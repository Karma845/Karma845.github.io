<h2>Chapter 6: Today’s Love Situation is Chaotic</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>The Sena Club members had assembled in the cafeteria. </p>



<p>Everyone looked overwhelmed by the dazzling aura emanating from Aria-san, who had arrived with me.</p>



<p>The entire cafeteria buzzed with anticipation, all eyes turning to our table. After grabbing two iced coffees, Aria-san and I joined the group.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you all. I’m Aria, Arisaka Yorka’s sister. Thanks for being so friendly to my little sister. Please continue to look out for her. Oh, if you’re thirsty, drinks are on me. Feel free to order as many refills as you like.”</p>



<p>With a smile, Aria-san greeted everyone warmly and took her seat. The Sena Club members were familiar with Yorka, but Aria-san’s approachable demeanor and familiar face left them taken aback. However, no one dared to ask for refills.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, I, feeling somewhat out of place in the cafeteria, quietly sipped my cold iced coffee and felt it soothe my parched throat.</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, can you drink your coffee black?” </p>



<p>“No problem.”</p>



<p>“Then, I’ll take some syrup. I prefer mine sweet,” she said before pouring syrup into her cup.</p>



<p>When I silently observed everyone, Sayu seemed guarded, Asaki-san maintained her smile while assessing the situation, and Miyachi sat beside Yorka with concern.</p>



<p>“I didn’t expect you to show up, Onee-chan.” Yorka looked surprised as she glanced at her sister.</p>



<p>“I felt nostalgic and wanted to take a break in the cafeteria.”</p>



<p>“You’re always so busy, I thought you would go back immediately after finishing your business here.”</p>



<p>“How can I refuse when my adorable Sumi-kun asked for help?”</p>



<p>“I did ask, but please don’t phrase it in a way that could be misunderstood.” </p>



<p>The meaning might be the same, but the impression it left could differ. You could see it in the stern looks from the girls.</p>



<p>“Hey, it’s no fun having tea alone, you know? I wanted to meet the friends Yor-chan’s been relying on. But why are all these cute girls gathered here? Sumi-kun, you got yourself a harem or what?”</p>



<p>“As if.”</p>



<p>“They say once you get a girlfriend, suddenly you start becoming popular. Who would’ve thought it’d apply to you too?”</p>



<p>“I can’t believe you’re joking like that in front of your sister.”</p>



<p>“Well, Yor-chan talks about her massive crush on you all the time at home.”</p>



<p>“Is that true, Yorka?” I couldn’t help but ask, feeling a surge of happiness.</p>



<p>“That’s because onee-chan keeps prying!”</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s not like that. Yor-chan looks so happy whenever she talks about you.”</p>



<p>“No, that’s not it! That’s not true at all!”</p>



<p>Yorka’s private life was now laid bare by her family’s testimonies, leaving us all to regard her with sympathetic gazes.</p>



<p>“Please, don’t reveal my affairs without permission. And Kisumi, don’t team up with my sister!”</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, if you want to know more, let’s talk privately later, okay?” My girlfriend’s sister winked at me slyly.</p>



<p>I was dying to know, but the gazes of the other girls, aside from Yorka, were starting to feel uncomfortable.</p>



<p>“Hey, it seems like you and Ki-senpai are pretty close.”</p>



<p>“Looks like Kisumi-kun is okay with dating someone older. Oh, is that why you’re so close with Kanzaki-sensei?”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, even if she’s your type, she’s still your girlfriend’s sister.”</p>



<p>Sayu and Asaki-san looked at me with suspicion, while Miyachi looked worried.</p>



<p>“Aria-san was my cram school tutor back in middle school! Nothing more, nothing less.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, back then, Sumi-kun was just a cheeky kid, so it was a bit hard to see him as a love interest,” Aria-san added, dismissing any unfounded suspicions with laughter.</p>



<p>If you only focused on the current beauty mode of Arisaka Aria, I could understand why they’d jump to that conclusion. But back when I was her student, she didn’t look like this, and I didn’t have the time or leisure to fall for a spartan teacher.</p>



<p>“What about now?” </p>



<p>“Aria-san is Yorka’s sister. She’s always been, and always will be, Asaki-san.”</p>



<p>She kept persisting with her off-topic questions. Why was she so insistent today?</p>



<p>“If she wasn’t Arisaka-san’s sister?” </p>



<p>“Such hypotheticals are pointless and irrelevant. You’re acting strange today,” I remarked, starting to get annoyed.</p>



<p>“Um, I can vouch for Ki-senpai’s lack of leisure during exam season. There wasn’t a hint of excitement back then. If he had feelings for someone, I would’ve noticed, whether he liked it or not.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san’s atypical stance was quickly followed by a reassuring comment from Sayu. As my junior in middle school who had seen me back then, her words carried weight.</p>



<p>“Yukinami-chan is so kind. You don’t need to make such self-deprecating comments.”</p>



<p>Nanamura, who usually struck up a conversation with any pretty girl, was unusually quiet today.</p>



<p>“Nanamura, you’re unusually quiet. Are you studying for a test or feeling unwell?” </p>



<p>“Idiot. I choose my battles wisely. That’s the secret to improving your success rate. I’m not foolish enough to aim for a target as high as you. Plus, I don’t want to get involved in your mess.”</p>



<p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p>



<p>As Nanamura and I whispered to each other, Aria-san nudged us gently.</p>



<p>“Hey, boys, what’s with the secretive talk?” </p>



<p>“Sorry, onee-san. Sena here just likes me too much,” Nanamura joked, trying to lighten the mood.</p>



<p>“Well, can’t argue with that. With your height and sporty charm, you must be quite the catch.”</p>



<p>“Nee-san, how about a date, just the two of us?” Nanamura swiftly changed tactics. Hey, where did that cautious approach from earlier disappear to?</p>



<p>“I appreciate the invitation, but I’m busy right now. Maybe in ten years, you can ask me again.”</p>



<p>“You’re not into younger guys, huh?” </p>



<p>Nanamura persisted even after being turned down. His relentless positivity and conversational skills were commendable. The others, too, seemed intrigued by Aria-san’s love stories.</p>



<p>“Age doesn’t matter if you feel the connection,” Aria-san smiled, offering hope.</p>



<p>“Onee-chan has always been too carefree,” Yorka muttered under her breath.</p>



<p>“Yorka, are you still upset?” </p>



<p>“Not really.”</p>



<p>“That’s the answer of someone who’s upset.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s expression was slightly sour, but she didn’t offer any further response.</p>



<p>“Hey, Sumisumi, can we talk about Kanzaki-sensei’s arranged marriage proposal soon?” Miyachi, who had been waiting for the right moment, broached the topic casually.</p>



<p>I glanced at Aria-san for confirmation.</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, you should probably drop it.”</p>



<p>“Hey! Aren’t you supposed to help me here?” </p>



<p>“I changed my mind.” </p>



<p>“You’re too fickle!”</p>



<p>Aria-san suddenly acted oblivious and took a sip of her iced coffee. With no other choice, I decided to tell them myself.</p>



<p>The plan was to pose as Kanzaki-sensei’s boyfriend, meet her parents, and then politely decline the arranged marriage proposal. </p>



<p>When I finished explaining, Nanamura burst into uncontrollable laughter, his abs on the verge of collapse.</p>



<p>“This is beyond absurd!” Yorka fumed in anger.</p>



<p>“Isn’t that plan going to fall apart?” Asaki-san sneered.</p>



<p>“That’s too much, even for Yoryor’s sister,” Miyachi recoiled in disbelief.</p>



<p>“Why do you think Ki-senpai can pull it off?” Sayu asked, clearly puzzled.</p>



<p>The girls collectively voiced their vehement opposition to Aria-san’s plan.</p>



<p>“I’ve met Shizuru-chan’s parents before, and I know Sumi-kun well too. It’s not a reckless gamble. You don’t need to worry,” Aria-san said, her expression unwavering.</p>



<p>Her confident demeanor alone carried enough persuasive power to make anyone feel reassured.</p>



<p>“All I can see is a future full of failures. Kanzaki-sensei quitting her job and Kisumi-kun and Arisaka-san will break up as a result.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san’s blunt opinion left me unable to muster even a bitter smile.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t talk about breaking up without permission!” Yorka quickly retorted to Asaki-san.</p>



<p>“If you have a complaint, take it up with your sister, not me.”</p>



<p>“I agree with Asaki-chan. Yoryor, don’t you think it’s strange too?” Miyachi chimed in, siding with Asaki-san.</p>



<p>“Well, yeah, but it’s my sister’s call…” </p>



<p>“Why do you act submissive at times like this? Now’s the time to speak up,”</p>



<p>Yorka’s indecisive attitude seemed to frustrate Asaki-san. </p>



<p>“Alright, alright, save the kids’ quarrels for after onee-san leaves,” Aria-san interjected in a deflated tone, cutting off Asaki-san’s words, “This time, it’s about Shizuru-chan’s life. Nobody wants to be forced into marriage. And I’m sure nobody wants to have their fulfilling job taken away because of it, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s a cowardly way to put it. Kanzaki-sensei’s situation and Kisumi-kun’s involvement are separate issues!” </p>



<p>“Now, now, don’t throw a tantrum,” Aria-san dismissed Asaki-san with the ease of comforting a child, “…It seems like there’s a misunderstanding, so let me clarify. I asked for Sumi-kun’s cooperation, not anyone else.”</p>



<p>Aria-san maintained her gentle expression but drew a clear line.</p>



<p>“Nevertheless, I believe there must be a better way.”</p>



<p>“Then, tell this onee-san what’s the incredible solution that will make everyone happy. Pretty please?”</p>



<p>Naturally, Asaki-san couldn’t come up with an immediate response.</p>



<p>“I deemed Sena Kisumi as the most suitable candidate, and he accepted of his own volition,” Aria-san spoke slowly, her tone suggesting she wasn’t open to input from outsiders.</p>



<p>“That’s exactly why accepting it is strange! Kisumi-kun is definitely being taken advantage of!” Asaki-san’s voice grew louder as she became more agitated.</p>



<p>“Hey, why are you getting so worked up?”</p>



<p>“I respect Kanzaki-sensei. And just like Kisumi-kun, I also share the same desire for her to continue teaching, especially since we’re both class reps.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I respect Shizuru-chan too. We have that in common.”</p>



<p>“The issue is him meddling in the teacher’s private life when he’s just a student!” </p>



<p>“…That seems more like your evaluation of him. Mine’s different.”</p>



<p>“It’s just a matter of common sense!”</p>



<p>“But wouldn’t it be more convenient for you if he failed?” Aria-san’s lips curled into a suggestive smile.</p>



<p>“What are you implying?”</p>



<p>“I wonder if it’s okay to say this with everyone here?” </p>



<p>Aria-san seemed to see through something once again, testing Asaki-san’s reaction with a mature nonchalance.</p>



<p>“Asa-senpai! That’s enough! Stop it!” Sayu raised her voice as she leaned forward from the table to intervene.</p>



<p>“Feel free to do so!”</p>



<p>However, Sayu’s attempt to halt her was futile. Asaki-san eagerly took the bait and was ready to engage in the verbal sparring match presented to her.</p>



<p>“Don’t you also like Sumi-kun?”</p>



<p>“────!” Asaki-san blushed, caught off guard, and so were we.</p>



<p>“Perhaps I’m on your side, aren’t I? If this plan fails and there’s an opportunity, you might get your chance too.”</p>



<p>Aria-san displayed her knack for uncovering others’ hidden feelings with terrifying finesse. Having faced a similar situation unexpectedly, Sayu seemed to have anticipated this turn of events.</p>



<p>This was Aria-san’s second unrelenting move today. How merciless.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I still like him! Is that a problem?” Asaki-san unabashedly proclaimed in front of Yorka.</p>



<p>Yorka and I froze at the unexpected turn of events, while Miyachi and Sayu looked unsurprised, as if they had expected this all along. Nanamura struggled to contain his laughter.</p>



<p>I remained speechless as I stared at Asaki-san.</p>



<p>“Don’t look at me!” </p>



<p>“S-Sorry!” I immediately averted my gaze—only to find myself facing Yorka.</p>



<p>“So you still have feelings for Kisumi! Give it up already!”</p>



<p>“I-It’s not like it concerns you, Arisaka-san.”</p>



<p>“It absolutely does! Stop trying to confess to my boyfriend every chance you get under the guise of something else!”</p>



<p>“It’s not a confession. My feelings were just inadvertently revealed.”</p>



<p>“It’s practically the same thing!”</p>



<p>“Then take your complaints to your sister!” </p>



<p>Even Asaki-san who usually composed couldn’t maintain her calm demeanor, she was pointing accusingly at Aria-san in a fit of frustration.</p>



<p>“Both of you, keep it down. We’re in the cafeteria, remember?” I tried to calm down the heated argument between them.</p>



<p>“”Shut up!””</p>



<p>Yorka and Asaki-san snapped simultaneously.</p>



<p>Miyachi, Sayu, and Nanamura stood up to mediate the quarrel between the two.</p>



<p>Aria-san elegantly took one last sip of her iced coffee, then said, “Well, I’m off,” before standing up. I hurriedly followed suit.</p>



<p>I walked alongside Aria-san in the corridor.</p>



<p>“Are you seeing me off? You’re such a gentleman, Sumi-kun. That’s extra points for you.”</p>



<p>“I just came to complain. Weren’t you supposed to help me?” </p>



<p>How could she remain so composed after everything that had happened?</p>



<p>“I did help you, didn’t I?” </p>



<p>“After causing all that chaos?” </p>



<p>“The spark was already there. It’s impressive that you can form a group with the girls who like you.”</p>



<p>“Thanks for the objective opinion.”</p>



<p>“Oh, don’t mention it.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t mean it as a compliment.”</p>



<p>Once again, I was reminded of Aria-san’s unpredictability.</p>



<p>Even Yorka, who was usually quiet and passive, had a significant impact on those around her. I thought I understood this well enough from observing her in class.</p>



<p>But the older sister was deliberate and proactive. Her every move and word had the power to influence others, for better or for worse. They created a ripple effect that could not be ignored.</p>



<p>“A single well-placed comment can shake people’s emotions.”</p>



<p>It sounded simple coming from her, but it wasn’t.</p>



<p>Like a chain reaction from tipping over dominoes, revealing one person’s hidden feelings could trigger a series of reactions from those around them. And inevitably, altering the situation.</p>



<p>“Is that how you became the student council president in your first year?”</p>



<p>“I’m just good at speeches, that’s all. Plus, I make a killer first impression.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine to know your strengths, but try not to exploit them too much.”</p>



<p>“I won’t.”</p>



<p>“But you’re stirring up your sister’s emotions and causing chaos among Sena Club members.”</p>



<p>“Friendships from school rarely last beyond graduation unless they’re genuine anyway.”</p>



<p>“Don’t say such bitter things. It’s heartbreaking.”</p>



<p>“That’s why real and long-lasting connections are precious, whether in love or friendship.”</p>



<p>“But the bond that could last a lifetime is on the verge of being destroyed by you.”</p>



<p>“It’s not a big deal. If anything, I’m impressed.”</p>



<p>“Impressed by what?”</p>



<p>“How Yor-chan can assert herself now, unlike before. She used to struggle with being honest about her feelings.”</p>



<p>“Yorka has indeed changed a lot since last year.”</p>



<p>“Even that smart-looking girl is quite something. Being able to voice her opinions confidently to me and Yor-chan is impressive. Not everyone can do that.”</p>



<p>Indeed, Asaki-san was remarkable. She could engage in conversation with the Arisaka sisters without feeling intimidated. Most people would be overwhelmed by their beauty and struggle to communicate effectively.</p>



<p>“But why provoke us if you’re impressed?”</p>



<p>“I don’t like it when people complain about Shizuru-chan or Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“I don’t understand you, Aria-san.”</p>



<p>“Older women are supposed to be mysterious.”</p>



<p>“You’re on a whole different level.”</p>



<p>“I like being treated differently.”</p>



<p>It seemed like she was just amusing herself.</p>



<p>“You can say goodbye here. I’ll contact you once the details are sorted out. See you.”</p>



<p>I <em>really</em> couldn’t compete with her.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>The tense atmosphere between Yorka and Asaki-san showed no signs of easing, so today’s Sena Club gathering was adjourned. </p>



<p>With Miyachi accompanying Yorka and Sayu sticking with Asaki-san, only Nanamura and I were left behind.</p>



<p>“What should we do? Are we heading home?”</p>



<p>“Since there are only boys left, why don’t we grab some ramen for a change? I’m hungry.” At Nanamura’s suggestion, we made our way to the ramen shop near the station.</p>



<p>“Man, I gotta say, Hasekura-chan really caught me off guard,” Nanamura mused between slurps of rich, porky ramen while recalling the scene at the school cafeteria.</p>



<p>“Bringing Aria-san along totally backfired.” I had hoped she’d smooth over the whole stand-in boyfriend situation, but it turned out quite the opposite.</p>



<p>“Sena, if you think that was intense, you ain’t seen nothing yet.”</p>



<p>“I’d rather not experience that kind of intensity, thanks.”</p>



<p>“To be honest, you were saved by Arisaka-chan’s onee-san this time.”</p>



<p>Nanamura echoed sentiments similar to Aria-san’s.</p>



<p>“How so?”</p>



<p>“You really have no clue, huh?”</p>



<p>“Hmm.”</p>



<p>“The fee will be a slice of your pork.”</p>



<p>“That’s expensive.” I transferred a piece of my pork into Nanamura’s bowl.</p>



<p>“Let’s face it, trying to pull off a stand-in boyfriend stunt was bound to cause chaos. Expecting everyone to just accept it calmly was wishful thinking.”</p>



<p>“I know that, but still…”</p>



<p>“Sena, you’re dependable and a good guy. You can’t just ignore someone in trouble. I get why you showed some manly spirit for Arisaka-chan’s sister, who helped you out before, and for Kanzaki-sensei, who’s currently looking after you. If I’m stuck with a homeroom teacher every day, it might as well be with someone as beautiful as Kanzaki-sensei, right?”</p>



<p>“You haven’t changed a bit in that regard.”</p>



<p>“It’s the truth. Everyone can be replaced. If a sportsman gets injured, another player takes their place in the game. Friendships change as we move up in grades. Homeroom teachers are the same. And after graduation? You’ll only keep in touch with a few. Romantic relationships are even more brutal. Even if you’ve had sex, breaking up can be swift and easy. Finding someone truly irreplaceable is rare.”</p>



<p>I wanted to argue with Nanamura’s assertion, but I knew deep down that it was the reality.</p>



<p>“As for Arisaka-chan’s sister, she redirected Arisaka-chan’s wrath away from you. The whole stand-in boyfriend debacle could’ve turned into a big fight. Poor Hasekura-chan got caught in the crossfire.”</p>



<p>“But that didn’t solve anything, did it? And Asaki-san’s feelings…”</p>



<p>“Sena, choosing someone means not choosing someone else.” Nanamura looked me in the eye as he spoke. “Who’s the most important to you? Don’t get that wrong. Dwelling on someone you’ve rejected isn’t kindness; it’s just a personal sentiment. You can’t do anything more about it. If your priorities keep changing, you’ll end up losing the person who matters most.”</p>



<p>“I know. Yorka is my priority. That will never change.”</p>



<p>Nanamura seemed satisfied with my answer. He flashed a big grin and devoured my slice of pork in one bite. “I have no doubt about your sincerity towards Arisaka-chan. If anything, it’s your awareness of it and your concern for others that make you a pain in the ass.”</p>



<p>“Sorry for being too nice.”</p>



<p>“Sena, for a regular guy, you have high ideals. That’s why you end up with unnecessary trouble.”</p>



<p>“I know, but…”</p>



<p>“I say this as someone who was helped by you last year, don’t get crushed between two forces. Arisaka-chan will cry.”</p>



<p>“It’s not like that. Yorka is the one caught in the middle. If Aria-san gets involved, things won’t go as smoothly. There are various complex feelings at play here.”</p>



<p>As an outsider, if the relationship fell apart, I had no choice but to distance myself. No, I could leave.</p>



<p>But this time, Yorka was different.</p>



<p>In the worst-case scenario, even if she harbored discord or dissatisfaction, she must continue to remain close with Aria-san.</p>



<p>“You’re aware of all that, and yet, you’re still…”</p>



<p>“I’m seriously worried that Yorka might give up on me.”</p>



<p>“…Are you still half asleep or something?”  Nanamura gave me a disbelieving look. “Well, I guess I’ve teased you enough. My bad. Honestly, it’s not like anyone in class still sees you two as some kind of mismatched couple. Everyone can tell from the way Arisaka-chan acts in class that she’s serious. You aren’t some accessory to Arisaka-chan—She is your girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“You’re a good guy, Nanamura.”</p>



<p>“I’m always the most reliable guy around, aren’t I?” His reassuring words swept away my uncertainty. “Here’s a little extra. I’ll tell you Sena, your ultimate weapon. Your ace in the hole, so to speak.”</p>



<p>“I have one of those?”</p>



<p>“You do.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Only you can bring out Arisaka-chan’s true feelings.”</p>



<p>I felt a rush of gratitude for my friend’s support.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>As I was returning home after grabbing ramen with Nanamura, I was greeted by my sister’s innocent enthusiasm.</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Kisumi-kun!”</p>



<p>“I’m home.”</p>



<p>“You came back late before the exams. Were you on a date with Yorka-chan?”</p>



<p>“…Since when did you start keeping tabs on me like that?”</p>



<p>“Mom told me to make sure you’re not slacking off.”</p>



<p>Mom’s behind this? It seemed like I had no credibility. Considering I improved my ranking in the midterms, she could cut me some slack.</p>



<p>“Ei, make sure to report to Mom that I’m studying properly.”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>Despite being in the fourth grade, she looked mature for her age, but inside, she was still just a kid. She was easy to handle.</p>



<p>Instead of heading straight to my room, I flopped down on the sofa in the living room.</p>



<p>Honestly, I was drained from dealing with the stand-in boyfriend situation and the cafeteria incident. Plus, since I was stuffed from the ramen, I didn’t have the energy to crack open a textbook.</p>



<p>While I was lounging on the sofa, Ei was busily tapping away on her phone.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you supposed to be studying, Kisumi-kun?”</p>



<p>“Call me onii-chan. And no, I’m taking a break. What about you?”</p>



<p>“I’m chatting with a friend on LINE.”</p>



<p>“Oh, really?”</p>



<p>Glancing sideways, I noticed Ei’s fingers moving at lightning speed, it was much faster than mine. Her friend seemed to be typing just as fast, as notification sounds kept chiming incessantly. Kids these days were something else.</p>



<p>But man, those notification sounds were getting on my nerves.</p>



<p>“Ei, could you at least put it on silent mode? It’s too noisy.”</p>



<p>“Just go to your room then.”</p>



<p>“I’m feeling more like chilling on the sofa than going to bed right now.”</p>



<p>“And I feel like watching TV.”</p>



<p>Even as we talked, the notification sounds kept ringing.</p>



<p>With a resigned sigh, I sat up and started to head to my room.</p>



<p>“Oh, wait. Kisumi-kun!”</p>



<p>“Hm? I’m moving.”</p>



<p>“Did something happen between you and Yorka-chan?”</p>



<p>I was startled and immediately turned to face Ei.</p>



<p>What’s up with her? She was unusually sharp today. Did she awaken as a new type or something?</p>



<p>“Why the sudden interest?”</p>



<p>“Just tell me!”</p>



<p>“It’s not like we’re fighting, but there’s a bit of a problem and things become complicated.”</p>



<p>Even though I knew consulting with a grade-schooler wouldn’t solve anything, I told her anyway.</p>



<p>“That’s no good. You two need to make up quickly. I don’t want it to be like during spring break again.”</p>



<p>“Was I really that bad back then?”</p>



<p>“You were like super, duper, incredibly weird.”</p>



<p>She emphasized it three times.</p>



<p>If Ei was saying this, then I must have been really messed up during spring break.</p>



<p>“I’ll do my best to avoid that.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, good luck!”</p>



<p>I patted Ei’s head reassuringly.</p>



<p>“By the way, why did you think something happened between me and Yorka?”</p>



<p>“Um, just a hunch!”</p>



<p>Another notification chimed from Ei’s phone.</p>
