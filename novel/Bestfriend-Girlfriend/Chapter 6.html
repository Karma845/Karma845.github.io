<h2>Chapter 6: A Treasure Lies In The Place Where the Princess and I Are Meant to Go</h2>

<p class="calibre5">Several days have passed since Natsumi-san passed away.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since then, I’ve been living my life as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Kanako and Takakyun are also lovey-dovey as always.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My father and mother are carrying out their duties just like any other day.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Yes, they are trying to return to their normal routine.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s what she would have wanted.</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had been invited to Himegi-san’s mansion because she said she had something important to discuss with me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why right now, I was quietly sitting on the large covered bench in the garden, waiting for her to appear.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A gentle breeze blew, making me feel comfortable.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I even felt like humming a tune… Just then, an uninvited man suddenly appeared before me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah! It’s the old man.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I made eye contact with the master of the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre5">We were a bit far apart, but there was no mistake, our eyes met.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, Himegi’s father looked at me and gave me a broad smile&mdash;raising his middle finger as a form of greeting.</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I see, apparently raising the middle finger is a sign of friendship in the Himegi household.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Following this custom, I also smiled warmly and gave Himegi’s father the middle finger in return.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Of course, Himegi’s father stomped his feet right there, visibly outraged.</p>
<p class="calibre5">His face turned bright red as he approached me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Oh? He wants to fight me? Is he picking a fight with a magician?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Fine, I’ll take that challenge!</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just as I was about to get into a combat stance, at that moment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">A black cat appeared in front of Himegi’s father and stood in his way.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And then, I witnessed something unbelievable.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi’s father suddenly dropped to his knees and began bowing deeply to the black cat.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wha? Eh? Huh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Wh-why did the old man suddenly start worshiping the black cat?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why is he scared of a cat?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is it that, in the Himegi household, cats are the most important?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Are cats on the same level as gods in their home?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or is this some kind of joke to make me laugh?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Regardless, what an absurd sight this is. A middle-aged man is seriously bowing to a cat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Well, at least it looks like I can get a funny video out of it, so I’ll record it with my smartphone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just as I was about to take out my smartphone from my pocket, at that moment&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;Huh? It’s coming this way…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The black cat completely ignores Himegi’s father and slowly approaches me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wait? Um, this is kind of scary…</p>
<p class="calibre5">By the way, seizing this opportunity, Himegi’s father dashes away as fast as he can.</p>
<p class="calibre5">What the heck? Wait, isn’t this the same cat I saw at the funeral?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“These distinctive round eyes… Yup, it’s the same black cat from that time.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And then, the black cat hops onto my lap. It seems this cat has taken a liking to sitting on my lap.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Are you the household pet here? Or, since you don’t have a collar, are you a stray cat?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Either way, it’s a pretty friendly cat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I gently stroke the cat’s back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Its fur feels really well taken care of; it’s very soft to the touch.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Good, good… What’s your favorite food? Cheese, fish, or perhaps chicken? Tell Onii-san what you like…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“….Scallop-flavored Churu….”</p>

<p class="calibre5">…Huh? Huh???</p>
<p class="calibre5">Did I… just hear a voice? I look around cautiously.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The only person-like figure I can see is Himegi-san waving at me from a distance.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems that it wasn’t an auditory hallucination; it was Himegi-san’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wave back at her, and she smiles warmly at me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems we’ve both come to terms with some things.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“As always, Himegi-san is so cute&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…My grandchildren were taken care of. Thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">” …. “</p>

<p class="calibre5">…I feel like the cat just spoke, but it must be my imagination, right??</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Maybe I’m just so tired?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I kept you waiting.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I haven’t been waiting long. More importantly, this cat doesn’t have a collar, so is it a Himegi family cat?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? Cat???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Look at this guy…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pick up the black cat and bring it close to Himegi-san’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san freezes, visibly stiffening as she looks at the black cat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wait, could it be that Himegi-san… hates cats???</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Uh, Himegi-san???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, Himegi-san stares intently at the black cat…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hissssssssss!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Unbelievably, Himegi-san makes a terrifying face and fiercely hisses at the black cat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Naturally, the startled cat runs off somewhere.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“? W-what? What’s going on? What just happened???”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even I am shaken.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Why is she suddenly treating the cat like an enemy???</p>

<p class="calibre5">What the heck?</p>
<p class="calibre5">What’s going on with the people in the Himegi family???</p>
<p class="calibre5">The father is suddenly bowing his head to the cat, and the daughter is hissing at it; what’s really going on???</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s such a thing as being emotionally unstable, but this is ridiculous…</p>

<p class="calibre5">Can I really handle the aftercare for these people?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-san, I’m sorry. I’m feeling a bit disheartened.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Scaring a cat like that is something I dislike…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“It’s because cats are cats. Really, that wretched stray cat is no good…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">While staring in the direction the cat fled, Himegi-san mutters curses.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Apparently, she really dislikes cats.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Even after that, Himegi-san continued to grumble things like, ‘I wish it would go back to its other world already,’ and ‘What do you even mean, saving the world?’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Another world? Saving the world?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Is she talking about some web novel???</p>
<p class="calibre5">She then looked somewhat anxious and asked,</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey, Ouji-kun, if I told you my grandmother was a witch, would you laugh?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">She posed such a question. Of course, I told her my honest feelings.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I wouldn’t be surprised, nor would I laugh.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">After all, Touka-san had already told me about it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Really? Because it’s a witch, you know? A witch! Normally, you’d laugh because you think I’m joking, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I want you to know that I believe you. If you say it, I will definitely believe you.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…Thank you. Someday, I want you to listen to me talk about my grandmother.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’d like that. I’d like to meet your grandmother someday, Himegi-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Since they’re a family of good looks, I bet her grandmother must be quite beautiful too.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Does she wear a pointy hat since she’s a witch?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or is she like the witches I’d imagine from fairy tales?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or could she surprisingly be a ‘loli-baba’ type of witch?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Personally, I’d love it if she’s a bombshell witch like Himegi-san.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Ahh… I’d love to meet her someday. To meet her and properly greet her…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Before we get into that, there’s something I want to show you, Ouji-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san held a hardcover book in her hands.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“For me?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, this came from Natsumi-neesan’s room, but…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Saying so, she flips through the book and, as if to use it as a bookmark, shows me something resembling a photo stuck in the middle of the pages.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I take it from her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;It indeed was a photo. To me, it was just a normal photo.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But for the Himegi family, it’s like a magical photo.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I have understood the future Touka Himegi’s true plan.</p>

<p class="calibre5">『&mdash; This is in return for the sunflower you gave me yesterday!』</p>
<p class="calibre5">『&mdash;Ha-kun, while you’re at it, take a picture of this sunflower too.』</p>

<p class="calibre5">I had thought that flower was either imported or grown in a greenhouse, but I was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Probably, even the beef we ate at that time was from a year ago…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Is this photo some kind of trick, Ouji-kun? Or is it a composite photo???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…No, this isn’t a trick, nor is it a composite photo…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The photo shows a woman with white hair.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She looks beautiful with a smile that suits her well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Wearing a white dress and a straw hat, she seemed to be enjoying herself under the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">As her name suggests, she fits well with summer, surrounded by yellow flowers&mdash;smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre5">On her right chest was the number ‘1.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">In her left hand, she held a pocket watch I recognized.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That number is evidence that she time-traveled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I see… she had gone back to the past.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe…. hahaha… ahahaha!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I laughed. I laughed out loud.</p>
<p class="calibre5">How could I not? I had a big misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Touka-san had said that the watch couldn’t be reused until the number turned to “0,” but that only applies to the person who time-traveled.</p>
<p class="calibre5">There’s no issue if a different person uses the pocket watch.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Touka-san’s aim was to show Natsumi-san the sunflower field once again.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Was that her plan from the beginning?</p>
<p class="calibre5">Or perhaps she thought of it later, but either way, this was her ultimate goal.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“But last summer, she was in surgery and couldn’t leave the hospital, and in May, the sunflowers weren’t in bloom, you know?”</p>

<div class="chapter-warning"><img src="https://animestuff.me/TWEM/000004.png" alt="" class="calibre2" /></div><p class="calibre3"></p>

<p class="calibre5">“Even so, I can say with certainty that this is real. Absolutely real.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ah, I’m glad she made it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She passed through the horrible cave and found the dormant treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m really glad she did.</p>

<p class="calibre5">She saw the sunflower field in full bloom with her own eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She made her wish come true, and that made me incredibly happy.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ahahaha… hehehe… ah, aha, hehe… ughhh…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Tears spilled down my cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I wanted to tell Natsumi-san, “How dare you trick me!’, but she’s no longer in this world…</p>
<p class="calibre5">…That made me overwhelmingly lonely and sad.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Here.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Himegi-san offered me a handkerchief. I took it and wiped away my tears.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I don’t understand, but I’ll assume for now that Nee-san made it to this place.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll tell you someday, when you’ve come to really like me.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What? That day might never come.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’ll work hard to make sure it does.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Through my encounters with Touka-san and Natsumi-san, I’ve learned countless things.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m neither smart enough nor strong enough to make use of all of it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m sure I’ll face numerous difficulties ahead, and I’ll want to run away many times.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Even so, I want to keep moving forward.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Because at the end of that terrifying cave lies a treasure worth seeking… I’ve seen that ‘what if’ with my own eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;It was a happy story for both her and me.</p>
<p class="calibre5">That’s why…I hope we can continue that story, even if it takes a different form.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Your confidence… it’s kind of irritating.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I’m not confident at all, actually.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I don’t think I need to be responsible for falling in love.</p>
<p class="calibre5">But if I want what lies beyond that…if I choose to walk that path, then I do need to face responsibility.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This experience taught me that painfully well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’m still immature and powerless.</p>

<p class="calibre5">People might laugh if I say I’m taking on this responsibility so casually, but even so, I want to face Touka Himegi till the very end.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I looked at her with a serious gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Her face turned slightly red.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“W-What? Why are you staring at my face like that?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The wind blows.</p>
<p class="calibre5">A wind that can neither be called a spring wind nor a summer wind blew.</p>
<p class="calibre5">About two months have passed since that painful rejection.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Since then, I think I’ve been able to understand her a bit more.</p>
<p class="calibre5">She’s timid, surprisingly a crybaby, stubborn, selfish, and flawed in many ways… but even so, I really like her.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The one who must be by my side is Touka Himegi.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I can’t think of anyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So let’s move time forward. Let’s start a story they don’t know about from here.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Himegi-san, about our romantic relationship…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Ah! About that&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“&mdash;&mdash;Hey, Himegi-san, I want you to listen to a story about someone I like&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Let’s sow the seeds. Seeds that will make everyone smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And if permitted, let’s water those seeds, just the two of us.</p>


<p class="calibre5">It’s alright, because other seeds and mechanisms that will move forward in the future have been properly entrusted to her…</p>
