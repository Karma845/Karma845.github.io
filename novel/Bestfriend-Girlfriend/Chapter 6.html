<h1>Chapter 6: Gal and LINE</h1>


<p>…Perhaps I shouldn’t have exchanged LINE contacts with Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>That was my honest impression after about a week had passed since exchanging LINE with her.</p>

<p>Why did I come to think that? It’s actually a rather simple story—because the frequency of LINE messages I was receiving from Tsumakawa was just too high.</p>

<p>Seriously, is she really that idle?</p>
<p>Please stop sending messages like ‘What are you doing?’ at 2 in the morning. I’m sleeping at that time!</p>

<p>To be honest, I wondered if she had an extraordinary amount of free time.</p>
<p>The day after we exchanged LINE contacts, it seemed pretty normal.</p>
<p>We were just exchanging messages like we used to do on Twitter, and the frequency of our communication didn’t seem to change all that much from before.</p>
<p>However, the moment Tsumakawa realized I was responding normally… She gradually began to reveal her true self as a chat app-loving girl, showing hints of her character through LINE and Instagram messages—.</p>

<p>『Hey.』『Do you have someone you like, Yoda?』</p>
<p>『Someone I like? Of course, I do.』</p>
<p>『Hmm?』 『I see…』『Yaba…』『I mean, really?』</p>
<p>『Yeah, maybe it’s a little bit shocking…』『Right now, I really like ‘Yume Irido’ from Tsurekano.』</p>
<p>『It’s a two-dimensional character!』『Don’t give me an answer about a 2D girl!』『Putting that aside, I really love Yume-chan too!』『Anyway, you don’t have anyone you like in 3D world?』</p>
<p>『Right now, my lover is in the 2D world…』</p>
<p>『Don’t talk like your hobby is your lover!』</p>
<p>『Speaking of which, aren’t you getting a lot of attention from that super cute gal lately?』『You still haven’t fallen for her?』</p>
<p>『Why does it sound like you’re assuming I’ll eventually like her… Also, what’s with calling yourself a super cute gal?』</p>
<p>『I don’t want to become the kind of girl who knows she’s cute but says ‘I’m not cute at all’—』『That’s why I say I’m cute!』『Repeat after me?』</p>
<p>『 … 』</p>
<p>『Say it, wwWW.』『Don’t reply with ellipses. (Three dots)』『In fact, I’m cute, right?』</p>
<p>『 … 』</p>
<p>『Hey.』『In this situation, it’s about pride.』『Until Yoda says I’m cute, I’m going to keep asking you if you think I’m cute, okay?』『Hey, am I cute?』</p>
<p>『Your actions are kinda like the ‘Kuchisake Onna (Slit-Mouthed Woman)’…』</p>

<p>Nowadays, my interactions with Tsumakawa have turned into exchanges like this——happening every day for about two hours without fail.</p>
<p>Wait, two hours! With that much time, I could watch five late-night anime episodes!</p>

<p>By the way, when I thought like that and ignored her LINE messages for a while, there was a point where I had accumulated 109 messages from Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>—That’s right! 109 messages: Is she a fashion building in Shibuya or something?</p>
<p>At that moment, even I was taken aback…</p>

<p>However, the content of the messages wasn’t about being angry or not getting replies… It was just flat messages like</p>
<p>『Hey Yoda—』 being sent repeatedly, and that was kind of scary!</p>
<p>It’s not spam, so don’t keep sending messages to someone who’s not responding!</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>With all that being said, it’s currently a week after exchanging LINE messages with Tsumakawa, it was Monday morning after 8 o’clock.</p>
<p>I usually commute by bicycle, but today I took the train to school after getting off at Omiya Station for a transfer because it had been raining since this morning.</p>
<p>In the crowded train, I spotted a few students from my school—Private High School—heading to school.</p>
<p>So, while absentmindedly observing that, I spotted her in a slightly distant place.</p>

<p>“Yawn~…”</p>

<p>Without covering her mouth with her hand, Tsumakawa, on the train, let out a big yawn and sat quietly on the edge of a green seat, rubbing her eyes that looked visibly sleepy.</p>

<p>“I wish she’d end our LINE conversation earlier if she’s going to end up sleep-deprived…”</p>

<p>As I was saying that while squinting, an elderly woman entered the train car.</p>
<p>She looked around and, realizing there were no available seats, reluctantly stood near the door.</p>
<p>Seeing that, I couldn’t help but give a slight wry smile.</p>

<p>I briefly thought it was fortunate that I wasn’t sitting down right now.</p>
<p>Because if I were, I would have thought a lot about whether I should give my seat to the old lady or not.</p>
<p>Perhaps that lady is someone who doesn’t want a seat offered—someone who doesn’t want to be treated like an old person.</p>
<p>But if I didn’t offer the seat, a feeling of self-condemnation like ‘I didn’t give up my seat for the elderly lady’ would slowly, but surely, build up within me.</p>
<p>For me, ‘giving up a seat’ isn’t an act of kindness. It’s merely a hypocritical act meant to avoid the wrongdoing of ignoring a struggling elderly lady.</p>

<p>Maybe I might give up my seat to the elderly lady just because I don’t want to commit the ‘wrongdoing of not doing a good deed.’</p>
<p>But that feels like such a warped sense of kindness…</p>

<p>Thinking about things like that, I sometimes get downcast, unsure if I can be a good person. And I’ve pondered if I’m definitely not fundamentally a good person.</p>
<p>As a sudden sense of emptiness rise within me——</p>
<p>Suddenly, a flashy-looking gyaru got up from her seat and spoke to the elderly lady.</p>

<p>“Hey, Granny. Sit here.”</p>

<p>…It was an astonishingly natural gesture.</p>
<p>There was something about her goodwill that wasn’t imposing.</p>
<p>It wasn’t meant to show off to herself or anyone else, just a natural consideration.</p>

<p>There’s an urban legend that gals are kind to otakus, but maybe it’s not that—maybe gals are just kind to everyone around them, not just otakus.</p>
<p>While pondering such things, I was feeling a little warm… On the other hand, the elderly lady who was offered the seat, after directing a somewhat awkward expression at Tsumakawa, said the following.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Standing seems tough, so how about sitting?”</p>
<p>“No! I’m perfectly fine on my feet! I can manage without a seat being offered!”</p>
<p>“I see… But I’ll be getting off in two stops, so I don’t really need to sit much. I’ll just stand for now, and you can do as you please.”</p>

<p>With those words, Tsumakawa started walking and moved towards the closed door.</p>
<p>As she did so, an empty seat was left behind where she had been.</p>

<p>For a few minutes after that, no one sat in that seat, and suddenly—still wearing a somewhat awkward expression—the elderly lady plopped down on it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tsumakawa, who had offered her seat, didn’t seem to pay any attention to this and was smiling while playing with her phone.</p>


<p>Thus, after an announcement, the train started moving towards the nearest station to our school. It took less than eight minutes.</p>
<p>The train arrived at my High School’s nearest station, and students wearing the same uniform as me were ejected from the train car.</p>
<p>Exiting through the ticket gate, I stopped where the roof ended. There, under my navy umbrella, I started walking again.</p>
<p>A little ahead, I spotted Tsumakawa’s figure.</p>
<p>I naturally quickened my pace to catch up with her and spoke to her in a casual tone.</p>

<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Well, well, it’s Yoda! It’s rare for you to greet me!”</p>
<p>“Yeah… There’s just something I wanted to talk to you about, Tsumakawa-san…”</p>
<p>“Huh, something to talk about? What?”</p>

<p>As Tsumakawa-san asked me that, a flashback of the scene from earlier where she gave up her seat to the elderly lady flashed in my mind.</p>
<p>However, for some reason, the words I wanted to say didn’t come out smoothly.</p>
<p>I ended up talking about something completely different from what I really wanted to say.</p>

<p>“Um, can you maybe lower the frequency of our LINE messages? Please?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Don’t say it with such a serious face. It’s like you’re finding our Line conversations tiring.”</p>
<p>“Yes, they’re tiring.”</p>
<p>“You’re being honest, huh? You should’ve sugar-coated it so it doesn’t hurt my feelings!”</p>

<p>Saying this, Tsumakawa exaggeratedly puffed out her cheeks… But that’s just how Tsumakawa-san is.</p>
<p>She simply won’t hold back unless I speak to her firmly!</p>
<p>While I was making this commotion in my mind, she continued talking with a cheerful smile as we walked side by side.</p>

<p>“Seriously, aren’t LINE messages so much fun!? We used to exchange messages a lot on Twitter through Nezumayo and Minacho, and I thought it wouldn’t be much different… But maybe I was being a bit fake back when I was Minacho. Talking to Yoda as Miona is seriously enjoyable!”</p>
<p>“I-I see…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, Yoda is pretty much Nezumayo too! And sometimes Yoda goes deeper than Nezumayo when talking, and I’m like, ‘Yoda, you’re doing great!’ Yoda is unexpectedly more Nezumayo than Nezumayo, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Um, could you please stop making brain-melting statements?”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa treated me and Nezumayo as two different personalities, which made the conversation very complicated.</p>
<p>What’s with the mysterious term ‘Nezumayo’?</p>
<p>While I was struggling with this concept of ‘myself-ness’, she continued merrily.</p>

<p>“Because of that, let’s exchange lots of LINE messages from now on too! Hamtaro!”</p>
<p>“Who’s Hamtaro?—I did ask you to lower the frequency of Line messages, so how did we end up with this conclusion?! Also, don’t message me at 2 in the morning!”</p>
<p>“Is it really not okay to send messages to Yoda around midnight or around 5 AM?”</p>
<p>“5 in the morning is practically dawn… and for people with normal sensibilities, sending messages at 5 in the morning is annoying, okay? I mean, think about it, can you understand what I mean, Miss Gal?”</p>
<p>“Well, of course I understand that, and I wouldn’t bother my ordinary friends with that… but for Yoda, isn’t it fine for me to message you at any time, no matter when?”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>

<p>I, born and raised in Saitama, let out a heartfelt ‘Why is that?’ from me, a person born and raised in Saitama.</p>
<p>I was genuinely surprised!</p>

<p>Since I was born, I’ve never lived in a prefecture other than Saitama, and yet you’re making me say ‘Why is that?’ – that’s really something!</p>
<p>(TN: なんでやねん. ‘Why is that?’ He’s using a Kansai dialect.)</p>

<p>Ignoring my surprise, Tsumakawa, who seemed to be in high spirits, continued talking while twirling a gaudy umbrella with shades of pink.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s common sense that you shouldn’t inconvenience your friends. However, when it comes to close friends or family… I believe it’s okay to lean on them. After all, they’re like your own kin. With family, you don’t really need to maintain the same considerations as with friends, right? So, in other words, since Yoda is practically family to me, isn’t it alright to message you anytime?”</p>
<p>“W-Well… Um, Tsumakawa-san? For now, I still consider myself not yet a friend with Tsumakawa-san…”</p>
<p>“Sure, sure. You’re still putting up a front, huh? Geez.”</p>
<p>“I feel like I’m being treated really casually here!”</p>
<p>“Haha… Well, I guess I may be going overboard with saying that Yoda is family, but to me, Yoda is someone I can lean on. You’ve probably noticed that, right? I mean, seriously, would anyone send these kinds of messages to just any guy?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“So, you get it? From now on, I can message you as much as I want, right?”</p>

<p>Saying this, Tsumakawa-san looked at me with a teasing smile.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, she grasped my hand from the side that held the umbrella and squeezed it tightly.</p>

<p>The sweet scent of citrus tickled my nose.</p>
<p>Her hand was really warm, and I could feel my cold hand warming up against hers.</p>
<p>This softness, this warmth—my heart was pounding so much that it made me dizzy. And while a captivating gal held my hand, I responded.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to. Please lower the frequency of Line messages.”</p>
<p>“This otaku is more cheeky than I thought…”</p>
<p>“Ah, you finally spoke your mind! You’re finally showing your wicked nature, you gal!”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, I say things like this all the time… But really, the normal thing to do now would be to accept my suggestion, okay? How much are you resisting the real world? Aren’t you taking being an otaku too far?”</p>
<p>“Ehehe…”</p>
<p>“That’s not a compliment, so don’t get all embarrassed…”</p>
<p>“By the way, the character that influenced me is ‘Hachiman Hikigaya’ from ‘My Youth Romantic Comedy Is Wrong, As I Expected!’ I’m going to be like the main character of a novel!!”</p>
<p>“Sure, sure, got it… So, I’ll start calling you ‘Zaimokuza’ from now on.”</p>
<p>“Huh!? Zaimokuza? I can’t be the main character of a novel then.”</p>

<p>As I was desperately trying to respond, Tsumakawa let go of the hand she was holding, chuckling softly.</p>
<p>That was close. Good job, my self-control! That’s the way of the twisted otaku!</p>

<p>She was exceptionally good at getting what she wanted while holding my hands at the same time. This girl is a temptress…</p>
<p>As I wiped my forehead while thinking that, she suddenly told me.</p>

<p>“Hey, instead of just standing around forever, let’s go to school already.”</p>

<p>I completely agreed with her on this, so Tsumakawa and I, holding our umbrellas, started walking on the rain-drenched sidewalk together.</p>


<p>Tsumakawa and I, holding our umbrellas, started walking on the rain-drenched sidewalk together.</p>
<p>And she, who was walking beside me, suddenly let out a deliberately exaggerated voice.</p>

<p>“You know, I really like messaging Yoda… But I guess I need to tone it down a bit… Ah, well, I really hate it, though… But, I guess I shouldn’t tell Yoda that I don’t want to… I’m an adult, after all…”</p>
<p>“Uh, ‘adult’? Tsumakawa-san? Your real thoughts that you were supposed to stop saying are slipping out quite a bit.”</p>
<p>“Even about LINE replies, honestly, if he doesn’t reply within a minute, I get a bit annoyed, but I won’t say that because I’d be seen as a clingy girl!”</p>
<p>“You’ve pretty much already said everything…”</p>

<p>To my exasperated remark, Tsumakawa responded with a slightly delighted expression.</p>
<p>It seemed like my request to lower the frequency of Line messages had been heard somehow.</p>

<p>I was relieved that this issue was resolved before the stress made me bald… While I was thinking about this, our school came into view.</p>
<p>Upon entering the school, Tsumakawa would be with her own group, so finding opportunities to talk one-on-one like this would be difficult, I thought.</p>
<p>Unable to resist my curiosity since earlier, I unintentionally voiced my thoughts.</p>

<p>“Speaking of which… I saw you on the train earlier, Tsumakawa-san…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Really? Then why didn’t you talk to me?… You’re so cold in those situations, Nezumayo. Trying to be cool, huh?”</p>
<p>“Hey, can you stop shoulder-squeezing me? Anyway, that’s not important right now… I wanted to ask you about when you gave your seat to the old lady on the train.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Yeah, what about it?”</p>
<p>“..Why did you do something like that?”</p>

<p>While I was the one who asked the question, I found myself wondering why I was asking Tsumakawa-san about this.</p>
<p>Honestly, I could’ve just seen Tsumakawa-san give up her seat and thought, ‘Tsumakawa-san is such a good person,’ feeling the goodness of her character, and that would have been enough.</p>

<p>——Isn’t it okay to leave it at that? Why did I start thinking like this…?</p>

<p>As I pondered these questions, Tsumakawa-san continued to wear a puzzled expression as if wondering why she was being asked this.</p>
<p>Despite that, after seeing my serious expression, she made a thoughtful gesture and said,</p>

<p>“Why?… I mean, there’s really no reason.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah, right! Sorry for asking something weird.”</p>
<p>“Well, if I had to say… I did it because I simply wanted to, I guess…”</p>
<p>“——”</p>
<p>“Hmm, the old lady had trouble standing, and I just didn’t want to sit while she was standing. But sorry, I don’t know what Yoda wants me to say, so I may be saying something ambiguous. Actually, I never even thought about anything… “</p>
<p>“R-Right… I guess it was a poorly phrased question on my part just now. ——Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, why are you thanking me? That’s funny.”</p>

<p>Perhaps the reason I thanked her was that Tsumakawa provided one of the answers I wanted to hear.</p>
<p>…Lately, I’ve been haunted by a kind-hearted gal who’s into otaku stuff, and I’ve been spending more time thinking about gals.</p>
<p>What are gals, anyway? The flashy style, frivolous behavior, and sun-loving attitude – is that all it takes to be a gal?</p>

<p>In the end, being a gal is just a category, and there probably isn’t a clear definition…</p>
<p>That’s what I’ve thought up until now.</p>

<p>But with Tsumakawa’s words just now and her actions on the train, I realized one thing: being a gal probably means being a girl who’s good at turning her emotions into actions.</p>
<p>Without overthinking or burdening herself with unnecessary thoughts, she could give up her seat to the old lady just because she wanted to.</p>
<p>Confess because she wants to, get closer to someone because she wants to be friends.</p>
<p>She doesn’t fake these feelings, she doesn’t suppress them, and she acts on her emotions with ease.</p>
<p>It’s not about having a carefree mindset; instead, it’s about having a nimble and agile way of living life, like having quick actions.</p>

<p>Thinking this way, the classification of extrovert and introvert might also be impolite for Tsumakawa…</p>
<p>After all, she’s not swayed by others and just does what she wants. She simply likes to make friends and loves light novels.</p>
<p>It was a mistake to try to classify and understand her under one label or the other when she was simply pursuing her interests within arm’s reach.</p>

<p>Giving up her seat for an elderly person isn’t the act of a saint, and texting late at night isn’t the deed of a troublemaker either——</p>
<p>——She’s just…a girl who’s honest with herself.</p>

<p>…I see. So, giving up her seat to the old lady, at its core, it’s driven by a sense of ‘justice’, isn’t it?</p>
<p>She wasn’t trying to do the right thing; she did it because she wanted to.</p>
<p>It’s like, when someone does the right thing for the sake of simply wanting to do it, that feels like the most genuinely righteous reason.</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>It felt like the fog in my mind had lifted just a bit.</p>
<p>I used to dislike gals because I didn’t understand them, and I didn’t expect much from the real world because girls always let me down.</p>
<p>However, thanks to understanding her a little bit, I realized that there’s something pure about a gal not restraining or hesitating due to her feelings.</p>

<p>Now that I understand her better, I can look squarely at Miona Tsumakawa’s face, the face of a gal who was free from reservations.</p>
<p>——And upon closer inspection, found Tsumakawa-san to be very pretty.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? Is there something on my face?”</p>
<p>“N-No… It’s nothing…”</p>
<p>“If it’s nothing, then why is your face turning so red?”</p>
<p>“Wait, seriously, I said it was nothing, please don’t touch my face! Stop the unnecessary body contact without reason!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, saying not to touch to a gal is just a waste of words, okay? This virgin boy still doesn’t get it, huh? ~Teasing, teasing.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with this gal!”</p>

<p>While Tsumakawa-san pinched my cheek, I shouted like that.</p>
<p>…Of course, a small realization like this won’t completely change my values, and a paradigm shift won’t suddenly make me fall in love with real-world girls, but——</p>

<p>Facing her constant presence, I sighed.</p>
<p>Continuing to maintain the cool and aloof attitude like a protagonist from a light novel might not be feasible anymore…I couldn’t help but think so——</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>By the way, there’s a little twist: On the night of that day, when I returned home, I received a message from Tsumakawa on LINE.</p>

<p>『As promised, I’ll try not to message you so often from now on!』</p>

<p>…Isn’t it strange to announce not sending messages too often via a message? Doesn’t that declaration contradict itself?</p>

<p>I was about to point that out when I received an additional message from her asking,『Still no reply?』</p>
<p>Receiving another message right away, I found myself muttering, ‘…Is her promise really a promise?’.</p>
