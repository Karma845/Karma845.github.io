<h2>Chapter 6: Lovers in New York</h2>

<p>“Why should Sakiho have to feel bad for being so cute?”</p>

<p>She told me one day that those words were the beginning. Sakiho and I lived in the same neighborhood and went to the same kindergarten, so we’ve known each other since then, but it was after that school trip that Sakiho started stalking me.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I went on a school trip in the spring of my sixth grade. The destination was Kyoto, a standard school trip.</p>

<p>During the free activities for sightseeing in the city, I was still embarrassed to be alone at that time, so I was looking for a spot where no one else seemed to go. I found a Starbucks along the Kamo River.</p>

<p>Starbucks was a very busy place, but for elementary school students, Starbucks was a very expensive place to go, so I figured that none of my classmates would come in there.</p>

<p>As a result, it was a success, and I did not run into any of my classmates, whom I had hoped to avoid.</p>

<p>The only miscalculation was the sight of a childhood friend sitting alone on the terrace, silently holding back tears.</p>

<p>“Sakiho, what are you doing all alone?”</p>

<p>Sakiho looked back at me in surprise, and then, perhaps feeling bad about being discovered, she said,</p>

<p>“Shinichi is alone, too. …”</p>

<p>She shows a calm demeanor.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s true… But Sakiho and I are different, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>“What’s the difference?”</p>
<p>“Sakiho has a friend, right? Wasn’t Imaguchi originally planning to go with you? Um, the girl with the vertical roll hairstyle…”</p>
<p>“Because it didn’t turn out that way, this is how it’s ended up… Uuuu…”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t cry …!”</p>

<p>Sakiho began crying as we talked, but after I comforted her and listened to her story, she explained how things had become this way.</p>

<p>Her story was so simple and childish.</p>

<p>Last night, the most popular boy in our class confessed his feelings to Sakiho.</p>

<p>Sakiho, who did not particularly like him, turned him down.</p>

<p>The confession by the most popular boy in the class became a well-known fact overnight.</p>

<p>(I didn’t know about it, but …).</p>

<p>The leader of the group, the girl with vertical roll hair, who liked the boy, said to Sakiho,</p>

<p>“You’re getting carried away, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>She left Sakiko and the other girls who were supposed to go with her and left Sakiho for free activities time.</p>
<p>The other girls were supposed to go around with her, but they left Sakiho behind and went off on a free tour.</p>

<p>“…What the heck.”</p>

<p>I’ve come to realize that human relationships are just burdening.</p>

<p>“Maybe it would have been better if I hadn’t refused the confession…”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t make any sense at all. If the opponent the girl with vertical role hair, it’s still impossible.”</p>
<p>“Stop calling her vertical roll hair! That girl has a name, Chiyan and Tateno Maki.”</p>

<p>Despite being betrayed, Sakiho defended the vertical roll. Or rather, the name really reflects the personality—Tateno Maki.</p>

<p>“Either way, with someone as jealous as vertical ro-… Tateno? The relationship was destined to get complicated when that boy confessed”</p>


<p>“What should I have done then…? Ughhh…”</p>

<p>Trying to calm down Sakiho, who seemed on the verge of tears again, I hastily stood up.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to do anything about it. Those people should be the ones begging us. Sakiho, it’s not your fault.”</p>
<p>“Not my fault…? Isn’t it because of me?”</p>

<p>I nodded in return and said the same thing in an extremely eloquent manner–actually, now that I think about it, I wonder where a sixth-grader in elementary school would have the courage to say something like that so casually.</p>

<p>“It’s not Sakiho’s fault. Just because Sakiho is cute, why should she have to feel bad?”</p>

<p>Sakiho looked surprised.</p>

<p>“Me… cute?”</p>
<p>“You got confessed to because you’re cute, right? Well, maybe it’s because of your good personality, but… anyway, it’s because you’re charming, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“As cute as someone you want to marry?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m just saying that in general…”</p>

<p>When I gently denied Sakiho’s leap in response, she once again filled her big eyes with tears.</p>

<p>“Forget it! I don’t matter anyway! You’re just trying to confuse me with fancy words like ‘general opinion’!”</p>
<p>“The fact that ‘confuse’ came out so naturally is impressive…” ( Sakiho using “煙に巻く)</p>
<p>“Nobody likes me anyway! Uwaaaa!”</p>

<p>Sakiho started crying again.</p>

<p>“No, I get it. You’re cute! As cute as someone you want to marry!”</p>

<p>That was the decisive moment when my words of encouragement reached her.</p>

<p>“Really…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, really really.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, I see.”</p>

<p>As I watched Sakiho wipe away her tears and smile happily, I realized that I had already noticed something about her true nature.</p>

<p>“Sakiho is emotionally unstable and scary…”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Recalling such things, it seemed that her emotional instability hadn’t gotten better even after she became a high school student, and it is being exposed in front of my eyes all the time.</p>

<p>“Um, Sakiho-san…?”</p>
<p>“…What is it?”</p>

<p>The plane was flying at an altitude of about 10,000 meters.</p>
<p>Seated in a first-class pair seat that was quite extravagant for a pair of high schoolers, she glared at me.</p>
<p>Despite the rare opportunity for a one-on-one date, she had been like this the whole time.</p>

<p>To be precise, not just since the start of our one-on-one date, but ever since we returned from the group date in Nasu.</p>
<p>Initially, I thought it was just because she was tired or slightly annoyed, or maybe she just wanted to show an attitude towards the other potential brides (mainly Osaki).</p>
<p>However, it seemed like she was genuinely angry. This prolonged silent treatment was the second time it had happened in our long relationship—the first being when I started dating Osaki.</p>

<p>“I’ve asked multiple times, but are you angry about something?”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you many times that I’m not angry at you.”</p>

<p>Upon returning to Roppongi, I had thought that she might be intentionally keeping the reason for her anger a mystery, perhaps as a strategy to secure a one-on-one date.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>To be honest, I can kind of guess why she’s angry.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t kindly accept the thought of the method she might have used to find out about it.</p>
<p>Because Sakiho was probably able to know this information because she was my stalker.</p>
<p>“…Could it be that you’re angry about me being kissed?”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened at that word, and she shot me another glare. She sat cross-legged on her seat, pulling the blanket over her head. It seemed like I hit the nail on the head.</p>
<p>I let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>Osaki wouldn’t have intentionally shared the details of that night with anyone, especially not with Sakiho.</p>
<p>So, it mean that Sakiho somehow overheard our conversation in the bathroom that night.</p>
<p>“From ventilation, maybe?”</p>
<p>Sakiho pouts her lips in silence.</p>
<p>While it was possible to block physical intrusion by closing windows, curtains, and doors completely, trapping air was impossible. Moreover, it would be dangerous for us if we did so.</p>
<p>Especially in lodging facilities, the bathroom vents often connected the rooms, and it was common to hear humming from the adjacent room’s bathroom in business hotels and such.</p>
<p>It seemed Sakiho utilized that to engage in her usual stalker-like eavesdropping activities and inadvertently overheard our conversation in the bathroom.</p>
<p>I thought we had spoken in voices lower than the shower’s sound… At least, I hope it wasn’t recorded by Osaki’s eavesdropping device.</p>
<p>Well, there was no helping it if she heard.</p>
<p>However, if we continued in this awkward moment, inviting Sakiho on a one-on-one date would be meaningless. We’d end without knowing what we wanted to know.</p>
<p>“Hey, Sakiho, about that…”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t want to hear it.”</p>
<p>She pulled the blanket tighter, hugging her knees and making herself even smaller.</p>
<p>“Sakiho…”</p>
<p>“I said I don’t want to hear it!”</p>
<p>Sakiho covered her ears and screamed.</p>
<p>The outburst might have slightly annoy other passengers, but this was indeed first class. The door was closed, creating a private space, and it seemed that the source of the sound couldn’t be identified. They quickly returned to silence, likely treating it as a glimpse of their imagination.</p>
<p>However, if Sakiho screamed one or two more times, the flight attendants would probably come here to check. After all, this is first class flight</p>
<p>Feeling weak, I scratched my head, and through the gap in the blanket, wet eyes peered at me.</p>
<p>“I cherished it all along, you know? Shinichi’s first kiss.”</p>
<p>Why does Sakiho cherish my first kiss? I was about to blurt it out, but realizing that she would undoubtedly get upset again if I said that. Besides, the time when I was dating Osaki overlapped with that incident, and for her to confidently conclude that it was my first kiss, well, it essentially meant that she, as a stalker, was monitoring me almost 24/7 even during that period… or she might be doing so. Even if she were, it wouldn’t be surprising, but even if she weren’t.</p>
<p>“And yet… Uuu…”</p>
<p>Apparently, she was sobbing as she imagined my first kiss.</p>
<p>“I wonder why you were taking a bath together?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Didn’t you ask me the reason for that? you heard it, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… but Shinichi and Osaki were talking in such a hushed voice that I couldn’t understand. I couldn’t even hear Osaki Sumire’s voice.”</p>
<p>“Was my voice loud?”</p>
<p>Osaki’s voice was probably higher and more audible…</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t. I have the ability to pick out Shinichi’s voice even in the midst of noise…”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>She said something frightening in a somewhat submissive tone.</p>
<p>“Out of those, I only caught three things. They were…”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to say it.”</p>
<p>” …’Osaki, maybe your ears… are they sensitive?’ ‘Is standing tough for you?’ ‘”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!”</p>
<p>Ignoring my attempt to stop her, Sakiho went on.</p>
<p>“…’Is it the first time I’ve been kissed?’ and ‘ Ugh…'”</p>
<p>“Please stop…I’m going to die…!”</p>
<p>Having only my side revealed doubled the embarrassment…!</p>
<p>“Even though it was Osaki Sumire, at least it was her… But still, ugh…! But I couldn’t protect my first kiss with you, Shin…!”</p>
<p>Next to me, who was so embarrassed that my face felt like it was on fire, Sakiho seemed to be regretful, like the protagonist of a battle manga who had just suffered their first defeat.</p>
<p>Thanks to her, I was able to regain a bit of composure.</p>
<p>“…Hey, Sakiho.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Sakiho raises her eyebrow and glares at me with teary eyes.</p>
<p>I confessed the truth to her who misunderstood me based on my voice alone..</p>
<p>“Does a kiss on the cheek count as a first kiss?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Sakiho let out a genuinely surprised voice. ‘Huh?’</p>
<p>“What? What’s with the cheek? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘What’s with the cheek?’ It’s exactly as it sounds. I didn’t kissed on the lips.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Really.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lie to appease Sakiho.</p>
<p>That time, what Osaki did was a kiss on my cheek.</p>
<p>“What? Yes, what…!”</p>
<p>Sakiho laughed, as if her displeasure from earlier was a lie,</p>
<p>Once again, she glared at me. No, why is she angry again…?</p>
<p>“The kiss on the cheek, it wasn’t your first time, right? I mean, I, back in elementary school, kissed you on the cheek, didn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, you did…”</p>
<p>“I did! As proof of my first love, I did it back then…”</p>
<p>After saying that, Sakiho quietly shut her mouth.</p>
<p>“…It’s fine after all. I want you to remember it yourself, so I won’t tell you yet.”</p>
<p>The misunderstanding was cleared up (maybe?), and the plane arrived at its destination—the Manhattan district of New York City.</p>
<p>Manhattan’s cityscape is like a combination of Tokyo’s Ginza, Omotesando, Roppongi, Shinjuku, and Shinjuku Gyoen. In short, it’s The Metropolis.</p>
<p>It gives off a feeling of the original Metropolis. Yellow taxis, skyscrapers, a world that seems to have been plucked straight from an overseas movie. And one of its distinctive features is the grid-like layout of the streets that intersect.</p>
<p>By the way, when we arrived, Juujo-san jokingly said with a serious expression,</p>
<p>“The rest is up to you two young folks,”</p>
<p>and drove us and our luggage to the hotel in a limousine.</p>
<p>“Now, what should we do?”</p>
<p>When I finally made it to the starting line, I reminded myself of my purpose this time.</p>
<p>① Is Sakiho the “master of the mysterious document”?</p>
<p>②If her first love were to be fulfilled, what would happen to Sakiho’s attitude?</p>
<p>In order to confirm these two points, I chose Manhattan.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Hey, Shinichi?”</p>
<p>Sakiho casually intertwined her arm with mine, looking up at me.</p>
<p>“Why did you choose Manhattan?”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you noticed??”</p>
<p>“Nfufu, well, I guess I do.”</p>
<p>When I asked again, Sakiho grinned happily.</p>
<p>On various occasions, Sakiho had mentioned, as if the two of us had decided it together, ‘Our honeymoon will be in Manhattan.</p>
<p>While I had no recollection of agreeing to go on a honeymoon to Manhattan or even approving of it as a travel destination, it was evident that, for Sakiho, this place held some significance.</p>
<p>So, when we came to Manhattan together, that is, when we fulfilled the ‘big event we wanted to do after getting married,’ I was curious about the changes she would show.</p>
<p>It was likely to be revealed more in her attitude after this date than during the date itself. And whether Sakiho was the mastermind behind the mysterious letters would probably be known by tonight.</p>
<p>Well, let’s ask just in case.</p>
<p>“Hey, what was Sakiho doing when that mysterious letter was discovered?”</p>
<p>As I asked, she, who had been grinning just moments ago, startled.</p>
<p>“I-I was in my room?”</p>
<p>“Whose room?”</p>
<p>“W-Well, mine, of course.”</p>
<p>Its suspicious.</p>
<p>“I see. So, on that night, Sakiho has no alibi after all?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, unfortunately… Oh, Shin! It’s a hot dog! Let’s eat!”</p>
<p>As if forcibly changing the subject, she pointed to a hot dog stand and headed in that direction.</p>
<p>On the first day, due to the late arrival, we had an American-sized dinner at a cafe-like place and headed to the hotel.</p>
<p>Walking around Manhattan at night as high schoolers is dangerous afterall.</p>
<p>When we reached the hotel, Sakiho and I each checked in. The room key was an unusual one for overseas hotels.</p>
<p>it was the type where you insert the key into the keyhole.</p>
<p>“Well then, good night, Shinichi.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, good night.”</p>
<p>2 AM.</p>
<p>Click, click… clack, clack… clickety-clack…</p>
<p>I heard the door open quietly and then slowly close.</p>
<p>While sighing inwardly, I sharpened my hearing to anticipate what will intruder do.</p>
<p>Would something would be stolen, or…</p>
<p>I was worried for a moment, but The soft, sneaky steps approached me, and then…</p>
<p>rustle, rustle, rustle, rustle.</p>
<p>The intruder—Shinagawa Sakiho—slippinginto my bed.</p>
<p>And from behind, she began touching around my waist as if searching something.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say we wouldn’t do these things until we were dating?”</p>
<p>“Oh, did I wake you up?”</p>
<p>The intruder—Shinagawa Sakiho—responded nonchalantly, without a hint of remorse.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t asleep to begin with. It’s not easy to sleep comfortable. So Sakiho, when did you learn that?”</p>
<p>I decided to ask about the fact I didn’t want to acknowledge.</p>
<p>“Did you acquire lockpicking skills?”</p>
<p>“Knowing about that is common sense, right?”</p>
<p>“I think it’s unconventional for Sakiho not to know that…”</p>
<p>Lockpicking and stalking are crimes.</p>
<p>“In other words, Sakiho, you have an alibi, right?”</p>
<p>“About the night of the mysterious letters?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, on that day, when I returned to the room with the mysterious letters, my toothbrush had been replaced with a new one.</p>
<p>So, someone stole and replaced it while I was out going to the sauna and returned with the mysterious letters.</p>
<p>The only person with a key to that room is me. Therefore, Sakiho must possess lockpicking skills.”</p>
<p>“Shinichi knows everything, huh?”</p>
<p>I won’t say it’s only about Sakiho.</p>
<p>“So, I researched hotels with lock-and-key locks instead of card keys and had Jūjō-san make a reservation. The information about the lock type isn’t readily available on websites, so it was quite challenging to find.”</p>
<p>“Wow, Shinichi, were you thinking about me all that time you were researching?”</p>
<p>She said that with genuine happiness. She’s a dangerous girl…</p>
<p>“Anyway, what do you usually do with the stolen toothbrush?”</p>
<p>“What do you think I do?”</p>
<p>“Uh, never mind.”</p>
<p>I stopped talking, fearing the answer.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing it?” was opposed with “What do you think I do?”…</p>
<p>“…So, are you coming to steal my toothbrush today too? Or have you been doing this all the time without me realizing?”</p>
<p>“No, this is the first time you’ve ever said that to me.</p>
<p>While saying that, Sakiho hugged me from behind.</p>
<p>The soft sensation, rapidly developing since middle school, emphasized its size.</p>
<p>Even with a childhood friend, something in me might have reacted strangely. She starting to bend forward a little.</p>
<p>“Hey, why?”</p>
<p>“…It’s a night visit.”</p>
<p>Sakiho hesitated for a moment, then whispered in my ear.</p>
<p>“When i heard Sumire Osaki kissed your cheek. I trust you, Shinichi. Your habits when lying didn’t show. But…”</p>
<p>Her voice starting to feel cold.</p>
<p>“If Sumire Ōsaki had tried to kiss you on the lips, would you have refused?”</p>
<p>“…I wonder.”</p>
<p>In reality, it wasn’t a matter of refusing or not. I wasn’t told, ‘I’m going to kiss you now,’ and it was a spur-of-the-moment thing.</p>
<p>With my sluggish reflexes, it wouldn’t have gone well.</p>
<p>“Right? So, rather than risking being stolen away.”</p>
<p>“I’d rather take it all from you than have it taken from me.”</p>
<p>“Wha…!”</p>
<p>“Even though I cherish Shinichi’s first time the most, it’s no good if Shinichi gives it to someone else without my permission, right?”</p>
<p>Then, she slipped her right hand into my T-shirt,</p>
<p>“…!?”</p>
<p>she gently traced her index finger over my chest.</p>
<p>“And also, when this study abroad is over, Shinichi, you’ll get engaged to me, right? I’ll win.”</p>
<p>“So, I realized there’s no need for you to become ‘lovers’ with anyone. Ah, it’s lonely and a waste. I wanted to be lovers. But thinking about it the other way, I realized now is like being lovers. ”</p>
<p>“Like ‘lover (temporary),’ essentially lovers, right? A somewhat popular and troublesome boyfriend who openly dates multiple people?”</p>
<p>As she unfolded her strange imagination, she entwined her thighs around mine.</p>
<p>“So, since I’m practically your lover, would Shinichi give me your first time? So…”</p>
<p>She gently guided my stiff hand to her thigh.</p>
<p>“H-Hey…!”</p>
<p>What’s happening, Sakiho… Could it be, is she serious?</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted to touch you for so long, wanted you to touch me for so long, wanted to know you for so long, wanted you to know me for so long, wanted to receive from you for so long, wanted you to give for so long, forever and ever…”</p>
<p>Unable to bear it any longer, I grabbed Sakiho’s shoulders and pushed her onto the bed.</p>
<p>“If you keep doing this….”</p>
<p>I was about to say about Flower Ceremony, but I stopped myself.</p>

<div><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/0021_Image_1_c6.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>Blackmail was the most detestable means to me, and making such promises would be meaningless since there is a chance that Sakiho will lost herself even changes her behavior. As I bit my lower lip.</p>


<p>“…Shinichi, I truly feel sorry for you.”</p>

<p>Sakiho placed her hand on my cheek.</p>

<p>“I know the real reason why Shinichi became a social minimalist. Actually…”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>

<p>With moistened eyes, Sakiho began to speak.</p>

<p>“Shinichi is truly kinder than anyone else, and he can’t bear to see people getting hurt, right? He doesn’t want to hurt anyone, right? That’s why, to avoid that, he keeps everyone at a distance, right?”</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Yet, Shinichi’s mom involves him in a program where he has to hurt someone. It’s really cruel.”</p>

<p>I felt my eyes widen at her compassionate expression.</p>

<p>“So, I’ll take care of all that for you?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean…?”</p>
<p>“I’ll confine Shinichi in New York.”</p>

<p>Saying that, she put my passport, which i had apparently forgotten about, inside her own pants.</p>

<p>…Damn, the night crawl was a lie, and that’s what she was aiming for.</p>

<p>“Shinichi’s passport is now in my possession. Without me, Shinichi won’t be able to return to Japan. So, as long as Shinichi puts on the face of a victim, everything should be fine, right? In that case, shall we continue with our honeymoon in New York as planned for the past five years?”</p>
<p>“…No, Sakiho.”</p>
<p>“Why not? This way, Shinichi can complete his studies abroad without hurting anyone.”</p>

<p>Somewhere in my heart, I briefly found myself considering her proposal as attractive. But it’s not right. It’s not about that.</p>

<p>“I am participating in this study abroad with my own consent. I cannot accept Sakiho’s proposal.”</p>

<p>As I reach out with trembling hands to retrieve my passport,</p>

<p>“… Stupid Shinichi.”</p>

<p>Sakiho wipes away the tears that were in her eyes and slips out of bed,</p>

<p>Passing through the bathroom and leaving the room.</p>

<p>“Even in this situation, she takes the toothbrush…,”</p>

<p>I mumble to myself, then cover my forehead with my palm.</p>

<p>“No, what about the passport…?”</p>

<p>The next morning, as I brush my teeth with a new toothbrush in my room, there’s a knock on the door.</p>

<p>When i open it, Juujo-san is standing there.</p>

<p>“Shinagawa-sama has checked out with a suitcase.”</p>
<p>“Checked out…? So, Sakiho is no longer here?”</p>
<p>“Yes. And this was found in Shinagawa-sama’s room.”</p>

<p>She hands me a note</p>

<p>“To Shinichi, I’ll be waiting for you at the place of our first love. Sakiho.”</p>

<p>“Ugh, the hint is so vague…”</p>

<p>Where could the place of our first love be? It wouldn’t be in Kyoto, considering we’re there for the first time together. Maybe there’s a clue from our school trip five years ago.</p>

<p>I recall the events after leaving Starbucks on that day.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>“Eh, What, you took the money out of your underwear…!?”</p>

<p>Sakiho’s eyes widened when I took out the money in front of the vending machine for a cup of tea.</p>

<p>“No, not from my underwear… I have a thin waist pouch between my pants and underwear. It’s convenient, hands-free, and less susceptible to pickpocketing.”</p>

<p>“Oh… I didn’t know such a thing existed.”</p>

<p>“When I was in elementary school, I was taken to New York, and they told me to keep my passport in here for safety. Even when sleeping. You wouldn’t want to worry about pickpockets during a trip, right?”</p>

<p>Eventually, we walked along the Kamo River, spent free time together, and returned to the meeting place.</p>

<p>On the way, Sakiho tugged at my clothes.</p>

<p>“Shinichi, have you been to Kyoto before? You walk without looking at the map.”</p>
<p>“Kyoto’s streets look like a checkerboard from above, right? So, even without a map, I can roughly tell where I am. …You were probably taught that in class”</p>
<p>“Is that so…?”</p>
<p>“No, what’s the point of taking classes then?”</p>
<p>“Well, probably no one remembers except Shinichi, right?”</p>
<p>“Are you kidding… What are others doing during class? Aren’t they slacking off?”</p>
<p>“Are there other cities like that? for example, overseas?”</p>
<p>“Why overseas? Well, let’s see. Oh, Manhattan in New York is like that, as I mentioned earlier.”</p>
<p>“Manhattan? Where is that?”</p>
<p>“In New York, America. The streets there are like a checkerboard, and there’s a river called the East River next to it. It’s like the Kamo River in Kyoto, I guess. I haven’t been to the East River, so I don’t know.”</p>

<p>As I explain in detail, Sakiho listens and then smiles.</p>

<p>“Then, let’s go there for our honeymoon!”</p>
<p>“Oh, honeymoon… huh? Wait, who?”</p>

<p>Perplexed, I feel her lips gently pressing against my cheek.</p>

<p>“It’s obvious that it’s us. So, when the time comes, treat me the same way you did then.”</p>


<p>* * *</p>


<p>“Ah, I see, that moment, back then…!”</p>

<p>I accidentally blurted it out loud.</p>

<p>If that’s the case…</p>

<p>“Find me,” the rest of her words from back then become clear.</p>

<p>“…There are too many Starbucks, aren’t there!?”</p>

<p>An hour later, I was going around Starbucks along the East River. Unlike Japan, there’s a Starbucks every block in Manhattan. It’s as frequent as convenience stores in Japan.</p>

<p>Even though I limited it to along the East River, there were still so many. It’s incomparable to the Kamo River!</p>

<p>After about 15 Starbucks, I finally find her sitting on the terrace of one.</p>

<p>I hastily approach her.</p>

<p>“Huff, huff… Sakiho, what are you doing alone?”</p>
<p>“I was definitely thinking about Shinichi.”</p>
<p>“So, why did you do something like this? Were you so upset about yesterday?”</p>

<p>She sips her café latte, as I sit next to her.</p>

<p>“No, I knew Shinichi wouldn’t go along with that invitation.”</p>
<p>“Eh, is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, even I understood that Shinichi wouldn’t agree to such a plan. So, I decided to come up with a little strategy. I named it the ‘Operation Doki-Doki★Make Shinichi Chase You!.’ ”</p>
<p>“Is stealing and escaping part of it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t say it like that. It’s not good, okay?”</p>

<p>She gives me a scolding look, but it’s clear that it’s not good from her side.</p>

<p>“But when you chase me like this, you realize that I’m important to you, right?”</p>
<p>“Sakiho, or rather, the passport you stole from me is what’s important.”</p>
<p>“Mou, Shinichi…”</p>

<p>Well, if she takes it home, I won’t be able to go back. I’ve never lost it, but I imagine it’s quite troublesome, going to the embassy and all.</p>

<p>“…But, I was happy that you found me.”</p>

<p>Sakiho was dazzling with a gentle smile.</p>

<p>“Do you remember that time?”</p>
<p>“There weren’t many hints, though, right? If I hadn’t remembered, Sakiho would have just stayed here waiting for me, right?”</p>
<p>“That can’t be true. I know how much hint it takes for Shinichi to remember. I know that much.”</p>

<p>In a cheerful mood, Sakiho drinks the still-warm coffee in front of her.</p>

<p>“Sigh…”</p>

<p>Considering the refusal of yesterday’s invitation and the time it took for me to find Sakiho, it’s quite a splendid.</p>

<p>“You seem to know everything, Sakiho.”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, I don’t know everything. Just about Shinichi.”</p>
<p>Back at the Roppongi Sky Tower, on a certain evening two days later.</p>

<p>Everyone gathers in the living room, waiting for the announcement of the second 1-on-1 date partner.</p>

<p>“I’m so nervous,” says Sakiho Shinagawa.</p>
<p>“You can relax, Sakiho, because it won’t be you. You can go back to your room and sleep,” says Yuu Shibuya.</p>
<p>“Yuu-chan probably won’t be chosen either. Neither will Ria-chan, right? ♡” says Ria Meguro.</p>
<p>“You can be aware of that much. There are only two candidates,” says Sumire Oosaki.</p>
<p>“In reality, it’s probably just one. If Hirakawa listens to my request, but…” says Reona Kanda.</p>
<p>“…I hope that’s the case,” says Maion Hiraga, staring at me intently.</p>

<p>In the midst of this, Juujo-san announces the name.</p>

<p>“Sumire Osaki, please go on a 1-on-1 date.”</p>
<p>“eh me..?”</p>

<p>Osaki eyes wided and surprised,</p>

<p>“Onii-chan……!”</p>

<p>Maion suprised, biting her bottom lip and looking at me.</p>
