<h2>Chapter 6: Shimizu-san and Shopping</h2>


<p style="text-align: center"><strong> 1</strong></p>

<p>“It’s our first outing since becoming the new Astronomy Club!”</p>
<p>“You call it an outing, but we’re just here to go shopping, you know?”</p>

<p>On the Saturday before our next day’s stargazing, the five of us in the Astronomy Club visited a large supermarket.</p>

<p>“But in fact, we haven’t done any activities outside of school since we became a five-member club. So it’s exciting!”</p>
<p>“Being excited is fine, but don’t bother the other customers.”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“Alright then… let’s reconfirm our objective. The reason we’re at the supermarket today is to make sure we have enough food for dinner tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“I’ve thought this before when you mentioned it, but why not just gather after dinner?”</p>

<p>That’s something I’d been wondering too.</p>
<p>Since we can’t stargaze until the sun goes down, it seems like it’d be better to meet up at night.</p>

<p>“There are other things I want to do besides stargazing. That’s why I want everyone to gather by noon.”</p>
<p>“What do you want to do?”</p>
<p>“That’ll be a surprise for when we gather!”</p>
<p>“By the way, I haven’t been told either.”</p>
<p>“Me neither.”</p>
<p>“So, really, no one knows except Ai?”</p>

<p>Is this really okay? I can’t say I’m without concerns. But then again, Ai-san probably wouldn’t do anything bad.</p>

<p>“Anyway, if we’re starting activities from noon, I’d like to have dinner before we start stargazing. I thought it’d be fine to eat at a restaurant near the school, but it seems Ai has something else in mind…”</p>
<p>“Another one of your ideas again, huh…”</p>
<p>“Since we’re all gathering on our day off, don’t you want to do something fun?”</p>
<p>“I know. I’ve been asked to help with various things. But it doesn’t seem like something that needs to be kept secret though…”</p>
<p>“No, I want you to look forward to it on the day itself, so let’s keep it a secret.”</p>

<p>It seems that Ai-san wants to keep tomorrow’s dinner’s details a secret.</p>
<p>Although, it feels like we might be able to guess just from the ingredients we’re buying today.</p>

<p>“So, for that reason, please wait until tomorrow for the dinner menu announcement.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to start shopping right away, but it’s inefficient for all five of us to walk around together and we might get in the way of other customers. So, I’m thinking of splitting into two groups for today’s shopping.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good, but how will we divide?”</p>
<p>“How about by grade? Third-years and second-years?”</p>

<p>Ai-san answered Shimizu-san’s question.</p>

<p>“That works for me.”</p>
<p>“I’m good too.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with it too.”</p>
<p>“How about you, Kei?”</p>
<p>“…That’s fine with me.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled!”</p>

<p>And so, we decided to split into two groups for shopping.</p>

<p>“I looked at the note she gave us, and isn’t it just snacks and drinks listed?!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha…”</p>
<p>“What about Dorayaki? Did she write dorayaki?”</p>
<p>“It’s there… it’s written…”</p>
<p>“As expected of Ai-senpai. She understands the demand.”</p>
<p>“That’s a very specific demand.”</p>
<p>“I can’t stand it. I’ll go ahead and secure some dorayaki.”</p>
<p>“Hey, wait! Not everyone is as obsessed with dorayaki as you are!”</p>

<p>Ignoring Shimizu-san’s words, Seto-san left us behind.</p>

<p>“What’s with Seto’s obsession with dorayaki…”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s good to have something you love, I guess?”</p>
<p>“There’s a limit to everything.”</p>
<p>“Should we go after her?”</p>
<p>“Maybe we should. She’s probably at the Japanese confectionery section.”</p>

<p>With that, Shimizu-san and I headed towards the Japanese confectionery section.</p>

<p>“It’s bigger than I thought.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>A few minutes after Seto-san split from us, we still hadn’t found her.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the Japanese confectionery section, Seto-san was nowhere to be found.</p>

<p>“That dorayaki monster has completely gone off the radar.”</p>
<p>“I think she’ll be okay, but I’ll let Ai-san and the others know just in case.”</p>

<p>I took out my smartphone and reported to Ai-san that Seto-san was missing.</p>

<p>“Now that we’ve informed them, shall we continue shopping and look for Seto-san?”</p>
<p>“…she’s acting weirdly considerate.”</p>
<p>“Weirdly considerate?”</p>

<p>I wonder what she meant by that.</p>

<p>“I’m just talking to myself. She’ll probably be back soon. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Okay…huh?”</p>

<p>As I was about to follow Shimizu-san, I noticed someone looking out of place.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Hondō?”</p>
<p>“Just wait a moment.”</p>

<p>I approached a young girl at the Japanese confectionery section.</p>
<p>The small girl looked around anxiously, which caught my attention.</p>
<p>I crouched down to meet her gaze.</p>

<p>“Can I have a moment?”</p>
<p>“…ah? Ye-yes.”</p>

<p>It seemed the girl was surprised, probably not expecting me to approach her.</p>

<p>“My name is Daiki Hondō. Where are your parents?”</p>
<p>“…They’re gone. My mom went somewhere…”</p>

<p>The girl looked as if she was on the verge of tears. I had to reassure her quickly.</p>

<p>“It’s okay. I’ll help you find your mom.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>

<p>It seemed I managed to calm her down.</p>

<p>“How are we going to find her parents?”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, were you listening?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. I couldn’t just continue shopping on my own, right? Let’s find this kid’s mother quickly… Why are you looking at me like that?”</p>

<p>Apparently, what I was thinking was reflected in my expression.</p>

<p>“Thank you. Shimizu-san really is kind.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be called kind by someone who sticks their nose into other people’s business. Let’s just find her mom quickly.”</p>
<p>“Ne, Daiki, who is this scary person?”</p>

<p>The girl pointed at Shimizu-san, seemingly wanting to know who she was.</p>

<p>“She’s not scary. This is Kei Shimizu. She’s a kind person, so you don’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>“…okay.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go find your mom.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san and I changed our initial objective and decided to search the supermarket to find the little girl’s mother.</p>
<p>After some time searching, we couldn’t find the girl’s mother and there wasn’t any significant progress.</p>
<p>The only thing we discovered was that the girl’s name was Sakki-chan.</p>

<p>“I wonder where she is… Sakki-chan’s mother.”</p>
<p>“There’s no way to predict that. That’s why we’re checking everywhere.”</p>
<p>“That’s true…”</p>

<p>Currently, Shimizu-san and I were walking with Sakki-chan in between us.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Sakki-chan was in a good mood and was following us with a smile.</p>

<p>“This…”</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped, I guess.”</p>

<p>Today, both Shimizu-san and I had come to the supermarket in casual clothes.</p>
<p>Because of that, we seemed to be mistaken for a young family, receiving warm glances from the adults around.</p>

<p>“Do young people these days have baby faces? That father and mother only look like high school students.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. That family looks so cute, I’m envious.”</p>

<p>We could hear the murmurs around us.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san and I are real high school students, but we couldn’t explain that to everyone around us.</p>


<p>“Hey, Hondō, let’s hurry up.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Wait, Kei, Daiki!”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan called out to stop Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Hold my hand!”</p>
<p>“Do you want to hold hands?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Daiki on my right and Kei on my left.”</p>
<p>“If we do that, we’ll look even more like a family!”</p>
<p>“Is that bad?”</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan looked up at Shimizu-san with pleading eyes.</p>

<p>“…I-I’ve got no choice, just give me your hand.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>

<p>Then Sakki-chan joyfully held Shimizu-san’s hand.</p>

<p>“Now Daiki too!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I followed Shimizu-san’s lead and held Sakki-chan’s hand.</p>

<p>“Where are we going next, Daiki?”</p>
<p>“What should we do, Hondō? We’ve mostly looked everywhere in the store.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if Sakki-chan’s mother is also looking for her?”</p>

<p>If not, it wouldn’t explain why we haven’t found Sakki-chan’s mother yet.</p>

<p>“Maybe if we missed each other, it would be better to wait somewhere?”</p>
<p>“Right. If we’re going to wait, maybe we should go to the rest area? Is that okay, Sakki-chan?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>We decided to head to the rest area inside the supermarket while holding hands. A few minutes later, the three of us were in the rest area.</p>
<p>Sakki-chan was drinking a juice I bought from the vending machine.</p>

<p>“We won’t be moving for a while.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for your hard work, Shimizu-san.”</p>

<p>It seems Shimizu-san was quite drained from walking hand in hand this far.</p>

<p>“Make sure you get reimbursed for the juice from her parents later.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I did it because I wanted to.”</p>
<p>“You really…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san looked at me with an incredulous expression.</p>

<p>“Kei, I want to play!”</p>

<p>Before I knew it, Sakki-chan had finished her juice.</p>

<p>“Alright, but don’t bother others around you.”</p>
<p>“Got it! What should we play?”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan’s eyes sparkled brightly.</p>

<p>“How about drawing?”</p>

<p>Saying that, Shimizu-san took out a notebook and a ballpoint pen from her bag and handed them to Sakki-chan.</p>

<p>“Thank you!”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Having received the notebook and pen, Sakki-chan immediately began to draw.</p>

<p>“…What’s with that look?”</p>

<p>As I watched her, Shimizu-san gave me a stern glance.</p>

<p>“No, I was just thinking that even if it’s subtle or not obvious, you’re really caring, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Anyone would be like this.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think so. In fact, I believe the reason Sakki-chan is so attached to you is because you’re kind.”</p>
<p>“She’s just friendly.”</p>
<p>“You think so?”</p>

<p>I looked over at Sakki-chan.</p>
<p>Somehow, I felt that, like Teruno, Sakki-chan might be the shy type.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, you’ll make a good mother in the future.”</p>
<p>“W-what…?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s face turned red. Did I say something weird?</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“N-nothing…Anyway, I wonder how much longer until her parents come.”</p>
<p>“It’s a big supermarket, so it might take a while.”</p>
<p>“I’m done!”</p>
<p>“You’re done already? That was fast. Let me see.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>

<p>There was a drawing of three people holding hands.</p>

<p>“The one in the middle is me, and on both sides are Daiki and Kei.”</p>
<p>“Not bad at all.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san patted Sakki-chan’s head.</p>

<p>“Hehe.”</p>

<p>Just then, an advertisement for today’s special sale started playing throughout the store.</p>
<p>A light bulb went off in my head.</p>

<p>“Ah!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I remembered a way to inform Sakki-chan’s mother about her location.”</p>
<p>“There’s a way to do that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, there is. So, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Where are we going?”</p>
<p>“To the service counter.”</p>

<p>After a short while, we were at the service counter.</p>
<p>We decided to ask Sakki-chan’s mother to come over to the service counter.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you embarrassed being like this?”</p>

<p>As we continued to wait with Sakki-chan holding our hands, Shimizu-san asked me a question.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit embarrassing, but it’s also nostalgic.”</p>
<p>“Nostalgic?”</p>
<p>“When I was little, I always held hands with Teruno whenever we went somewhere. We stopped doing it as Teruno grew older. Didn’t you do something like that with Ai-san, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“If I held hands with Ai, my hand would end up somewhere else entirely.”</p>

<p>It seems Ai-san has always had an unusual level of energy.</p>

<p>“Sakki!”</p>

<p>We turned to the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>A woman was standing there.</p>

<p>“Mom!”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan let go of my and Shimizu-san’s hands and energetically ran towards the woman.</p>
<p>The woman then embraced Sakki-chan tightly.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad… I’m glad I found you.”</p>
<p>“Mom, you’re squeezing a bit too hard.”</p>
<p>“I’m-I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san and I then walked closer to the two of them.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, are you Sakki-chan’s mother?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am. Did you two bring Sakki here?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Thank you so much.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Sakki-chan’s mother bowed deeply.</p>

<p>“Oh, please lift your head.”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan’s mother slowly raised her head.</p>

<p>“While I was shopping, I lost sight of her. This supermarket is so big, and I couldn’t find her even after searching. If it weren’t for you two, I wouldn’t have found Sakki so quickly. Really, thank you so much.”</p>
<p>“No problem. We’re just glad Sakki-chan could quickly meet her mother again. Right, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me. W-well, that’s good, I guess?”</p>
<p>“How can I ever thank you… Sakki, thank this brother and sister.”</p>

<p>Hearing that, Sakki-chan turned towards us with a smile.</p>

<p>“Daiki, Kei, thank you for helping me find my mom!”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t call them by them first names without honorifics!”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I was fine being called that.”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry. But, there’s something…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>It feels like everything has been resolved, but maybe there’s still something left?</p>

<p>“I’d like to give you something to thank you for helping Sakki.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you really don’t need to do that.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. We didn’t help expecting anything in return.”</p>
<p>“Even so, she did interrupt your time together…”</p>

<p>I feel like there’s a misunderstanding here.</p>

<p>“Um, what do you think the relationship is between Shimizu-san and me?”</p>
<p>“Huh? You two are a couple on a date, right?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“W-we’re not!”</p>

<p>Turns out my feeling of a misunderstanding was correct, but I didn’t expect it to be this.</p>

<p>“Really? Since you two looked so good together, I thought that was the case…”</p>
<p>“Eh, Daiki and Kei, you’re not boyfriend and girlfriend?”</p>
<p>“I-I said we’re not!”</p>

<p>Even Sakki-chan had the wrong idea.</p>

<p>“But Kei, the way you looked at Daiki was like a maiden(Otome)…”</p>
<p>“Where did you learn that kind of word?!”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan seems a bit precocious.</p>

<p>“Mmm, I see-I see.”</p>

<p>For some reason, I feel like the way Sakki-chan’s mother looks at us has changed slightly.</p>

<p>“Well, if you insist on thanking us, there’s something I’d like.”</p>
<p>“What would that be?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san made eye contact with Sakki-chan.</p>

<p>“Hey, do you still have that drawing from earlier?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan pulled out a folded piece of notepaper from her pocket.</p>
<p>It seems to be the notepaper she drew on in the break area earlier.</p>

<p>“Can I have that?”</p>
<p>“Sure, take good care of it!”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san took the piece of notepaper with the drawing from Sakki-chan.</p>

<p>“Is that all you want?”</p>

<p>Sakki-chan’s mother looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“This is more than enough for me. We still have some shopping to do, so we should get going. Make sure you keep a tight grip on her hand.”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“Bye-bye, Kei, Daiki.”</p>
<p>“See you.”</p>
<p>“See you.”</p>

<p>And with that, our search for Sakki-chan’s mother came to an end.</p>

<p>“…by the way, where did Seto end up going?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>Then, we moved on to search for the first person we had completely forgotten about.</p>
