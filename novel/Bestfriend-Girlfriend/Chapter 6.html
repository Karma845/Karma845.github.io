<h1>Chapter 6: Kanaya Chihiro Seeks Revenge</h1>

<h3>Tokyo Lovey-Dovey</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A 24-hour bowling alley.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game corner next to the lanes, my sister and I were engrossed in an air hockey game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time had passed by 21:00.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We honestly weren&#8217;t concerned about the score.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In general, there&#8217;s no logical reason for me to beat my sister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her athletic ability is on a completely different level. Moreover, when my sister unleashes her abilities, nobody can defeat her. And worst of all, my sister is quite immature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230; why do you think Fumio is suspicious?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I ask.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not my sister. It&#8217;s to the guy with long hair playing air hockey with a girl at the adjacent table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wearing a lightweight short-sleeved summer hoodie with the hood pulled up, he stops his hands and puts on a sycophantic smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well….it&#8217;s not just suspicious. It&#8217;s more than that. He used to be a mere target of bullying until not long ago. But in the blink of an eye, those who used to bully him fell from grace and all the girls started fawning over him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; he doesn&#8217;t seem like the type who would attract attention, no matter how you look at it. But is that all? Maybe he&#8217;s just going through a phase of popularity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Popularity, huh&#8230; well, aside from that guy Kijima, I was actually kidnapped somewhere and went through a terrible experience. I wonder if the track and field incident is the same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The pig monster, was it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230; I&#8217;d rather not remember, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy&#8217;s story, which looks flimsy at a glance, contains a lot of lies but the part about the pig monster isn&#8217;t a lie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, there are two reasons I bought into this story from a guy who&#8217;s clearly full of lies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a chance for us, the detective JKs, to further make our name known by solving the trending 『Excessive Disappearance Incident』 on the internet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the other reason is&#8230;we found out from this guy&#8217;s story that there seems to be a 『Devil』 involved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As someone blessed by an angel&#8217;s favour, I can&#8217;t overlook it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s probably right that the track and field club is the same. In fact, almost everyone in the club has fallen into the hands of the kidnapper. Whether they can&#8217;t remember like you or if their mouths are sealed, I don&#8217;t know, but it&#8217;s safe to say they&#8217;re under some kind of mental control”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way!?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who raised her voice was the girl who was competing against Tachioka. She had cute twin tails and looked like a junior high school student. She&#8217;s Tachioka&#8217;s sister, apparently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-well&#8230; I have friends in the track and field club. Like Sato-chan, Shiratori-senpai, and Kei-chan…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pondered, considering my next move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve entrusted my sister with monitoring the ponytailed track and field club captain. She&#8217;s all in black. Somewhere, there should be a moment when she comes into contact with the culprit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it wouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea to have this little sister investigate the girls whose names came up now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there&#8217;s someone else I want to meet more than anyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The woman accused of a crime, did you say her name was Anna Kamishima? Any idea where she might be?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, Tachioka shrugged his shoulders and shook his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know. However&#8230;I have located the whereabouts of her younger sister. She&#8217;s working at a girls&#8217; bar called 『Seaside Bound』 in a neighbouring prefecture.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm&#8230; Well, maybe I should start by paying a visit to that sister then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Second day of summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing the morning radio callisthenics and taking a shower, I headed to the station for a 『return visit』 where I met up with Kurosawa-san on the bullet train platform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Fumi-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came running over with a suitcase in hand, wearing oversized sunglasses, an off-shoulder top and high-waisted skinny pants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of a model, she looked incredibly stylish in her casual attire.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Kurosawa-san&#8230;you look really cute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe&#8230; It&#8217;s a trip to Tokyo with you, Fumi-kun. I&#8217;ve got to put in some effort for that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A trip&#8230;but isn&#8217;t it a photoshoot? Yours, Kurosawa-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed. The purpose of this trip to Tokyo is for Kurosawa-san&#8217;s photoshoot for a teen magazine. I&#8217;m accompanying her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s fine. Today and tomorrow, I get to have Fumi-kun all to myself. Let&#8217;s just call it a trip, okay?, okay! Look, the bullet train is about to leave soon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, she linked her arm with mine and started walking towards the stationary bullet train.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our seats were in the last row of the regular carriages. Kurosawa-san pushed me into a window seat of a two-seater and then leaned heavily against me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re like a bag of mice, Fumi-kun!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[an idiom in Japanese that humorously describes someone as being overly cautious, timid, or jumpy.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Close, so close, our faces are so close!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thinking that we can be all lovey-dovey without worrying about anyone for the next two hours really gets me excited.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lovey-dovey&#8230;but the bullet train is almost full, isn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see young businessmen sitting in the three-seater seats across the aisle, trying to act like they&#8217;re not looking but clearly curious, leaning in with interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which&#8230;don’t you need to disguise yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked that, she chuckled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wearing sunglasses should be enough. Besides, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m that famous. Probably just among readers who are high school girls. They would know about me.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s fine, Fu-mi-ku-n. Don&#8217;t be so worried. Let me be spoiled.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When there&#8217;s no one we know around, the tsun part of her tsundere personality seems to disappear somewhere, and the current Kurosawa-san is all dere, completely affectionate. It&#8217;s a grand dere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her chest against my upper arm, her lips planting kisses on my cheek and her fingers playing with my nipple through my clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, love you, mmm&#8230;let&#8217;s keep kissing, Fumi-kun. I&#8217;m lonely…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh no…she can&#8217;t reason like this&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the initial brainwashing stage, Lili had mentioned that Kurosawa-san becomes extremely clingy when we&#8217;re alone and it&#8217;s true in bed but I never expected it to extend to our everyday life like this.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I gently ask Kurosawa-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Today&#8230; do you think they&#8217;ll come?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I asked the editor in charge, but&#8230;today&#8217;s shoot is with Hikami Kirito and Akira Mitsuki together, so I think&#8230; they&#8217;ll come.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, this trip to Tokyo was something I requested of Kurosawa-san to accompany her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are a few reasons for this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Firstly, I just wanted to go to Tokyo. It&#8217;s a dream of a country person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Secondly, I&#8217;m curious to see a model&#8217;s photoshoot in action. It&#8217;s a bit of shallow interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thirdly, once I&#8217;ve visited, from now on, whenever Kurosawa-san has work in Tokyo, I can use 『Revisit』 to instantly transport us there.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the main purpose is to fulfil a promise with someone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, this is Hikari-kun, and this is Akira-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san takes a magazine out of her bag, flips through the pages, and points to the two individuals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The male has a somewhat handsome half-like appearance. Yeah, an enemy. One could even say an enemy of humanity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, the girl has mushroom-like blond hair and her makeup, which could be described as Ulzzang-style, including overly vibrant lipstick, accompanied her smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: In japanese it’s called Oruchanmeiku;in katakana but in English it is Ulzzang-style; a Korean fashion and makeup trend that is characterised by: glass, milky white skin. youthful, big eyes]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Kurosawa-san is cuter. No doubt about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nfu, Fumi-kyun, you&#8217;re too much…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I get that you&#8217;re happy, but please stop pinching my nipple, Kurosawa-san.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are these two also reader models?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, they&#8217;re different. These two are professional models.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Kurosawa-san&#8217;s explanation, when it comes to reader models, it generally refers to fashionable ordinary people not affiliated with an agency who appear in the magazine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These two aren&#8217;t like that, they are professional models as a profession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, not all reader models are regular people. Some so-called 『talent eggs』 start as reader models and become more established.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it seems that Kurosawa-san follows precisely that pattern.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her agency is a small-time entertainment agency and reader model jobs are typically done without the agency&#8217;s involvement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, the compensation is a modest token, including transportation expenses at best and it seems like the expenses often outweigh the earnings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, why does she continue with such work? In a word, it&#8217;s for the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the female fashion magazine 『CUTIE☆CUTIE』 which primarily targets teenage girls, MISUZU is the flagship reader model.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After graduating, she plans to leverage the popularity gained as a reader model to enter full-fledged talent activities.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Impressive, Kurosawa-san. Thinking about the future and putting in effort from now on&#8230; it&#8217;s kind of like what adults do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used to think that modelling was something frivolous, to be honest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I couldn&#8217;t help but be impressed, Kurosawa-san smiled and said,</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumi-kyun&#8217;s dick is more than an adult&#8217;s.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you ruined it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After arriving in Tokyo, we transferred to a local train and made our way to the building where the studio was located, then turned into an alley behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in a place hidden from view, I summoned a door and stepped into the 『room』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;ll go change now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Want me to coordinate for you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Kurosawa-san does the coordinating, it&#8217;ll end up stylish. But since we&#8217;re in disguise, it&#8217;s better to look a bit sloppy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Fumi-kun, you&#8217;re going to be my new rookie manager, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right, treated as Kurosawa-san&#8217;s lackey of a manager. Not seen as the opposite s*x but someone you like to tease and boss around. Please act that way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re asking for quite a lot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re aiming to be an actress, aren&#8217;t you? You&#8217;ll be fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yeah&#8230;I&#8217;ll do my best, but not being seen as the opposite s*x, that&#8217;s a bit challenging.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though she looks somewhat troubled, if Kurosawa-san returns to her previous attitude towards me, it should be alright. I&#8217;m sure of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, after changing clothes for a while, Kurosawa-san, seeing me emerge from the 『costume room』 burst into laughter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gyahahahahahahaha!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She held her stomach and rolled on the floor laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A baggy navy suit, a loose-fitting shirt. An unnecessarily bright red tie and round glasses. A bit more slouched than usual. I’m clearly a dull salaryman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They exist! You know, people like this! Probably buys lunch at the convenience store every day, looks at marriage agency ads, likely enjoys trains. Oh, and all his friends probably wear glasses too,and he&#8217;s the type to have a kotatsu and a fan in his room regardless of the season!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, Kurosawa-san, you have a lot of apologising to do in different directions!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking a deep breath and wiping away a tear that welled up at the corner of her eye with her finger, Kurosawa-san finally speaks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No…this is a gem. The vibe that makes me want to tease you is incredible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Please act accordingly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, we exit the 『room』 and head to the studio again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking the elevator to the fourth floor. After announcing our visit through the intercom at the entrance, we step into the studio.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as we entered the studio, Kurosawa-san raised her voice and bent over with a big gesture. I quickly followed suit and bowed my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around, there were more people than I had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An elderly female photographer and two male assistants, presumably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A woman who seemed like a stylist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A well-built man in his fifties wearing a double-breasted suit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A beautiful girl who seemed like a model, and a tall, slender handsome man who also appeared to be a model.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These two were Akira Mitsuki and Hikami Kirito, the ones I saw in the magazine earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Akira Mitsuki looked quite different from the magazine photos. That mushroom cut was probably a wig. Her hair was long and delicate-looking. At the very least, she looked cuter than in the photos I saw earlier.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Though, Kurosawa-san is way cuter!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kimeta-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san called out and the woman who was closest to us approached with a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yahhoo! Long time no see, Misuzu-chan! I was worried about you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With hair down to her shoulders, a young woman with freckles on her nose greeted us. She wore a girly dress and had a round face with a warm and friendly aura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for causing you trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trouble? Oh, no worries. Seriously! Don&#8217;t take this the wrong way, but Misuzu-chan&#8217;s return has been a source of excitement, even for the editor-in-chief. You&#8217;re our flagship reader model after all. This time, we&#8217;re going to have you on the cover too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The cover!? Oh, thank you. Hey, Fumijima, you too, bow your head, quickly! Seriously, you&#8217;re such a drag!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, thank you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san grabbed my head and forcefully made me bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn? And who&#8217;s this person?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, I&#8217;m sorry. Let me introduce him since he&#8217;s technically my manager. Come on, Fumijima, give a proper greeting, you slacker.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san kicked my foot with her toe. It really hurt.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wait, this is acting, right? Right?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pleased to meet you. I, um, am Fumijima Sajio, the manager of MISUZU under Modero Planning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello there! I&#8217;m Sameta Yasuko from the Morita Publishing editing department. Feel free to call me Pompoko.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Pompoko-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I made a puzzled expression, she smiled brightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See, if you read my last name backward, it&#8217;s 『tanuki』.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Well, speaking of which, she does kind of look like a tanuki.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, by the way, who&#8217;s that over there?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I directed my gaze at the man wearing a double-breasted suit. He looked like a strong-willed middle-aged guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that&#8217;s President Kurashima from the First Beauty Office”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First Beauty, the industry giant!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exaggeratedly feigned surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it seems that Akira-chan is personally produced by the president himself…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-Then, I&#8217;d really like to introduce myself to him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I lowered my head to greet him with a humble nod, President Kurashima simply nodded in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indifferent to my gesture, he took my business card and casually tossed it into his pocket without offering his own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the photo shoot began, I found myself idle. I absentmindedly watched the proceedings from a corner of the studio and it seemed quite challenging. Not the actual photography process but dealing with the strong-willed old man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s shoot was for the cover and a feature page with three friends, both male and female. Despite being a reader model, Kurosawa&#8217;s popularity in 『CUTIE☆CUTIE』 was unrivalled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, with the added topic of her return from the kidnapping incident, the focus of the shoot naturally centred around Kurosawa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, President Kurashima frequently interjected with his opinions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Focus on our Akira!』 or 『Make sure she appears on the cover!』 He disrupted the shoot multiple times with his domineering demands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surprisingly, Pompoko-san was staunchly resisting this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, despite being the president, it was inappropriate for the modelling agency to intervene in editorial matters, so Pompoko-san&#8217;s resistance was justified.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The clashes between President Kurashima and Pompoko-san occurred repeatedly, significantly delaying the shoot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re going to demand that, why don&#8217;t you work with a different agency?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though I believe Pompoko-san&#8217;s outburst might have escalated the situation, she raised her voice in genuine frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the tense atmosphere on the verge of confrontation, Hikami Kirito intervened, saying, 『Come on, President&#8230;We would be in trouble if we lost Morita Publishing&#8217;s business』 and managed to appease the president, allowing us to somehow complete the shoot.</span></p>



<h3>People Who Are Out Of Focus</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U–…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outside the window, cicadas were chirping. From the direction of the sports field, the calls of club activities could be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a frustrated expression, I pursed my lips and let out a groan, holding a pencil between my lips and nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a supplementary lesson. No matter what, it&#8217;s supplementary lessons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I resist with [I don&#8217;t want that] it&#8217;s still supplementary lessons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, you win, just take my cushion.</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I&#8217;ve finished one session of supplementary lessons and am in the midst of reviewing for a quiz.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a chicken, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d get the newly explained content wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re making fun of me too much. I want to finish quickly and wait for the papers to be collected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still&#8230; something feels off. It&#8217;s like a haze of frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about why I&#8217;m feeling so frustrated, the reason immediately comes to mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven&#8217;t seen Fu-min. Not yesterday, not today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a reply to the 『Goodnight, Fu-min』 message I sent before bed, but it came in the early hours of the morning.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hey, isn&#8217;t 『Goodnight』 past six in the morning a bit odd, Fujiwara-san? Hey, isn&#8217;t it a bit too harsh to treat me like this? Fu-min-san.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While sulking, I looked around and in the end, there were six of us who got stuck with the supplementary lessons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More accurately, it&#8217;s five people plus one. This plus one is Kasuya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the teacher&#8217;s explanation, Kasuya&#8217;s suspension has been lifted at the end of the semester. It seems he can avoid repeating a year by taking makeup exams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, good for him. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clap, clap.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Well, I have no intention of forgiving the guy who did that to Fu-min, so I won&#8217;t talk to him and won&#8217;t even make eye contact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think he&#8217;s aware that he&#8217;s being avoided too. He never talks to me and only converses with Hiratsuka-kun in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since everyone knows about the interactions between those two, who are both rejected guys, the unbearable tension was palpable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after the quiz is over, it&#8217;s break time. Returning from the restroom after eliminating an excess of water due to the heat, I peek into the classroom through the door&#8217;s crack and spot a girl looking inside stealthily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The colour of the ribbon I caught a glimpse of indicates she&#8217;s a first-year student. I wonder if a fan has come to see Kasuya. But upon closer inspection, it turns out to be someone very familiar.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I narrow my eyes slightly, and she trembles even more.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmm, the medication might be affecting her a bit too much…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ryoryo, there&#8217;s not much to do in the dorm, so I thought I might have a chance to see Kijima-senpai…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Please don&#8217;t be mad&#8230; please forgive me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fukuda&#8217;s eyes are filled with tears as she strikes a prayer-like pose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you speak honestly, I won&#8217;t be angry, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nhii!? N-No, it&#8217;s not like that! I-I&#8217;m not thinking of confessing or anything grand like that! There&#8217;s no way for me to come between the perfect couple that is Fujiwara-senpai and Kijima-senpai! I-I just wanted to catch a glimpse of senpai for a little eye candy…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Piiii!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grab her shoulder without thinking, and she looks as if the world is about to end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had misunderstood Fukuda-chi. I didn&#8217;t realise you were such a good kid…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Uh&#8230; are you perhaps waiting for me to retort?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about? Just that we stick together and can&#8217;t be separated?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;You&#8217;re absolutely right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There seemed to be a slightly puzzling moment but perhaps I felt a bit of jealousy, even if just a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, wanting to catch a glimpse of Fu-min for some eye candy, ahaha! Fukuda-chi, you&#8217;ve got good taste. Un, I&#8217;m starting to feel like we could get along well!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as we arrived, the senior maid showed us to the room assigned to us and I immediately started unpacking our belongings without taking a break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, we only had three trunks&#8217; worth of luggage between the two of us, so moving wasn&#8217;t much of a hassle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it&#8217;s been a month since we applied to terminate our apartment lease, Masataka-sama took care of all the arrangements. We can only express our gratitude for his kindness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Kurosawa-san was convinced that Akira Mitsuki was undoubtedly the president&#8217;s lover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had thought that capturing their intimate moments on camera could be useful in various ways but unfortunately, that didn&#8217;t pan out. Apparently, the two of them returned to the agency after their liaison and then went home separately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it wasn&#8217;t a complete loss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a conversation inside a car on the way back to the agency. Right now, Lili is reenacting it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, even though I didn&#8217;t say a word, it seems that Hikari Kiriya was also in the front passenger seat, so it&#8217;s safe to assume he&#8217;s involved too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I&#8217;m surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not because of the content of the conversation. It was just so exactly as Kanaya described it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It just goes to show that they engage in such devious activities so casually in their daily lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember the day I first talked to Kanaya-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was two days after rescuing Kurosawa-san from a ship bound for Southeast Asia and it was the day after I stormed the yakuza office and got detained by the police.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the women we rescued alongside Kurosawa-san, there was one who chose to stay in the 『room』, Kanaya Chihiro.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was in her mid-twenties. Long black hair, sharp features. An outstanding figure with long limbs. Her initial impression was that of a capable career woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that impression changed to that of a mentally unstable person about two seconds later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s about the time when I noticed faint pink lines resembling self-harm scars on her wrists, peeking out from the cuffs of her white blouse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She entered the room with Lili, her graceful appearance tainted with undeniable anger and pleaded with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..I have a favour to ask.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her subsequent story was truly shocking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened two years ago. Despite being a late bloomer at the age of twenty-three, she was starting to gain popularity as a gravure model and talent. A tempting offer came her way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a recruitment from a major agency. The president himself visited her, showering her with flowery words and presenting irresistibly lucrative terms that left her salivating.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-103134 lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/p153-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" srcset="/app/uploads/2023/08/p153-698x1024.jpg 698w, /app/uploads/2023/08/p153-204x300.jpg 204w, /app/uploads/2023/08/p153-102x150.jpg 102w, /app/uploads/2023/08/p153-768x1127.jpg 768w, /app/uploads/2023/08/p153-1046x1536.jpg 1046w, /app/uploads/2023/08/p153.jpg 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, she eagerly jumped at the opportunity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s no way she wouldn&#8217;t be thrilled to be valued highly. Besides, she knew that compared to the younger models around her, her time as a model was limited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;everything the president said was a lie. None of it came true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The story the president told her was about future plans and prospects, not a contractual agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, she herself was tightly bound by the contract.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The jobs that came her way were all gravitating towards risqué adult video shoots. Her exposure level kept increasing. Still, she endured, convincing herself that it was only temporary and silently completing her tasks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But one day, she heard a certain rumour about herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Kanaya Chihiro is nothing but selfish. She only picks and chooses jobs and avoids gravure work. Akira Mitsuki diligently fills in the gaps left by her.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She couldn&#8217;t believe it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been quite a while since she had received any decent mainstream magazine gravure work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And on that same day, she personally appealed to the president.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wanted to leave the agency as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was not possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He told her thatshe had invested one hundred million yen and she was expected to repay it in full.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, the contract did mention a penalty for early termination in the middle of the contract.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she didn&#8217;t have that kind of money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『However, I&#8217;m not a heartless person. If you can finish five more jobs, I might consider releasing you from the contract』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The president said condescendingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The following week, she was taken to a pornographic film shoot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time she realised and tried to escape, the filming had already begun.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a brutal gang rape scene involving a reluctant girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The promotional tagline upon release was 『Realistic Acting』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that&#8217;s exactly what it was. Not acting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After returning to her apartment, battered and torn, she impulsively attempted suicide but was unsuccessful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who comforted her in such times was her junior model, Hikami Kirito.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He would console her gently, and in return, she repeatedly surrendered her body to him. They promised to get married. Kanaya became more and more dependent on him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Just four more AV shoots and I&#8217;ll be free.』”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She accepted ridiculous stage names like 『Ai☆Mami』 with a tearful heart and ahegao expressions while making peace signs, believing that she would be happy with him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She went on to film two more AVs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she couldn&#8217;t endure it any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, on the night she confided in Kanaya Chihiro that she was thinking of going to the police, she was abducted on the street and taken onto a ship bound for Southeast Asia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My impression after hearing her story was──a terrible story. I couldn&#8217;t think of it any other way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess I&#8217;m just waiting for her sarcastic retort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Lili&#8217;s expression. She was floating around near the ceiling, seemingly oblivious to the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I couldn&#8217;t quite grasp the intention. What did she want from me after telling me all of this?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230;what is it that you&#8217;re asking from me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon asking this, Kanaya-san widened her eyes, twisted her cheeks, and declared;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akira Mitsuki, President Kurashima, Hikami Kirito, and also Manager Yasunochi Kiyoka&#8230;I want you to bring them down to hell.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not a champion of justice, nor am I engaged in charity work. I rescued you all as a byproduct of helping Kurosawa-san. It was just a whim. There&#8217;s no obligation for me to fulfil such a request, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll make sure I get you something in return. If you need money, I&#8217;ll do as many AV shoots as needed, even sell my body. And if you want to sleep with me, you can do as you please. If you tell me to die, I&#8217;ll gladly die.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The moment you entered this room, I could do whatever I wanted with you, Kanaya-san. So, I have no reason to comply, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaya-san clenched her back teeth tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Lili, what do you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While feigning disinterest, I deliberately turned the conversation to Lili.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, I do feel sorry for her and would like to help her in some way but I can&#8217;t just go along with this devil&#8217;s intentions without understanding what she&#8217;s aiming for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it seems that stance was, indeed, the right one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili nodded with satisfaction and spoke:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for Lili, if she offered as a sacrifice and granted her wish, that would be the correct way for a devil to handle it, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not a devil.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufunn, let me share some insider info, Devi. I&#8217;ll tell you who Akira Mitsuki will be working with soon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s Kurosawa-chan, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s possible that Kurosawa-san might become the next victim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, that&#8217;s more than enough reason for me to get involved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I still can&#8217;t believe that Lili introduced me to Kanaya-san out of pure goodwill to help Kurosawa-san. There must be another reason behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili&#8230;it&#8217;s tiring to play this cat and mouse game. What&#8217;s your aim?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked that, Lili smiled and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, it&#8217;s not that big of a deal, Devi. I just thought that using an entertainment agency&#8230;might be a convenient stepping stone for what lies ahead, that&#8217;s all, Devi.”</span></p>
