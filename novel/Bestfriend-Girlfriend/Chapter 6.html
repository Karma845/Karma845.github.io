<h2>Chapter 6: A Peaceful Way to Fight the Guild</h2>

<p>My next target after obtaining Luna Maria is the warrior priestess Iria from the ‘Falcon Sword.’</p>
<p>However, it will take some time to make the necessary preparations. It’s natural for a relationship that has lasted for several years not to break overnight.</p>
<p>Well, I don’t think Lars will go crazy and want to bet Iria for a rematch.</p>
<p>On my part, I would like it if he did… but given Iria’s personality, she would refuse even if Lars asked. Therefore, I need to change Iria’s way of thinking.</p>
<p>So, what should I do in the meantime?</p>
<p>That’s decided. My other target for revenge is the adventurer’s guild.</p>
<p>However, even though I say revenge, should I cut down the guildmaster, Elgart? Should I have the receptionist, Liddell, fired? But I had no intention of resorting to such direct means.</p>
<p>I will seek revenge on the adventurer’s guild because they absolved Miroslav’s sins as if nothing happened.</p>
<p>I won’t let the guild make such foolish mistakes again—that’s the essence of revenge.</p>
<p>But the question is, even if Elgart and Liddell are removed, will their replacements make different decisions from their predecessors?</p>
<p>Will they judge the guilty party properly if a situation similar to the Lord of the Flies incident were to occur again? Will they listen carefully to the words of a ‘Parasite’?</p>
<p>The answer is “no.” It’s natural for people who belong to a guild to prioritize the guild’s benefits.</p>
<p>Especially for lower-level adventurers, they would all make the same decisions as Elgart.</p>
<p>In that sense, eliminating Elgart and Liddell won’t achieve my revenge. In that case, I have to make the organization known as the adventurer’s guild surrender.</p>
<p>No matter who becomes the guildmaster, they won’t dare to meddle with me again—they will be in that state.</p>
<p>This is probably the best retaliation against Elgart and Liddell. I wonder what they will think when they realize that everything they did for the sake of the guild led to its downfall. Imagining that, the corners of my mouth lifted.</p>
<p>Once my next plans are decided, the next step is concrete action. To make the guild surrender, I have to do two things simultaneously.</p>
<p>One is to raise my reputation. If my skills surpass those of the guild, it will be a problem for them in itself. The other is to lower the reputation of the adventurer’s guild. This is to decrease the guild’s ability to act.</p>
<p>To achieve these two things simultaneously, I will fight the guild in a peaceful but with imposing manner in the eyes of the world. The first step would be to take care of the requests that the guild cannot handle, also known as preserved requests.</p>
<p>As a expelled individual, I can’t receive requests from the guild, but now I have Luna Maria.</p>
<p>There is no rule in the guild that says “Slaves cannot be adventurers.” Nor is there one that says “Adventurers who become slaves will be immediately expelled.”</p>
<p>Even after becoming a slave, Luna Maria still belongs to the guild as an adventurer. I took her away from the ‘Falcon Sword,’ but not from the guild, so she will serve as an intermediary to receive requests. As I mentioned before, those will be preserved requests.</p>
<p>These are requests with lower rewards than the risk, reasonable rewards but with a long restriction period, or high rewards but with even greater risk. There are several reasons why they are preserved requests.</p>
<p>Clients also complain, “How long will you make me wait?” However, even if they ask an adventurer, they will only receive a negative response.</p>
<p>There are two main ways to clear these types of requests.</p>
<p>Let an adventurer who violated the rules handle it as a penalty, or have guild staff who have adventurer qualifications take care of it.</p>
<p>However, if it were a general city, this would be resolved, but this is Ishka, an adventure city.</p>
<p>The number of requests submitted every day is enormous, and inevitably, the number of preserved requests increases at an accelerated pace.</p>
<p>In that case, I will take care of those cases that they can’t handle. The clients who have been waiting will be delighted, and the guild will be pleased to see the problems disappearing. What a great solution!</p>
<p>Liddell and others might suspect and refuse Luna Maria’s orders for some reason, but if that happens, I’ll simply have to go to the client and deliver a secret message.</p>
<p>The guild hid the request aside, so we’re unableto accept the request. Something like that.</p>
<p>This way, the client will be furious, and the guild’s actions will significantly decline. And to avoid that, they have to accept Luna Maria’s taking the request.</p>
<p>Then, I will complete the request with the power of my soul equipment.</p>
<p>As I said before, I devised a “Peaceful Way to Fight the Guild (Introduction).”</p>
<p>I decided the steps for concrete plan, but the problem here was Seal Arusu—the treatment of the beast girl, my slave.</p>
<p>At the moment I dragged Lars into the duel, Seal’s role was over. If she wanted, I could release her from slavery and send her back home. I mean, I was going to do that.</p>
<p>Although I spent 30 gold coins to buy her, it’s not money I earned through hard work. I didn’t think it was a loss if I thought of the money simply disappearing.</p>
<p>meanwhile, even if she were to return home, she couldn’t pay the debt again and would have to be sold again.</p>





<p>There was no guarantee that the next master would be a better person than me. She lowered her head and said, “Please use me and don’t abandon me.”</p>
<p>“…From now on, I’ll strive to provide better nighttime service…”</p>
<p>Saying that, she blushed while stealing glances at Luna Maria, who was even more flushed than Seal. Well, she certainly made an effort. So much so that she would spend a night in the adjacent room for the first time in several days when she couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p>I’ll just say that Luna Maria’s soul was as fragrant and delicious as the finest wine. Although that’s an assumption, as I have never tasted the best wine.</p>
<p>Putting that aside, it’s strange to release someone from slavery when they don’t want it.</p>
<p>Regardless of the services, there is no need to worry about insufficient manpower in the future.</p>
<p>Above all, Seal’s sharp ears, eyes, and nose can be very useful in completing requests.</p>
<p>I postponed the plan to release Seal and changed the plan regarding her  use.</p>
<p>After that, I sent Luna Maria to the guild as planned and she withdrew from the ‘Falcon Sword.’ Then, I also told her to make a list of preserved requests.</p>
<p>Luna Maria is a sixth-class adventurer just like Lars, so she can take on missions as long as they aren’t too difficult.</p>
<p>In the list Luna Maria made, there was one request that caught my attention.</p>
<p>“…Subjugation of a griffin, huh?”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s a request to subdue a griffin that lives in Skim Mountain. According to the client, it seems the griffin killed their son and grandson…”</p>
<p>“It’s not a magical beast you come across casually. Weren’t there adventurers who wanted money?”</p>
<p>A griffin, also known as the king of birds, is a powerful magical beast with the head and wings of an eagle, and the body and claws of a lion. It lives at the highest places, out of reach of humans, and has a habit of hoarding gold in its nest.</p>
<p>There are stories of adventurers challenging a griffin in search of great fortunes.</p>
<p>“Yes. They want revenge for what happened to their family, but it’s a problem to face a griffin in a mountainous area. Also, unlike goblins and orcs, it’s not a monster that harms people for no reason. According to what I heard from the staff, the guild tried talking to veteran adventurers but instead they got rejected and accused as greedy fools because insufficient reward.</p>
<p>“So, that’s why it’s a preserved request. And the reward… it’s not low, but it doesn’t seem sufficient to face a griffin.”</p>
<p>If you think about fighting a griffin, you have to be prepared for climbing. So, this reward isn’t very promising.</p>
<p>Now I understand why no one accepted. For that reason, it’s suitable as my first job.</p>
<p>“An adventurer who doesn’t care so much about profits but does care about the client’s feelings… that sounds very appealing.”</p>
<p>“Do you intend to accept it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Fortunately, there is a way to get around.”</p>
<p>At this moment, what appeared in my mind was the appearance of a wyvern with shiny indigo scales.</p>
<p>The wyvern that recovered from poisoning thanks to the Jiraiya Oaks fruit has settled on the cliff where the Lord of the Flies’s nest is located. Apparently, it thinks that place is my home and is acting as a guardian.</p>
<p>I think it’s as gratitude for helping the wyvern. Every time it looks at me, it jumps happily. It’s possible that it misses me.</p>
<p>I even wondered how an Indigo Wyvern became so submissive when a dragon knight has a lot of trouble achieving that, so I tilted my head in doubt, and the wyvern said, “Pui?” and did the same as me, so the truth remains in the dark.</p>
<p>One possibility that comes to mind is that wyverns are said to be relatives of dragons. That Indigo Wyvern might have sensed the presence of a dragon in me and might be submitting to that.</p>
<p>In fact, it didn’t go against my orders. When I commanded it to be ridden and then to fly, it did so instantly.</p>
<p>However, it seemed to have a hard time flying due to the baggage on its back that it wasn’t accustomed to, so it wobbled from side to side, and we ended up crashing into the forest.</p>
<p>If you think about it, there’s no way a wild wyvern would know how to fly with a rider. I apologized to the Indigo Wyvern, embarrassed by my shallow thoughts.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the wyvern (?) itself seems to be ashamed of that failure, and since then, every time it looks at me, it has eyes that say, “Do you want to ride?” It moves its wings widely, surely meaning that it’s very motivated. Apparently, it wants a chance to regain its honor.</p>
<p>I was just thinking of trying again with a saddle. The trip to Skim Mountain will be a good opportunity to get used to handling the wyvern.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, in this country, those who ride wyverns are called dragon knights and are respected.</p>
<p>If I can ride the Indigo Wyvern, maybe I can become a dragon knight. This could have been the only way to raise my reputation.</p>
<p>Well, it wouldn’t be strange if the wyvern is no longer there when I return to the Lord of the Flies’s nest, and if that happens, I’ll have to use my energy to force the climb.</p>
<p>In any case, Seal and Luna Maria can’t accompany me on this request. They will take on another request.</p>
<p>“I’ll be away for a while. Complete the requests on the list properly. Also, Luna Maria, I want you to be an adventurer guide for Seal.”</p>
<p>“Understood, master.”</p>
<p>“I-I’ll do my best too! Please take care, master!”</p>
<p>Being seen off by two beauties with slave collars, I left the room.</p>
<p>After giving a silver coin as a tip to the inn’s daughter today as well, I pondered as I walked down the street.</p>
<p>Well, I wonder where I can get a saddle and reins used by dragon knights.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“…It’s strange. Really strange.”</p>
<p>At the guild reception counter where the sun was setting. In a corner, Liddell muttered with a furrowed brow. Of course, it’s a face she can’t show to adventurers or colleagues. Liddell was very concerned that such an expression appeared unconsciously.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was someone who cheerfully spoke to Liddell.</p>
<p>“Senpai! I’ve prepared some tea, here you go— What’s wrong? You have a face like you found a dead cockroach after moving the furniture.”</p>
<p>“…Please don’t make those kinds of remarks. Especially when serving food or drinks.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see, you’re from the city, right, senpai? In the countryside, something like an insect is the most normal thing, so I don’t mind it much.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. I don’t want to know anything about it. By the way, Parfait, what happened with the Werewolf case on the Atend Path?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, I just received confirmation. It’s completed! Also, the griffin in Skim Mountain, the Banshee in the communal cemetery, the Scylla in Lake Toya. And today was the Werewolf on the Atend Path! All the worries that were a headache have been completed one after another. In fact, I just received a compliment from the guildmaster. Yay!”</p>
<p>Liddell was a bit irritated to see her kouhai making a V sign with her hand. However, she thought it was inevitable.</p>
<p>The achievement of completing the troublesome preserved requests, of course, belongs to the adventurer. But at the same time, the value of the receptionist who assigned the adventurer for that also rises.</p>
<p>One of the important skills for a receptionist is “Letting adventurers handle problematic requests.”</p>
<p>And it happened four times in a row. That was already significant, and over 20 preserved requests have been completed in a short time, including detailed requests. It was natural for Parfait to be in a good mood.</p>
<p>Beautiful receptionists are the stars of the adventurer’s guild, but their work is not easy. Even if a mistake is made, when an adventurer goes to fulfill a chosen request, they will be rewarded when it is completed—but it wouldn’t always be that way.</p>
<p>The role of the receptionists is to determine if the request submitted by the client is feasible or not and ensure an appropriate reward.</p>
<p>Requests cannot be accepted without money. For example, a farmer who asks for help with tears in their eyes because their family was kidnapped by goblins, but their request is denied due to the small amount of money they offer—as a receptionist, one has that experience.</p>
<p>Speaking of newcomers who choose requests that don’t match their abilities, they are sometimes scolded or even hated.</p>
<p>Also, of veterans with great pride who are asked to accept problematic agreements.</p>
<p>And even a group of rookies annihilated because they thought the request wasn’t dangerous.</p>
<p>Adventurers have sometimes blamed the guild severely for losing comrades due to incorrect information.</p>
<p>Because of that, no matter how good one is, a delicate person will soon quit. Or maybe they will request a transfer.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the work of the receptionists is tough, and it cannot be done unless one has enough spirit.</p>
<p>In that sense, Liddell, who has been at the reception for over five years, as well as Parfait, who has been present for a year, were women with great spirit.</p>
<p>Parfait regards Liddell as her senpai but has secretly been aiming for her title as a manager for a long time.</p>
<p>The usual Liddell would bitterly say, “That audacity will last for a while,” but she couldn’t say it in the current situation.</p>
<p>Liddell could sense those who were in the shadow of Parfait’s reputation, and it could be said that those people didn’t like her.</p>
<p>“So, what request was entrusted to Luna Maria-san next?”</p>
<p>“Listen to this, senpai! She has been taking on many difficult jobs with little profit, right? So, I presented her with a request from a noble. You know, the Count’s household heard about the griffin subjugation and asked to have it.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the one the master said we should give priority to, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I entrusted it as he said, but you won’t believe it. She rejected that promising request to have connections with the count!”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>“I was surprised. And speaking of what she accepted, there was a request from an orphanage a while ago, right? The one to find Aldo herbs in the Tittis Forest. She accepted that instead.”</p>
<p>The reward for collecting Aldo herbs is five copper coins. It’s an amount that would disappear just by buying bread and milk. It was more of a volunteer job than a request.</p>
<p>Usually, this kind of request should be played out at the reception stage, but as a special case, requests from orphanages and rescue houses are not rejected.</p>
<p>They are posted on the bulletin board in anticipation of adventurers’ goodwill. And occasionally, some adventurers take care of it when they have time.</p>
<p>Aldo herbs are medicinal herbs that work against fever. Probably, a disease spread in the orphanage.</p>
<p>However, Aldo herbs grow deep in Tittis. It’s a place one wouldn’t go to as a volunteer unless it’s deep like that.</p>
<p>Of course, that point should have been explained properly when accepting the request.</p>
<p>However, the requester may have had only one hope that someone would accept the request. As a result, that hope is likely to come true.</p>





<p>Then, Parfait bowed her head and looked doubtful.</p>
<p>“Luna Maria-san has become more active since leaving ‘Falcon Sword.’ In her previous group, it was as if she just followed Lars-san and the others with a smile, but now she’s moving on her own… no, I think it’s actually ‘Parasite’-san who’s really active.”</p>
<p>‘Falcon Sword’ was famous as a young and promising group. One of them, who enters and leaves the guild with a slave collar around her neck, stands out a lot. The circumstances of ‘Falcon Sword’ were already known by many guild officials.</p>
<p>Even a child understands that Sora the ‘Master’ is behind the current Luna Maria.</p>
<p>Liddell opened her mouth with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>“Luna Maria-san and the girl called Seal haven’t moved much from Ishka. In that case, the griffin subjugation and the others are the work of Sora-san. It’s not something a level ‘1’ can do. No, in the first place, there’s no way a level ‘1’ person can defeat Lars-san in a one-on-one fight.”</p>
<p>An adventurer of the lowest class who seems to have a talent limit—no, why did a former adventurer suddenly become so strong?</p>
<p>Liddell had doubts about that, but Parfait, who was not interested in Sora at all, had come to a completely different point.</p>
<p>“Ah, about that. I also want to see it. I mean, I’m in charge of ‘Falcon Sword,’ so they should have called me instead of you, senpai.”</p>
<p>“I was there as the reception supervisor. Anyway, Luna Maria-san and the others’ behavior is strange. If possible, we shouldn’t give them too many requests, but…”</p>
<p>Parfait laughed at Liddell’s concerns.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you should worry so much. The requests that no one wanted to accept are being completed. Shouldn’t we be thankful? Maybe ‘Parasite’-san is desperate to return to the guild.”</p>
<p>“When the master was going to welcome him as a ninth-class adventurer, he declined. I don’t think he wants to return to the guild at this point.”</p>
<p>“He may have been carried away by his emotions and declined, but perhaps they regretted it. He surely can’t say they want to return to the guild after what Falcon Sword. That’s why he’s trying to show his usefulness through Luna Maria-san. If you think about it, isn’t that kind of cute?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t think he’s that simple of a person.”</p>
<p>Liddell said it in a negative tone, but looking at Parfait, it was clear she wasn’t going to listen to her words.</p>
<p>In Parfait’s case, the “Falcon Sword” group she was in charge of, which was also a powerful way to elevate her reputation, was inactive.</p>
<p>Surely she must think that as long as Luna Maria and Sora elevate her reputation instead of the “Falcon Sword” group, it doesn’t matter what they do. That way of thinking isn’t wrong.</p>
<p>Rather, it’s the right approach. The requests given to Luna Maria are all that the guild needs to fulfill. That action is beneficial for the guild, the client, and the city of Ishka.</p>
<p>Liddell was trying to accuse those actions without any solid evidence.</p>
<p>“If you’re an adventurer or a member of this guild, you should remember that you have an obligation to work for Ishka.”</p>
<p>More than two months ago, she remembered the words she said to Sora when he was sentenced to be expelled.</p>
<p>Now Sora was the one working for Ishka, and Liddell was trying to undermine that with her suspicions. The roles had clearly been reversed. There was no way she was was the main cause of this situation… but Liddell unconsciously bit her lip.</p>
<p>The expelled adventurer took care of the griffin, defeated the Banshee, and subdued the Werewolf.</p>
<p>It was as if he were saying, “You made a mistake by expelling me.” Sora’s actions seemed to mock the guild in some way.</p>
<p>It’s also said that Sora, who stayed at the Blue Bird Inn, gives a large amount of tips to the innkeeper’s daughter every day.</p>
<p>“Next time you come, make sure to have enough money to leave a tip.” It was clear that the innkeeper’s daughter said those words to him when he was expelled. It makes sense to think that he’s doing the same for the guild.</p>
<p>But Liddell was convinced that it wasn’t just that. Despite the various circumstances, a person who had enslaved his former companion and beaten the group couldn’t be satisfied with just that.</p>
<p>Liddell’s thoughts would soon become reality.<br />
——————————————————————</p>
<p>One day, Luna Maria submitted a notice of withdrawal from the guild and officially abandoned her status as a sixth-class adventurer.</p>
<p>At the same time as her withdrawal, several clients withdrew their requests from the adventurer’s guild.</p>
<p>It was better to entrust them to someone other than the guild, as their requests made no progress no matter how long they waited.</p>
<p>that someone were a group of adventurers who didn’t belong to the guild.</p>
<p>A new clan led by the one who defeated the griffin, stopped the Scylla, and subdued the Werewolf.</p>
<p>Their name is “Bloody Sword.”</p>
<p>A clan is a group of independent free adventurers outside the guild. In exchange for not being able to benefit from the guild, they have no restrictions from the guild.</p>
<p>They’re not bound by guild fees or commissions. It’s troublesome to handle everything on their own, from receiving orders to obtaining rewards, but if successful, they can receive much greater rewards than when they were in the guild. It’s not uncommon for a well-known group to create a clan and leave the guild.</p>
<p>There is evidence that there are clans easily reaching triple digits when looking only at the city of Ishka.</p>
<p>However, about half—or rather, around 70%—are kept waiting like open stores, hoping for customers.</p>
<p>The remaining 20% have become a “Catch-all Store,” barely earning a daily living, and some engage in criminal activities. In fact, less than 10% maintain their clan functions as adventurers.</p>
<p>The adventurer’s guild, which can operate on a continental scale across borders, has an overwhelming number of human resources and a wide range of information.</p>
<p>The accumulated history and the trust built are not the same as those of emerging countries. Adventurers who dont fight under the guild’s umbrella usually can’t do much.</p>
<p>It’s not uncommon for adventurers who created a clan while loudly accusing the guild of their lack of profits to return to the guild within a year.</p>
<p>By the way, regarding the “Peaceful Way of Dealing with the Guild (Introduction)” that I devised, the goal was to fulfill the neglected requests that the guild had set aside, so that everyone would doubt their capabilities.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not the end. If it were the end, I wouldn’t have put “introduction.” If there’s an “introduction,” there’s an “interlude” and a “climax.”</p>
<p>The clients I obtained from the guild were few. Moreover, the guild surely determined that “those who withdrew are clients with neglected requests, so it’s not a big problem.” For the guild, it’s not something that particularly affects them; in fact, they would be grateful for it.</p>
<p>But no matter how small, there are those who have chosen my clan, “Bloody Sword,” over the guild.</p>
<p>This fact is important. Changing “0” to “1” and “1” to “2” has completely different meanings even if “increasing by one” is the same.</p>
<p>As with anything, it’s difficult to rise. Once you rise, the effort to run is not significant. Besides, I had some ways to increase “1” to “2.” One of them is…</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>The road that connects the Tittis Forest with the city of Ishka has been passed over  into perfection many years by adventurers and hunters traveling between the forest and the city.</p>
<p>Even I could walk the road with my eyes closed. At this moment, I was walking on that road from a different perspective.</p>
<p>The height of my vision is more than twice the usual. Strong vibrations shake my body, and my view trembles constantly.</p>
<p>For a while now, those who pass by unconsciously open their eyes and mouth as they look this way. Fufufu, I’m attracting attention.</p>
<p>That’s natural. It’s not very common to see a Wyvern walking on the road with a human on its back. Everything was going according to plan… but there was an unexpected factor.</p>
<p>“Ugh… this shakes a lot…”</p>
<p>“M-Master… um… I feel a little sick…”</p>
<p>As she spoke while sitting in the saddle, Seal, who clung to my waist, murmured something similar.</p>
<p>I put her up there because it seemed like she wanted to, but it looks like it wasn’t necessary.</p>
<p>Then Luna Maria, who had been walking on the ground from the beginning, spoke up with a clear face.</p>
<p>“Wyverns are a species specialized in flying. Walking on the ground would be a weak point.”</p>
<p>“I know that… but it would be my debut as a dragon knight. It would be better if they saw me riding with the saddle… Oww!”</p>
<p>“Are you… are you okay, Master? Oww!”</p>
<p>Both of us accidentally bit our tongues due to the commotion. Luna Maria narrowed her eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to see you two getting along.”</p>
<p>“Ah, should we fly closer? But if we get too close, we’ll be shot down by ballistae and catapults on the wall…”</p>
<p>Approaching carelessly with a Wyvern would make them mistake us for being attacked by a magical beast from Tittis and intercept us.</p>
<p>Because of that, we kept a certain distance from Ishka’s gate and are walking like this, but…</p>
<p>“Well, when we went to Mount Skim and Lake Toya, we were basically flying. So it’s uncomfortable to walk like this.”</p>
<p>As I murmured unintentionally, the Wyvern made a sound like “Pugy…” as if apologizing.</p>
<p>Ah, darn it. This little guy is more delicate than he looks.</p>
<p>“No, no, you can keep improving in the future! The way you fly is much better than before!”</p>
<p>“Pui?”</p>
<p>The Wyvern’s neck turned towards me as if to say, “Really?” Yes, really. So have more confidence.</p>
<p>Ah, but it’s better not to breathe fire in too much joy. If you hit the walls that can be seen in the distance, it would be very bad.</p>
<p>While the Wyvern was both delighted and calmed down, Seal laughed cheerfully.</p>
<p>“After all, this Wyvern can understand the Master’s words. I wonder why it doesn’t react to my words.”</p>
<p>“Maybe there’s a certain hierarchy. First would be me, and second would be him.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. So he treats me as lower rank than him. Like, ‘Newcomers should stay quiet’ or something?”</p>
<p>Seal nodded as if convinced, and Luna Maria added a few words.</p>
<p>“Wyverns only recognize humans as food unless they’re familiar with them. I guess he doesn’t understand anyone other than the Master.”</p>
<p>“In that case, would Seal’s words be like a mosquito buzzing in his ear?”</p>
<p>“T-That’s very cruel. But sometimes I feel like he’s looking at me with a dangerous gaze…”</p>
<p>Seal’s body trembled, and she tightened her arms around my waist.</p>
<p>She may have imagined herself being crushed by the Wyvern’s tail, which is thick like a trunk. Feeling a strongly elastic sensation pressed against my back made my cheeks naturally loosen.</p>
<p>No, wait. It’s not time for that yet. I have to be careful. With that in mind, I remembered the nocturnal events. Not in an erotic kinds, but in the way of devouring souls.</p>
<p>My current level is “7”. It increased when I defeated the griffin.</p>
<p>But then it came to a refreshing stop. The Scylla and the Werewolf were quite good, and I’ve been devouring Luna Maria’s soul every day, but the next level is farther away than ever.</p>





<p>If I were a normal adventurer, I should be level “20” with the amount of souls I’m devouring.</p>
<p>At first, filling a cup of soul would raise my level. The next amount of souls required was a full bucket. The next was a barrel… and the game continued that way.</p>
<p>After all, Luna Maria alone is not enough at night. Seal hasn’t caused me any harm, so she’s not a target for devouring her soul.</p>
<p>It will probably take some time to prepare for obtaining Iria.</p>
<p>Contacting Miroslav in this situation could jeopardize my plans.</p>
<p>Recently, I’ve been wondering if I should devour Seal. But asking for the consent of a slave who has gave me the right to live and die is no different from coercion, so I can’t do it in the current situation.</p>
<p>For now, I have to settle for hunting monsters or magical beasts.</p>
<p>—And while I was thinking about that.</p>
<p>“H-Hey, stop right there!”</p>
<p>A faint warning voice hit my earlobe. Realizing it, we were surrounded by guards patrolling the city gate. It’s obvious, but they are clearly on alert with us. However, it’s probably because of the presence of the Indigo Wyvern.</p>
<p>They might be more concerned about our affiliations than the strength of the magical beast.</p>
<p>Dragon knights riding Wyverns are the heart of the Kingdom of Canaria.</p>
<p>Dragon-riding knights are influential people, and most of them belong to the aristocracy. Among them, tne the Captain should be the head of the duke’s family connected to the royal family.</p>
<p>No, was he the next head? Anyway, the dragon knights are an elite group.</p>
<p>The guards seem hesitant to draw their weapons when they see me on top of the Wyvern. They probably think I’m a dragon knight.</p>
<p>Some of the guards might recognize my face, but the power of the Indigo Wyvern seem to overpower the rider in front of them.</p>
<p>When they ordered us to stop, I pulled on the reins of the Wyvern and jumped to the ground, leaving Seal in the saddle.</p>
<p>Although it was quite high, I landed smoothly and faced the guards.</p>
<p>“I am Sora, the leader of the ‘Bloody Sword’ clan. I request permission to enter.”</p>
<p>“B-Before granting permission, what is that dragon? Are you a dragon knight?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all. Previously, this Wyvern was injured in the Tittis Forest. After helping it, it strangely became attached to me. So today, I brought it to register as my follower monster.”</p>
<p>“I-Is there no danger of it going out of control?”</p>
<p>“Do you think a Wyvern that is hostile to humans would let a person ride it? There won’t be any problems as long as anyone doesn’t resort to hostility. Well, just don’t point a spear at it.”</p>
<p>I said it loudly to the surrounding guards. It was amusing to see the strong guards tremble.</p>
<p>By the way, a follower monster is a monster that submits to a person. In some cases, follower monsters are trained with sweets or whips, and they can also be made obedient through magic.</p>
<p>There are times when there is quite a rigorous examination of follower monsters. I don’t know if the Indigo Wyvern will be recognized as my follower monster, but well, if it’s not recognized, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>Now that the Indigo Wyvern has been exposed to the public, my goal has already been achieved.</p>
<p>If taking clients away from the guild and creating a clan was the “Peaceful way to fight against the guild (Introduction),” then letting them know that the leader of that clan is a private sector dragon knight would be the “Peaceful way to fight against the guild (Intermediate).”</p>
<p>The presence of such a dragon knight will be known throughout Ishka in an instant, and then throughout the Kingdom of Canaria.</p>
<p>It will surely also be known that this dragon knight was expelled from the guild and started working with his own clan.</p>
<p>In that case, it will become known that the guild, or rather, the guild master, let this gem slip away.</p>
<p>—–In fact, my expulsion is lawful under the Guild rules, and at that time. I didn’t have any talent at that time, but surely now those who hear Elgart’s claim will think it as an excuse.</p>
<p>It’s possible that other guild masters from other cities will hold Elgart responsible.</p>
<p>A dragon knight who should have been secured by the guild was discarded with  guild master own hands. That would already be a big mistake.</p>
<p>The adventurers’ guild is not a charitable organization, so strength is everything. Being a dragon knight, the limitations of terrain such as forests and high mountains can be ignored. Furthermore, considering the distance covered by a Wyvern, important missions can be accomplished.</p>
<p>The Ishka adventurers’ guild missed out on that possibility. The more I act like a dragon knight, the more the guild’s stupidity in expelling me will be exposed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered the words that the receptionist named Liddell once told me.</p>
<p>“If you’re an adventurer or a staff member of this guild, you should keep in mind that you have an obligation to work for Ishka.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t agree more. I have already been expelled from the guild, but as someone who lives in Ishka, I fulfilled my duty.</p>
<p>Even if it didn’t benefit the guild, people didn’t care. Because we are also obligated to work for Ishka.</p>
<p>Due to my own presence and benefit, there is no way the guild can try to obstruct my actions.</p>
<p>There is no way they can do something so brazen.</p>
<p>—–Kuku, I let out a small laugh.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Early in the morning, Luna Maria left Ishka’s gates and headed towards a nearby forest. The scent of vegetation along the road wafted through the air.</p>
<p>The season has already changed from spring to early summer.</p>
<p>Although it was early in the morning, it was hot enough to make you sweat just standing still.</p>
<p>The summer season was uncomfortable… but Luna Maria wasn’t sweating just because of the heat.</p>
<p>As she walked along the road, Luna Maria gently placed her hand on her sage robe.</p>
<p>This purple-colored robe is proof that she is a graduate of the Sage Academy. It is armor that can only be worn by those who are qualified as sages, providing increased defense, greater resistance, and an increase in magical power.</p>
<p>The fabrics woven with mithril thread are resistant to heat and cold, designed to be worn in both summer and winter.</p>
<p>Years ago, a director of the academy criticized the conventional robe as “slack” and incorporated it as a fashion style.</p>
<p>Now, Luna Maria is wearing a winter coat that covers most of her skin.</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s hot. Very hot. If you were wondering why she’s wearing it, it’s because if she didn’t, her indecent outfit underneath the robe would be visible.</p>
<p>The silk outfit that Sora gave her on the day she became a slave had exposed shoulders and thighs, with minimal fabric covering her chest and waist. For a completely modest elf, it was like being naked.</p>
<p>If she wore a summer robe, it would boldly expose her shoulders, chest, and legs, so she had no choice but to go with the winter robe.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a fact that she was walking with an almost naked appearance. It’s embarrassing. She couldn’t help but feel that. Originally, Luna Maria is an elf and also a sage, so she often stood out.</p>
<p>After being an adventurer for five years, she should have gotten used to the strange looks, but after being forced to wear that outfit, a different kind of tension was added, and the gazes of others worried her more than ever.</p>
<p>And seeing that embarrassed Luna Maria, her master happily distorted his mouth. Just remembering that face made the sweat start pouring out of her body.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, Luna Maria reached a forest that was her destination. The place was not like Tittis where magical beasts roamed. Squirrels roamed the ground and birds sang in the treetops, making it a relaxing place for Luna Maria. So, she took off her robe and felt relieved.</p>
<p>At first, she was worried if someone might be watching, so she would never take off the robe outside, but recently, she started thinking that it would be fine as long as there was no one nearby.</p>
<p>Whether with that outfit or with the nocturnal act, Sora intentionally tries to embarrass Luna Maria.</p>
<p>By continuing with that kind of life for over a month, even a forest fairy would get used to it.</p>
<p>Sora, who shook off Luna Maria’s embarrassment, stole her lips after enjoying her reaction.</p>
<p>At that moment, she felt a sensation as if extracting a certain physical strength, magical power, or something else. Luna Maria wondered what it was. But she still hadn’t found the answer.</p>
<p>Remembering that sensation, Luna Maria’s body trembled unconsciously. As if frightened. Or as something alluring. It was a significant feeling.</p>
<p>A mysterious sweetness, similar to sexual pleasure. A powerful presence—that gave her a sense of security to her heart and soul.</p>
<p>Every time Sora enveloped Luna Maria in his arms, she was transported to that feeling. No matter what Sora did, she would accept it. That was her decision when she became a slave.</p>
<p>No, mere acceptance was not enough. Enduring it was not atonement. One must accept the actions of the other person and make them their own.</p>
<p>It was all for the master. That was Luna Maria’s thought as a slave.</p>
<p>…..That’s how it should be, but now she not only had that feeling of acceptance and endurance, there was also a part of her that enjoyed what she was given. Rather, there was even a sense of desiring it for herself—–</p>
<p>With that thought in mind, Luna Maria vigorously shook her head. Her golden hair fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>She became a slave for atonement. Despite being exposed to nocturnal acts, it shouldn’t be possible to experience sweet emotions in less than a month.</p>
<p>After taking a deep breath and calming herself, Luna Maria slightly bowed, jumped, and grabbed onto a branch of a nearby tree.</p>





<p>Today, Luna Maria and Seal were resting by Sora’s orders. In these days, he surely knew that the two of them had worked hard to raise the clan’s name.</p>
<p>So, Luna Maria came to this forest. There was something she wanted to make sure of.</p>
<p>This forest served as a training ground for her to keep her body in shape.</p>
<p>Luna Maria, being a sage, a spirit bearer, and a hunter, would come here when she had free time and run through the forest to maintain her physical abilities.</p>
<p>She used the branch as a foothold to propel herself. Shortly after, Luna Maria squinted her eyes sharply and kicked the branch. From branch to branch, from tree to tree. Sometimes she used the ivy as a pendulum and ran on the trees like a monkey. She moved through the forest relying solely on the strength of her body, without using magic or depending on spirits.</p>
<p>Even though it was called a forest, it was too narrow to compare with Tittis. Although she circled it in less than an hour, Luna Maria wasn’t even exhausted. That was exactly what she wanted to confirm.</p>
<p>No matter how light an elf may be, it would be impossible for them to run through the forest with all their might for almost an hour without being out of breath.</p>
<p>“As I thought, my physical strength has improved considerably. Not only physical strength, but also magic and my connection with the spirits.”</p>
<p>She had noticed it even in the city, but running through the forest made it even clearer. She could feel that the power of the spirits was stronger.</p>
<p>Perhaps if she were to use spiritual magic now, she would be able to unleash a greater power than before. A rapid increase in power. Naturally, she thought it was due to leveling up, but the number hadn’t changed.</p>
<p>Her strengths had increased dramatically. She had noticed it a month ago. In that case, the cause could already be considered to be Sora. Indeed, when she was with Sora, Luna Maria was full of energy in the morning and afternoon. Could it be said that she was always in good shape?</p>
<p>During the first few days, she thought it was a temporary shock due to a sudden change in the environment, but as it lasted three days, five days, and more than ten days, she could no longer say it was a “temporary shock.”</p>
<p>She could only think that there was a reason for it. And being a sage, Luna Maria had an idea about that reason.</p>
<p>“It is said that one cannot discard the materials of a dragon, but…..”</p>
<p>Scales for armor, blood for medicine, claws for weapons. Both the eyes and the bones, even a single strand of hair, were precious as materials.</p>
<p>That’s the dragon species. Unlike dragon subspecies like Wyverns that are born from eggs, true dragon species are said to have no egg stage.</p>
<p>A true dragon doesn’t have parents to begin with.</p>
<p>Like a lightning bolt. Like a tornado. Like an earthquake. Or like a volcanic eruption.</p>
<p>A phenomenon that is triggered when the conditions of the world are met.</p>
<p>A mythical disaster born in flesh and blood.</p>
<p>That’s a dragon.</p>
<p>Therefore, the body of a dragon is composed of a super dense mass of magic in the form of blood and flesh.</p>
<p>It is only natural that a piece of bone or even a strand of hair cannot be discarded.</p>
<p>Drinking that blood will cure any disease, and eating that flesh will rejuvenate the body—–such rumors are not entirely wrong.</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>What would happen if a dragon took the form of a person? Or if a person came into contact with a dragon.</p>
<p>What changes would occur in that person where a great power resides?</p>
<p>“I wish it were just my imagination, but…..”</p>
<p>But Luna Maria had to judge that it was unlikely. Rather, there was another example besides Luna Maria.</p>
<p>The beast girl called Seal.</p>
<p>Her strength had also visibly increased since Sora started calling her at night.</p>
<p>Luna Maria, who had been entrusted with Seal’s education, could clearly see the difference from Seal before being called by Sora.</p>
<p>It was possible that Seal herself had also realized it.</p>
<p>It would be terrible if it were known that Sora’s blood had the same value as a dragon. To avoid that situation—–</p>
<p>“I should speak my mind properly.”</p>
<p>Until now, Luna Maria had forbidden herself from asking about the dragon inside Sora.</p>
<p>She was a slave for atonement, not to uncover Sora’s secret. Besides, she also knew that Sora’s attitude would quickly harden and show his true colors.</p>
<p>However, if the symptoms appeared so clearly, it would be dishonest to remain silent. Regardless of how Sora judged or treated her properties, he should understand.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Luna Maria decided to talk to Sora when he returned. With her decision made, she lightly tapped her cheeks and jumped back onto the trees. In addition to that, she wanted to find out what her current physical strength limit was.</p>
<p>Tap, resonating with a small step, the figure of the elf disappeared into the forest.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>It seems that a two-horned Kijin has been found in the Tittis Forest—–that rumor began to spread on the day after Luna Maria was tense and had an physical anomaly. Luna Maria’s story was interesting in many ways, but I was drawn to the rumor of the Kijin.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, the horns on a Kijin’s forehead are extraordinarily rare materials. When I heard it was a two-horned Kijin, only one thing came to mind.</p>
<p>“They must be referring to Suzume…..”</p>
<p>I remembered the face of the two-horned girl captured by the Lord of the Flies. After that, I entered the forest several times but never saw Suzume again.</p>
<p>It’s a vast forest. Perhaps due to the lack of information about the Kijin up until now, Suzume’s home probably has a barrier to mislead others.</p>
<p>That day, it was a miracle that we met in the Lord of the Flies’s nest. We wouldn’t see each other again—that’s what I thought, but I didn’t expect to hear news of her in this way.</p>
<p>“Well, what should I do?”</p>
<p>The reason is the target. It was quite obvious what they would do to Suzume if they captured her.</p>
<p>She would surely be killed to have her horns broken, and even if she luckily survived, she would be used for others’ entertainment or perhaps put on display.</p>
<p>In the worst case, she could be used as a tool to have children—and the new child that would be born would have a horn on their forehead.</p>
<p>…..It’s an assumption that makes me sick, but I heard a similar story from Luna Maria before. And according to what she told me, it wasn’t about a Kijin, but an elf.</p>
<p>In the Kingdom of Canaria, or rather in the human world, there is no law to protect the Kijin, and in that sense, it’s even worse than the elves, who have protective laws.</p>
<p>No matter how cruel they are to Suzume, it won’t be considered a crime. If I want to protect Suzume from persecution, I have to rely on my own power.</p>
<p>As long as there is a super rare material called “Kijin horn,” those who seek Suzume will not give up.</p>
<p>She would be pursued for years, or even decades. And knowing all that, do I have any reason to protect Suzume?</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t. Moreover, helping a Kijin and fighting against other humans would mean losing the reputation of my clan that I have been building, and it would affect my plans. Thinking about that, helping Suzume was very detrimental.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Yes, there was a “however.” Abandoning the girl I took the trouble to save, how should I put it, leaves a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>It would be something like saving a girl from a goblin’s nest, only for her to be killed by bandits afterwards—who would be satisfied with such a thing?</p>
<p>Because I saved her, I want her to be happy, that wouldn’t be a strange story. At least, I don’t want to hear an unfortunate outcome. In that case…</p>
<p>“I don’t want my few good deeds to be in vain”</p>
<p>Remembering the satisfaction when I saved Suzume, I decided on my path.</p>
<p>Regarding the reputation of the clan—yes, it wouldn’t be about helping Suzume, but rather defeating those hostile individuals who want to take the “Kijin” away from me.</p>
<p>It’s not rare for adventurers to fight each other over monsters that drop valuable items, and sometimes it turns into battles.</p>
<p>Well, the reputation might decrease anyway, but if that happens, I just have to increase it.</p>
<p>And upon calmly thinking about it, those targeting Suzume, whom I am protecting, are my enemies.</p>
<p>Devouring the souls of enemies does not conflict with my oath. If there are women among the aggressors, the demand might increase. With that in mind, there was no option but to sit idly and watch Suzume’s crisis.</p>
<p>While thinking about such things, knock, knock, knock, the door was knocked three times.</p>
<p>Speaking of the door, the innkeeper’s voice answered me, saying there was a visitor. And upon hearing the name of the visitor, I furrowed my brow. It was an unexpected name.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, I suppose it hasn’t been that long, Sora-dono. I apologize for this unexpected visit.”</p>





<p>The one who exaggeratedly bowed before me was the sturdy slave trader, Fiodor. He is a member of the slave trade association who witnessed the duel between Lars and me.</p>
<p>After defeating Lars and making Luna Maria my slave, we haven’t had any particular contact… there’s no way a slave trader would come alone for nothing. There’s no doubt he has some ridiculous task.</p>
<p>That kind of alert can’t be shown on my face, but Fiodor narrowed his eyes even more. I think he was smiling.</p>
<p>“Actually, there is a request I would like Sora-dono—no, the “Bloody Sword” clan—to take care of”</p>
<p>“Does the association want to give a request to a newly formed clan?”</p>
<p>There should be other clans to ask. Saying that to him, Fiodor responded with a strange laugh, “Kokoko.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, it hasn’t been long since “Bloody Sword” was formed, but your name is spreading all over Ishka. The bearer of a black katana who rode a Wyvern, and has an elf and a beastman as subordinates. Defeating a Griffin for an old man seeking revenge for his son and grandson, eliminating a Banshee that screamed every night in a poor orphanage’s cemetery, revealing the identity of the Scylla who transformed into a human in Lake Toya, and rescuing a young man trapped by his innocence on the Atend Trail, cutting down the long-feared Werewolf”</p>
<p>“…I see you know a lot”</p>
<p>“Information is a weapon. I collect it daily. Furthermore, the information of a level “1” that overwhelmed a sixth-class adventurer”</p>
<p>Saying that, Fiodor laughed again, “Kokoko.” But when the slave trader quickly calmed down, he looked me in the eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sure Sora-dono is already aware of this. A Kijin has been discovered in the Tittis Forest”</p>
<p>“That’s right. According to what I heard, it “seems” they discovered a Kijin, but…”</p>
<p>“It’s true. The association has already seen it three times”</p>
<p>“They’ve already seen it? That means—”</p>
<p>“Exactly, we started moving before the rumors spread. It was right on the day of the duel between Sora-dono and Lars-dono. That day, an adventurer lost in the forest accidentally found a Kijin girl and came to us to sell the information”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, I began to remember. When Fiodor came to the guild to witness, he was out of breath saying, “There was a problem on the way out.” Is it because he obtained information about the Kijin?</p>
<p>If he has been following the Kijin since then, he probably has a lot of information. He may also have a rough idea of where she lives.</p>
<p>Then, Fiodor continued speaking as if he had read my mind.</p>
<p>“Of the three sightings, we discovered the escape route at that time, as well as the approximate location of the Kijin’s home. However, it is in the deep area. As you know, the depths of Tittis are the breeding grounds of monsters. More than once, hunters sent to capture a Kijin have become prey for the monsters. That’s why I’m asking for the help of Sora-dono, who can ride a dragon.”</p>
<p>“I see. By soaring through the sky, we can avoid troublesome monsters and go straight to the depths. In other words, is this request to capture the Kijin?”</p>
<p>“No, no, that’s not it. The location was only an approximation, and the area where the Kijin is supposed to live could still be very vast. I don’t expect Sora-dono to search all of that. What I would like to request is assistance in transporting our personnel and supplies. You will receive a generous reward for going back and forth between Ishka and Tittis many times. Or if you prefer, I can introduce you to a new slave. In fact, I recently obtained a very interesting slave.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to talk about that—”</p>
<p>I leaned forward, showing interest, and immersed myself in my thoughts.</p>
<p>According to the current story, the capture of Suzume is Fiodor’s intention, and consequently, the intention of the slave trading association.</p>
<p>That means if I try to protect Suzume, the biggest enemy would be the slaver in front of me.</p>
<p>I would like to reject the request if possible, but if I do that, Fiodor might think I have an interest in the Kijin.</p>
<p>In that case, he might do anything to harm me personally, but it would be problematic if Luna María and Seal become the targets.</p>
<p>The slave collars Luna María and Seal have are patented technology of the association, so they could deprive me of my rights as their master and take them away. And if I take countermeasures, it will eventually escalate into a major conflict.</p>
<p>If that happens, I won’t be able to afford to help Suzume, and it won’t prevent another force from capturing her while the association and I are fighting.</p>
<p>In short, I believe the slave trading association is at least more reliable than the adventurer’s guild. Even though I didn’t request it, I was genuinely grateful that Fiodor witnessed my duel with Lars</p>
<p>If possible, I don’t want to confront the association head-on. As Fiodor looked at me in that way, his already narrowed eyes narrowed even further.</p>
<p>“Hm? Is there any inconvenience?”</p>
<p>“Well… actually, I have accepted another request. If I don’t complete it, I won’t be able to accept the association’s request.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t lying. I am currently working on a request to collect Aldo herbs for the orphanage. Regarding this request, I received exactly the same request through the guild before.</p>
<p>I finished it on the same day, but apparently, a fever was spreading among the children, so the director of the orphanage sent the same request to “Bloody Sword”.</p>
<p>As usual, the reward is low, but I took it as something natural, with the motto “An adventurer who can support the client’s feelings without being affected by gains or losses.” The orphanage is the temple of Mother Earth.</p>
<p>I can’t deny a request from them, both to deepen our connection and to increase the reputation of the clan. This was just yesterday.</p>
<p>“Another request? If you don’t mind, could you tell me the details?”</p>
<p>I calmly replied to Fiodor’s curious gaze.</p>
<p>“The strict confidentiality of the client is the iron rule of an adventurer. You wouldn’t want them to speak so openly about your request, would you?”</p>
<p>“Ohh, my sincere apologies for that.”</p>
<p>Fiodor apologized profusely. In fact, he didn’t show any discomfort on his face—I would like to say that, but he probably already knows the status of this request. He himself said he collected information daily, after all.</p>
<p>Perhaps that question was to gauge me as an adventurer. From Fiodor’s expression, it seems that I barely passed the test.</p>
<p>However, the fact that I rejected the association’s request hasn’t changed, so I’ll have to follow up on that point.</p>
<p>“I will contact Fiodor-dono as soon as I complete my request. At that time, I will be happy to cooperate if my skills are still needed.”</p>
<p>“Ohh, I would appreciate that. Please inform the association when you finish your request and are available.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>
<p>After finishing my conversation with the slaver, I lowered my head with a serious expression, foreseeing the turbulence that lay ahead.</p>
