<h1>Chapter 8: Nevertheless, This Demon is Quite Enthusiastic</h1>

<h3>Crawling Malice</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exactly at 1:00 PM, I relied on the web map and visited the office of 『First Beauty Office』 in Roppongi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had temporarily parted ways with Kurosawa-san and we were scheduled to meet at a nearby hamburger shop at 3:00 PM.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s surprisingly small…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The office I arrived at is a four-story brick building located one street back from the main street.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It feels much more modest than I had imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering it&#8217;s a major company, I had envisioned something like a high-rise building so it&#8217;s a bit disappointing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I climbed about three steps and pushed the glass door to enter the entrance, where the reception was right in front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I informed the neat receptionist of my business and she said, [Please go up to the fourth floor] pointing towards the elevator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon reaching the fourth floor, a woman was waiting in front of the elevator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She appeared to be in her early thirties. She was wearing a tight skirt and a white blouse with an employee ID hanging around her neck. Her alluring black hair and a beauty mark on her face gave her a captivating and sexy aura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her appearance matched the characteristics of what Kanaya-san spoke about when I asked her about it. That person&#8217;s name is Yamauchi Kiyoka, the manager.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m almost certain it&#8217;s her. If what Kanaya-san said is true, she should also be the president&#8217;s mistress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must be Fumijima-san from Modero Planning. We&#8217;ve been expecting you. Please follow me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was led into the reception room, there was a set of luxurious leather sofas. Along the wall, a shelf extended up to waist height displaying trophies and shields ostentatiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please have a seat and wait.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes, um, thank you very much.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My slight stuttering wasn&#8217;t an act. I was genuinely bewildered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the reason is──</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Where should I sit? What&#8217;s the correct place?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was told to sit, I had no idea where I should sit among the sofa set.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I remember&#8230; I think I&#8217;ve heard that sitting closer to the door is the lower position…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In terms of status, I&#8217;m the one in the lower position. But I&#8217;m also a guest, so would it be more proper to sit in the higher position?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I have no clue&#8230; Well, for now, I&#8217;ll just try to be humble and play safe.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down where it seemed to be the lowest position and waited for the president to arrive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the reception room, only the ticking of the clock could be heard. There was no sign of tea being brought in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a considerable amount of time passed, maybe fifteen minutes or even half an hour, President Kurashima finally appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apologies for the wait.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He sat down heavily in front of me and without much of a greeting, he launched into conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t like beating around the bush. Let me get straight to the point. That MISUZU of yours! She&#8217;s a rare talent. I want to pull her into our agency!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa?! No, w-wait a minute, please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I decided to exaggerate my panic for effect. In response, the president leaned in with a faint smile on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll cover all the penalty fees for breaking the contract. Just think about it. Isn&#8217;t it a loss for the entire entertainment industry if a talent like her ends up buried in a small agency like yours?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s a very forceful man. I guess being a president requires this level of assertiveness. Still feeling flustered, I deliberately responded with a voice that seemed to fade away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I appreciate your words, President. But would it be too impolite to say that? Besides, it&#8217;s not something I can decide on my own&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The president then leaned back and with a nonchalant nod, replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, of course. That&#8217;s only natural. So, I want you to persuade MISUZU herself.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaaaa?! M-Me? Are you serious? Th-this can&#8217;t be a joke! Are you telling me to betray the company?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feigning a bit of anger and raising my voice, the president responded with a grin that seemed to say he had expected as much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not saying..it’s for free&#8230;.If you also transfer to our agency along with MISUZU, that&#8217;s fine. How much is your current annual salary? We would treat you as a department manager and bring you on board.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-As a department manager!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, indeed. I sense potential in you as well. I&#8217;m even considering entrusting you with a certain department in the future.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Uwaa&#8230;their tactics are so blatantly straightforward that it&#8217;s almost believable.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I deliberately stayed silent, President Kurashima leaned towards me again as if to emphasise his point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think? I believe it&#8217;s not a bad deal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa&#8230;Even so, MISUZU-san is coming to Tokyo next week.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not an issue. By then, make sure you persuade MISUZU on your end. The conditions we&#8217;ll offer her are outlined here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying so, the president handed me a sheet of A4 paper with bullet points typed in word processing.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A quick glance through it reveals a list of nearly ten economic conditions, including the signing bonus, which makes me think that I am at the height of the bubble economy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But.── it was anonymous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can give me your answer next week when she comes to Tokyo. Bring her here at that time and we&#8217;ll formalise the contract.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The president doesn&#8217;t seem to doubt me but it&#8217;s better if he underestimates me a bit more. Villains tend to feel more secure when dealing with greedy individuals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll work on convincing MISUZU-san. And also&#8230; could I get written assurance about my own conditions?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t you trust me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; It&#8217;s not about whether I trust you,President. It&#8217;s more about my own sense of self-worth”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon saying this, the president grinned mischievously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, I see. Fair enough. I&#8217;ll make arrangements.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then&#8230;I&#8217;ll do my best to bring MISUZU-san here next week.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well&#8230;that&#8217;s all for the matters. I&#8217;m a busy man as well. I&#8217;ll take my leave.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that declaration, the president left the reception room without even looking back.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘He&#8217;s quite a character..If he keeps up with these methods, even if I don&#8217;t do anything, it seems like I will eventually trip him up..’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“President, welcome back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Returning to the president&#8217;s office, Kiyoka smiled at me with a slight nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That man turned out to be even more of a small fry than I thought. He was quite easy to handle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wrinkled her nose as if she had just smelled something unpleasant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you really planning to hire someone like that? I mean, no matter how much of a trade it is, he&#8217;s really off-putting, seems smelly and doesn&#8217;t seem capable of work. Other than being young, there&#8217;s really nothing noteworthy about him…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, Kiyoka, you&#8217;re merciless. Well, that&#8217;s kind of like the cost we&#8217;re accounting for to bring MISUZU in.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;still, you really went all out by giving him the department manager treatment. I doubt anyone would follow him as a subordinate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not like we have to assign subordinates just because he&#8217;s given a department manager title. For now, I might even set up a new department for toilet cleaning. After the probation period, we can fire him on the grounds that the stains haven&#8217;t been removed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu&#8230; You&#8217;re such a wicked person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reaching out to her chest and giving it a squeeze, she quickly let desire fill her eyes and leaned towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a woman I had trained carefully since joining as a new employee and she had truly become the kind of woman I preferred.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get in, Hikari.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Coach Yolanda.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s club activities ended in the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gestured for Teruya Hikari to take the passenger seat, and we got into the used compact car I had bought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, she would be living with us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked and Hikari looked a bit troubled before saying the following.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It feels like walking on eggshells…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s unavoidable.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While no one outright rejected her to her face, the club members couldn&#8217;t hide their confusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari is the younger sister of Teruya Anna, who is considered to have kidnapped them. Given that connection, it&#8217;s only natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry about it. Your sister isn&#8217;t the culprit, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes&#8230; Well, that&#8217;s true, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The encounter with the maids last night was a significant lead for us to solve the major case at hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witnessing that mysterious space and getting a glimpse of the enemy&#8217;s abilities was crucial. With that understanding, we can strategize accordingly. The culprit is likely able to move using that space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, Claudia suspects the track and field club&#8217;s captain, Tashiro, vice-captain Shima and a first-year student named Moribe. We&#8217;ll monitor them closely and provoke reactions to gauge their involvement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we get closer to the core, the culprit should strike at us through that space.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for Tashiro and Shima, I intend to keep an eye on them personally, while I&#8217;ve entrusted Hikari with monitoring Moribe. That&#8217;s why I went through the trouble of converting her into a short-distance runner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way&#8230; is this alright?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;letting me be a coach for the track and field club.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It wasn&#8217;t exactly 『alright』 but&#8230;well, I managed somehow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the principal and vice-principal opposed the idea, but I managed to persuade them by emphasising that Hikari would be a coach hired with my personal funds and that it would only be for the limited duration of the summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above all, it was a significant help that her former homeroom teacher, Morioka, supported the idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Education isn&#8217;t about discarding the bad parts. If we were to discard the younger sister because of her sister&#8217;s crime, the students would stop believing in the teachers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was impressed by how wise his words were, despite his gorilla-like appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he weren&#8217;t a gorilla-like appearance, I might have developed a bit of a crush.</span></p>

<h3>Pushing Through With Outdated Jokes Could Be Considered Devilish, To Say The Least</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After thoroughly sobbing near Mako-san, I returned to the assigned room a little past six in the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I finished taking a shower, I went to bed right away. It was in the afternoon when I was awakened by the maid named cockroach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While having a meal, I told her, [I want to go to the shop by four o&#8217;clock today] She responded with a cold, [Feel free to do as you please].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takata-sama, starting today, please go to work on your own. Whether you slack off or decide to laze around, we won&#8217;t enforce anything, particularly from our side. If you have any requests, please ring this bell, and we will attend to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, she placed a small bell on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Requests&#8230;can you listen to my request &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It depends on the content.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gathered my courage and made a daring request.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to study. I would like something like a reference book. About customer service, and well&#8230;about 『gyaru』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I conveyed this, she bent her waist deeply and said the following;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood. By the time you return today, I will have selected a few for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I adjusted my appearance, it became four o&#8217;clock. I opened the entrance with my own hands and stepped into the locker room of the gals&#8217; bar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, it was a pastel pink swimsuit. I opened the locker room and took out a mini skirt, putting it on.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As I thought&#8230;it&#8217;s embarrassing. Why am I dressed like this…’</span></i></p>
<div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-16598521' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-16598521' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when I checked in the mirror, I still looked like nothing but a seductress. There&#8217;s no way not to feel embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on a foldable pipe chair and waited for a while. With a creaking sound, the door opened and Mako-san&#8217;s face peeked in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Taka-chi, good morning!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mako-san, it&#8217;s already evening though?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with a wry smile, she informed me that it&#8217;s okay to say 『good morning』 no matter the time for nighttime work. If 『good morning＝ it&#8217;s early, isn&#8217;t it?』 then it seemed to make sense in its own way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, after yesterday’s sobbing extensively, I ended up asking her to teach me about customer service.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s truly frustrating but there&#8217;s some truth in what that cockroach maid said. Criticising things I can&#8217;t do myself would only be a form of sour grapes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, if it&#8217;s been said that I&#8217;m disrupting the order, I can&#8217;t just stay silent.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I came to understand this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『It&#8217;s a different set of rules』 If my existing common sense and concepts were related to baseball, for example, the common sense here is soccer. To those playing soccer, I must have been angrily saying, 『Why aren&#8217;t you standing in the batter&#8217;s box!』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking this, the absurdity became so clear that I felt embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mako-san, please guide me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I bowed my head like that, she hesitated for a moment, her expression looking a bit puzzled and she smiled wryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay to just call me Mako, we&#8217;re friends.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised. Friends. We.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Mako-san proceeded to teach me about customer service step by step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, when a customer comes in, greet them energetically. Just a simple 『welcome』 is good, I think.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230; everyone says things like『hello』 or 『cheers.』&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ll get used to it. The kind of people who come to this place aren&#8217;t looking for formal customer service. They prefer easygoing conversations like with a female friend. But it&#8217;s still better to naturally say 『welcome』 than to force it and make it awkward.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, it&#8217;s important to start with the basics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, when a customer approaches, you take their drink order&#8230; Let&#8217;s see. You could try saying it like you would to a close guy friend or a boyfriend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boyfriend&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled my usual interactions with Kobayashi-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How would you like your drink&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of boyfriend are you dealing with!? Just say something like 『What are you gonna drink?』 or 『What&#8217;s your choice for a drink?』 That&#8217;s enough!”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there, with Mako-san&#8217;s guidance, I practised repeatedly, simulating interactions where customers entered and I greeted them with 『welcome』 and when they came to the counter, I asked, 『What are you gonna drink?』 like a practice swing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, the most important thing at a gals&#8217; bar is conversation. But even saying that, mostly it&#8217;s just about talking with people who want to talk. So, if you give them good nods and reactions, you&#8217;re good to go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-Good nods?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like saying [Oke-maru].&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Okemaru is a youth word used to mean [Understood!] It is a slang and is used in casual communication between friends]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oke-maru?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It means 『okay』 And for reactions, if you have 『that&#8217;s right』, 『I see』 and 『wow』 those three, you can pretty much keep the conversation going. Once you get used to it, if you slip in some gal language casually, the customers will appreciate it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mostly understood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Sore Na』 expresses agreement, 『AーNe』 shows understanding,and 『Yabai』 indicates surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, look at the person and have a casual chat with them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That sounds&#8230; somewhat challenging.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright then, I&#8217;ll be the customer, so let&#8217;s practise! Ready!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we practised for about twenty minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Mako-san had a face that resembled a member of an expedition team who had discovered an incredibly rare creature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Returning to the 『room』 Kurosawa-san and I started discussing strategies for conquering the talent agency with Lili in the dining room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the table was a photocopy of the treatment that Kurosawa-san had received from the president in case of her transfer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Kurosawa-san, [Well, it&#8217;s tempting. If they offer conditions like this].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Lili, are you really going to do that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked that, Lili nodded as if it were obvious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I&#8217;m not very enthusiastic about it. But Lili is brimming with confidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This time, it&#8217;s not brainwashing, it&#8217;s condemnation, Devi. We&#8217;re going to take what we can, confess their sins and socially destroy them. The goal is to execute them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwa&#8230; sounds intense, how are you going to do it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kurosawa-san asked with great interest, Lili proudly puffed up her chest even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FuFunn! Get ready to be surprised! This time, it&#8217;s the trending Death Game,Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Lili exclaimed loudly, a rather awkward atmosphere settled over the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a bewildered expression, Kurosawa-san finally spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;I think Death Game is&#8230;&#8230;out of season.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, that can&#8217;t be, Devi. There are many death game manga released every month, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those are just riding on inertia. Apparently, they don&#8217;t sell that well even if they&#8217;re released, right? There aren&#8217;t that many patterns, in reality.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha!? That&#8217;s a statement that would seriously antagonise a part of the publishing industry, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Lili, who huffed and waved her arms, Kurosawa-san asked with a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;fine, but, how are you going to do it specifically?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, selecting participants, Devi. That&#8217;s already taken care of, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san and I are confirmed. Are there a few others?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Devi Devi. People with a certain level of acting skill are needed for the roles, Devi. From FumiFumi&#8217;s harem, we&#8217;ve chosen relatively sensible and adept individuals, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the mention of [sensible individuals] I instinctively tilted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I can&#8217;t think of any faces that come to mind. It feels like I don&#8217;t know anyone like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, FumiFumi and Kurosawa-chan are obvious choices, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since we&#8217;re like parties involved”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Plus, the AV girl,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Kanaya-san, she’s not playing the mastermind role, is she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just the fact that the AV girl is participating is enough to make that president and others nervous,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. If there&#8217;s someone who was supposed to be deceived and sold overseas, just their presence can be incredibly intimidating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, next is the role of the survivor from the previous death game. We&#8217;ll assign 『Buaiso』 to a character who speaks mysteriously for now,Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;that kind of character. Well, Shiratori-san definitely fits the bill”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, there&#8217;s the role of a cheerful black person like in Hollywood movies,『Nande ya nen』,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima-san, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then, for someone who seems harmless but is actually a serial killer&#8230; Oppai-chan,Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-chan!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This&#8230; feels kind of dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than being a mismatch, it&#8217;s more like a surprisingly perfect fit&#8230;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, does that mean Masaki-chan is the mastermind?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Kurosawa-san&#8217;s question, Lili vigorously shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not quite, Devi. It&#8217;s just the role of a serial killer who happened to get lost, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">一What kind of scenario is that?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then, the role of being killed two minutes into the start goes to Ryoko,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「That&#8217;s such a harsh treatment!」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san and I inadvertently harmonised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As always, Ryoko remains underappreciated. I genuinely thought that she might be born under an unlucky star.</span></p>

<h3>The Concept of Friendship</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished the closing tasks and returned to the locker room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The results of the popularity poll, I was still at the bottom today. I knew that it wouldn&#8217;t change much with half-hearted efforts but the difficulty is higher than I imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, today I didn&#8217;t upset anyone and even though it&#8217;s just two votes, customers cast their votes for me. I felt inexplicably happy about such a small thing, and it made me want to work harder tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s still the urgency to secure the first place quickly, and the frustration with this unfair situation hasn&#8217;t disappeared. However, somehow, I felt like I had taken a step forward and was looking ahead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t thank Mako-san enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only for giving me guidance on customer service, but also for immediately helping when my conversations get awkward during work and for teaching me how to prepare drinks carefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thanked her, she gave an uncomplicated smile and said,[We&#8217;re friends, so it&#8217;s only natural]. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised. Apparently, it&#8217;s natural if we&#8217;re friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s cast is the same as yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are a total of thirty-one cast members on the roster and they work in shifts. But today, by chance, it seems I&#8217;m with the same people as yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the early morning&#8217;s airy atmosphere, everyone is changing in the locker room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have nothing to change into myself but opening the entrance where people are present is prohibited. So, without anything to do, I sat on a pipe chair in a daze, waiting for the other girls to finish changing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their cheerful laughter and behaviour are no different from the way my school classmates used to make a racket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Taka-chi, what&#8217;s up? Aren&#8217;t you changing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, um, I&#8217;m taking a little break first…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who called out to me was Lena-san, who has been at the top of the popularity poll both yesterday and today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her about it, I found out she&#8217;s a law student at the prestigious university I aspire to attend. It was surprising to hear that she aims to become a judge in the future.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her why she&#8217;s doing a part-time job like this──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, I mean, I convinced my parents to let me go to university, so I don&#8217;t want to be a burden with money issues. The official reason is that I can talk to various people here and become more mature but honestly, it&#8217;s just for fun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if Japan&#8217;s legal field is okay. If judgments are made based on fun, it&#8217;s not going to end well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To me, she doesn&#8217;t particularly look beautiful or cute, but for some reason, there are many regulars who come for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I smiled politely, she approached me while still in her underwear and gazed at my face intently.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking I might have said something to upset her, I turned away and she suddenly laughed and spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, it&#8217;s a shame! You&#8217;re cute, but&#8230;you&#8217;ve tanned your skin so much and your hair colour is kind of faded, well, actually, it&#8217;s the opposite&#8230; With such a flashy appearance, if you don&#8217;t wear makeup, your face looks flat and your impression becomes weak.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F-Flat?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the other two and Mako-san also leaned in to peer at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ah, now that you mention it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, there was something that felt off.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was bewildered, the girls took out makeup tools from their bags one after another and started applying makeup to my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The key to gal makeup is definitely the eyes. With your skin tone being this intense, if you don&#8217;t do a pretty thorough makeup, it&#8217;ll look blurry. Use double eyelid tape and eyeliner to make your eyes look bigger&#8230; and maybe false eyelashes for a bit more oomph.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I&#8217;ve got a new pair, I bought them before coming here, I&#8217;ll give them to you~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s nice! And, the recent trend is to make the eyes slightly droopy and bring out some sweetness. For the eyebrows, well, ideally you&#8217;d match them to your hair colour, but for now, let&#8217;s just do it my way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A, well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaaah, Taka-chi, your skin is so nice. Normally, we&#8217;d build up the foundation a lot but the natural look seems good enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t know what to do. But&#8230;the girls were having fun and getting excited. I didn&#8217;t want to spoil the mood by rejecting them. Eventually&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, perfect☆”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, Taka-chi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Mako-san turned the full-length mirror towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the mirror, there was a gal. Moreover, she had the features of a foreigner with well-defined facial features&#8230; she was quite beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve got good material to work with, you know. If you do it properly, you&#8217;re really cute” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh damn, I&#8217;m falling for you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See, see, just like Lena thought!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did they do things like sending salt to an enemy? Is it that they don&#8217;t really care about the effort I put in?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don&#8217;t know how to do the makeup, just ask anytime. Lena&#8217;s working five days a week this month.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th-thank you…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thanked them while feeling confused, Lena-san smiled and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised. It seems like they consider me their friend too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After making a lot of noise for a while, they finished changing and left the locker room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you later! Taka-chi! See you tomorrow!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pondering such things, I looked at the table and saw a portable DVD player and several DVDs placed there.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s this?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that it wasn&#8217;t even a Blu-ray in this day and age seemed a bit stingy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, before my shift, I had asked the cockroach maid to [prepare something that could be useful as reference material]. It seems she decided to provide video materials.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, when it comes to learning about gals and customer service, videos do seem more fitting than books.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What is this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing the pile of DVDs, I involuntarily raised my voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Premium Black Gal Nanpa』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Connecting the Dots of Black Gals! Friends of Friends,Everyone Are All Sluts』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Lewd Black Gal Big Sister! The Enchanting Semen Squeezer』</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The titles on the DVDs were explicit and shocking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Black Gal Mother』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Black Gal Bitch Semen Squeezing Festival. Samba ☆Samba Until Morning』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Second Class Salesperson Exam Thorough Preparation DVD』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an adult video (AV). There was absolutely no room for misunderstanding, it was unmistakably AV.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well&#8230; the last one wasn&#8217;t an AV, but the 『Just as Takata Requested』 felt like the cockroach maid was saying that and it made me incredibly furious.</span></p>

<h3>Moribe Saori</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gaijin! You came again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gaijiーn, Gaijiーn.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ahaha”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the kids who cling and swarm around, I put on a polite smile for now. In my true feelings, I really want to punch them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially, the brat with a shaved head who casually comes and strokes my butt. My butt isn&#8217;t that cheap. I&#8217;ll send you a bill with interest after he become an adult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as soon as I saw Fumio and Saori entering the park, the annoying focus of the brats&#8217; antics shifted over to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumioー, you&#8217;re so sloooow! Stuーpid!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, shut up, shut up! I won&#8217;t give you the stamp!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, right! Even though you&#8217;re Fumio! I&#8217;ll tell this to your mother!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, okay, I got it, I got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dealing lightly with the clinging kids, Fumio gives me a slight nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s start. Saori-chan, please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un! Onii-chan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori presses the play button on the vintage cassette player placed on the bench.</span></p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-66365907' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-66365907' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distinct sound of tape threading in. Perhaps the tape is stretched, the first second of the sound warbles slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But somehow, the lively sound of a light-hearted piano in D major resounds and the radio callisthenics begin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter what attitude they just had, when the music starts, the kids diligently start their exercises. They manage to finish up to the second part of the radio callisthenics and Saori stops by pressing the stop button.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Watching the kids line up in front of Fumio to get their stamps, I walked over to Saori.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good job.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th-thank you. Claudia-san, um&#8230; you participated today as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I thought I should properly blend into the local community. I&#8217;m a bit of an outsider in various ways…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But on the inside, I&#8217;m solidly Japanese. Anyway, how&#8217;s it going? Is my big sister being tough?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230; Coach is&#8230; a little scary&#8230;I guess. And Teruya-senpai&#8230; has a loud voice too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, I see”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Saori really is like a small animal…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks down and lets out a fading voice and I can&#8217;t help but laugh at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After participating in radio callisthenics and talking to her yesterday and today, I still can&#8217;t see her as someone who sold her soul to the devil or anything like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the fact that my abilities don&#8217;t work on her, Saori is just a regular girl. A girl who is timid to a degree beyond the norm.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmm&#8230;Could it be that Fumio is the suspicious one after all?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve had Tachioka look into Saori, just in case but it might have been a waste of time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, whatever&#8230; It&#8217;s Tachioka anyway.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was pondering these thoughts, Fumio, who had finished stamping the kids, walked over to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Claudia-san. You&#8217;re up early again today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m actually a night owl, but I&#8217;m trying my best. My eyes are all watery even now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, so are you planning to go back and sleep after this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m definitely going to sleep a lot. Sleep, sleep, sleep.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a trivial exchange.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I&#8217;d like to quickly ask critical questions to get to the bottom of this and clarify things. But  right now, I can&#8217;t afford to expose myself and have my fangs bared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As detective high school girls, all we need is to identify the culprit and make it public. That would be enough for our names to be well known. Catching the criminal is the police&#8217;s job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the super strong maid I encountered last night has seen my face too. If Fumio or Saori were the culprits, it would make sense to be more cautious&#8230; but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Fumio and Saori seem really close. Could you be dating?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buha-!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an offhand remark but Saori reacted excessively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-We&#8217;re not dating! We&#8217;re not dating! We&#8217;re childhood friends! We&#8217;ve been close since childhood, so it&#8217;s natural! Right, Onii-chan?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her face turn bright red and her flustered gestures as she waved her hands, well&#8230; anyone could imagine her feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Well..Onii-san is cool and popular&#8230;Even I&#8230; um, if there&#8217;s a chance&#8230; I mean…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While glancing at Saori muttering to herself about the day after tomorrow, Fumio leaned in and whispered to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Claudia-san, you shouldn&#8217;t tease her&#8230; Saori is really a considerate girl and she can&#8217;t say no even if she doesn&#8217;t want to. If someone like me were to be said to be dating her, it would be quite troublesome.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s with this guy? He&#8217;s really annoying. Especially Fumio&#8217;s words and the fact that he seems to be telling the truth&#8230; it&#8217;s confusing.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Fumio, have you and Saori always been like this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, I can&#8217;t help but feel sorry for her.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not always&#8230;I&#8217;ve only started talking to Saori relatively recently. We used to go to school together in groups during elementary school but I don&#8217;t remember much about that time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Saori?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, there was a situation where I got help from Onii-chan and that&#8217;s how we started talking again. It was about a month ago…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230; that&#8217;s interesting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking back home after parting ways with the two of them, I tried to organise the story of the 『Disappearance Incident』 in my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I could access the police investigation information, I might have a clearer picture but for now, my sources of information are newspapers, magazines, the internet, Tachioka&#8217;s account and Hikari&#8217;s account combined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first person to go missing was a female student named Misuzu Kurosawa. She disappeared shortly after arriving at school and was found in front of the school thirteen days later in the middle of the night.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following Misuzu Kurosawa, another girl, Masaki Haneda went missing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, after that, Tachioka Tachibana encountered a demon and had a part of his memory stolen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The location where that man was abducted was a love hotel. Tachioka claims he went into the hotel with a female student named Mai Fujiwara but that&#8217;s a lie. Hikari informed me that Mai Fujiwara is a regular participant in prostitution. It&#8217;s likely Tachioka paid for her services.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s perplexing is that this Mai Fujiwara seems to be infatuated with Fumio.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The relationships between the two are not clear. It might be a good idea to press Tachioka for more details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, eighteen members of the track and field team have gone missing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The term 『Disappearance Incident』 has appeared on the internet and the story becomes more intricate. There&#8217;s a lot of missing information.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, after a girl reported Fumio being suspicious to the police, she went missing.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was later revealed that this was a hoax. The girl, out of spite for being rejected by Fumio, had tried to frame him and cause trouble.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Fumio is really popular, huh? I wonder what&#8217;s so good about him…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, the first missing student, Misuzu Kurosawa, for some reason disappeared while walking home with Fumio. She was abducted by men in a black large vehicle. Apparently, not only Fumio but also Misuzu Kurosawa&#8217;s boyfriend witnessed it, so it wasn&#8217;t a hoax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment of abduction was witnessed only once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, things are quite unclear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, Fumio suddenly barged into the Kamishima clan&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On internet summary sites, it was written that he had seen a black van with Misuzu Kurosawa inside but anyone who would barge into a yakuza office for such a reason is honestly quite reckless.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, right after Fumio&#8217;s intrusion, the police also stormed the group&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a plot twist that even light novels would find astonishingly convenient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the police found the missing female track and field members that included Misuzu Kurosawa and  Masaki Haneda, only four freshman students haven’t been found.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Can something like this really happen? It feels a bit too convenient…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The super-strong maid that attacked the other day was one of the four missing freshman students, according to Teruya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, it&#8217;s safe to assume that these four are still under the control of the demon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hikari&#8217;s older sister, Anna and other members of the group were arrested. Fumio was also arrested but he was released shortly afterward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Initially, there was an atmosphere online that idolised Fumio as a hero, but as soon as his middle school yearbook photo was revealed, he was ridiculed as 『a bullied kid who wanted revenge and only attacked crying out』.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, Saori&#8217;s 『saved me』 remark was probably referring to this situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『It&#8217;s not like we&#8217;ve been close&#8230; I started talking to Saori relatively recently. We used to go to school together in groups during elementary school, but I don&#8217;t remember much about that time.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The colour that surrounded Fumio&#8217;s statement was blue, indicating it wasn&#8217;t a lie.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, it is impossible that Fumio and Saori conspired to do something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The origin of the story that Fumio is suspicious comes from Tachioka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Kurosawa Misuzu and Haneda Masaki, who were rescued, seem to be on good terms with Kijima now. He seem to have many girls at his beck and call.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Given this situation, Tachioka&#8217;s words aren&#8217;t entirely incomprehensible. Looking at the outcome of the 『Disappearance Incident』, Fumio benefited the most.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, viewed from a different angle, it&#8217;s not entirely implausible that Saori orchestrated things for Fumio.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, my abilities don&#8217;t work on Saori. If the grace bestowed upon me by the angel doesn&#8217;t work, it&#8217;s hard not to suspect the involvement of a demon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I got home and stepped into the dining area, my older sister had already finished eating breakfast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m back and I&#8217;m starving! Give me sunny-side-up eggs with both eyes! And spread jam on the toast!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I exclaimed, my older sister gave me a look that seemed to convey exasperation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Claudia&#8230;don&#8217;t you ever think of doing things for yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t. Everyone knows your sunny-side-up eggs taste better, Onee-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My older sister shrugged her shoulders, placed the partially eaten toast on the plate and stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, as she reached for the refrigerator door, she turned around as if she had remembered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, I got a message from Tachioka.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, what does it say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He&#8217;s being really cryptic in his wording but he&#8217;s basically saying to call him back for more details.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Onee-chan took her smartphone out of the back pocket of her jeans, opened the messaging app, swiped across the table with the app open and I looked down at the phone that had slid into my hand. I couldn&#8217;t help but raise an eyebrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe Saori died once.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That single sentence written there was just too unsettling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, I changed my plans and decided to observe the track and field team&#8217;s practice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the morning, I talked to Tachioka on the phone and had a good reason to do so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He answered the phone on the eighth call, sounding quite annoyed. Apparently, he just woke up and wasn&#8217;t in a good mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『&#8230;I did asked you to call me, but couldn&#8217;t you at least think about the time&#8230; Geez.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, you lazy NEET. People are awake at seven o&#8217;clock.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I&#8217;m not a NEET. I&#8217;m still enrolled in school, you know.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care about that. What does it mean that Saori has died once?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well&#8230; I did my best, you know. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to give me a little praise&#8230;But whatever. I visited the elementary school where that Moribe girl graduated from and talked to her former teacher. He was an old man close to retirement.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Surprising that you weren&#8217;t treated as a suspicious person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well, if you say something like 『I’m looking for surprise ideas for Moribe-chan&#8217;s birthday』 most people are fine with it. They&#8217;re all eager to help and tell you things.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;so being carefree has its uses. That&#8217;s unexpected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『FuFun, so the teacher said, [I remember Moribe well] And when asked why, he said, [Because she died once].』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, I&#8217;m asking what the situation was for her to die once”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You&#8217;re really impatient&#8230;Apparently, when she was in fifth grade, her parents contacted the school. They said she had a high fever and had passed away that morning. So, the teacher informed the students and they all had a moment of silence while crying. But the next day, she came to school as if nothing had happened.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa? What&#8217;s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Exactly. It&#8217;s really strange. The teacher panicked and called Moribe&#8217;s house but apparently they said, [We don&#8217;t remember making such a call. Maybe it was a prank] However, the teacher swears it was without a doubt the voice of Moribe&#8217;s mother.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Isn&#8217;t it just the ramblings of a senile old man?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Well, yeah, that possibility exists too. But the interesting part is what happened afterward. Apparently, after all that fuss about her being dead or not, Moribe&#8217;s personality completely changed. She used to be bright, selfish, the centre of the class but then she turned quiet, timid and reserved.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily held my breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『[She looked the same, but seemed like completely different person] the teacher said. Other teachers joked about it too, [Is she actually the twin sister?]』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s undeniable.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had thought something similiar. In fifth grade, she and the demon had switched places.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon reflection, it was reasonable that the track team members were hiding their ongoing connection with the culprit. After all, a demon was among their ranks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t know if Fumio was involved. Even if he was, I couldn&#8217;t tell if he was using the demon, [Moribe Saori] or being used by her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if I could thoroughly monitor her and find decisive evidence that she was the demon, the situation would take a significant turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori held the key to this case.</span></p>

<h3>DV Boyfriend and the Woman Who Spoils Him</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan is surprisingly stubborn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although she says that she works as a servant, that&#8217;s just a facade. In reality, it&#8217;s just a matter of not making Yui-chan&#8217;s mom feel inferior when my step-father protected her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My step-father seemed to express his desire for Yui-chan&#8217;s mom to return to the entertainment industry, and if she&#8217;s willing, he would support her enthusiastically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I was thinking more of welcoming her as a guest, but──&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As a maid serving Ojou-sama, I will devote myself wholeheartedly. When we do something, we aim for the top. Master the path of the maid! We will lead the world of maids. Okaa-sama, we will ascend Maid Hill without looking back.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s right, Yui-san~.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan is full of motivation and Yui-chan&#8217;s mom claps her hands cutely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, probably Yui-chan&#8217;s mom isn&#8217;t really thinking about anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, whether it&#8217;s a hill or a path or a world, I wish they&#8217;d focus on just one. It&#8217;s too messy and distracting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; but you don&#8217;t have to wear maid uniforms or anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I refuse! The maid uniform embodies the soul of a maid, I have heard it. Since I receive a salary and work, I won&#8217;t discard that soul.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in reality, the maids in my place don&#8217;t really wear maid uniforms or anything like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The part-timer Tanaka-san, whom she addresses as [senior maid] also wears her own traditional Japanese apron.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I mentioned this, she responded with a mysterious answer, [That Kappogi is a maid uniform!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For that reason, Yui-chan was becoming a bit difficult for me to handle.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s strange&#8230;that kind of character should be my exclusive domain…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things were getting out of control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way to school for supplementary lessons, she&#8217;s still walking three steps behind, clutching my bag to her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yui-chan, it&#8217;s hard to talk when you&#8217;re walking behind me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, a servant would never walk side by side with Ojou-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There used to be servants in her family as well, but I wonder if they were treated like this? The inherent Ojou-sama and someone like me, a former commoner trying to be an Ojou-sama, might be different in terms of our mental makeup.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;or rather, you don&#8217;t need to accompany me to my supplementary lessons.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, Mai-Ojousama. I will always stand by your side and do my utmost to ensure that you never experience any inconvenience. That is the role of a maid. While you are dedicated to your studies, I will be waiting in the hallway. If you need anything, please feel free to let me know.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s with this embarrassing play…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling quite fed up, I finally arrived at school. I noticed three women walking toward the sports field ahead. All three of them are wearing tracksuits but they stand out remarkably. They are not visible to the students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two of them are foreigners with blonde hair. Walking just behind them is another person with green-dyed hair. Catching a glimpse of their profiles, I involuntarily looked away.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Teruya!? Why? Why is she here of all places?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked back behind me, Yui-chan also had a look of astonishment.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, she&#8217;s also in the track and field club. It&#8217;s only natural for her to know Teruya.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why is Teruya here&#8230;? Is she planning something? Could it be related to Anna-senpai, like trying to get revenge on Fumi for what happened…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna-senpai&#8217;s arrest was caused by Fumi breaking into the agency, so it wouldn&#8217;t be strange if he held a grudge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yui-chan, I have a favour to ask right away&#8230; Can you watch over Teruya for me? Just while she&#8217;s at school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Teruya -senpai? Why would you want that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think Teruya might be holding a grudge against Fumi. So, I&#8217;m thinking she might be trying to get back at her or something…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Against&#8230; Ki, Kijima-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a serious matter. Leave it to me. I will definitely catch her tail and show you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her tail&#8230; it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;ve decided on that yet. Don&#8217;t jump to conclusions. Don&#8217;t push yourself too hard and if you think it&#8217;s dangerous, retreat immediately.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, Yui-chan&#8217;s character seems to be getting more and more lost, but anyway, this kills two birds with one stone. While she kept an eye on Teruya, I’ve also successfully avoided this embarrassing play.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m back!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Towards the late afternoon, Yui-chan returned home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she hadn&#8217;t shown any signs of returning after going to watch over Teruya, I had gone home ahead of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome back! So, how did it go about with Teruya-senpai?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asking that, Yui-chan responded with a slightly excited tone.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What was?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Love! It&#8217;s all about love! The reason Teruya-senpai came back was to confess to the man she loves!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the mention of 『the man she loves』 I understood.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see! It&#8217;s Kasuya-chi!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, that makes sense then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had an intense obsession with Kasuya-chi. After learning that Misuzu had broken up with him, she came back to make her move on him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Yui-chan, in the morning she had been coaching the sprinters in the track and field club but suddenly started behaving suspiciously around midday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She locked herself in the restroom for a while, then emerged wearing a neat white dress and headed towards the back of the school building. There, she met with a boy. Yui-chan doesn&#8217;t know Kasuya-chi personally, so she couldn&#8217;t confirm but there&#8217;s no doubt it was him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“While the young man seemed perpetually moody and disinterested&#8230;Teruya-senpai expressed her feelings fervently&#8230; In the end, they linked arms and left the school through the back door.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui-chan gazes dreamily into the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gives off the impression of a maiden in love. She seemed to be picturing someone she had feelings for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, well, forgive me, there&#8217;s no boy more wonderful than my Fumi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed the instructions and undressed, then knelt between Junichi-sama&#8217;s legs as instructed, letting my tongue crawl on his dick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the first time seeing a live male dick. My sister and I lost our parents at a young age, so I don&#8217;t even have memories of seeing our father&#8217;s dick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s incredibly grotesque and has a strong, raw smell.  But I still loved it when I thought it was a part of Junichi-sama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I licked it with my tongue as I was told, and my heart was beating wildly just by taking it in my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My blood was pumping so fast that I felt like my head was boiling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A love hotel behind the station. A room at La Vian Rose. The first love hotel I entered had a vibe very similar to what I&#8217;ve seen in dramas. Right now, pink lights are illuminating Junichi-sama and me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My expression reflected in the mirror is completely debauched. On the other hand, Junichi-sama&#8217;s expression doesn&#8217;t reveal much. Perhaps, due to having more experience, he possesses a certain level of composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want him to feel good. With that in mind, I desperately continue to suck on Junichi-sama&#8217;s dick.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">S*x with Junichi-sama, the dream I had even during my sleep. Thinking that I&#8217;m about to give my first time to him, I became so excited that my head was spinning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Junichi-sama grabbed my hair tightly and let out a low groan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oi, bitch. How&#8217;s my dick?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-How?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it big? Is it small?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if he says things like that, I can only be confused as I&#8217;ve never seen a male dick before. I don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s big or small.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Oh, I think men feel pleased when you say it&#8217;s big, right?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Oh, it&#8217;s big…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I answered with a shy look, Junichi-sama&#8217;s expression underwent a swift change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The previously indifferent look in his eyes was replaced by flames of anger and deep furrows appeared on his forehead.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, aah, wha&#8230;kyaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiii!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, out of fear, I choked on my voice. He repeatedly slapped my cheeks, the sound echoing through the room like explosions.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the slaps reverberated. My desperate apologies were completely ignored.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t let you make a fool out of me! Laugh at me if you dare! I&#8217;ll kill you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I screamed desperately, the hand striking my cheek stopped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, your first time, huh? Don&#8217;t lie, you moron!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, he grabbed my breasts and twisted them forcefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-It hurts, plea-se, it might, it might tear!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I twisted my body in desperation. With his face pressed against mine, he twisted his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, you damn bitch! You want to belong to me, right? You said I can do whatever I want, didn&#8217;t you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I-I did.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t care what you do to me, I just want you near me. You were the one who said that, right!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Junichi-sama got off me then he positioned himself between my legs, placing his hand on his own thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither my mind nor my body are prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugeehhh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A bestial, guttural sound escapes and a sour taste floods my mouth from deep within my throat.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Painful, painful! Why? Why is this happening?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cheek that was hit earlier throbs with heat. My mouth is also cut and I can taste blood. Tears overflow naturally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Please, a-at least, on the bed…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do I care, you moron.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He spits out those words to my pleading, then forcefully thrusts himself inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, it hurts, it hurts, guh, guuuu, it hurts so much!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sensation as if my body is being torn apart, a stabbing pain crawls up my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clenching my teeth and digging my nails into the carpet, I arch my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh&#8230; uuhh, ughh, ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Words fail me. Along with my tears, only sobbing spills out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s this? I thought it would be looser. Surprisingly tight, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, he mercilessly began to move his hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Giiii! It hurts! It hurts so muuuuch!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain is unbearable. The freshly formed wound is being rubbed fiercely and involuntarily, my screams burst forth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Junichi-sama raises his hand again and strikes my cheek.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t make such a dull voice, you moron! Moan, moan like [ahn ahn!] Say it feels good! You damn bitch!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-S-Stop, don&#8217;t hit m-me! Hiiii, ahn, ahn! It feels goooood!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was desperate. I screamed as instructed. But still, Junichi-sama&#8217;s mood only worsened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I no longer knew what to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re just fooling around! Damn bitch! You&#8217;re not even feeling good, yet you act like you are! Making fun of me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shouting this, Junichi-sama puts his hand around my neck and starts choking me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ch-Choking, it&#8217;s painful, I&#8217;m dying!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being strangled without mercy, I frantically flail in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ju-Junichi-sama, pl-please, s-stop, I-I&#8217;ll, di-die&#8230; uugh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha! Strangle your neck and your pussy tightens up, you damn bitch! Listen, you piece of meat! If you want me to keep fucking you, tighten your pussy hard for me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hya, hyaaaiii, guuuuuu, gahah, kahah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Junichi-sama mercilessly thrusts his hips while exerting force on my neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His gaze is vacant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The eyes directed at me seem to be looking at someone other than me. That&#8217;s the feeling I got.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind is hazy and my consciousness is fading away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pink lights flicker on and off. My vision gradually darkens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as my consciousness is about to be swallowed by darkness, there&#8217;s a sensation of Junichi-sama releasing his essence inside me. That&#8217;s what it felt like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perfect&#8230; it should be perfect.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, Takata Takaka, changed into a light blue bikini and looked back at the pile of DVDs on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spared no time and watched all the DVDs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I thought my mind might go crazy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sexual intercourse is meant to confirm love and a sacred act to propagate offspring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, the girls appearing on the screen were intertwining their bodies with men as if it were a recreation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were impolite and familiar, devoid of any sense of chastity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, the men participating in the scenes seemed to delight in their behaviour.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What I know about sexual intercourse&#8230;is completely different.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My encounters with Kobayashi-sensei were hidden secrets of quiet nights. That&#8217;s the impression I had. Sensei was gentle and our acts seemed like poetic exchanges of confirming each other&#8217;s love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I entrusted myself to him, responding to his advances with the innocence of a bird. That&#8217;s my memory. It might have been slightly idealised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even though it was the same sexual act, the girls on the screen were completely different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They straddled the men, demanding things like [deeper] or [move your hips more] taking pleasure like savages while mocking the men and toying with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I try to recall, I feel kind of weird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shake my head vigorously and tell myself.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;ll pretend I didn&#8217;t see the explicit parts! I should focus on their attitudes and way of speaking!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I peer into the mirror and stick my tongue out provocatively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about how some of the girls in the DVDs had piercings on their tongues, I wonder how they would have talked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s so good, seriously~. Like, super hot, lol. Sooo sexy, ～?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say it out loud and twist my neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What does [sexy] mean? I&#8217;m not really sure. Probably something like [awesome] or [impressive].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their way of laughing is with a big open mouth, like [gyahaha] When talking to guys, they seem friendly and teasing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a bit of simulation, I nod vigorously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gyaru makeup I was taught yesterday is spot on. Of course, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m as skilled as Rena-san but looking at myself like this, I might be quite cute too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s alright. Today&#8217;s the day to escape from last place&#8230; no, to aim for first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to become capable of getting first place quickly, or I&#8217;ll be in trouble. There&#8217;s no extra time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m a hard worker. I&#8217;ve always been described as such on my report cards, aiming to be an example for everyone since elementary school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I work hard, things should work out somehow.</span></p>
