<h2>Chapter 9: Morning Light Washes Away Dreams</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>



<p>“Already back? That was quick.”</p>



<p>“Sensei fell asleep.”</p>



<p>“I see. Then, keep me company too.”</p>



<p>Despite being quite drunk earlier, Aria-san was pouring herself another drink. This time, she was uncorking a bottle of wine and filling the glass with red liquid. I wondered if mixing so many types of alcohol was really okay.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it bad to drink too much?”</p>



<p>“Alcohol just flows on happy days.”</p>



<p>“I’ve been nervous since we suddenly arrived at Sensei’s house.”</p>



<p>“You should have been nervous from the moment we were alone in the taxi.”</p>



<p>“How could I pay attention to the Dreadful Demon Queen?” I scoffed and settled onto a nearby cushion.</p>



<p>“Being able to maintain this attitude with me is one of your strengths, isn’t it? Someone who can talk to me casually is rare, most people are either uneasy or intimidated.”</p>



<p>“I can change my attitude if you want.”</p>



<p>“No, I would be lonely if I lost my easy conversational partner.”</p>



<p>“Is that how you see me?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. I can talk to you about anything.”</p>



<p>Aria-san’s cheerful chatter was disarmingly carefree. The transcendent beauty, with her cheeks flushed from alcohol, was in an utterly defenseless state. It was astonishing how approachable she became, contrary to her usual unapproachable beauty.</p>



<p>“It’d be a problem if you display such carelessness outside. You should be careful or some wild beast might come sniffing around. Yorka would be shocked and cry again.”</p>



<p>“Bringing up another woman’s name at a time like this is so tactless.”</p>



<p>“She’s your sister. And she’s my girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, are you the type to be bothered by that?” </p>



<p>Damn, she was really enjoying this.</p>



<p>“What kind of nerve do you have to tease your sister’s boyfriend?” </p>



<p>Even though I knew it was a joke, I couldn’t help but nervous.</p>



<p>“When it comes to guys and girls, sometimes things just happen.”</p>



<p>“I’m not interested in those uncensored sexual shenanigans among university-level. I’m still in high school.”</p>



<p>“Seventy percent of high school boys are made up of hormones, don’t try to deny it.”</p>



<p>“That seventy percent is mostly water! What kind of hormone overload are you talking about?” </p>



<p>“You seem pretty interested though.”</p>



<p>“I’m sticking to soft drinks only.”</p>



<p>“Oh, that,” she trailed off, a meaningful silence settling in.</p>



<p>“Wait a second, don’t tell me…”</p>



<p>“I spiked your cola with a bit of adult liquid to loosen you up. You didn’t notice it because of the spicy food, right? That’s why you were acting bolder than usual!”</p>



<p>Wait, so my ability to casually call sensei’s name was thanks to the power of that <em>adult liquid</em>!?</p>



<p>“I’m leaving!” I exclaimed and jumped up from my seat.</p>



<p>“Too bad. The last train left long ago.”</p>



<p>“I can walk home from here.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think that’s a good idea. Just walking around at night in your school uniform already makes you stand out, but having an alcohol scent on top of that? You’d attract unwanted attention from the police. And that could cause trouble for your family and Yor-chan. Why don’t you just stay quiet and spend the night here?” </p>



<p>She was grinning while trying to persuade me. And she had directly mentioned the word “alcohol”.</p>



<p>“You planned this from the beginning, didn’t you!”</p>



<p>I felt a chill down my spine at her manipulative prowess. What started as a simple conversation had somehow been steered into the situation she wanted.</p>



<p>“What do you say? Just accept it and become my conversation partner,” she poured herself another drink.</p>



<p>I sighed and sat back down. “I’m always in your control, huh, Aria-san?”</p>



<p>“Do you have any complaints?” </p>



<p>“I tend to get nervous around beautiful women.”</p>



<p>“That’s rich coming from a bad guy who’s stolen my cute little sister.”</p>



<p>“You must be really desperate to rely on such a bad guy like me.”</p>



<p>I aimed for a light jab, but Aria-san’s response caught me off guard.</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t involve you if it weren’t necessary,” Her usual confidence and brightness were replaced by an uncharacteristically quiet tone.</p>



<p>“Aria-san?” </p>



<p>Ignoring my confusion, she leaned her head against my shoulder as though seeking comfort.</p>



<p>I tried to pull away instinctively, but she held me in place. She was surprisingly strong, her resistance left me hesitating. I found myself unable to move.</p>



<p>“I told you. I’m not as mature as you think.”</p>



<p>“I’d rather you didn’t rely on me like this.”</p>



<p>“What’s the harm? Can’t you just listen to me vent a little?”</p>



<p>“Listening is all I can do.”</p>



<p>“You’re so honest.”</p>



<p>“Blame it on the magic potion someone slipped into my drink.”</p>



<p>“That’s a lie. You’ve only had cola.”</p>



<p>“Not again!”</p>



<p>With a merry laugh, Aria-san flopped onto the floor. </p>



<p>“If you’re going to sleep, at least use the bed or the sofa. You’ll catch a cold on the floor.”</p>



<p>“Then, Sumi-kun, take care of me,” she mumbled, drunk and acting spoiled.</p>



<p>“I’ll pass.”</p>



<p>“You must really dislike me.”</p>



<p>“I’m not sure about that. Come on, let’s move.”</p>



<p>I tried to get her stand up, but she pulled me back instead. In that split second, I lost my balance and ended up tumbling over her.</p>



<p>“Hey, cut it out alr—!”</p>



<p>“Have you kissed Yor-chan yet?”</p>



<p>Aria-san’s face was inches away from mine.</p>



<p>“…Not yet.”</p>



<p>“Hmm…”</p>



<p>“Is it bad?”</p>



<p>“I thought you had kissed by now.”</p>



<p>“We could’ve done it the other day.”</p>



<p>“Haha. Sorry for interrupting.”</p>



<p>Then, like caressing with her breath, the sister of my girlfriend whispered sweet words.</p>



<p>“Then, how about I make it up to you with a kiss?” </p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Think of it as a rehearsal for the real thing.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“──It’s alright if it’s you.”</p>



<p>My eyes inadvertently glanced at the lips of another woman, so similar to those of my lover.</p>



<p>Our eyes met. Her moist gaze reflected me.</p>



<p>Sometimes, silence could be awkward, but at times, it spoke volumes.</p>



<p>The older sister, who looked exactly like my girlfriend, exposed herself in a relaxed and defenseless manner. Even without speaking, her eyes did convey everything.</p>



<p>Knowing that I understood, she gently closed her eyelids. Her long eyelashes didn’t even twitch, as if provoking me to do whatever I wanted.</p>



<p>In the quiet living room, the faint hum of the air conditioner and the sound of my own heartbeat seemed unnaturally loud. All I had to do was relax my arm, and I could steal those soft-looking lips.</p>



<p>This situation felt oddly familiar.</p>



<p>The day I first entered the art preparation room, I accidentally toppled Yorka like this. Back then, I was too flustered by the pain and the close proximity to a girl to even properly look at her.</p>



<p>Ah, this must be the kissing opportunity I had always dreamed of. </p>



<p>Just surrendering to the moment could lead to action.</p>



<p>Indeed, it was all unfolding so naturally. Did I really struggle so much to bridge this close distance?</p>



<p>The flushed skin of a woman, the warmth felt up close, the scent tickling my nose, the sound of her breath.</p>



<p>No matter how much my mind tried to rationalize, everything converged towards her lips. Courage was unnecessary to cross this threshold. I just had to stop thinking.</p>



<p>Why not just indulge in the enticing words of an attractive older woman? It was natural for a man to feel excited.</p>



<p>But—she’s not the one.</p>



<p>No matter who it was, I couldn’t allow myself to be swept away. If I let temporary satisfaction cloud my judgment, I’d definitely regret it.</p>



<p>I quietly sat up and turned away from Aria-san.</p>



<p>“…Coward.”</p>



<p>“Is it fun to tease a little coward?”</p>



<p>“It’s fun. Being with you is entertaining, Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Seriously, cut it out.”</p>



<p>“I’ll keep this a secret,” she whispered in my ear.</p>


<div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1000011092.png" alt="" /></div>


<p>She silently slipped her arms around me from behind and pressed her body against mine.</p>



<p>“You already crossed the line.”</p>



<p>“If you only know one woman at the beginning, isn’t it just like not knowing any other women? It’s important to broaden your horizons and see various potential partners, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“Then what about someone who suddenly meets their soulmate? What if they lack experience and overlook it?”</p>



<p>“In those cases, perhaps there’s a strong connection akin to the red string of fate at work?”</p>



<p>“So, experience would be pointless in the face of destiny, wouldn’t it?”</p>



<p>“…Oh my, checkmate. Looks like the alcohol’s getting to me too.”</p>



<p>The warmth I felt against my back faded away.</p>



<p>Aria-san gestured towards the bedroom. “I’ll sleep in Shizuru-chan’s bed, you can take the sofa, Sumi-kun,” then disappeared into the room.</p>



<p>I gathered the dishes left on the table and took them to the kitchen. After finishing washing them up, I laid down on the sofa.</p>



<p>Through the slightly parted curtains, I tried to spot the moon in the night sky. But at the peak of mental exhaustion, I quickly succumbed to sleep.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Waking up in bed, Shizuru’s head wasn’t quite working due to her usual low blood pressure.</p>



<p>On top of that, her hangover pounded at her temples. She stumbled out of bed and noticed Aria was sleeping soundly beside her.</p>



<p>She gulped down cold water in the kitchen, then headed to the bathroom to rinse off the night sweats and lingering discomfort. A hot shower would surely clear her foggy mind.</p>



<p>After feeling refreshed, Shizuru stepped into the living room wearing only a bath towel. The cool air from the AC soothed her flushed skin. She must have forgotten to turn it off last night.</p>



<p>There, she locked eyes with Kisumi, who had been sleeping on the sofa. He had just woken up from the noise she made.</p>



<p>“──────”</p>



<p>“……”</p>



<p>Kisumi’s face remained stiff, beads of sweat forming on his brow.</p>



<p>Ah, right. He was here with Aria last night. </p>



<p>Shizuru recalled this as she remembered going to the kitchen earlier and everything had been unusually clean. Aria never bothered with dishes, so it should have been a clue.</p>



<p>While she comprehended this, the towel wrapped around her loosened in her flustered state.</p>



<p>In the bright morning sunlight streaming into the living room, an uncharacteristic scream escaped Shizuru.</p>



<p>“Stop yelling, Shizuru-chan! Ugh, I feel sick…” Aria emerged from the bedroom in response to Shizuru’s voice.</p>



<p>“I’m never getting married!”</p>



<p>“Yes, we’re here to make sure you don’t get married,” Aria sounded exasperated at Shizuru’s panic.</p>



<p>“I didn’t see anything!” Kisumi insisted, lowering his head as if he wanted to bury his head on the sofa.</p>



<p>Seeing this reaction, Aria let out a big yawn and remarked, “You look like a little caterpillar hiding there. It’s kind of funny.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p>In the end, despite Aria-san’s groggy attempts to calm Shizuru, she was practically shoved out of the apartment.</p>



<p>Even after changing, Aria-san who still looked half-asleep barely able to keep her eyes open. She struggled to walk straight, so I had to lend her a hand all the way to the elevator.</p>



<p>Even on the ground floor, she was too lazy to walk on her own.</p>



<p>“I can’t walk. Sumi-kun, carry me,” she demanded.</p>



<p>“Please walk on your own.”</p>



<p>“I can’t. Besides, I’m hungry. I don’t have the energy to walk.”</p>



<p>“I’ll go buy breakfast from the convenience store. Please recharge your energy by yourself.”</p>



<p>“You’re so cold. What if a beauty like me get attacked by a pervert? How will you take responsibility then?” </p>



<p>“Then please carry yourself with the dignity and awareness befitting a beautiful lady.”</p>



<p>“That’s so mean. You’re abandoning your benefactor.”</p>



<p>“It’s because I can’t abandon you that I’m in trouble now.” I sighed.</p>



<p>“Hmm, you’re tough in some ways. Okay, let’s have breakfast! Help me!”</p>



<p>We stepped out of the elevator. I wanted to just drop her in the lobby, but we were already attracting weird looks from the other residents.</p>



<p>“I prefer being carried like a princess.”</p>



<p>“I’m not doing it.”</p>



<p>“But you did it for Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“That’s because Sensei couldn’t walk.”</p>



<p>“I can’t either. I’ll definitely trip.”</p>



<p>“Blame your high heels.”</p>



<p>“Just carry me.”</p>



<p>“Lean on my shoulder and bear with it. I won’t yield any further.”</p>



<p>“You’re so stingy.” Aria-san, tottering in her high heels, casually leaned on me as we walked. Her nonchalant attitude about yesterday was honestly a relief.</p>



<p>“If you’re not satisfied, just hail a taxi and go home.”</p>



<p>“No way. I want to have breakfast together. Let’s go to a café.”</p>



<p>“Huh, you want to drag me along again?”</p>



<p>“I’ll treat you, so eat whatever you want. High school boys are the hungriest creatures in life.”</p>



<p>“My stomach is definitely rumbling.”</p>



<p>“Can’t you eat the food I gave you?”</p>



<p>“Don’t threaten me with breakfast.”</p>



<p>We walked for one station, chatting idly to sober her up along the way. After arriving at our familiar local station, we headed into a café.</p>



<p>Aria-san ordered sandwiches and scones one after another, handing me her wallet and leaving me to pay the bill before heading to our table.</p>



<p>While carrying a mountainous tray, I searched for Aria-san and found her sitting by the window near the entrance. She was staring absentmindedly outside with a wistful expression.</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, you’re slow,” she noticed me and waved.</p>



<p>While feeling grateful for the café’s air conditioning, we enjoyed our breakfast amidst the summer’s bright morning light. In the end, Aria-san hardly touched her meal and left me to eat most of it.</p>



<p>As time passed, we reminisced about our days at the cram school, talked about Yorka, dissected the strategies of the stand-in boyfriend, and indulged in aimless chatter.</p>



<p>It was more than enough to fill the two-year gap since we last saw each other, after I finished high school entrance exams and Aria-san quit her part-time job as a cram school tutor.</p>



<p>“—After all, this is probably just right for us,” Aria-san muttered as she finished the last sip of her coffee.</p>



<p>“What do you mean?” </p>



<p>“No matter how close we are, you’re already Yor-chan’s boyfriend.”</p>



<p>Why did she say something like that with a serious expression?</p>



<p>“Do you not have a boyfriend right now, Aria-san?”</p>



<p>“Nope.”</p>



<p>“You’ll find someone great soon.”</p>



<p>“This is weird, but I never seem to meet the right person.”</p>



<p>“Are you feeling pressured because your sister has a boyfriend?”</p>



<p>“She looks happy every day. That’s why I got a little curious about what love is like.”</p>



<p>“About last night…”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“If you’re blaming it on the alcohol—”</p>



<p>“That was something I wanted myself,” Aria-san cut in before I could finish.</p>



<p>I looked up suddenly, and saw her face bathed in the morning sunlight streaming through the window. Her eyes filled with affection as she smiled a little sadly.</p>



<p>Her presence was so picturesque that I couldn’t help but be mesmerized. If this weren’t reality, I might have just kept gazing at her forever.</p>



<p>“Please don’t experiment with me, especially since I’m the worst possible choice. What were you planning to do if something actually happened?”</p>



<p>Regardless of curiosity or whims, playing with fire was too reckless.</p>



<p>“Then, how about we both share a burden and start dating?” Aria-san said nonchalantly.</p>



<p>Her languid smile left me uncertain whether she was joking or serious. I couldn’t figure her out. Even though she was not great at acting, her intentions were completely unclear to me.</p>



<p>“I can’t imagine being happy with that,” I replied casually, expecting to be teased.</p>



<p>“We don’t need anyone else’s blessings. I’ll make you happy.”</p>



<p>“You’re only strong at times like this.”</p>



<p>And her conviction sounded oddly persuasive.</p>



<p>As I nibbled on my flaky croissant, I indulged in a bit of daydreaming. </p>



<p>Spending a leisurely morning at a café with such a beautiful woman, like in dramas or movies, would indeed be one form of happiness. Even if it meant forsaking everything else at the end of a forbidden romance, enjoying a luxurious breakfast with a beautiful partner didn’t sound like a bad ending.</p>



<p>Aria-san was the person I spent a significant period of my life with during the intensive preparation of entrance exams, a woman who worked tirelessly alongside me. In that sense, she was undoubtedly special.</p>



<p>When we first met, we weren’t equals, nor did we viewed each other as potential romantic partners. I was just a middle schooler then, too naive to see beyond what was in front of me.</p>



<p>For Aria-san, I was just one of her students at the cram school, nothing more. After two years of separation, we reunited when we both had matured a bit.</p>



<p>Indeed, it might seem cliché for a romance story to start this way, but it was fitting.</p>



<p>However, there was a fatal flaw.</p>



<p>“It’s too late to fall in love.”</p>



<p>In reality, my heart already belonged to Yorka.</p>



<p>“…I see,” Aria-san crossed her slender legs and brushed back her long hair.</p>



<p>“Wait, before we even settle Kanzaki-sensei’s matter, what was your plan if I had bolted after last night?” I slipped into a bit of a lecturing tone.</p>



<p>“Hmm, once this is all over, you won’t have a reason to meet me, right?” </p>



<p>“That’s right. There’s no reason for you to meet me.”</p>



<p>Meeting someone you had little contact with on a whim wasn’t easy unless you were pretty close.</p>



<p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p>



<p>“Huh? If it were you…”</p>



<p><em>You’d be swinging by and messing with me like you always do.</em> I was about to speak those words then suddenly stopped.</p>



<p>While resting her cheek on her hand, Aria-san avoided eye contact. Her ears turned red. That bashfulness reminded me of her sister, Yorka.</p>



<p>“Back then, I felt guilty towards Yor-chan, and the time I spent teaching you was a relief for me. Your grades improved drastically under my guidance. It felt like a chance to make up for what I couldn’t do for my sister, and it was incredibly fulfilling. It puts my mind at ease.”</p>



<p>“You were worried about Yorka all this time.”</p>



<p>This was a rare moment of vulnerability from the seemingly invincible Aria-san.</p>



<p>“But isn’t that just normal for you?”</p>



<p>I couldn’t quite understand.</p>



<p>After all, many other students besides me had passed their first-choice high schools with Aria-san’s tutoring. I couldn’t see why there would be any special meaning in boosting my grades, especially since I wasn’t particularly outstanding.</p>



<p>“For me, most people are predictably boring. That’s why I tend to like those who surprise me. Shizuru-chan was like that too. We’re close because she didn’t treat me differently.”</p>



<p>“What about me, then?”</p>



<p>What was so special about the ordinary guy Sena Kisumi?</p>



<p>“I initially thought you wouldn’t be able to handle my assignments, Sumi-kun. Since the goal was already too high, I figured you’d just give up like anyone else. But you kept at it. No matter how much you complained or grumbled, you always turned them in on time. That’s why I was genuinely moved by your success. I felt a sort of sisterly connection to your motivation to aim for Eisei.”</p>



<p>I never expected to receive such a heartfelt blow on the dreadful Demon Queen herself. Beneath those plain glasses and mask, I never imagined Aria-san felt that way back then.</p>



<p>“In my memory, the boy named Sena Kisumi had exceeded my expectations and achieved a major victory on his own. There’s something undeniably cool about that and it left such an impression on me.”</p>



<p><em>Don’t say that with a shy face. It’s hard for me to react.</em></p>



<p>“I’m glad you didn’t say those words to my face back in middle school. I might have misunderstood and gotten my hopes up.”</p>



<p>I breathed a sigh of relief from the depths of my heart. If Aria-san had praised me, I might have fallen head over heels for her. A single word from a beautiful older sister could have easily changed the course of my life.</p>



<p>For a teenage boy going through puberty, the existence of Arisaka Aria was too dazzling.</p>



<p>“Haha, did I miss my chance?”</p>



<p>“What do you take people’s lives for?”</p>



<p>“But after reuniting with you after two years, it’s actually me who changed.”</p>



<p>“Well, the visual impression is quite different.”</p>



<p>“I’m not talking about appearances.”</p>



<p>“You’re exaggerating. The age gap hasn’t suddenly disappeared. I’m still in high school, and you’re in college. You’re much more of an adult in every way.”</p>



<p>“That’s true. But you see, in a few more years, that age difference won’t be such a big deal anymore. I can’t help but think about it.”</p>



<p>“No one can defy time.”</p>



<p>Defying time was an impossible task, even for Aria-san.</p>



<p>“When I watch Yor-chan, I realize I’ve never truly fallen for anyone. That’s why I found it easy to imagine you, someone I already knew, as a romantic interest. Maybe because we’re sisters, we’re drawn to similar types.”</p>



<p>I wish she wouldn’t arbitrarily choose me as her love simulation partner. That’s something she should keep in her own head; there’s no need to report it to me.</p>



<p>“Forbidden love is enough as fiction.”</p>



<p>“I guess being forbidden just makes it more enticing.”</p>



<p>“But there’s nothing to be done about it.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t like Aria-san to resort to a hypothetical scenario.</p>



<p>The appeal of embellished stories, ideals, and happiness were alluring precisely because they didn’t require grappling with reality. </p>



<p>Ending on a happy note would be lovely. That’s why epilogues or sequels were unnecessary since there was no need to disrupt the bliss of happiness.</p>



<p>“I probably don’t even understand feelings beyond unrequited love. That’s all it is to me,” Aria-san gazed out at the window bathed in the summer’s white light.</p>



<p>“Since you used to treat your sister like a child, you’re probably just feeling left behind by her.”</p>



<p>Aria-san must be the type who had never lost in life. Perhaps the only thing she had ever been outrun in was matters of love.</p>



<p>“…I see. Maybe it’s the first time I’ve lost to Yor-chan.”</p>



<p>Aria-san said with a happy smile, showing just how much she cared about Yorka.</p>



<p>“You’re a good guy after all, Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Being liked by Yorka is the only thing I can boast about.”</p>



<p>“What’s that? Are you gloating? Gross!” she laughed and lightly tapped my shoulder.</p>



<p>Aria-san’s joyful smile indeed resembled Yorka.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“Alright then, I’m heading back.”</p>



<p>After leaving the cafe, I decided to see Aria-san off at the taxi stand near the station. </p>



<p>The temperature was rising rapidly, and when we stepped out from the cool interior of the café, the heat felt even more intense. Despite the early hour, the strong sunlight made me break out in a light sweat.</p>



<p>“It looks like it’s going to get even hotter.”</p>



<p>“I have to get through my final exams before I can fully enjoy summer.”</p>



<p>“Regular folks sure have it tough. Want big sis to give you a free tutoring session?” </p>



<p>“I’ll take you up on that offer when I’m seriously struggling.”</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re honest.”</p>



<p>“Well, you do have quite the track record, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“You’re only calling me out when it’s convenient, what a bad guy.”</p>



<p>“Hey, watch how you say that! You’ll give people the wrong idea!” </p>



<p>“Just kidding. You’re funny, Sumi-kun ~”</p>



<p>“Seriously, it’s bad for my heart.”</p>



<p>“Oh no, we can’t have you getting heat stroke. Do you need sunglasses?” she rummaged through her handbag.</p>



<p>“I’m fine—” </p>



<p>“Eek!”</p>



<p>Aria-san, who seemed distracted by something in her bag, suddenly missed a step and stumbled over a small ledge. Realizing she was about to fall, I reached out instinctively.</p>



<p>I grabbed her slender arm as she lost her balance and inadvertently pulled her toward me. In that split second of contact, I felt something soft brushed against my ear, a sensation akin to an electric shock coursing through me.</p>



<p>“Hehe, you really are good at catching women.”</p>



<p>As we found ourselves in an awkwardly close position, her breath brushing against my collarbone. The close, soft touch made me flustered.</p>



<p>“I was the one who met you first, yet Yor-chan was the one chosen. How strange.”</p>



<p>“A-Aria-san?” I stammered, finally managing to speak up after being taken aback by her remark.</p>



<p>“The taxi’s here,” she stepped away and quickly slid into the back seat, “Sumi-kun, your face is all red. Take care on your way back.”</p>



<p>“Can you please stop teasing me?” </p>



<p>The station area in the morning was already traumatizing for me. Last April, I was seen with Yorka and it created a major issue, almost leading to a breakup. Neither Sensei who helped me back then nor Aria-san herself could be relied upon this time.</p>



<p>“See you later.” She put on sunglasses inside the car. As the door closed, the taxi carrying her disappeared into the distance. </p>



<p>I stood there, covering my ears with my hands until the taxi was completely out of sight.</p>



<p>“…Kisumi?”</p>



<p>When I turned towards the voice, I saw Yorka and Sayu, the latter was holding her phone behind me.</p>



<p>“T-This is scandalous!” Sayu was trembling as if she had seen something shocking.</p>



<p>“Wait, why is Yorka here? And Sayu too?”</p>



<p>“I-I didn’t want to do something like paparazzi either! But I saw it!” Sayu showed me her phone screen. There was a picture of Aria-san and me embracing each other.</p>



<p>“It’s just an accident. I was just supporting her when she fell. But why are you here, Yorka?”</p>



<p>Today was Saturday, so there was no school. Yorka, who was dressed in casual clothes, had no reason to be here near the school station early in the morning.</p>



<p>“Last night, my sister didn’t come home. You also didn’t contact me until morning. I kept messaging you through LINE but there was no reply, that’s why I got worried. I asked Sayu-chan to come with me to your house to check on you, and we planned to meet here at the station,” Yorka explained quietly.</p>



<p>I hurriedly took out my phone. It was turned off, so I hadn’t noticed any messages.</p>



<p>Damn it, I neglected to respond again. Why did this always happen at crucial times?</p>



<p>“Wait. Yorka, it’s not what you think!” </p>



<p>“Then why are you still in your school uniform? That means you haven’t been home since last night. You must have spent the night with Onee-chan,” Yorka’s tone suddenly grew heavier as she looked down.</p>



<p>“That’s true, but—” </p>



<p>“I trusted you.”</p>



<p>“Yorka, wait!” I called out, but she had already left.</p>



<p>“Ugh! You’ve shattered my illusions, Senpai. You’re the worst!” Sayu looked at me with disdain before quickly following Yorka.</p>



<p>I wanted to chase after my girlfriend right away. But Yorka’s hurt voice lingered in my ears and made me uncertain.</p>



<p>Even if I caught up to her, how should I explain it?</p>



<p>I couldn’t think of any words to prove the coincidence was just that. I was stuck in place, unable to move.</p>
