<h1>Chapter 8: Revelation on the Beach</h1>


<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Shimizu-san and Takoyaki 1</strong></p>

<p>“I’m getting hungry.”</p>

<p>About thirty minutes had passed since the King’s Game ended.</p>
<p>After being escorted to the hallway by Shimizu-san, Ai-san, who had been saying nothing but apologies, finally seemed to have regained her spirits.</p>

<p>“I’m the same.”</p>
<p>“You ate the dorayaki you got from Hondō earlier, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Dorayaki goes to a separate stomach.”</p>

<p>Seto-san appeared to be more of a hearty eater than I had thought.</p>

<p>“True. It’s about time, so shall we go?”</p>
<p>“Go where?”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, only some of the snacks and juice we bought at the supermarket yesterday are in the clubroom.</p>
<p>Where could the other ingredients be?</p>

<p>“That would be, of course, the kitchen!”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“We’ve arrived!”</p>

<p>A few minutes after leaving the clubroom, we arrived at the kitchen.</p>

<p>“I put the ingredients in this refrigerator when we came to school.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine that we came to the kitchen, but what are we going to make? And can we use knives and fire without a teacher?”</p>
<p>“I’ll explain what we’re making later. As for knives and fire, students are generally not permitted to use them unless it’s a special occasion like a cultural festival.”</p>
<p>“So what are we going to do?”</p>
<p>“Don’t rush. The dish we’re making today can be done without using fire.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Yousuke-san brought a cardboard box from the back of the kitchen and placed it on the table around which we were gathered.</p>
<p>Written largely on the box was ‘Takoyaki Maker.’</p>

<p>“Is it takoyaki?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You can cook Takoyaki without fire, and I’ve already cut the ingredients and put them in Tupperware, so there’s no need to use a knife here. I’ve prepared various ingredients so you won’t get bored and can have fun.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know the school had a takoyaki maker.”</p>
<p>“It’s not surprising you didn’t know since it’s generally only used during the cultural festival. As long as we get prior permission, it can be borrowed even when it’s not the cultural festival.”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san likely knew about this because he had been involved in tasks like organizing equipment as a student council officer.</p>

<p>“Enough of the explanations, let’s get started on the takoyaki party preparations!”</p>

<p>And so, we began to prepare for making Takoyaki.</p>
<p>Several minutes after starting the cooking, the takoyaki-making process was smoothly progressing under the guidance of Ai-san.</p>
<p>It seemed that Ai-san had previous experience in making Takoyaki.</p>

<p>“Alright, the first batch is ready! I’ll put them on everyone’s plates.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Ai-san skillfully placed Takoyaki on all of our plates.</p>

<p>“As expected of Ai. We can rely on you for cooking.”</p>
<p>“Even if you praise me, all you get in return is only Takoyaki. Go ahead, eat it.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Well then, itadakimasu.”</p>
<p>“Itadakimasu.”</p>

<p>The other members of the Astronomy Club also put their hands together following Yousuke-san’s lead.</p>
<p>The first to eat the takoyaki was Seto-san.</p>

<p>“…it’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“Ah, hearing that from Mio-chan makes me happy.”</p>

<p>After Seto-san, I also put a takoyaki in my mouth.</p>
<p>The freshly made Takoyaki was slightly hot and tasty.</p>

<p>“How is it, Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“It’s really good. Freshly made Takoyaki is the best.”</p>
<p>“High praise from Daiki-kun too! How about Kei?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t eaten yet.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Shimizu-san blew on the Takoyaki to cool it down before also taking a bite.</p>
<p>Ai-san watched her eagerly as she did so.</p>

<p>“Don’t stare so much…Well, it’s not bad, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Translated from Kei language, that means ‘delicious’ and ‘I love Onee-chan’!”</p>
<p>“The first half is fine, but the second half is a complete mistranslation.”</p>
<p>“So it was delicious then. That’s good.”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s positive thinking knows no bounds.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to ask me?”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to ask. I can practically read Yousuke’s stomach!”</p>

<p>Ai-san makes a fist-crushing gesture with her hand.</p>

<p>“With that move, you’re going to make Yousuke’s stomach explode.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s true that everything you cook is delicious.”</p>
<p>“Uh? W-well, yeah.”</p>

<p>Unusually, Ai-san seems flustered. It’s a rare sight to see.</p>

<p>“Heh.”</p>
<p>“What’s with that warm look in your eyes, Kei-kun(圭君)?”</p>
<p>“I was just thinking it must feel good to be praised by Yousuke.”</p>
<p>“I-It’s not like I’m happy to be praised by Yousuke or anything! Ah…I’m imitating Kei.”</p>
<p>“Your impersonation is way off. Are you trying to hide your embarrassment?”</p>
<p>“I’m not embarrassed, I’m actually proud of my cooking skills.”</p>
<p>“Can I have seconds, Ai-senpai?”</p>
<p>“Sure, seconds it is.”</p>

<p>And so, the first round of Takoyaki was consumed by everyone in high spirits.</p>

<p>“How about we change the cook for the second round? That way, everyone can participate and it’ll be more fun.”</p>

<p>As I say this, two people look a bit downcast.</p>

<p>“Sorry, but I don’t want to participate.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to cook either.”</p>
<p>“To the two not-good-at-cooking members of the Astronomy Club, making Takoyaki is fun, you know? It’s not scary, okay?”</p>

<p>It was one thing for Shimizu-san, but it was surprising to find out that even Yousuke-san wasn’t good at cooking.</p>

<p>“It’s not that I don’t do anything. I plan to work twice as hard on cleaning up. So, please let everyone else handle the Takoyaki making.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s true that forcing people is not good. In that case, how about Mio-chan or Daiki-kun give it a try?”</p>
<p>“Can I give it a try then?”</p>
<p>“Of course! So it’s settled, Daiki-kun will be making the second one!”</p>


<p>“It’s ready.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it smells great!”</p>

<p>I was initially worried about making the Takoyaki well, but thanks to Ai-san’s guidance, I managed to make some nicely shaped takoyaki.</p>

<p>“You’re good at this, Daiki-kun, probably because you cook often.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s all thanks to Ai-san’s guidance.”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe that’s part of it.”</p>

<p>Ai-san grinned mischievously.</p>

<p>“Should we go ahead and serve it up?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Using bamboo skewers, I placed Takoyaki on everyone’s plates.</p>
<p>Everyone started eating it at once, adding sauce and mayonnaise.</p>

<p>“It’s delicious.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the inside is perfect too.”</p>

<p>Relieved, I also put a takoyaki in my mouth. Just as everyone said, I’m glad it turned out well.</p>

<p>“How is it, Kei, eating Daiki-kun’s homemade cooking?”</p>
<p>“What’s with that way of asking?”</p>
<p>“Why not, just tell me what you think.”</p>
<p>“…Well, it’s not bad.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seemed satisfied, which put my mind at ease.</p>

<p>“You could be more honest, you know. You could say you wish it had been made just for you.”</p>
<p>“W-who would say something like that!”</p>
<p>“Well, whatever, let’s move on. Is Mio-chan up next?”</p>
<p>“No problem, but I have a question.”</p>
<p>“A question? Ask away, Senpai is here to help!”</p>
<p>“I heard that in a takoyaki, you can add ingredients other than octopus.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Besides octopus, we have things like sausages and cheese prepared in the fridge.”</p>
<p>“There’s something I’d like to try.”</p>

<p>With that, Seto-san went to the fridge alone and came back holding something.</p>
<p>A tube labeled ‘anko’ (sweet bean paste) was gripped in her hand.</p>

“…Wait, you’re not saying you want to try—”<p></p>
<p>“——Yes, I want to make takoyaki with anko as an ingredient.”</p>

<p>The kitchen fell silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“When did you prepare anko?”</p>
<p>“I bought it during yesterday’s shopping trip.”</p>
<p>“I did remember Mio-chan was quietly putting something in the basket yesterday, so it was that.”</p>
<p>“You’re supposed to like Dorayaki, not Takoyaki. Making Takoyaki with anko won’t make it dorayaki.”</p>
<p>“If there’s dough and there’s anko… it’s essentially dorayaki.”</p>
<p>“By your definition, even a large pancake or anything would be dorayaki, wouldn’t it?!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s sharp retort shone through.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’d like to give it a try. Don’t worry, if worst comes to worst, I’ll eat it all myself.”</p>
<p>“That’s just because you want to eat it.”</p>

<p>As everyone felt a sense of unease, the third challenger was decided.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“It’s done.”</p>

<p>The finished Takoyaki looked a bit misshapen but still appetizing.</p>

<p>“Everyone, get your plates ready.”</p>

<p>It seemed like everyone was slower to bring out their plates than before.</p>

<p>“Yousuke.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Say ‘ahh.’ “</p>
<p>“What the—what are you doing all of a sudden!? You’re planning to use me as a guinea pig, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? This is an ‘ahh’ from a beautiful girl; You don’t have a choice.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call yourself a beautiful girl.”</p>


<p>Despite his reservations, Yousuke took a bite of the Takoyaki while glancing at me and Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“…This isn’t bad, actually. It might even be better with some honey or something.”</p>
<p>“Really? Yousuke, do the ‘ahh.’ to me”</p>
<p>“Why do I have to say ‘ahh’ to you?”</p>
<p>“If I say ‘ahh’ to you, you have to say it back.”</p>
<p>“…Fine. ‘Ahh.’ “</p>

<p>Then Ai-san put the Takoyaki in her mouth with a smile.</p>

<p>“…Hmm! This is surprisingly good! It sort of feels like a Japanese-style dessert.”</p>
<p>“As I thought, anko is the best.”</p>

<p>Seto-san’s expression hadn’t changed, but she looked somewhat pleased.</p>

<p>“Now it’s your turn.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem that bad, so I’ll eat it.”</p>
<p>“So who’s going to say ‘ahh’ first?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I feel like Ai-san just suggested something incredible.</p>

<p>“Why do we have to say ‘ahh’ too?”</p>
<p>“I see-I see. Kei, you can’t beat the friendship level between Yousuke and me.”</p>
<p>“Don’t think I’ll just go along with something because you provoke me.”</p>
<p>“Whatever, it would be impossible for Kei anyway. You don’t have the courage for it.”</p>

<p>Ai-san flashed a wicked grin. I think I can see where this is going.</p>

<p>“…Fine.”</p>
<p>“What? I couldn’t hear you. Say it again?”</p>
<p>“Alright! I’ll do the ‘ahh’!”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san…”</p>

<p>I’m once again reminded of Shimizu-san’s lack of resistance to provocation.</p>

<p>“Hey, Hondō, let’s do it!”</p>
<p>“Uh, okay.”</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by Shimizu-san’s pressure, I unwittingly nodded.</p>
<p>It seems like there wasn’t really an option for me to refuse in the first place.</p>

<p>“Can I go first then?”</p>

<p>If one has to say ‘ahh’ and the other has to receive, it’s less embarrassing to be the one saying ‘ahh’.</p>

<p>“Sure, go ahead whenever.”</p>
<p>” ‘Ahh.’ “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san hesitated for a moment but then put the Takoyaki in her mouth.</p>

<p>“How was it, Kei? What do you think?”</p>
<p>“…it’s sweet.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I see.”</p>

<p>Ai-san is grinning as she looks at Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“No, I was wondering if the Takoyaki was sweet or if it was something else… Ah, don’t glare at me.”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who gave me a reason to glare.”</p>
<p>“It’s Daiki-kun’s turn next.”</p>
<p>“Don’t change the subject.”</p>
<p>“I’m not changing the subject. Come on, Kei, can you say ‘ahh’ to Daiki-kun?”</p>

<p>After glancing at me, Shimizu-san seems to resign herself and sticks a toothpick into a takoyaki.</p>

<p>“…’Ahh.’ “</p>

<p>Shimizu-san brings the takoyaki closer to me.</p>
<p>I don’t think her red face is due to the heat from the takoyaki heat.</p>
<p>There’s no point in hesitating now. I boldly put the Takoyaki in my mouth.</p>

<p>“How is it, Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“…It’s very sweet.”</p>

<p>Even though I said that, I actually was so nervous that I couldn’t really taste anything.</p>
