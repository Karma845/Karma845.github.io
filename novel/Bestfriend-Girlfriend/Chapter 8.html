<h1>Chapter 8: Gal and Friends</h1>


<p>Several days had passed since the day I played games with Tsumakawa after school.</p>

<p>It was a little past 5 in the afternoon, and I stayed a bit late for the manga club activity today, so I was heading towards the bicycle parking area alone.</p>
<p>As I was walking, I noticed Tsumakawa walking towards the school gate from a little ahead.</p>
<p>Since I didn’t have any particular business with her, I didn’t approach her or anything. I just watched her from behind.</p>
<p>But then, out of nowhere, a male student appeared and walked up beside her, fitting closely by her side.</p>
<p>In response to that, Tsumakawa’s face lit up slightly, and she started chatting happily with him.</p>
<p>Upon closer look, the male student next to her was someone I knew too—Shōta Horito.</p>

<p>He was my classmate and also a member of Tsumakawa’s popular group, skilled in soccer and quite popular among girls.  </p>

<p>“By the way——Really——me——playing with Yoda——yesterd——together——is really fun.”</p>
<p>“Miona——you really seem——care about him——.Next time——introduce——okay?”  </p>

<p>I couldn’t quite grasp the content of their conversation.</p>
<p>However, Tsumakawa and her male friend from the class were engaged in quite a friendly chat.  </p>

<p>” ….. ”  </p>

<p>As I watched them, I found myself standing still, lost in thought.</p>
<p>I hadn’t really paid much attention when we were in a group, but the sight of Tsumakawa and Hotori walking together like that inevitably looked like a couple deeply in love to an outside observer.</p>
<p>…I’m sure eventually, Tsumakawa will come to me and say something like, ‘Hey, Yoda, I’ve got a boyfriend~.’  </p>

<p>In the end, she’s not any different from the female singer or idol I was rooting for.</p>
<p>She just makes me hope for the best, but in the end, it’s bound to turn out that way.</p>
<p>It’s not like Tsumakawa is a terrible woman. Women, in general, are just like that by nature.  </p>

<p>“…sigh…”  </p>

<p>I guess three-dimensional reality is really just a mess.</p>
<p>As I thought this, I averted my gaze from them and started walking towards the bicycle parking area.</p>
<p>Even though I should have understood that I was just being teased, why do I feel like this?</p>
<p>Maybe we otaku are just too easily infatuated. There’s no way someone like me would be considered by someone popular like her.  </p>

<p>“Real-life girls suck…”  </p>

<p>In an attempt to distract from the rising frustration, I muttered these words, but the real problem is not that; it’s that I’m trying to simplify things with such harsh words.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa hasn’t really done anything cruel to me…She’s just going home from school with a male friend, and I don’t even know if the two of them are dating.</p>
<p>Yet, I arbitrarily felt as if I was betrayed by Tsumakawa-san, which made me feel terribly down.</p>
<p>This is probably more a feeling of childishness emotion than jealousy or such emotions.</p>

<p>What’s the accurate word for it?</p>
<p>Maybe it’s resignation——probably because I can’t establish that kind of relationship with Tsumakawa.  </p>
<p>As I watched Hotori walking slowly beside her to match her pace, I thought…</p>
<p>Ah, I see. I probably didn’t want to confront that fact directly, so I brought up my usual theory that ‘reality is a mess’ and tried to conveniently dismiss Tsumakawa as another trashy girl with a boyfriend behind my back.</p>
<p>But it’s not true. Tsumakawa is probably different from the girls I’ve been let down by——But I wonder if this is just something I want to believe…  </p>

<p>“I really don’t get this anymore…”  </p>

<p>I tried to sort it out in my head, but it didn’t quite come together.</p>
<p>In any case, all I know now is that I’m terribly uncool and lame as a person for thinking so much about a scene where an acquaintance gal simply walks with her male friend (or maybe boyfriend?).  </p>
<p>It’s just sad what kind of creatures we are, a sulky otaku… I hope at least the two-dimensional world and my mom will treat me kindly forever.  </p>

<p>***  </p>

<p>The next day, after homeroom had ended without any issues, it was after school.</p>
<p>As I was getting ready to leave at my desk, she casually appeared beside me and started talking to me.  </p>

<p>“Hey, Isono——. Let’s go to McDonald’s together.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Isono? And McDonald’s… Why?”</p>
<p>“Uh, why…? Honestly, I just felt like having a shake right now, so I invited you, Yoda…”</p>
<p>“If you don’t have a clear reason, I won’t budge under any circumstances…”</p>
<p>“…Why do I always have to come up with a convincing reason when I invite Yoda? That is so annoying.”  </p>

<p>After Tsumakawa muttered this, she crossed her arms and began pondering.</p>
<p>Even if it’s annoying, why doesn’t she just give up if she thinks it’s annoying?</p>
<p>With that question in mind, she seemed to have a realization and lifted her fist.  </p>

<p>“If you don’t come to McDonald’s with me, I’ll punch you in the face?”</p>
<p>“That’s such a lame reason! That’s just a threat, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Well, because I don’t have any reason every time I invite Yoda. Do you think Yoda contemplates things like ‘I have to pee for this and that reason!’ when needing to pee? You just pee when you need to, right? It’s the same.”</p>
<p>“Um, Tsumakawa-san? I understand what you’re saying, but maybe girls shouldn’t repeatedly talk about needing to use the restroom so much…”</p>
<p>“Hey, Yoda, don’t you think you have too many illusions about girls? Girls casually say words like ‘pee’ too. ——Pee pee pee pee pee.”</p>
<p>“Don’t repeat it five times in a row like we’re playing a game! What kind of girl are you?”</p>
<p>“If you want me to stop saying ‘pee’ to you, why don’t you come to McDonald’s with me?” “That’s a new way of making threats…”  </p>

<p>Even though I retorted, I didn’t want to be hit in the face or hear vulgar words, so I reluctantly agreed to go to McDonald’s with Tsumakawa.</p>
<p>And so, after finishing preparations to leave, I walked out of the classroom with her. Then Tsumakawa bid farewell to her main group by the classroom door.  </p>

<p>“See you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Later.”</p>
<p>“See you later, Miona——”</p>

<p>For some reason, the exchange of farewell greetings, ‘See you, Miona,’ left an impression on me.</p>
<p>And so, as we descended the stairs, Tsumakawa started her story with an introduction like, ‘You see, yesterday, Kanachamu couldn’t sleep, so she called me late at night…”</p>
<p>While changing to our outdoor shoes, I listened to her story, and we both headed toward the bicycle parking area to retrieve my bike.</p>


<p>“Hey, Yoda, if you have a bike, want to do Niketsu?”</p>
<p>“Niketsu, you mean riding together?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it means like riding a bike together. Isn’t that kind of like a romantic comedy? Doesn’t it spark love or something?”</p>
<p>“…Riding together is just a violation of traffic laws, and rather than sparking love, it’s more about violating the law and sparking guilt.”</p>

<p>While having that conversation, we arrived at the bicycle parking area.</p>
<p>It seemed Tsumakawa commuted by train, as I’d seen before, so only I was pushing my bicycle along.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the school gate, Tsumakawa said to me again</p>

<p>“Alright then, let’s do Niketsu!”</p>
<p>“Eh… I mean, I don’t really want to commit a misdemeanor…”</p>
<p>“Well, just try it once. If there are cops around, you can just stop immediately.”</p>
<p>“Don’t call the police ‘copsサツ’ when you’re not against them, okay?”</p>

<p>While saying this, I climbed onto the saddle of my bicycle.</p>
<p>Then, Tsumakawa straddled the back of my bicycle and put her arm around my stomach!?</p>

<p>Whoa, whoa, wait! W-wait a minute!</p>

<p>“T-Tsumakawa-san…? Is there nowhere else you can hold on to other than hugging me from behind?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“No? …I-Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I could lean back and hold onto the rear handle for stability, but—I won’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Even though there are other ways,, why won’t you do that?”</p>
<p>“Okay, enough. Can we just start moving already? Let’s do something romantic for a change!”</p>

<p>With those words, Tsumakawa began to tap my back playfully.</p>
<p>Gals are too casual with their physical contact!</p>
<p>If she suddenly hug and squeeze my stomach, an otaku with no immunity to girls like me could easily fall in love!</p>

<div><img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g10.png" alt="" />

<p>…Huh, fall in love?</p>
<p>No, I’m not really bothered by this. Yeah, I’m not bothered at all.</p>
<p>If I had to point out something abnormal, it would be that my heart rate is at around 200 BPM, yeah——Wait, isn’t that dangerously fast!?</p>
<p>After joking around in my brain like that, I started pedaling my bicycle——Then I heard Tsumakawa’s puzzled voice from behind me.</p>

<p>“Whoa… Wait… Aren’t we swaying too much!?”</p>
<p>“Haa, haa, haa, haa——Pedal, pedal harder! We need to hold on!”</p>
<p>“You’re putting so much effort into this, huh… Wait, no? The two-person rides I know are more like, ‘Oh, the wind feels so good!’ and have a sense of ‘Ehehe, ahaha!’ about them! Why does it feel like we’re on a small boat going through a big storm?!”</p>
<p>“Haa, haa, haa——Ooh…My right leg… I’m begging you! Please hold and take me to the McDonald——”</p>
<p>“That’s enough. I’m getting off this small boat——<br />and don’t look so tired. That’s disrespectful!”</p>
<p>“Haa, haa, haa——By the way, Tsumakawa-san. Right now, a question comes to mind… Is this phenomenon happening because I’m weak or because of Tsumakawa-san’s weight? Which one is it?”</p>
<p>“The fact that you’re doubting my weight makes you a failure as a man!”</p>

<p>As soon as I stopped the bicycle, Tsumakawa, who had just dismounted from the bike hit my shoulder with those words…It’s understandable to be hit…</p>
<p>But as someone who had been slandered as weak, I couldn’t help but ask…!</p>
<p>And so, after our two-person bike ride failed, we headed to the nearest train station on foot.</p>
<p>After leaving the bicycles at the bike parking near the station, we took the train and headed to Omiya Station, where the McDonald’s was located.</p>
<p>By the way, right after the failed Niketsu attempt, Tsumakawa, who seemed unhappy, said, ‘It’s not like I’m that fat, seriously… So it’s not my fault… but I feel down for some reason…’</p>

<p>Now, she seemed to have gotten over it and returned to her usual cheerful mood.</p>
<p>And so, as the two of us stood side by side in the train, holding onto the straps of the train, for some reason, Tsumakawa suddenly looked up at me with upward eyes, gazing at me meekly, and said,</p>

<p>“Hey, you know, I’ve never had an after-school date with a boy before… Ehehe…”</p>
<p>“Can you please stop making such obvious and cheesy comments? Besides, this isn’t an after-school date… and honestly, there’s no way someone like you, a sparkling gal like Tsumakawa, never had after-school dates before…”</p>
<p>“Hehe, can’t you just believe me for once? I’m serious. Well, if I keep saying ‘I’m serious’, it might not sound as serious, so I won’t emphasize it too much. But seriously, I’m serious.”</p>
<p>“I think you don’t want me to believe you anymore…By the way, Tsumakawa-san? I saw you and Horito, a classmate, walking home together yesterday. Wasn’t that an after-school date?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that? That’s because he decided to go out for dinner, and I just happened to leave school at the same time as Shōta, that’s why we use the same road together. It wasn’t like we went off somewhere alone together, you know?”</p>
<p>“…Ah, I see…”</p>
<p>“Huh?… Jealous? Yoda, are you jealous because I was with another guy? ——Ah, I’m so happy! I mean, Yoda hasn’t told me that he likes me much, right? That’s why I’m super happy that you said you were jealous seeing me with Horito! You should keep saying more things like that in the future!”</p>
<p>“Um, Tsumakawa-san? I’m not jealous, so stop trying to make it seem like I was.”</p>

<p>I said in reply, but Tsumakawa-san simply responded with a ‘Sure, sure, I got it,’ not acknowledging my statement…</p>
<p>It’s slightly irritating to be misunderstood like that…I’m not jealous!</p>

<p>After that conversation on the train, an hour later.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Hey, Yoda. What are you spacing out for? Are you listening to me?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, sorry… I wasn’t listening…”</p>
<p>“Come on. Don’t leave me alone when I’m here with you.”</p>

<p>I was snapped back to attention by Tsumakawa-san’s words.</p>
<p>We were currently at a McDonald’s near Omiya Station.</p>
<p>Since the restaurant was quiet today, we were sitting facing each other at a table with two two-seater sofas, nibbling on fries, and having a light conversation.</p>

<p>Looking around, I could see men in suits who seemed like new office workers, university students with their laptops open, and high school couples in uniforms…</p>
<p>I wonder if people see us as a couple too?</p>
<p>After pondering that briefly, I found myself smiling a little.</p>


<p>“So, what were we talking about?”</p>
<p>“I said…When cocoa is exported, it tends to be bought cheaply by foreign countries, right? That’s why the wages of the workers in the producing countries are low. It’s because the value of cocoa and the money that goes to the producing country don’t match up, so we need to think about it a bit.”</p>
<p>“Were we talking about such socially conscious topics?! Aren’t we too highly conscious as a high school student?!”</p>
<p>“Because social dominance is absolution to the extent that a noisy minority pushes it primitively. That’s why, if it comes to that, we should comport the peaches!”</p>
<p>“Don’t start listing incomprehensible words that you don’t even understand the meaning of. And somehow, I crave peaches now.”</p>
<p>“By the way, don’t you think canned peaches taste good?”</p>
<p>“Let’s calm down… Let’s keep the conversation within my understanding range…”</p>

<p>When I mentioned that, Tsumakawa-san chuckled and then continued with a smile.</p>

<p>“Sorry, what I said earlier was a lie. We weren’t talking about such things at all… We were just discussing light novels like usual.”</p>
<p>“I see… So we’re not a highly conscious individual, huh…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, changing the subject a bit… Look at this! When I went to Animate the other day, they had an acrylic keychain of ‘Megumin’ from ‘KonoSuba,’ so I bought it! Isn’t it super cute?”</p>

<p>While saying this, Tsumakawa-san placed her school bag on the table and showed off the acrylic keychain attached to her bag to me.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s cute…”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s really nice, isn’t it? It’s so cute, I love it!”</p>

<p>To be honest, I’m the kind of otaku who would spend money on buying more books rather than these kinds of merchandise… but I see.</p>
<p>Seeing items like these, I’d be tempted to spend my money too.</p>
<p>While I was thinking that, I noticed that there were several more keychains hanging from her bag.</p>
<p>Looking at one of them, I unintentionally made a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>“…This might be irrelevant, but Tsumakawa-san, there’s a keychain with a logo inside a double circle with blue and green tones, and ‘F’ written in white letters… Is that, by any chance——”</p>
<p>“Oh, you got it? Hehe… This is the Fantasia Bunko logo!”</p>
<p>“Who would want such a weird keychain like that?”</p>

<p>Looking at the keychain resembling the Fantasia Bunko logo, I couldn’t help but comment out loud.</p>
<p>What kind of sentiment does Tsumakawa-san have when attaching this to her bag…?</p>

<p>“You know how even for idols there’s a thing called supporting the whole group instead of just one member? It’s the same as that.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you mean supporting a specific publishing label? Well, if you put it that way, it’s not too strange to have a keychain resembling a light novel label logo… I guess?”</p>
<p>“Seriously, is this really good? I don’t get what’s so good about it though.”</p>
<p>“You don’t get it either, Tsumakawa-san? …But this keychain is amazing! Someone wouldn’t buy this unless they truly love light novels… Minacho-san, you’re such a passionate light novel reader, huh?”</p>
<p>“Ehehe, maybe? But, you know, I bought an extra one just in case. Want me to give it to you?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I don’t want it.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t want it?”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa-san pretended to get angry at my nonchalant response.</p>
<p>Then, after taking a sip of her vanilla shake and placing it down, she continued speaking with a cheerful smile.</p>

<p>“Hehe… Well, I was really in the mood for a shake today, so I’m really chillin’ right now. Thanks for coming along, Yoda.”</p>
<p>“…To be honest, I do feel like I’m being forced to go along with you…”</p>
<p>“Hehe… You’re surprisingly easygoing, and you never really turn down my invitations, so can you please stop with that ‘Reject any advances from real-life girls,’ Yoda? I mean, you do enjoy hanging out with Miona, right? Then don’t make things complicated by trying to reject me every time.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve been brought along to this point because I couldn’t refuse your invitations, but deep down, the true me wants to reject your invitations. That’s why I’m here right now, being swept along with the flow. It makes me feel like I’m doing something wrong…”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘doing something wrong’? Stop using vague words out of nowhere… I mean, aren’t we friends already? No matter what your values are, if we’re friends, you don’t have to keep turning down my invitations all the time, right?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Tsumakawa-san. Can I just say a few words?”</p>

<p>Without waiting for Tsumakawa-san to respond, I cut her off and took a sip of the ginger ale I had just purchased.</p>
<p>Then, after moistening my throat, I looked at Tsumakawa-san, who was tilting her head in confusion, and said this.</p>
<p>This had been on my mind since yesterday when I saw her walking with Hori in the corridor.</p>

<p>“I really am not Tsumakawa-san’s friend and… we can’t be friends.”</p>

<p>The moment I uttered those words, Tsumakawa-san’s soft smile vanished from her face.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Then, after a brief moment of lowering her gaze with a hint of sadness, she lifted her head, her expression turning ice-cold, and asked quietly.</p>

<p>“…Why? Even though we’re having so much fun…I enjoy being with you, Yoda. So why would you say something like that? It doesn’t make sense. Weren’t you having fun being with me?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I meant. It’s not like that——”</p>
<p>“Then it’s even less clear. If being together is fun, why can’t we just be friends? Seriously, you’ve insisted on it for some reason, and it’s kind of creepy. In the end, you’re just being weirdly too stubborn to accept me. That’s called narrow-minded.”</p>
<p>“…What Tsumakawa-san said is true… But there’s one thing I want you to know. It’s not because you’re at fault that we can’t be friends… it’s more like there’s an issue on my side…”</p>
<p>“I already know that. It’s not Mona’s fault at all. It’s because you’re being selfish and won’t accept me… Even if I try my best, Yoda won’t look my way… It’s all your fault!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa’s emotions flared up as she raised her voice, but she immediately lowered her head and apologized.</p>

<p>“Sorry, it’s not right for me to yell…”</p>

<p>Apologizing right away for becoming emotional like that is quite impressive…</p>
<p>While being slightly impressed by this, I looked down at the cup on the table.</p>

<p>I spoke out of line now, I didn’t need to go out of my way to cause a stir by saying I can’t be friends with Tsumakawa-san…</p>
<p>What am I really trying to accomplish by earnestly trying to confront her?</p>
<p>I thought so, but it’s too late now.</p>

<p>Having angered Tsumakawa-san and made her look like she’s about to cry, I can only continue speaking to fulfill my responsibility to explain, despite not having sorted out my own feelings yet.</p>

<p>“When I saw you and Horito walking side by side yesterday… it’s just that… well, I felt like… ‘I can’t become like him,’ you know?”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. Do you want to become Shota? Do you want to walk home with me? You can do that whenever you want. If you want that, I will——”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it. It’s not about wanting to walk home with you… It’s just that, seeing you two together like it’s perfectly natural… I felt like… I can’t do that…”</p>
<p>“…Why?”</p>
<p>“After all, I am… I have no redeeming features…I’m nothing but an otaku…”</p>
<p>“——”</p>

<p>By putting it into words like that, I became aware of the feelings I had for Horito…</p>
<p>It was just a sense of inferiority.</p>

<p>I only have two friends in the class. I like light novels and games, but I’m not particularly skilled at them.</p>
<p>I work part-time because I need money, but I’m constantly scolded by the manager and seniors.</p>
<p>Even in my studies, I can only manage to avoid failing.</p>

<p>There’s nothing I can be proud of, and I haven’t achieved anything. Despite that, it would be too brazen to become friends with someone like Tsumakawa-san, who’s already modeling at my age…</p>
<p>At that moment, the other me told me, ‘How can a nobody like you be with her who is adored by everyone in the class, just like Horito?’</p>

<p>“I don’t think I’m the right person to be next to Tsumakawa-san. So, even when Tsumakawa-san invited me to be friends, I couldn’t accept it… whoops, it seems like this conversation is getting heavy, but really, it’s not that serious. It’s just that I think Tsumakawa-san and I should live separately as human beings, that’s all.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“There’s no law that says you have to be someone who’s worthy of being friends with others. So, from Tsumakawa-san’s perspective, you might be thinking, ‘What is this guy talking about?’ But honestly, it’s not about others. It’s because I haven’t accepted myself. As long as I think that way, I’ll probably never become Tsumakawa-san’s friend…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“In the end, the reason I can’t become friends with Tsumakawa-san isn’t because you’re a real-life girl who eventually would betray me…Well, I might just be getting deceived, but I can no longer dislike Tsumakawa-san as I did before and label you as ‘a woman who will eventually betray me,’ just like Yuna-chan and ArlSU… uh, of course, that doesn’t mean I like Tsumakawa-san in that way…please don’t get carried away.”</p>
<p>“I’m not getting carried away, so don’t tell me not to.”</p>
<p>“I-I see… So, well, uh… In short, I’m a person with low self-esteem, twisted in my own way. Because of that, I can’t be friends with Tsumakawa-san. It’s absolutely unnecessary for Tsumakawa-san to get angry or sad about it…”</p>

<p>After speaking up to that point, I realized what a lengthy and embarrassing speech I had given.</p>
<p>Oh no… I started talking without properly organizing my thoughts and ended up expressing emotions I didn’t intend to share! This is the worst!</p>

<p>But well, the pathetic sense of inferiority I just spoke of is my true feelings, and only I understand those feelings…</p>
<p>I get it, Yoda. You’re not wrong. Your inferiority complex about not being someone worthy enough to stand next to Tsumakawa is not mistaken!——It’s this self-affirmation that’s fundamentally wrong!</p>
<p>As I reflected this way, Tsumakawa, sitting right in front of me, suddenly stood up and moved toward me——Then she sat down on the two-seater sofa where I was sitting.</p>
<p>As a result, she was now directly on my right, and my right shoulder and her left shoulder were touching.</p>

<p>“Uh… Wh-why did you come and sit next to me?”</p>

<p>In response to my question, Tsumakawa didn’t say anything; she just gave me a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>Then, she slowly spread her arms wide——</p>

<p>Without any warning, she enveloped my head with her arms and held me against her chest.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g11.png" alt="" />


<p>“Ah—!? Tsumakawa-san!?”</p>

<p>Naturally, my face was buried in the ample cleavage of Tsumakawa-san.</p>
<p>The sensation of her soft breasts transmitted through my entire face, and in an instant, an electric current seemed to surge through my brain.</p>
<p>W-what’s happening? Why am I being tightly embraced by a gyaru right now?</p>

<p>Her uniform smells like lavender. While feeling the softness of her breasts with my entire face, there was a somewhat firm part too, probably the bra…</p>
<p>When I thought about it that way, I started feeling seriously aroused. Someone, please kill me…</p>
<p>While I was panicking, Tsumakawa-san inexplicably let out a soft ‘hehe’ and then leaned closer to my ear, whispering…</p>

<p>“Hey. Yoda, you’re really a big idiot, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>With a bewitching voice, those words were spoken, and my heart raced really fast.</p>
<p>…T-T-Tsumakawa-san, isn’t it quite audacious of you to suddenly bury someone else’s face in your cleavage like this?</p>
<p>While I protested inwardly, unable to voice my disagreement, she continued speaking cheerfully while still holding me close.</p>

<p>“Why do you need to accept yourself to become my friend? It’s all about your intentions, okay? If you like me, you can become friends. If you don’t like me, you don’t have to. Does it really matter whether you have ‘value’ or not?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Besides, I’ve found your value. You don’t have to look for it anymore.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>At Tsumakawa’s kind words, my eyes started to well up with tears for a moment.</p>
<p>…Of course, I’m not crying.</p>
<p>I’m definitely not crying, but…I felt ashamed of myself for feeling a little saved just because Tsumakawa said that to me.</p>
<p>Afterward, Tsumakawa gently released my head from her embrace. So, I quickly moved my blushing face away from her chest.</p>

<p>Seriously, what was that just now?</p>
<p>How much is the service fee for burying your face in a gal’s cleavage?</p>
<p>As I was thinking that, Tsumakawa-san’s face also turned red, and with an embarrassed expression, she giggled cutely.</p>
<p>Um, why is the one who hugged me acting all embarrassed like this?</p>
<p>Isn’t it strange?</p>
<p>You were the one who initiated the action, right?</p>

<p>While I was thinking that way, she continued with the conversation.</p>

<p>“But even if I recognize your value, Yoda, you can’t recognize yourself, can you? Like you said, it’s not about wanting someone else to recognize you. You can’t feel like you can be my friend unless you recognize yourself.”</p>
<p>“… Minacho-san, you’re really understanding…”</p>
<p>“Understanding, but I can’t empathize! Seriously! I don’t get it at all. I don’t care if we’re actually mismatched! I mean, we’re not even mismatched! I think so, but you don’t… Yoda, you’re being stubborn about not becoming friends with me according to your own values, right?”</p>
<p>“W-Well, being stubborn is a bit…”</p>
<p>“You’re being stubborn! Seriously, you’re so hopeless, Yoda… but… It can’t be helped, it’s fine for now.”</p>

<p>While saying that, Tsumakawa-san moved my right hand onto the table without asking, and she placed her hand on top of mine.</p>
<p>Even though I found this gal’s level of physical contact today to be a bit intense and I showed a bewildered expression, she pretended not to notice and intertwined her left hand with my right one, initiating the entwining of our fingers as if we were lovers.</p>
<p>And with an amused smile, Tsumakawa continued.</p>

<p>“Honestly, I don’t really understand what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“I-I see, you don’t really understand…”</p>
<p>“But——I know it’s not because you dislike me. So, can we continue like this, not becoming friends but still being together?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Even if there is a part of you that can’t accept being with me, please continue to be with me from now on.”</p>
<p>…I wonder for a moment if it’s okay to do that.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I saw Horito beside Tsumakawa, I thought I couldn’t be like that… So, I concluded that I couldn’t become friends with Tsumakawa-san anymore—yet staying together without becoming friends, is that really the right thing to do?</p>
<p>After all, from an outsider’s perspective, we’re just——</p>

<p>While contemplating, I gently loosened the hand that she was holding.</p>
<p>Then, I adjusted my position and turned to face Tsumakawa-san. In response to her, ‘Even if there is a part of you that can’t accept being with me, please continue to be with me from now on.’ I replied,</p>

<p>“Actively being with Tsumakawa-san from my side might still be beyond me… but from now on. I won’t use the excuse that real-life girls suck to reject being with you anymore…”</p>
<p>“You’re giving such an unsatisfying answer, you idiot.”</p>

<p>In response to my conclusion, Tsumakawa interjected with a playful tone, then burst into a lively laugh.</p>
<p>Wait… What I just said was quite personal and serious for me, so why am I being laughed at…?</p>

<p>Anyway, I conveyed to her my conclusion that due to my inferiority complex——I couldn’t be friends with a gal, and in response, she said it was fine to be together anyway.</p>
<p>As a result of the discussion, despite all the back and forth, our relationship remained unchanged.</p>

<p>…On another note, why does Tsumakawa continue to have a relationship with such an awkward otaku like me?</p>
<p>Is her tolerance level as a gal off the charts? Her tolerance is at the mom level.</p>

<p>Maybe from now on, I should call Tsumakawa ‘Saitama Mother (Saitama no haha)’ .</p>
<p>…Well, when I return home, the ‘Saitama Mother’ is there too!</p>
<p>But that’s my real mother. Let’s not refer to your actual mom as if she’s a fortune teller or something.</p>
<p>(TN: I don’t get this joke. Saitama probably refers to Saitama Prefecture, but the terms ‘Saitama Mother’ and ‘fortune teller’ in this context confuse me.)</p>
