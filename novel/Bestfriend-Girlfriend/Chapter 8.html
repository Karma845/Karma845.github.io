<h2>Chapter 8: Special Training At Night</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>“…Um, is it okay if I intrude on my homeroom teacher’s home?”</p>



<p>“Aria tends to be pushy, but this time it’s my problem so I have no choice. Just please keep this between us.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei invited me into her apartment reluctantly. Perhaps because I came in my uniform, I could sense her inner conflict.</p>



<p>While she usually left a strict impression at school, seeing her in a pastel-colored casual outfit with bare legs and no makeup created a much softer vibe. Her long hair was tied into a low side ponytail.</p>



<p>“Hey, Sumi-kun, I get that you’re mesmerized by Shizuru-chan, but don’t just stand there. Hurry up and take your shoes off.”</p>



<p>“R-right.”</p>



<p>“The strategy meeting has already started. I’m counting on you,” Aria-san said, leaving me behind as she leisurely headed towards the inner room.</p>



<p>“…Excuse me then.”</p>



<p>“…Please come in.”</p>



<p>Perhaps my nervousness was contagious, as Kanzaki-sensei also looked somewhat awkward. It was only natural for a high school boy to feel bewildered when entering the home of an older, beautiful woman, especially if she was their homeroom teacher.</p>



<p>To ensure privacy, the door neatly divided the entrance from the rest of the room.</p>



<p>When I opened it, I saw Aria-san casually took off her clothes as if it was the most natural thing.</p>



<p>“W-why are you doing that?”</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s just a habit of mine. I’ll change right away. Look the other way if it bothers you.”</p>



<p>Aria-san was changing her clothes in Kanzaki-sensei’s living room. She was still as carefree as ever.</p>



<p>“Aria! Go to the bedroom right now!”</p>



<p>“Come on, it’s fine! I only show this side to people I trust.”</p>



<p>“I’m here too, you know.”</p>



<p>“You’ve already seen me naked before, so what’s the big deal?” She casually exposed me.</p>



<p>“S-Sena-san!?”</p>



<p>“That was just an accident, I swear!” I recounted the incident when I visited the Arisaka household to Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“But isn’t Aria’s attitude a bit too laid-back?”</p>



<p>“She just doesn’t see me as a guy because I’m her sister’s boyfriend!” </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Aria-san returned from the bedroom after changing clothes.</p>



<p>She was wearing glossy summer loungewear. The camisole revealed more skin than usual, and the loose shorts had a wide hem.</p>



<p>They both seemed accustomed to this routine, probably often dressing up like this and having sleepovers.</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan, I’m starving. Oh, could I get a beer?” Aria-san, fully in relaxation mode, promptly started her evening drink with a can of beer from the fridge.</p>



<p>Oi, what about the strategy meeting?</p>



<p>“Um, Sensei, is there anything I can help with?”</p>



<p>“Then please bring chopsticks and tableware to the table.”</p>



<p>Feeling somewhat idle, I obediently followed Kanzaki-sensei’s instructions.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei’s apartment was as neat and orderly as her personality. The furniture, kept to a minimum and unified in color, had a cohesive feel, and everything seemed to have its designated place. There was a work desk and chair, shelves for documents and books, a lush potted plant, a large sofa with a coffee table, and a wall-mounted TV.</p>



<p>However, the cluttered pile of marriage candidate photos in the corner was the only thing that truly reflected Kanzaki-sensei’s mental state. Keeping them instead of discarding them was very much like her.</p>



<p>“Alright, cheers!” </p>



<p>Aria-san raised her glass and led the toast.</p>



<p>The two adults enjoyed their drinks while I, being underage, sipped on cola.</p>



<p>“Now, let’s be impressed by Shizuru-chan’s cooking!” </p>



<p>“Why are you looking so excited, Aria-san?”</p>



<p>Having already finished one beer, Aria-san was clearly in high spirits. Although she had called it a strategy meeting, it seemed more like a drinking session at home. On the table sat a steaming pot. </p>



<p>“Why hot pot in the summer?” I asked.</p>



<p>“It’s Aria’s request for kimchi jjigae hot pot.”</p>



<p>The red pot simmered with plenty of vegetables, mushrooms, pork, and seafood, enticing enough to awaken anyone’s appetite. However—</p>



<p>“It looks incredibly spicy.”</p>



<p>“It’s best to eat spicy food in hot weather ~”</p>



<p>Aria-san deliberately turned off the room’s air conditioning and began serving three portions onto plates.</p>



<p>With each bite, a harmonious blend of sweet veggies, pork, and spicy soup danced on my palate. The layered spiciness of the soup enhanced the flavor, making it overwhelmingly delicious.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei then handed me a bowl of white rice. I mixed the hot pot ingredients with the rice and eagerly devoured them, my chopsticks moving non-stop. It was seriously delicious. In no time, my bowl was empty.</p>



<p>“Would you like seconds?”</p>



<p>“Yes, please.”</p>



<p>A young body couldn’t resist such appetite.</p>



<p>“You two are getting along well already,” Aria-san remarked cheerfully, her drink having changed from beer to highball without me noticing.</p>



<p>She swiftly poured whiskey over ice in a glass, topped it with chilled soda water, and stirred. Her pace was rapid as she was immediately preparing another refill.</p>



<p>“Will she be okay drinking at such a fast pace? Her face is quite red,” I expressed my concern while glancing at Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“Aria can hold her liquor and knows her limits. Although, she tends to crash here after getting tipsy.”</p>



<p>“Your complexion doesn’t change, sensei.”</p>



<p>“I only indulge lightly,” she replied, sipping on a sweet cocktail.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei maintained her grace even during meals, displaying impeccable manners. Although she drank, her complexion remained unchanged.</p>



<p>“Stop whispering, Sumi-kun. Here, since it’s spicy, would you like another cola?” Aria-san, being considerate, poured a fresh cola for me.</p>



<p>“Hmm, this cola tastes kind of off.”</p>



<p>“It’s just your imagination! Your taste buds are numb from the spiciness!”</p>



<p>Indeed, my tongue felt slightly numb, making it hard to discern the sweetness of the cola.</p>



<p>“Boys really eat a lot, huh? No wonder Aria asked me to make more than usual today,” Kanzaki-sensei remarked, impressed by my appetite.</p>



<p>“Should I hold back a bit more?”</p>



<p>“No, I’m glad to see you finish everything I’ve cooked.”</p>



<p>“Here, Sumi-kun, let me refill your plate. Don’t hold back.”</p>



<p>“Thanks,” I passed my empty plate to Aria-san, who was serving the hot pot.</p>



<p>And just like that, dinner proceeded in a warm and jovial atmosphere.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Eating spicy food in a hot room with the air conditioning off naturally raised body temperature. </p>



<p>Aria-san seemed prepared for this since she was dressed lightly from the start. Even Kanzaki-sensei had taken off her apron and any extra layers she had without minding my presence, leaving me increasingly unsure where to direct my gaze.</p>



<p>“Huh, Sumi-kun? Why is your face all red?” </p>



<p>“The capsaicin is making me feel hot. Shouldn’t we turn on the AC soon?”</p>



<p>“That means you lose and you should do a penalty game.”</p>



<p>“Since when did this turn into a contest of endurance?” </p>



<p>“Hey, no talking back!”</p>



<p>Alcohol seemed to amplify Aria-san’s cheerful demeanor threefold, but despite her beauty, dealing with her inebriated state was more bothersome than anything.</p>



<p>“It’s impressive how you can handle Aria-san when she’s like this, sensei.”</p>



<p>“I’ve gotten used to it,” Kanzaki-sensei sighed in resignation.</p>



<p>“Hehe, I love that about you, Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>Just then, the phone rang. Kanzaki-sensei’s smartphone lit up. As soon as she saw the caller ID, her expression darkened.</p>



<p>“Who’s calling?” </p>



<p>“It’s my mother.”</p>



<p>“You’re not going to answer? Ignoring her will only make things worse later, won’t it?” </p>



<p>“I can already tell it’s about arranged marriage proposals.”</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan, that’s why we’re here. If the enemy attacks, we have to fight back. I’ll be right here to give you instructions if anything happens. Put it on speaker so we can all hear.”</p>



<p>Aria-san muted the TV and placed a finger to her lips, signaling me to stay quiet. Kanzaki-sensei placed her smartphone on the table and answered the call.</p>



<p>“Hello, mother,” she responded nervously.</p>



<p><em>“You finally answered, Shizuru-san.” </em></p>



<p>A stern voice came from the other end.</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry, I just got home,” Kanzaki-sensei stammered.</p>



<p><em>“You seem to be very busy with work. It’s good to be diligent, but your father is worried. We need to set a date for the arranged marriage soon,” </em>her mother pressed without preamble.</p>



<p>“I’ve said this before, but I want to focus on my work for now. I’ll have to decline the marriage proposal.”</p>



<p><em>“In these uncertain times, it’s crucial to have a stable partner and family. We’re worried since you’ve always had trouble asserting yourself.”</em></p>



<p>“I appreciate your concern, but—”</p>



<p><em>“Shizuru-san, you can’t turn back time once you regret it. Even if you’re hesitant now, you’ll feel relieved later. As your parents, it’s our responsibility to find a suitable partner for you.”</em></p>



<p>While Kanzaki-sensei was still talking, her mother forcefully pushed the conversation forward. </p>



<p>Wait, was I supposed to play the role of her boyfriend against this aggressive opponent? Wasn’t this too much pressure?</p>



<p>Aria-san looked amused after seeing my expression.</p>



<p>Feeling cornered, Kanzaki-sensei executed her plan with the urgency of someone leaping from the stage.</p>



<p>“Um, actually, I have a boyfriend! We’re serious about each other and thinking about our future together! That’s why I can’t accept any arranged marriage!” Kanzaki-sensei blurted out, her voice uncharacteristically loud and rushed.</p>



<p><em>“…Then you should introduce him to us immediately.”</em></p>



<p>Her mother replied without missing a beat, showing no sign of surprise or confusion as if she had known all along. How resilient was this woman? Couldn’t she at least waver a bit?</p>



<p>“Th-that would be a problem.”</p>



<p><em>“Why? Are you dating someone you’re ashamed to introduce to your parents? It’s a waste of time to date someone like that. Break up now.” </em></p>



<p>Her mother’s words were extreme. What did she think her daughter’s life was? Even for a parent, wasn’t she a bit too overbearing?</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, but with upcoming final exams, I won’t have time.”</p>



<p><em>“You always use busyness as an excuse. I won’t compromise this time,” </em>her mother retorted, her words as unyielding as a cold boulder.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei’s expression clouded, her gaze pleaded for help from Aria-san and me. </p>



<p>Aria-san looked at me as if asking, <em>“Are you ready for this?”</em></p>



<p>After listening to the exchange between Kanzaki-sensei and her mother, I felt even more trapped. I’d be a failure as a man if I backed down now.</p>



<p>I had to make this fake relationship work to ensure Kanzaki-sensei remained our teacher. And then, Yorka and I could graduate with a safe and secure high school life.</p>



<p>Aria-san and I simultaneously gave Kanzaki-sensei thumbs-up, assuring her everything would be fine.</p>



<p>“…Alright. I’ll take him to see you, Mother.” </p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei finally managed to squeeze out the words, her expression rigid.</p>



<p>After hanging up, Kanzaki-sensei slumped onto the sofa. She looked drained. She seemed to forget I was even there as she fell silent.</p>



<p>“Do you get it? She’s a tough opponent, right?” Aria-san grinned.</p>



<p>“You foresaw this too?” </p>



<p>“If her mother respects her daughter’s wishes, there’s no need for you, Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“It’s going to be difficult to persuade her.”</p>



<p>Convincing that mother would be no easy feat.</p>



<p>“Her parents are perceptive. It’s better to have someone like you who already knows Shizuru-chan well and have a solid trust with each other, rather than faking it with some random person. Besides, aren’t you good at handling pressure?” </p>



<p>“You say that so casually. The pressure is no joke.”</p>



<p>“That’s why to enhance your intimacy, how about practicing calling each other by your first names?” </p>



<p>Aria-san proposed a plan for boyfriend stand-in training, activating her Dreadful-Demon-Queen’s mode.</p>



<p>“N-No, that’s not necessary,” Kanzaki-sensei, who had been lying on the sofa, lifted her head abruptly.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it suspicious to use last names when you’re dating? It’ll be obvious you’re lying if you’re too formal. We need to prepare as much as we can beforehand.”</p>



<p>Even though the plan was absurd to begin with, Aria-san tried to persuade us that it’d significantly increase our chances of success.</p>



<p>Of course, the one who would suffer the most from failure would be Kanzaki-sensei herself, so it was hard to argue against her persuasion.</p>



<p>Aria-san was as skilled as ever at convincing people.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s do it,” I agreed and glanced at Kanzaki-sensei, who still looked unsure. But hesitation here would only lower our chances of success further.</p>



<p>“…Sena-san?”</p>



<p>“Come on, Sensei, let’s steel ourselves. We decided on this in the tea room, didn’t we? Being indecisive halfway through won’t do us any good.”</p>



<p>Though I felt embarrassed and awkward, desperate times call for desperate measures.</p>



<p>“As expected of you, Sumi-kun, you’re decisive!” </p>



<p>“There are also couples who call each other by their surnames but are very close,” Kanzaki-sensei denied.</p>



<p>“Listen, objectively speaking, you two are still teacher and student. There’s a hierarchy, a line drawn, and zero romantic atmosphere. It’s too formal. You lack that romantic spark.”</p>



<p>“Because it’s the truth.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, could it be that Shizuru-chan is nervous about calling someone of the opposite sex by their first name?” </p>



<p>“Boys and girls should keep their distance at seven. I can’t adopt such a casual attitude.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, you’re really sheltered. What era are you from?”</p>



<p>“It’s because of my upbringing in such a traditional household that I’m struggling like this!” Kanzaki-sensei appealed with a face on the verge of tears. She was aware of it.</p>



<p>“Sensei, let’s give it a try. Okay?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. Everyone, turn off your smartphones and put them in your bags. Let’s not be distracted and focus on the practice.”</p>



<p>I followed Aria-san’s lead and stashed my phone in my bag as well.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei and I were seated facing each other.</p>



<p>“Why do they measure affection by names…” Kanzaki-sensei grumbled, apparently still reluctant.</p>



<p>I decided to take the plunge and address her by her first name.</p>



<p>“Shizuru-san.”</p>



<p>“────!!”</p>



<p>“Oh? Shizuru-chan, you froze up. And you’re surprisingly smooth, Sumi-kun.” Aria-san remarked and poked Kanzaki—no, Shizuru-san’s—cheek with her finger.</p>



<p>“…You’re quite bold, Sena-san.”</p>



<p>“I’m just playing the role of a boyfriend, that’s all.”</p>



<p>“Come on, Shizuru-chan, call him by his first name. It’s just an act.”</p>



<p>“I’ll remember this, Aria.”</p>



<p>There was no trace of the stern dignity she usually exuded in the classroom; instead, there was a flustered woman trying to find her way.</p>



<p>Shizuru-san’s lips trembled, apparently she had made up her mind.</p>



<p>“…Kisumi…-san.”</p>



<p>She awkwardly addressed me by my first name.</p>



<p>This was so embarrassing. Really.</p>



<p>Even if it was just acting, I couldn’t help but feel embarrassed alongside her. I was struggling to maintain my composure after facing the usually distant and cool older woman’s timid reaction.</p>



<p>I was vividly experiencing the destructive power of contrast.</p>



<p>“Good, good. That innocent vibe is coming through. There’s a natural distance typical of an age-gap couple. Now, let’s keep going,” Aria-san urged excitedly while Shizuru-san already looked worn out.</p>



<p>“Are we still doing this?” </p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan, success on the big day comes from repetition in practice. You have to get used to it until it feels natural on the actual day!” </p>



<p>“Ugh…”</p>



<p>Shizuru-san growled softly. Perhaps because of her teacher’s nature, she was unable to argue against the truth.</p>



<p>Feeling the need to take the lead, I straightened up.</p>



<p>“Shizuru-san.”</p>



<p>“…Kisumi-san.”</p>



<p>“Shizuru-san.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-san.”</p>



<p>“Shizuru-san.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-san.”</p>



<p>“You managed to say it properly.”</p>



<p>“It’s pathetic of me to ask for this myself and then lose my composure.”</p>



<p>Upon hearing my words, Shizuru-san instinctively turned her face away. Aria-san, who had been watching, looked thoroughly pleased.</p>



<p>“Whoa, I’ve just seen something interesting. I could eat three servings of rice after this!”</p>



<p>“Aria-san, you’re seriously relentless. You don’t hold back even with your former teacher.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, what are you talking about~~”</p>



<p>Once again, I trembled at the education methods of the Dreadful Demon Queen.</p>



<p>However, no matter how absurd the approach was, Aria-san’s spartan guidance had made me capable of things I never imagined.</p>



<p>“But if you’re not immune to romance, how come you’re so good at giving advice on students’ love lives?”</p>



<p>A simple question popped into my head.</p>



<p>“That’s simple. Shizuru-chan, being such a beauty, is automatically assumed to have plenty of romantic experience. She’s heard everything from light to heavy relationship issues from students, that’s why her knowledge is rich.”</p>



<p>“Ah, that makes sense.”</p>



<p>If you combined the accumulated wealth of case studies and Shizuru-san’s thoughtfulness, her persuasive words seemed to come naturally.</p>



<p>“Besides, she surprisingly enjoys watching romance dramas.”</p>



<p>“Please don’t reveal unnecessary details like that.”</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun is your boyfriend. It wouldn’t be strange for a boyfriend to know a lot, right?”</p>



<p>“He’s just a stand-in boyfriend!”</p>



<p>“It wouldn’t hurt to embrace the role emotionally for a while. Just try to enjoy the boyfriend-girlfriend vibe for now.”</p>



<p>“I feel bad for Arisaka-san if I do that.”</p>



<p>Arisaka-san, of course, referred to Yorka. This kind of integrity was probably the reason why Kanzaki-sensei was so well-liked. There was no deception or hidden agenda in her words.</p>



<p>It was precisely because of her honest nature that the guilt of this strategy weighed even heavier on her.</p>



<p>“Alright then, I’ll explain the setup for the two of you. Oh, and you’ll continue to call each other like this.”</p>



<p>Aria-san deliberately avoided mentioning Yorka and proceeded to explain the operation in detail.</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun is a fourth-year student at the same university as Shizuru-chan, and you both are in the same seminar group. It wouldn’t be strange for her to meet someone of the opposite sex there. So, Sumi-kun, who fell head over heels at first sight, pursued her passionately and confessed. Shizuru-chan was impressed by your determination and you two started dating. Now, let’s delve into Sumi-kun’s university profile—”</p>



<p>From there, Aria-san drilled us with the detailed setup she devised for a fake couple. The details about Shizuru-san were intricate and varied.</p>



<p>In this way, I had become quite familiar with the background of a woman named Kanzaki Shizuru.</p>



<p>As if getting thirsty from the conversation, I couldn’t help but notice that Shizuru-san had been drinking a lot faster now.</p>



<p>“It feels like this couple really exists, doesn’t it?”</p>



<p>“The details really help. It’s like actors preparing for their roles.”</p>



<p>After hearing all the information, I was impressed.</p>



<p>“Did you remember everything, Shizuru-chan?”</p>



<p>“I understand the college student setting for Sena-san, and I’ve grasped his character. However, I still have doubts about the realism of our dates.”</p>



<p>“In that case, since Sumi-kun needs to buy a suit for the event, why don’t you two go on a date? You can talk about dates naturally if you have real-life experience.”</p>



<p>“”A date!?””</p>



<p>Shizuru-san and I echoed in unison.</p>



<p>“Why are you so surprised? We can’t have Sumi-kun show up in his school uniform, can we? Casual clothes would make him look too young, it’s safer for him to wear a formal suit.”</p>



<p>“Going on a date with a student is absolutely out of the question!”</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan, Sumi-kun is your boyfriend even if it’s just for show. You need to control your reactions better or your parents will figure it out in no time.”</p>



<p>With that reminder, Shizuru-san couldn’t argue back.</p>



<p>“It’ll be fine. You can just tell your parents that Sumi-kun had dinner at your house like today and ended up having a sleepover date. If anything, you two can even do more couple-like things to get used to it,” Aria-san said something dangerous with a playful tone.</p>



<p>“That’s impossible!”</p>



<p>Shizuru-san, who took it seriously, stood up abruptly but quickly collapsed. I instinctively caught her.</p>



<p>“Nice catch, Sumi-kun. You’re top-notch at catching girls.”</p>



<p>“It’s been happening a lot lately,” I grumbled.</p>



<p>Shizuru-san seemed to have lost strength in her body and relied on me to remain standing.</p>



<p>“Ah, you’re pretty drunk, Shizuru-chan. You overdid it in the second half.”</p>



<p>Looks like she was the type to drink without changing her expression and then suddenly shut down.</p>



<p>“What should we do!?”</p>



<p>“Let’s carry Shizuru-chan to bed.”</p>



<p>“Then help me out here.”</p>



<p>“I’m also drunk, and these slender arms won’t be of much use.”</p>



<p>“But—”</p>



<p>“Carrying Shizuru-chan is a privilege. Enjoy that marshmallow body to the fullest.”</p>



<p>“I’m just helping her. Nothing more, nothing less.”</p>



<p>“I’m still drinking, so don’t mind me. Should I turn up the TV volume? I’ll keep quiet no matter what!”</p>



<p>“What do you take your former teacher for?”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, she likes you very much.”</p>



<p>“There are many issues at hand.”</p>



<p>“You’re so stiff. Save that for the bed, will ya?”</p>



<p>Dealing with a drunkard is such a pain—!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>I lifted Shizuru-san and carried her to the adjacent bedroom. Aria-san didn’t bother to help at all.</p>



<p>I was desperate not to be rattled by the tension of entering a woman’s bedroom and the soft weight in my arms.</p>



<p>Similar to the living room, the bedroom was neatly arranged, so I smoothly made my way to the bed. I carefully laid her down and withdrew my arms to avoid waking her.</p>



<p>I switched on the bedside lamp and adjusted the room temperature to ensure she wouldn’t feel uncomfortable, then covered her with a summer blanket.</p>



<p>“Mm… Sena, -san?”</p>



<p>“Are you feeling okay, Sensei? Do you want some water?”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for the trouble. And for this whole situation…”</p>



<p>“We’re in this together now. Let’s do our best to handle it.”</p>



<p>“…How did it come to this?”</p>



<p>While gazing up at the ceiling, she spoke as if it were someone else’s problem.</p>



<p>“Maybe it’s because Aria-san started working as a cram school teacher at your suggestion, Sensei.”</p>



<p>The one who connected me and Arisaka Aria was undoubtedly Kanzaki-sensei herself.</p>



<p>“Sena-san, I’m well aware that I’ve inconvenienced Arisaka-san with my problem. If there’s any way I can make amends, I’ll do it. I feel ashamed to burden you alone.”</p>



<p>Shizuru-san, who was slightly drunk, murmured apologetically.</p>



<p>“It’s okay. Really.” I sat on the edge of the bed.</p>



<p>Sure, if there were an easy way out, I’d like to take it. I prefer to steer clear of trouble and just enjoy life without complaint.</p>



<p>Yet, despite my lack of remarkable talent and modest means, Arisaka Yorka loved me.</p>



<p>If I had a different life as Sena Kisumi, Yorka might not even glance my way, and I wouldn’t find myself attracted to her either.</p>



<p>Love was such a fragile and ephemeral thing, easily swayed by circumstances and status. A slight change in circumstances could turn what should have been a love story into an unfulfilled one.</p>



<p>That’s why becoming Yorka’s boyfriend felt like a kind of miracle to me, and I didn’t intend to disregard something so precious.</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>“This is just a hunch, but I don’t think Yorka actually dislikes you despite her attitude.”</p>



<p>“You shouldn’t worry about that. It’s part of a teacher’s job to have students not like them.”</p>



<p>“Well, I wouldn’t willingly become the stand-in boyfriend of someone I dislike, so you can rest assured there.”</p>



<p>“You’re kind.”</p>



<p>“Thanks to that, I’m being manipulated even by my girlfriend’s sister.”</p>



<p>“Even though Aria is like that, she also has her cute side.”</p>



<p>“…As expected, Sensei, you’re quite something.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but think so.</p>



<p>No matter how close we became, Arisaka Aria remained a Dreadful Demon Queen, the sister of my girlfriend, and someone from a different world to me.</p>



<p>“…?”</p>



<p>“Only Sensei could call Arisaka Aria cute.”</p>



<p>“Please don’t misunderstand. That girl genuinely wants to cherish her sister. When Arisaka-san decided to attend the same high school, Aria came to me first and said, <em>‘My sister will be enrolling. Can you help her?’ </em>I became her enemy the moment we met, though…”</p>



<p>“That’s because from her perspective, you were the male teacher who laid hands on her underage sister…”</p>



<p>Shizuru-san chuckled.</p>



<p>“When we first met, she suddenly yelled at me, <em>‘Why are you a woman?’.</em> Perhaps that’s why she refused to speak as students representative at the entrance ceremony.”</p>



<p>“If it was the Yorka from first year, she would have refused even without that.”</p>



<p>“I hope that’s the case…”</p>



<p>With that muttered, Shizuru-san began to breathe quietly and fell asleep.</p>
