<h2>Chapter 12: Longing in Reverse</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>“Everyone, why…” </p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei looked really surprised by the unexpected appearance of her students in their school uniforms. Naturally, her parents shared the same reaction.</p>



<p>“We received an urgent summon from Kisumi-kun about an important matter concerning you, Sensei,” Asaki-san replied as if it were obvious.</p>



<p>“Could it be that you’re Kanzaki-sensei’s parents? I’m Hasekura Asaki, Kisumi-kun’s classmate and his partner as the class representative. Nice to meet you. Today, we’ve all come together to persuade Sensei not to quit.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san explained confidently to the imposing parents without a hint of fear. Her bright smile and gentle demeanor gradually lowered their guard.</p>



<p>“We initially wanted to bring the whole class, but we thought it’d cause too much trouble. That’s why we selected some students to represent the class,” Asaki-san smoothly justified their presence.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but offer sincere praise to my partner.</p>



<p>If the plan of having a stand-in boyfriend failed, what I had prepared was a simple yet classic approach: a straightforward persuasion tactic in numbers.</p>



<p>Just one look at the diverse members of the Sena Club made it clear how widely respected Kanzaki-sensei was among her students. </p>



<p>From a plain guy like me to a distinguished honor student like Asaki-san, quirky individual like Miyachi, the lively Sayu, and the athletically imposing Nanamura. His towering height exerted a physical dominance even in the spacious room.</p>



<p>“Is this what you do, Sena-san?”</p>



<p>“I thought it’d be nice to share the honor of helping Sensei with everyone.”</p>



<p>“What are you all doing here instead of studying for the upcoming exams? Really…” Kanzaki-sensei’s voice trembled with emotion, “And even Yukinami-san…”</p>



<p>The presence of Sayu, who was from a different grade, seemed to puzzle her.</p>



<p>“I may have caused trouble before, but, um, I’m not exactly here to apologize. Ki-senpai begged me to help, so I came along!” Sayu’s awkward demeanor swiftly returned to her usual high energy as she glanced at the fragile Kanzaki-sensei. </p>



<p>And stop using me as a shield because you felt embarrassed, would you?</p>



<p>“As for me, I’m just good at basketball. I’m here to repay a favor to Kanzaki-sensei and Sena who helped me out last year. Oh, and if Sena isn’t suitable, how about me as your boyfriend?” </p>



<p>Nanamura boldly made his pitch. I was impressed with his guts. His mere presence seemed to lessen the intimidating aura of the stern father.</p>



<p>“Nanamu, calling yourself a boyfriend already undermines your credibility. You’re too flippant.”</p>



<p>“Don’t get the wrong idea, Miyachi. I’m always dead serious when it comes to women.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that just another way of saying you’re a playboy?”</p>



<p>“That’s harsh!”</p>



<p>Miyachi, the smallest of us, interacted with the tall Nanamura in a relaxed manner. With her dazzling short blond hair, round eyes, and youthful face, she exuded a cute charm like a small animal. She wore piercings on her ears and had fair skin. Because she was sensitive to sunlight, she wore light long sleeves even in the summer, with oversized sleeves that hung loose.</p>



<p>“I’m happy in Kanzaki-sensei’s class. I’m used to dislike school because people would pick me on for doing things my own way even though I’m small. But now, no one bothers me. That’s because Kanzaki-sensei watches over us. Thanks to the two she chose as class representatives, there’s no bullying in our class. That’s something I’m really proud of.”</p>



<p>Miyachi’s honest words resonated with us and we nodded.</p>



<p>“I deeply respect Kanzaki-sensei. I’m also a member of the tea ceremony club she advises, where I’ve learned many things beyond academics. Her precise guidance makes me want to aim higher. So if she were to quit, it’d be tough for me. I’d be devastated. I’d feel terrible…so much…” Asaki-san appealed earnestly.</p>



<p>Everyone had been helped by Kanzaki-sensei in ways unknown to others. Then the eyes of the Sena club turned to me, as if saying <em>‘now it’s your turn’.</em></p>



<p>“Um, as you pointed out, I do have a girlfriend. And the fact that I’m still with her is all thanks to Kanzaki-sensei and everyone here. I’m nothing special, but having friends who rush to help our teacher in a pinch is something I’m a bit proud of. I’m really grateful. And that’s because of Kanzaki-sensei’s warm yet stern guidance.”</p>



<p>“Moreover…” I added, “I think Sensei would make a great wife if she decides to get married. She’s beautiful, a great cook, and whoever marries her would be incredibly lucky and happy. And equally, she’s a great teacher. The students who graduate under her guidance grow up to be wonderful adults and will undoubtedly make others happy in the same way. Because of Kanzaki Shizuru as a teacher, more and more people will find happiness in the future. She’s doing an amazing job.”</p>



<p>I glanced at Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“You should’ve said that from the start, Sena.”</p>



<p>I ignored Nanamura’s remark.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t have said it without everyone here. Right, Sensei?” </p>



<p>Our sentiments were united, and I believed Sensei understood them even more than her own parents.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei stood up from her chair.</p>



<p>“Mother, Father, I won’t quit teaching. I have precious students who trust me like this. There’s no other job as rewarding as helping them grow. So please, believe in me and wait a little longer! I promise I’ll bring a good partner someday. Just give me a little more time. That’s all I can say!”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei declared loudly and broke out of her shell.</p>



<p>A brief silence followed.</p>



<p>“Shizuru, you’re doing great,” her intimidating father muttered, tears welling in his eyes.</p>



<p>“Dear, we’re in front of Shizuru-san’s students,” the mother interjected and handed him a handkerchief. “And Shizuru-san, it’s inappropriate to raise your voice.”</p>



<p>In contrast, her mother’s words were dismissive. Despite conveying everything with all our might, her mother remained unfazed.</p>



<p>Was it all in vain, then?</p>



<p>“Shizuru-san.”</p>



<p>“No matter what you say, I refuse to go through with this arranged marriage!” </p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei endured the pressure and continued to speak up.</p>



<p>“─Do as you please.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“You’ve been doing a good job behind our backs.”</p>



<p>“So, is it okay?”</p>



<p>“If you’ve gone this far, don’t come crying to us later.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yes!”</p>



<p>“You must continue to work hard so you don’t betray the trust of your students. And dear, stop crying already! Let’s go home!”</p>



<p>She hurriedly ushered her husband to stand up.</p>



<p>“Well then. Everyone, please continue to support Shizuru-san from now on.”</p>



<p>The graceful bow as she left made it clear to me that Kanzaki-sensei’s mannerisms was learned from her mother.</p>



<p>Once the door closed and their presence faded away, we all breathed a collective sigh of relief. The tension in the room dissipated instantly.</p>



<p>“I can’t believe it actually worked…”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei, in particular, slumped back into her chair. She looked drained.</p>



<p>“We did it, Sensei! I’m so glad! The arranged marriage has been avoided!”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Sena-san. And thank you everyone as well,” she expressed her gratitude once more.</p>



<p>Feeling like my role was done, I loosened my tie, “Miyachi, where’s Yorka?”</p>



<p>“She’s with her sister. I’m sure they’re still talking.”</p>



<p>I immediately dialed Yorka’s number, but there was no response.</p>



<p>“Miyachi-san, is Arisaka-san also here?”</p>



<p>“Yes. Yoryor was with us until just before. She was supposed to come here too, but it seems she needed to talk to her sister about something important.”</p>



<p>“I see, that girl…” Kanzaki-sensei murmured with a mysterious expression.</p>



<p>“Then let’s split up and look for Yor-senpai at the hotel!” Sayu suggested, and everyone agreed.</p>



<p>“In that case, I’ll—”</p>



<p>“Sensei, we’ll handle this so please see your parents off.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“There might be things they can’t say in front of us. It’s a good opportunity for you.”</p>



<p>“…I’ve shown you my embarrassing side as a teacher. But I’ve been greatly encouraged by you all. It’s an honor to have been able to teach you.”</p>



<p>“They’ll be gone before you finish thanking us. Please go ahead, Sensei.”</p>



<p>I urged her to leave, sensing that things might drag on and sent her off.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Shizuru found her parents in the hotel lobby.</p>



<p>“Father! Mother!”</p>



<p>At the sound of Shizuru’s voice, their steps halted.</p>



<p>“You should not run in a kimono.”</p>



<p>“Um, earlier, that was…”</p>



<p>“Our daughter has such reliable students. Especially Sena-kun who can speak to your father without fear. He was bold, I quite like him.”</p>



<p>“This is the first time you’ve said something like that,” Shizuru was puzzled by her mother’s unexpected reaction.</p>



<p>“Because our only daughter never once showed any signs of having a boyfriend, we started to worry and even considered arranging a marriage. We’d like to see our grandchildren someday. You should consider our feelings a bit when you suddenly bring a boyfriend. Not to mention you make a move with your student.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t make a move! He was just acting with me!”</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s a joke.”</p>



<p>“You don’t usually joke like this, Mother.”</p>



<p>Though Shizuru had braced herself for scolding, she couldn’t hide her bewilderment at her increasingly elated mother.</p>



<p>“We know we’ve been strict with you. But even so, we parents felt anxious when the possibility of our precious daughter marrying someone suddenly became more real. Your father has been sleep-deprived lately.”</p>



<p>“It felt like going to a parent-teacher meeting. And even your cooking hasn’t been quite right lately.”</p>



<p>“But dear, didn’t you always say it was delicious?”</p>



<p>“S-Sorry. You were quite on edge, so I couldn’t say it honestly…” Like a scolded child, her father shrunk down.</p>



<p>“So even Father and Mother have moments like this.”</p>



<p>“Ahem. Anyway, even if your companion today wasn’t a real boyfriend, we were curious about the person you brought for the first time. Thanks to that, we feel a bit relieved.”</p>



<p>“That’s true.”</p>



<p>The parents nodded at each other.</p>



<p>“Even though I was lying…?”</p>



<p>For Shizuru, who had lived her life without telling a single lie to her parents, this fake boyfriend scenario felt like leaping off the stage.</p>



<p>“Because I originally thought you were a workaholic. But you do have a good eye for your partner.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“I’m surprised. Did you bring Sena-kun without even realizing it?”</p>



<p>“Realizing what? Mother, please be clear.”</p>



<p>Shizuru was completely lost, struggling to grasp the point. Her mother, who usually jumped straight to the point, was unusually cryptic.</p>



<p>“Shizuru-san, personally, I think you’re quite fond of him. My woman’s intuition says so.”</p>



<p>At her mother’s gleeful assertion, Shizuru’s breath tightened.</p>



<p>“Huh, really? Are you into younger guys, Shizuru?”</p>



<p>On the other hand, her father was simply relieved that Kisumi wasn’t her real boyfriend and hadn’t thought beyond that.</p>



<p>“Don’t be flustered, dear. Besides, aren’t you much younger than me too?”</p>



<p>“What are you saying? You’ve always been and will always be beautiful.”</p>



<p>Her parents were always affectionate.</p>



<p>“…My ineptness in love is partly because of both of you.”</p>



<p>Shizuru had never been particularly interested in romance. She had grown up in a household with a clear power dynamic; a mother who was in superior position and a father who was completely smitten.</p>



<p>“Don’t be ridiculous. I may be more assertive than you, but our personalities are just alike. Our taste in men is practically similar.”</p>



<p>“Similar…?”</p>



<p>Glancing at her father, who seemed to understand, Shizuru waited for her mother’s next words.</p>



<p>“They’re someone who doesn’t flatter or fawn over others, yet they’re incredibly selfless.”</p>



<p>Her father’s characteristics certainly aligned perfectly with Sena Kisumi’s attitude and actions.</p>



<p>He patiently engaged in necessary communication, occasionally adopting a relaxed attitude while always maintaining the boundary between teacher and student. He was easy to talk to and dependable. She was able to trust him because he always handled his assigned tasks diligently.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, whenever he visited the tea room, she often took the trouble to brew tea. Outside of tea ceremony club activities, it was rare for her to go the extra mile for students.</p>



<p>“B-But, he’s my student! And he’s nine years younger! It’s impossible!”</p>



<p>Shizuru’s attempt to deny was met with disbelief.</p>



<p>“You’re worried about the age gap? Your father is a whole decade younger than me, so it shouldn’t be a problem in our family.”</p>



<p>Indeed, Shizuru’s mother was the type of woman who looked much younger than her actual age. With both parents standing side by side, the father appeared even older with his rugged appearance and presence.</p>



<p>“You were treating him like a child earlier!”</p>



<p>“We can’t just accept Sena-kun in front of you. He’s still a child, we can’t just give him the green light.”</p>



<p>The father nodded deeply in agreement.</p>



<p>“He has a girlfriend!”</p>



<p>“He’s still in high school. Unless he plans to marry his high school sweetheart soon, which I doubt, I don’t see any problem especially after he graduates.”</p>



<p>Her mother was unusually enthusiastic, seemingly elated at the prospect of her daughter’s love story.</p>



<p>“You can find happiness even from lies if they lead to truth. In that case, then we will welcome him with open arms. But you have to act as fast as possible.”</p>



<p>After admonishing the father who looked fidgety for some reason, both parents left.</p>



<p>Left alone in the lobby, Shizuru found herself momentarily frozen.</p>



<p>“Wait until he’s no longer a student… huh? What?!”</p>



<p>Shizuru desperately tried to convince herself that her flushed cheeks were due to wearing a kimono in summer.</p>



<p>However, this excuse was quite implausible in the heavily air-conditioned hotel lobby.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>It would be a blatant lie to claim that you fought more with people you were closer with.</p>



<p>The persistence of conflicts worldwide was proof enough of that. </p>



<p>Such playful banter was only possible between those with good communication skills or those with an amicable relationship, where they could forgive each other despite exchanging harsh words. </p>



<p>The reverse was impossible. It was either tolerating one side’s opinions, keeping silent, or maintaining distance from the outset to avoid conflicts altogether.</p>



<p>Opening one’s mouth became a perilous endeavor for those lacking communication skills, often leading to misspoken words and disjointed conversations. A slip of the tongue could dampen the atmosphere, at worst leading to anger and resentment. Above all, it was the repeated disappointment and hurt from one’s own inability to communicate effectively that took its toll.</p>



<p>Staying silent was a commendable risk management strategy. At least, it proved effective for Arisaka Yorka. </p>



<p>Avoiding people at arm’s length helped her to avoid unnecessary stress, and she was never one for altercation. </p>



<p>Nevertheless, life was harsh and cruel, and those who remained silent were often overlooked.</p>



<p>Those who understood your silence were a minority, and those who responded to it were even fewer. The majority tended to be insensitive, with the loudest voices often belonging to the most self-centered individuals. </p>



<p>Therefore, she detested the confined world of the classroom, where immature individuals spent their days cooped up in tight spaces and forced into similar behaviors while interpersonal dynamics were left to chance.</p>



<p>Though touted as training for group living, the true significance and efficacy remained dubious. For delicate individuals, constructing smooth interpersonal relationships proved overwhelmingly difficult.</p>



<p>As a shy girl who was always sensitive to others’ words, young Yorka admired her older sister from the depths of her heart.</p>



<p>She could predict the reactions of others if she behaved like her sister. With prepared answers at the ready, she could navigate unforeseen circumstances.</p>



<p>That was a revolutionary discovery for Yorka. </p>



<p>Her sister’s actions were as reliable as mathematical formulas, proving effective and useful in every situation. </p>



<p>To elicit the same praise, Yorka adopted her sister’s cheerful and optimistic behavior. No one around her realized that Yorka’s means and ends were reversed.</p>



<p>Emulating her dear sister was enjoyable for Yorka, who always saw her as an unwavering role model. </p>



<p>However, as Yorka entered middle school, her ability to mimic her sister’s began to wane, primarily because of her growing self-awareness. It created a gap and made it increasingly painful to imitate her no matter how well she performed.</p>



<p>Her classmates’ reactions, especially those involving romantic sentiments, led to a rapid increase in irregular situations. Strong feelings of affection, even if well-intentioned, were nothing but noise to Yorka who struggled with improvisation. </p>



<p>If she responded incorrectly, boys’ attitudes would change abruptly, and even the girls from other classes whom she didn’t know would hurl harsh words at her.</p>



<p>Moreover, there were more occasions where people who knew her sister pointed out the differences. While their comparisons were made without malice, Yorka couldn’t help but feel inferior. </p>



<p>Even though Yorka realized the limitations of mimicking her sister, she couldn’t find another way. Since her means and ends were reversed, being praised did little to bolster her confidence. </p>



<p>Her older sister remained radiant as ever, and the gap between them remained unbridgeable. Feeling anxious, Yorka desperately sought advice from Aria. </p>



<p>However, despite Aria’s attempts to convince her to change, Yorka couldn’t let go of her only weapon. </p>



<p>In the end, her sister that Yorka admired so much got a boyfriend. This inimitable scenario made everything irrelevant to Yorka.</p>



<p>The shock of her dear sister being taken by someone else, coupled with the accumulated stress, drained her of the energy to navigate her school life effectively. She rejected all attachments to others and resigned herself to the solace of solitude.</p>



<p>Whether fortunate or unfortunate, Yorka’s consistent actions, driven by her own will, led her to protect herself independently for the first time. </p>



<p>—However, the injustice of life laid in the fact that no one could live without communication with others.</p>



<p>Little did Yorka expect to meet someone like Sena Kisumi, let alone fall in love with him and desire a connection with him. </p>



<p>Kisumi brought about an increase in friends. She discovered that being herself made it easier to talk to others than before.</p>



<p>And now, she was finally facing her admired sister in earnest.</p>



<p>Arisaka Aria was the ideal Yorka had always looked up to, the unattainable goal, a family member she could never surpass.</p>



<p>Faced with such a person, Yorka’s knees trembled with nerves. In truth, she wanted to escape right away.</p>



<p>“Yor-chan, don’t you want to go to Sumi-kun?” Aria casually asked while walking ahead with her usual air of ease.</p>



<p>Yorka and Aria were in the famous Japanese garden of this hotel. Surrounded by dense trees reminiscent of a somber forest, the hustle and bustle felt distant despite being in the heart of Tokyo. The lush foliage provided cool shade, making it a perfect spot for conversation outside.</p>



<p>“I’m not worried since Kisumi and everyone else is over there.”</p>



<p>“It’s strange to see you relying on friends. I thought you’d never come here because of your dislike for Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“That’s because of the weird lie you told in the past.”</p>



<p>Aria was entirely at fault for mentioning Kanzaki-sensei as her boyfriend. Yorka still vividly remembered the turmoil and confusion when her homeroom teacher introduced herself as ‘Kanzaki’. In that moment, Yorka realized just how deceitful her sister could be.</p>



<p>“Well, you’re so sensitive and stubborn at the same time that you wouldn’t listen to my story properly. It was just a spontaneous idea for me too, but I never thought it would backfire like this. I’ve caused trouble for both you and Shizuru-chan.” Aria sat down on a nearby bench and removed her sunglasses. “So, what was that sister quarrel you mentioned earlier? That’s quite dramatic.”</p>



<p>“We should’ve had this conversation sooner.”</p>



<p>“…Why so serious? Did you declare a fight just to have one? Is this all because of Sumi-kun’s influence?” </p>



<p>“Why bring Kisumi into this?”</p>



<p>“After clearing up the rumor about you spending the night outside, Shizuru-chan was venting like crazy.”</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>“I was surprised by how daring your boyfriend is, but knowing it’s Sumi-kun made sense. His audacity and impulsive actions must be something he learned from me.”</p>



<p>There was a certain joy in Aria’s expression as she spoke. The boldness Kisumi occasionally displayed which was contrasting his usual modest demeanor must indeed be influenced by her.</p>



<p>“I’m getting dragged along too because of it.”</p>



<p>“But you still like him, don’t you?” </p>



<p>“Of course. I’m Kisumi’s girlfriend, after all.”</p>



<p>“I’m relieved to see you so confident. I have to thank Sumi-kun later.”</p>



<p>Aria praised her sister without a trace of hesitation. With a smile still intact, she listened calmly to Yorka’s words.</p>



<p>“I never even thought about having arguments with you. I always saw you as someone ideal, someone to admire, and someone I could never beat.”</p>



<p>Though there was no superiority between them as close sisters, there existed a natural hierarchy in their roles. Aria led, and Yorka followed. It was a relationship built on unwavering love and trust, which was why there was no conflict between them until now.</p>



<p>“…The way you put it makes it sound like you’re going to win from now on.”</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“Interesting. How do you determine who wins? Oh, but I’m not up for a catfight, it looks painful.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about that. You can just speak your mind, onee-chan.”</p>



<p>“I don’t really have anything particular to say.”</p>



<p>“Really?” </p>



<p>“What are you suspicious about?” </p>



<p>Finally, Yorka took a seat next to her sister.</p>



<p>“Because it seems like you’re genuinely interested in Kisumi.”</p>



<p>Yorka didn’t miss her sister’s slight twitch.</p>



<p>“You say the most amusing things. Sure, I like Sumi-kun. But it’s purely as a person. I wouldn’t dare make a move on a high schooler, especially since he’s your boyfriend,” Aria dismissed with a laugh.</p>



<p>“I’ve been pondering why I’m bothered by the closeness between you and Kisumi for a while now. I even thought I was jealous of him for getting close to you,” Yorka recalled her discomfort with their close bond.</p>



<p>“Huh? What do you mean, Yor-chan? Are you upset that Sumi-kun called me Demon Queen? Oh, is it because you don’t like his casual attitude around me? I understand, it must be unsettling to see your boyfriend being too friendly with your sister. I’m sorry about that,” Aria immediately accepted the blame and apologized.</p>



<p>“…That’s still too normal of a reaction, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Yorka became convinced.</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“That’s not like you at all. Why apologize right away?” </p>



<p>Yorka scrutinized Aria’s expression. Her gaze was not one of suspicion but of certainty.</p>



<p>It seemed Aria was about to say something but stopped. She avoided looking at Yorka directly as she suddenly felt lost on how to face her.</p>



<p>“I’ve unconsciously noticed it, onee-chan. Your true feelings are leaking out. But I couldn’t be sure and ended up just warning Kisumi instead. But it’s the other way around. Well, the situation wouldn’t change regardless of who I talked to.”</p>



<p>“It just happened because of Shizuru-chan’s arranged marriage. And besides, it’s been two years since I last saw Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“As long as you have that excuse, you can meet up with him openly.”</p>



<p>“You’re reading too much into it.”</p>



<p>“That’s what I thought too. After all, you know how much you mean to me, onee-chan. You would never do anything to upset me.”</p>



<p>“Of course,” Aria agreed firmly.</p>



<p>Her sincerity was unmistakable, and Yorka knew it. That’s precisely what made it so critical.</p>



<p>“Yes, I’ve always loved you dearly. That’s why I’ve been brushing off any possibility like that from my mind because you’re my sister.”</p>



<p>Strong affection could sometimes distort one’s perception of reality. Especially when Yorka held an extraordinary amount of love, respect, and admiration for her perfect and ideal sister.</p>



<p>She’d always believed her gentle sister would never betray her.</p>



<p>“Even when I used to imitate you, no matter how worried you were, you never yelled or forced me to stop. Because you love me. But… this time it’s different.”</p>



<p>Yorka might not know the right way to argue with her sister, but imitating her sister was something she excelled at. </p>



<p>She carefully observed the opponent, picked up on subtle hints, grasped their true intentions, and pieced together the whole picture. And with just one piercing remark, she could shake someone’s feelings to the core.</p>



<p>“You kept doing things I didn’t like. You tried to get closer to Kisumi when you usually never did that.”</p>



<p>“────”</p>



<p>“At school, you even exposed Sayu-chan and Hasekura-san’s true feelings because you were jealous of the other girls who could be near him. That’s why you tried to destroy the Sena Club.”</p>



<p>“Either way, that group was doomed to fail since those rejected girls would have to watch you and Sumi-kun flirting.”</p>



<p>“I’ve told everyone that they’re free to do as they please. I’m not forcing anyone, and if they don’t like it, they don’t have to join. But I don’t want you getting involved, onee-chan,” Yorka emphasized, “I know once you’ve fallen for someone, you can’t stop yourself.”</p>



<p>Aria’s gaze finally met Yorka. The sisters were sitting on the same bench and had a conversation at eye level.</p>



<p>“I fell in love with Kisumi, and I was happy when he confessed to me. For the first time, life felt enjoyable because our feelings are mutual. If I can see Kisumi, then school isn’t so bad. I can even talk to friends from Sena Club.”</p>



<p>“Yor-chan…” </p>



<p>“I’m sorry for putting you through this. Even though you met him first, he chose me. He chose Arisaka Yorka, the sister you love so much. Not Aria.”</p>



<p>This was the first time Yorka addressed her sister by her name like this.</p>



<p>Aria felt the same dilemma. Perhaps she carried similar struggles.</p>



<p>Ideally, Yorka didn’t want to say these words to her beloved sister. But if she didn’t say them now, things might get worse in the future.</p>



<p>Yorka desperately resisted the urge to cry and poured out all her emotions.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to be disillusioned with my sister. I don’t want to hate you. I want us to always be close forever. So, please, onee-chan, you must <em>never</em> become my romantic rival.”</p>



<p>Yorka felt like she was tearing herself apart.</p>



<p>She could fight any other girl who liked him, win in the end and forget about it. But Aria was different. </p>



<p>If they both got serious, they would both carry scars that wouldn’t fade and live with resentment toward each other for the rest of their lives.</p>



<p>All Yorka could do now was pray. </p>



<p><em>—Please, don’t fight for him.</em></p>



<p>“Don’t fall for the person I like.” Yorka was already crying. Just the thought of it was terrifying, and her tears wouldn’t stop. “I’d hate it if both you and Kisumi weren’t around anymore.”</p>



<p>It was the worst possible future for Yorka. She couldn’t imagine her boyfriend and her sister leaving her at the same time. Losing the two most important people in her life was unthinkable.</p>



<p>“I guess seeing little Yor-chan finding someone she loves made me a bit envious.”</p>



<p>“…huh?”</p>



<p>“In the end, I hurt my precious sister… I’m sorry for being a bad onee-chan.”</p>



<p>Yorka was being hugged by Aria.</p>



<p>“No matter what, Kisumi—”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll always be your big sis.”</p>



<p>“Onee-chan…”</p>



<p>“I also love you the most. So don’t cry.”</p>



<p>Wrapped in her sister’s warmth, Yorka remembered the feeling of security she had long ago. </p>



<p>When their parents were away from Japan, she always relied on Aria. In times of loneliness, sadness, or pain, her sister would always hold her gently and calm her down, making her feel safe.</p>



<p>“I’ve known you since the day you were born. There’s no way I could ever betray you.”</p>



<p>“It’s been a while since you hugged me.”</p>



<p>“You’re always relying on him, though.”</p>



<p>“You’re the one who taught me that hugs bring comfort.”</p>



<p>“…You’ve really grown up, Yor-chan.”</p>



<p>At that moment, Aria truly felt that her sister was no longer a little girl.</p>
