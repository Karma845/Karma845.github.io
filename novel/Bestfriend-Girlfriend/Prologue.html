<h3>Prologue</h3>


<p>The greatest treasure in life is a best friend.</p>



<p>We share the same hobbies; we&#8217;re always on the same page, and we can say whatever we want and do whatever we want.</p>



<p>When something extraordinary happens, our happiness is doubled. When something sad happens, we can share it and make it half as bad. Sometimes we may&nbsp;get pushed around occasionally, but even that is enjoyable.</p>



<p>In some extreme cases, if you have even one person in your life whom you can call your best friend, your life will generally be manageable. A best friend is someone who can make you feel that way.</p>



<p>Then, what should you do if you have feelings for your best friend…of the opposite sex?</p>



<p>Sugisaki Yuuma and his best friend, Kamishiro Yui, were on their way to school together.</p>



<p>Her white hair stands out from the rest. Her height is relatively short for a high school student. A few days ago, Yui would have adored Yuuma like a puppy, but ever since a while ago, she has been looking in the opposite direction of Yuuma and not him.</p>



<p>But it wasn&#8217;t because of an argument or anything of that sort.</p>



<p>Yuuma and Yui were holding hands together. Moreover, they were lovers.</p>



<p>Yui seemed to be embarrassed by it, and even her ears were red.</p>



<p>Yuuma&#8217;s heart was pounding, and he felt like it was going to burst. His face was hot.</p>



<p>&#8220;……If you&#8217;re embarrassed, do you want me to let go?&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yuuma suggested that, Yui shook her head from side to side.</p>



<p>As if to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be separated from you,&#8221; her small, soft hand clung to Yuma&#8217;s hand tightly.</p>



<p>──He was aware that Yui liked him. However, Yuuma still doesn&#8217;t know what kind of &#8220;Love&#8221; Yui harbours for him.</p>



<p>Originally, Yui was the type of person who was unprotected or defenceless towards the opposite sex. Although she was introverted and withdrawn, she didn&#8217;t mind performing skinship with those close to her.</p>



<p>So, is the fact that I&#8217;m holding hands with Yui also a part of our skinship as friends? Or…is she aware of me as a member of the opposite sex?</p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s one thing that I can say, Yui is super cute and adorable.</p>



<p>As he squeezed Yui&#8217;s hand tightly, Yuuma reminisced about the days since he met Yui till now.</p>
