<h1>Prologue: Me and Gal</h1>


<p>As I exited the station’s ticket gate, I was greeted by intense sunlight that was hard to believe it was mid-May.</p>

<p>It’s Shibuya Scramble Crossing, and the sheer number of people passing by here made me feel a bit overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Why do they walk so quickly, as if they’re being urgently pushed by something? I pondered about that, but maybe it was only natural.</p>
<p>After all, I figured people living in the city must have dreams they want to grasp or places they aim to reach.</p>
<p>Tokyo was a bit suffocating for me because there are many people living here who are always moving to somewhere they want to reach.</p>

<p>“…I guess Saitama is just right…”</p>

<p>I thought that while being dazzled by the surroundings.</p>
<p>I had come to Shibuya to meet 『Minacho』, a fellow light novel enthusiast whom I met on the internet.</p>

<p>Half-expectant, half-anxious… I inhale the city’s unfamiliar air as if swallowing my nervousness.</p>
<p>I had been interacting with Minacho on Twitter for about half a year, but today was our first face-to-face meeting.</p>

<p>I wondered if Minacho was really living in Tokyo. If so, what kind of life would he be leading?</p>
<p>How much of his ‘self’ had he revealed through our online interactions?</p>

<p>Lost in thought, I gazed at the view of Shibuya.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the stress of meeting someone whose face I didn’t know, the rows of buildings seemed to loom over me.</p>
<p>People hurriedly walked by, one after another, a multitude of footsteps blending into a rumble that sounded like an approaching avalanche.</p>
<p>…If Minacho turned out to be a young man living in the city, belonging to the ‘Wei-kei’ type… what should I do?</p>
<p>(TN: Term when encountering someone who is cheerful or loud. This is because people who are often lively and loud frequently use the word (wei 「ウェーイ」) to get excited.)</p>

<p>At that moment, an even stronger unease surged within me.</p>
<p>Although it seemed unlikely that a reader of light novels would fit that description, there was a possibility.</p>
<p>If the Minacho I was about to meet didn’t accept someone with communication problems like me——</p>

<p>As my thoughts turned increasingly negative, a notification sound from my smartphone interrupted me.</p>
<p>Since we had agreed to notify each other upon arriving at the meeting place, it could be that Minacho had reached Hachiko Square ahead of me.</p>
<p>Thinking so, I headed toward the designated meeting spot while opening my DMs.</p>

<p>And then, I received a message from Minacho.</p>

<p>『Black off-shoulder knit, carrying a white bag, brown-haired girl – that’s Minacho!』</p>

<p>…I didn’t quite understand. A black off-shoulder knit? White bag? Brown-haired girl!?</p>
<p>I was confused, but I still replied to Minacho’s message with my information.</p>

<p>『Wearing a gray hoodie and navy jeans… ‘Nezumayo.’ 』</p>

<p>As I contemplated this, I suddenly noticed a woman standing by the Hachiko statue.</p>
<p>Then she spotted me and began running toward me.</p>
<p>She was dressed in a black off-shoulder knit top, a short black skirt, black short boots, and carried a white bag.</p>
<p>Her medium-length brown hair resembled the information I had just received through DMs.</p>
<p>She looked like a gal, or more precisely, exactly like the popular gal in our class – Miona Tsumakawa!</p>

<p>I realized who she was, and as I shuddered with that realization, she approached me with a bright smile.</p>

<p>“Yahoo——Nezumayo-kun! I’ve been really looking forward to meeting you!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it turned out that the Minacho I had hoped to meet for our shared love of light novels was someone entirely different from what I expected.</p>
<p>While she might not be a Tokyo resident, she was a Wei-kei gal, which I’m not very fond of…</p>

<p>However, I didn’t immediately rush back to Saitama for some reason.</p>
<p>Probably because somewhere deep down, I was intrigued by her.</p>
<p>I probably wouldn’t have admitted that to myself at that time, but…</p>

<p>“N-nice to meet you, Minacho-san.”</p>

<p>This first scene, serving as our prologue, marked the beginning of our relationship.</p>
<p>Of course, just because an otaku met a gal didn’t mean my values or personality would change.</p>

<p>However, what if my life were a light novel?</p>
<p>My unremarkable story would surely begin to change from here.</p>
