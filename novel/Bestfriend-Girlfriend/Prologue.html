<h1>Prologue</h1>

<p>“Yikes!” <br /> <br />I slipped. <br /> <br />“Whoa!” <br /> <br />And fell over. <br /> <br />“Oof!” <br /> <br />I hit my head against the wall. <br /> <br />“Ugh…damn it… ” <br /> <br />How can there be a banana peel in this squeaky clean hallway? I shouldn’t be having such thoughts, though. <br /> <br />It’s not the banana peel’s fault that I fell. Since this was my path, that’s why the banana peel was there. <br /> <br />Even though I seem to be getting philosophical, it’s not that deep. <br /> <br />The cause is just bad luck, and that says it all. <br /> <br />It’s been like this ever since I can remember. <br /> <br />Banging my little finger on the edge of a dresser, getting bird poop dropped on me, dropping my wallet, whatever – nothing too unusual in and of itself, but they happen to me with an unnaturally high frequency. <br /> <br />So my daily life is just filled with danger. <br /> <br />Even when I’m just walking, I have to be extra careful – <br /> <br />Oops! <br /> <br />“Gah!” <br /> <br />… No matter how careful I am, some things just can’t be helped. <br /> <br />After dramatically stretching out again, I look at the culprit while still lying down. <br /> <br />Well, two banana peels in a row isn’t unusual for me – it’s an everyday thing. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />It was an erotic manga called “[Monthly Survey of My Banana]”. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Come on, this is going too far!” <br /> <br />What’s something like that doing in the school hallway… although I guess it’s not that weird for me. <br /> <br />To the extent that I’ve gotten used to my unhappy life. <br /> <br />“But you’d think the school would know better…why does it always have to be me?” <br /> <br />I intently examine the name of the school printed on the new student ID I was issued earlier. <br /> <br />Teio Private Academy.<br />T/N: The kanji is spelled as Imperial Sakura <br /> <br />It’s the name that reigns over the high schools of this nation. <br /> <br />Upholding the absolute principle of talent, it gathers and nurtures students who excel in their craft, making the cultivation of top talent its primary mission. <br /> <br />While it initially produced only a slightly higher number of outstanding graduates than other schools, the ratio and quality of its graduates have increased at an accelerated rate with each passing year. <br /> <br />Accordingly, the bar for its entrance exams has also risen, to the point where a lack of outstanding aptitude is itself a bar to admission. <br /> <br />It’s matriculation rate at the nation’s top-ranked universities is also number one, so much so that it’s considered to surpass even those universities in terms of brand power. <br /> <br />Within this showcase of talent, there are even more strange students. <br /> <br />[The Ten Sai]<br />T\N: a wordplay of Genius, the kanji written as Ten Sakura Petals </p>

<p><br /> <br />Teio Private Academy – Recognized by all as the best high school in Japan. At its pinnacle, the ten who have been given this title reign supreme. <br /> <br />In academics, athletics, and their own fields of expertise, these chosen ten outliers, known as geniuses or monsters, have long since transcended the student mold, with some wielding nationwide fame and influence. <br /> <br />It continues to churn out eminent figures who pioneer various industries, but this year in particular it has drawn attention for doubling down. <br /> <br />Considered the strongest class in the academy’s history, the current members reportedly surpass all previous generations in talent, looks, and eccentricity – guaranteed to shoulder Japan’s future, according to media reports. <br /> <br />The very fact that mere high school students have received extensive coverage on a prime-time national news program reveals the anomalous existence of both [The Ten Floral Crests] and the Teio Academy. <br /> <br />But in a way, even stranger things have happened: <br /> <br />I was scouted. <br /> <br />Huh? <br /> <br />I mean, huh? <br /> <br />…….. What do you mean, huh? <br /> <br />No matter how many times I think about it, “huh?” is the only word that comes to mind. <br /> <br />Just my luck to be living a normal life at a run-of-the-mill public high school when suddenly a shady redhead shows up out of nowhere. Before I knew it, the hooks were in with my teacher, principal, and parents, arranging my transfer on what felt like coercive terms. <br /> <br />And to drive the point home, the words of that same redhead: <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Crush [The Ten Sai].” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />You’ve got to be kidding me… As if getting into Teio wasn’t incredible enough, they want me, a chronic klutz, to take down their elite of the elite? <br /> <br />Me, whose number one goal in life is to not stand out? <br /> <br />“…” <br /> <br />Before I knew it, I was standing at the classroom door. <br /> <br />Well, I’m definitely going to refuse this request, and of course it’s impossible anyway – they’ll understand that right away.  <br /> <br />For now, I’ll just blend in seamlessly… Yes, I’ll blend in like air, so even if I have a little bad luck, I won’t stand out. <br /> <br />Giving my plan the okay, I knock lightly on the door. <br /> <br />“Come in, come over here.”  <br /> <br />My teacher calls from inside. <br /> <br />“Sorry for the intrusion.”  <br /> <br />I announce, opening the door to a room of eyes that are instantly focused on me. <br /> <br />A delinquent-looking guy, an unmistakably domineering queen, a kid knocked out face down at his desk – it’s clear that some characters in this class are trouble. <br /> <br />But a variety of personalities should work in my favor. The thicker the air gets, the more I can fly under the radar, regardless of mishaps. <br /> <br />“All right, why don’t you introduce yourself?” the teacher asks. <br /> <br />I make my way to the lectern, which serves as my stage.  <br /> <br />Talented people should be able to shine, I just want to live peacefully and normally. <br /> <br />“Youta Ootomo, coming at the end of April as a second year transfer. Nice to meet you all…which reminds me, there’s something I feel I should say up front, so you know – it may cause trouble, so listen closely, because honestly…” <br /> <br />…………….what the? <br /> <br />Suddenly, a powerful sense of wrongness hit me, and my words caught in my throat. <br /> <br />And unbelievably, the next thing that flashed through my mind was – <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> </p>
