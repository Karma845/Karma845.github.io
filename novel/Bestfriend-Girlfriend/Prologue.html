<h1>Shimizu-san’s Evening</h1>

<p>“That guy…”</p>

<p>Lying on my bed in my room, I mumbled to myself.</p>
<p>I was reflecting on the events during today’s lunch break.</p>
<p>It was when I had rejected a confession from a senpai I didn’t know.</p>
<p>I was in a tight spot, but Hondō appeared and helped me without showing any fear of the senpai.</p>

<p>“He said he cares about me and that he can’t take his eyes off me…”</p>

<p>Not just that, Hondō uttered several other things that I can’t easily forget.</p>

<p>『Maybe more than you think, Shimizu-san, I care about you.』 (Volume 1 Epilogue)</p>
<p>『Yeah, you’re kind yet clumsy, and that makes you an irresistible presence to me. I think as long as we’re together, I’ll always find myself looking at Shimizu-san without even realizing it.』 (Volume 1 Chapter 9.4)</p>

<p>I press my pillow onto my face and roll around on the bed, attempting to somehow deal with this overwhelming emotion that I can’t put into words.</p>
<p>After a few dozen seconds, I realized it had no effect, and I stopped my wild behavior.</p>
<p>Having calmed down just a little from earlier, I got off the bed and picked up a bear plushie from my desk.</p>

<p>It’s the only stuffed animal in my room. A prize from a claw machine game when I went to the shopping mall with Hondō.</p>

<p>“How do you think I can, um, make him like me?”</p>

<div><img src="../Images/0007_hiraethtranslations9.png" alt="" /><!--  https://hiraethtranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/hiraethtranslations9.png  --></div><p style="text-align: center"></p>

<p>I pose this question to the stuffed animal, even though I know it won’t respond.</p>
<p>What would it take for Hondō to like me?</p>
<p>This is the question I want an answer to the most.</p>

<p>“It’s pointless talking to you about this.”</p>

<p>Certainly, I feel like I’ve gotten emotionally closer to Hondō compared to our first year of high school.</p>
<p>But at this pace, I’ll graduate from high school before becoming his lover.</p>
<p>That’s why I need to make more moves from my side.</p>
<p>But I can’t make a move without hearing about Hondō and Matsuoka’s love talk…</p>
<p>As I pondered this, I heard a voice.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, bear! If it’s Kei-chan, just one confession will make Daiki-kun head over heels, bear!”</p>
<p>(TN: She’s saying ‘kuma (bear)’ as a sentence ending, I guess she’s pretending to be the bear plushie.)</p>

<p>I quietly set the stuffed animal down and headed straight for the door from which the voice had come.</p>
<p>When I opened it, as expected, Ai was standing there.</p>

<p>“How long have you been listening?”</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re not going to chat with Bear-san anymore, bear(kuma)?”</p>
<p>“If I were about ten years younger, maybe. Answer me properly. Since when have you been listening?”</p>
<p>“From when you were rolling around on the bed, I guess?”</p>
<p>“So you’ve been eavesdropping from the very beginning!”</p>

<p>I slowly brought my right hand closer to Ai’s head.</p>

<p>“Young lady (Ojōsan), what do you intend to do with that hand?”</p>
<p>“If I scoop out that empty brain of yours, maybe I can erase your memory.”</p>
<p>“Seriously, stop it! Kei’s signature mom’s iron claw really hurts! It’ll make a hole in my head!”</p>

<p>It’s rare to see Ai scared.</p>
<p>She seems to have been traumatized by something that happened when she was in elementary school.</p>

<p>“Do you understand what you need to say next?”</p>
<p>“Kei-sama, I deeply apologize for eavesdropping you!”</p>

<p>Ai bows her head vigorously.</p>
<p>She’s so straightforward about it that I can’t bring myself to take any further action.</p>

<p>“There won’t be a next time.”</p>
<p>“Roger!”</p>
<p>“Then, I’m closing the door now.”</p>

<p>I try to close the door as I said so, but Ai stops me.</p>

<p>“What is it? We’ve settled the issue, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>“It’s far from settled! Now that I’ve been forgiven, it’s time to get down to business! Tell me what happened during lunch today!”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>I can’t help but sigh.</p>
<p>Conversations like this tend to drag on.</p>
<p>After that, I had to explain to Ai what happened during lunch in my room.</p>
<p>Ai reacts to every little thing I say, so the conversation takes forever.</p>

<p>“I see-I see. So that’s what happened during lunch…”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you satisfied now? Hurry up and go back to your room.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say it like that, Kei. Even you must admit Daiki-kun looked pretty cool rushing in to save the day.”</p>
<p>“Well, he might have looked cool if he hadn’t been so out of breath when he came around to the back of the gym.”</p>
<p>“Now you’re just being shy, but that’s also another cute point about you.”</p>

<p>With that, Ai crosses her arms and starts thinking.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? If you have something on your mind, just tell me.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve been thinking… maybe there really is a sign of interest.”</p>
<p>“W-what are you suddenly talking about?!”</p>
<p>“Lower your voice. It’s nighttime, so calm down.”</p>

<p>I reflexively cover my mouth.</p>
<p>It feels a bit strange being told to calm down by Ai.</p>

<p>“Sorry…”</p>
<p>“I think Mom and Dad didn’t hear you, though.”</p>
<p>“…So why do you think he’s interested in me?”</p>
<p>“Because when I talked about the situation in class, Daiki-kun seemed really worried about you. I don’t think he would have been so worried if he didn’t care about Kei.”</p>
<p>“Hondō was worried about me…”</p>

<p>I touch my cheek, and it feels a little warmer than usual.</p>

<p>“Hehehe…”</p>

<p>When I glance over to the source of the laughter, Ai is grinning at me.</p>

<p>“What? Why are you laughing like that? If you have something to say, spit it out.”</p>
<p>“My little sister, you look so smitten.”</p>

<p>I try to retort, but I pause and think for a moment.</p>
<p>The warmth inside me cools rapidly.</p>

<p>“…That’s not it.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Why the sudden change? You look so sad.”</p>

<p>Do I really look that sad right now?</p>
<p>I can’t tell without checking myself.</p>

<p>“He probably doesn’t see me ‘that’ way. Even if I were to give it the benefit of the doubt and say he was interested in me, it would be a ‘like’ and not ‘love’.”</p>

<p>I don’t understand everything, but I just can’t believe Hondō sees me romantically.</p>
<p>Back then, Hondō told me I was important to him.</p>
<p>Those words were probably true, but I feel like the emotion behind it is more familial love rather than romantic.</p>
<p>While I’m lost in thought, Ai, with a curious expression, meets my gaze.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with it just being ‘like’?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“After all, it doesn’t change the fact that Daiki-kun views you positively, right? That’s way better than him having no interest in you at all.”</p>

<p>While I stood there stunned, Ai continued to speak.</p>

<p>“I haven’t always liked Yousuke as the opposite gender for a long time. Feelings changing from ‘like’ to ‘love’ towards someone is quite common, you know.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>Guess it’s just how it is, huh?</p>
<p>But indeed, I’ve witnessed the change in Ai’s feelings towards Yousuke.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s right. So, even if it’s just ‘like’ for now, if you keep working hard, perhaps it can turn into ‘love’?”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>Maybe I’ve been too pessimistic.</p>
<p>My relationship with Hondō now, compared to when we were freshmen, has made slight but certain progress.</p>
<p>By the time we graduate high school, we may not be able to become lovers, but we could still have a close relationship…</p>

<p>“Um, Kei-san?”</p>
<p>“W-what is it?”</p>
<p>“Weren’t you just thinking that by the time of graduation, while becoming lovers might be unlikely, you could at least be somewhat closer?”</p>

<p>I was taken aback.</p>
<p>Can my sister read minds when it comes to romantic affairs?</p>

<p>“Is… is that wrong?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say it’s wrong, but it might be risky.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about now, but I have a feeling that Daiki-kun will be quite popular in college. He’s kind, and if you look closely, he has quite an attractive face.”</p>

<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>I’ve tried not to think about it too much, but it’s very possible that others will notice Hondō’s kindness and be attracted to him in the future.</p>

<p>“If you keep up this relaxed attitude, by the time he’s in college, Daiki-kun might just end up dating a lovely girl who comes out of nowhere.”</p>
<p>“Grrr…”</p>
<p>“Glare at me all you want, but it only makes my heart flutter.”</p>

<p>It seems I unconsciously furrowed my brow.</p>

<p>“…what should I do then?”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, you seem troubled, Kei.”</p>
<p>“You’re laughing weirdly again. What is it this time?”</p>
<p>“I’ve thought of a way to close the distance between Kei-san and Daiki-kun in an instant!”</p>

<p>Saying this, Ai suddenly leaned in close to me.</p>

<p>“Too close. Back off a bit.”</p>

<p>I grabbed Ai’s shoulders and pushed her away somewhat forcefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, naughty Kei~”</p>
<p>“Who’s naughty? Just tell me the method quickly.”</p>
<p>“I’d love to tell you… but I can’t reveal it right now.”</p>
<p>“Why not? Stop beating around the bush and just say it.”</p>

<p>Why would she claim to have a good idea and then not share it?</p>

<p>“If I told you now, it’d cut the fun in half.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care about fun. Just tell me right now.”</p>

<p>Right now, my anxiety greatly outweighs my anticipation.</p>
<p>I just want to hear her method.</p>

<p>“Eh~, it’d be a waste to tell you now. Don’t worry! I’ll get Yousuke to help as well, and we’ll approach this with perfect preparation!”</p>
<p>“You’re involving Yousuke too? What are you planning?”</p>
<p>“That’s top secret! But for now, just know that if it’s successful, it’ll make Kei, me, and everyone happy!”</p>
<p>“I hope it really will be okay…”</p>

<p>In the end, Ai never spilled anything and simply returned to her room.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Oh? You went out of the classroom during lunch and that happened?”</p>

<p>On the night of the commotion behind the gymnasium, I was on the phone explaining the situation to Toshiya.</p>
<p>I felt the need to inform Toshiya, who had been worried about me, so I was grateful for his call.</p>

<p>“…Ah, I’m sorry for making you worry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. Well, I was indeed worried when Daiki suddenly left the classroom.”</p>
<p>“I was panicked at that moment…”</p>

<p>When I was told Shimizu-san might be in danger, I honestly didn’t have the time to consider my surroundings.</p>

<p>“I can imagine. But both you and Shimizu-san came back unharmed during lunch break, so that was a relief.”</p>
<p>“True. But I wonder if Shimizu-san is really okay…”</p>
<p>“You mean because of those harsh words from that senpai?”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>

<p>Even though senpai did apologize in the end, he had said some terrible things to Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>I hope Shimizu-san wasn’t too affected by it.</p>

<p>“I’m just speculating here, but I think she’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think so?”</p>
<p>“Because when that senpai spoke heartlessly, Daiki defended her, right? You told her that what was said wasn’t true. I believe that words filled with genuine emotion from someone who’s always by her side, like Daiki, will resonate more with Shimizu-san than the careless insults from a stranger.”</p>
<p>“Do you think so?”</p>
<p>“At least that’s what I believe. Maybe Daiki should continue to interact with Shimizu-san as usual from tomorrow. From the outside, Shimizu-san seems a bit happier when talking with Daiki. So I think she would appreciate that.”</p>
<p>“Got it, I’ll try that. Thanks, Toshiya.”</p>
<p>“No problem, that’s what friends are for.”</p>

<p>Though Toshiya often jests around, when I speak seriously, Toshiya reciprocates with the same sincerity.</p>
<p>I’m genuinely glad to have Toshiya as a friend.</p>
<p>As our conversation settled, I remembered something else I wanted to ask.</p>

<p>“Toshiya, there’s a bit more I want to talk about. Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“What is it? Just go ahead and tell me.”</p>
<p>“When Shimizu-san thanked me behind the gymnasium, I thought she looked really cute”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. And?”</p>
<p>“That kind of cuteness… I mean, it’s not like I never found Shimizu-san cute before, but… I can’t quite put it into words, but the way I perceived her cuteness this time was different from before.”</p>

<p>It’s frustrating not being able to put my feelings into words.</p>
<p>This is the first time I’ve been unable to convey what I feel.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see-I see.”</p>
<p>“Do you understand what I’m trying to say, Toshiya?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>

<p>All I could hear was Toshiya’s pondering hum from the smartphone.</p>

<p>“I guess you don’t get it either.”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not what I’m thinking about right now…”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>I wonder what Toshiya is thinking about.</p>

<p>“How should I put this… I have a rough idea about what Daiki’s feelings for Shimizu-san are.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then tell——”</p>
<p>“But I feel like it’s not right for me to just tell you directly.”</p>
<p>“Oh, why?”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s not like I’m trying to be malicious or anything, okay?”</p>
<p>“Then why?”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to think. I’ve been pondering how to explain it since earlier… It’s kind of difficult. My explanation might be a bit hard to grasp, is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Thanks. To get straight to the point, I think the reason Daiki found Shimizu-san cute during lunch break is because a new feeling for her sprouted within Daiki.”</p>
<p>“Feeling?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I want Daiki himself to recognize that feeling towards Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“You mentioned this earlier, but why don’t you just tell me directly?”</p>
<p>“I believe there’s meaning in confronting and understanding that emotion by yourself.”</p>

<p>Toshiya’s voice was unwavering as he spoke these words.</p>

<p>“So you’re saying I should think about it more myself?”</p>
<p>“That’s a simple way of putting it.”</p>
<p>“Will I understand it if I take the time?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, who knows?”</p>
<p>“Toshiya!?”</p>

<p>I unintentionally raised my voice.</p>
<p>I had hoped he would assure me with a definitive answer.</p>

<p>“Sorry-sorry. In the end, whether you accept my answer is ultimately up to you.”</p>
<p>“Well, that might be true.”</p>
<p>“But don’t worry. It might take some time, but I’m sure you’ll eventually be able to put your feelings for Shimizu-san into words.”</p>
<p>“Toshiya…”</p>

<p>I’m not yet confident that I can put my feelings for Shimizu-san into words right now, but if Toshiya says so, maybe I’ll be able to do it someday.</p>

<p>“I’ve decided, I’ll think about it again on my own.”</p>
<p>“Alright, and if you’re troubled, I’ll be here to listen. Don’t hesitate to reach out.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Thanks, Toshiya.”</p>

<p>I didn’t find a solution immediately, but I’m glad I talked to Toshiya about this.</p>
<p>As I was thinking this, I heard Toshiya’s voice again.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s one more reason I can’t tell Daiki.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“In the off chance that my guess is wrong, there’s a certain group that might beat me up.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about!?”</p>

<p>I was dying to know, but Toshiya stubbornly refused to give me any more details.</p>
