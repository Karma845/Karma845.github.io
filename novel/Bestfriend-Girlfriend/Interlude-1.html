<h1>Interlude I</h1>


<p>“Nanamu, if you keep this up, you’ll seriously be in trouble for the final exam. Try to memorize a few more English words and grammar rules.”</p>



<p>It was after school inside the classroom of Class 2-A. </p>



<p>I, Miyauchi Hinaka, was tutoring Nanamura Ryū, the ace of the boys’ basketball team.</p>



<p>“It’s okay, Miyauchi. Getting along with girls is a breeze with my looks and overflowing masculinity.”</p>



<p>“Looks and attitude won’t raise your exam scores. You won’t be able to play in official matches if you fail, right?”</p>



<p>“Hmm, that’s the only thing that worries me.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s work hard!”</p>



<p>Even though he often boasted about aiming for the world, this cheerful guy over 190 centimeters tall was currently hunched over an English workbook. While his athleticism made him popular with girls, he struggled with studies in general.</p>



<p>If the ace were absent, the team’s strength would halved. Thus, feeling immense pressure from his teammates, he came to me who was good at English.</p>



<p>It was amusing to see his towering figure, blessed with an athletic physique, bowing down to me—a girl with short stature, blonde hair, and ear piercings. </p>



<p>Because the final exam was approaching, there were several groups surrounding desks in the classroom to prepare for the exam. At the podium, classmates gathered around our homeroom teacher, Kanzaki-sensei, to ask questions. In the midst of it all was Hasekura Asaki.</p>



<p>Just like Sumisumi, she was a class representative member and was known for her lively and sociable nature. </p>



<p>Her shoulder-length bright brown hair was loosely permed, and she wore light makeup on her well-defined features. She had a subtle sense of fashion that girls would immediately notice, fitting for a model student. Even in summer attire, she never parted with her cardigan and kept it tied around her waist for the air-conditioning.</p>



<p>“Thank you very much, Kanzaki-sensei,” Asaki-chan expressed her gratitude politely after finishing her question.</p>



<p>Just then, a LINE notification chimed simultaneously from Asaki-chan’s and Nanamu’s phones, as well as mine.</p>



<p>A new message had appeared in the Sena Club group chat. It was from the junior, Yukinami Sayu-chan.</p>



<p><strong>Sayu: </strong><em>Everyone, help! Kanzaki-sensei will have an arranged marriage, and Ki-senpai has been abducted by Yor-senpai’s older sister! Yor-senpai is in a foul mood! Please come to the courtyard immediately! I can’t handle this alone!</em></p>



<p>“An arranged marriage!?”</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan’s older sister abducted Sena?!?”</p>



<p>“Yoryor is in a sour mood!?”</p>



<p>Asaki-chan was the first to voice our collective shock. At the unusually urgent message, the three of us exchanged puzzled looks.</p>



<p>“Huh, Kanzaki-sensei’s going on an arranged marriage!?”</p>



<p>“W-What’s happening…”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei, who happened to be standing right in front of Asaki-chan, was visibly flustered. Just then, a broadcast came over the classroom speaker..</p>



<p><em>“Kanzaki-sensei, Kanzaki-sensei. You have a visitor. Please return to the faculty room. I repeat, Kanzaki-sensei──”</em></p>



<p>“A visitor? But I didn’t have any appointments…”</p>



<p>Feeling confused, Kanzaki-sensei glanced at Asaki-chan, who timidly showed her something on her phone screen.</p>



<p>“…A-Aria!? My apologies, it seems there’s an unexpected visitor. If anyone still has questions, I’ll address them tomorrow. Excuse me!”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei’s expression changed as she hastily exited the classroom, showing an unusual level of agitation for the typically calm teacher.</p>



<p>“Hey, what’s going on? Why would Kanzaki-sensei going on an arranged marriage result in Arisaka-san’s sister kidnapping Kisumi-kun? I’m totally lost,” Asaki-chan titled her head in confusion as she approached us.</p>



<p>“For now, it doesn’t seem like studying is a priority,” Nanamu closed his workbook immediately.</p>



<p>“I’m worried about Yoryor, so let’s go. Asaki-chan, you coming?” I stood up.</p>



<p>“Of course, as a member of Sena Club, I’ve got to help her.”</p>



<p>The three of us quickly made our way to the courtyard.</p>
