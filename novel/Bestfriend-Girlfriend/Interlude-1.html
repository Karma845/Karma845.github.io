<h1>Interlude I: Me and Nezumayo</h1>


<p>“Hehe, you’re totally taken aback. Cute…”</p>

<p>As the train moved away from Saitama Shintoshin Station, I gazed at Nezumayo standing on the platform and felt a bit dazzled.</p>
<p>I wonder if he really understood the meaning of the words I said?</p>
<p>Well, maybe Nezumayo would understand. Because the ‘Nezumayo’ that I know is well-versed in reading between the lines of youth romantic comedies, admires protagonists with keen observation skills, and can decipher the nuances of light novels.</p>

<p>In straightforward terms, what I said earlier was a declaration of war.</p>
<p>It was a declaration of war from a gal to a stubborn otaku who selfishly says he doesn’t want to make a cute girl like me his girlfriend—or even be friends.</p>
<p>You can’t be friends with me because you’ve given up on real-world girls? Seriously, who cares about that? Because I want to be friends with Nezumayo so badly!</p>

<p>That’s why I’ll pretend not to notice the ‘stay away from me’ vibe he’s giving off and act like a clueless airhead gal.</p>
<p>Then I’ll stay by his side like that.</p>

<p>Of course, as I mentioned before, it’s not love.</p>
<p>I’m not the type to fall in love easily, and I certainly wasn’t interested in having any intimacy with Nezumayo right now, but I do like him already.</p>
<p>It’s more like a ‘like’ than a ‘love,’ but I definitely like him. That’s why I told him, ‘Let’s hang out again!’</p>

<p>While summarizing these thoughts in my head, I opened a social media app.</p>
<p>Among several accounts, I chose the account named ‘Minacho’ and revisited a tweet that I had favored in the past.</p>

<p>『It’s troublesome because Minacho’s comments make me want to read even the works I wasn’t interested in…』</p>

<p>He probably doesn’t know. The gal who found a bit of energy and motivation from such a simple reply, feeling like she could give her best at her model job tomorrow, is right here.</p>

<p>…Well, I’m not an easy girl or anything, and it’s not like I’m falling for Nezumayo or anything…but still, I think I really like Nezumayo!</p>
<p>We had so much fun together today, and I realized I like Nezumayo!</p>
<p>Hey, when are we going to play again? How about tomorrow?</p>

<p>“Well, a day is too short… huh, I want to call Nezumayo…”</p>

<p>While thinking this, I regret not exchanging phone numbers with him.</p>
<p>But then again, even if I had asked for his number, Nezumayo probably wouldn’t have easily agreed. He’s a stubborn otaku, after all.</p>

<p>But honestly… the Nezumayo I had in mind seemed like a weirdly prideful otaku, so him being a bit difficult like that would actually match my impression of him.</p>
<p>Oh well, that’s the Nezumayo-kun I thought he was!</p>

<p>“Hehe. Just watch me, you stubborn otaku…”</p>

<p>From now on, I’ll shatter Nezumayo’s ‘three-dimension is trash’ perspective. Not for his sake, but for mine.</p>
<p>To be with Nezumayo, I need to dismantle that perspective. That’s why, I’m determined to undertake the annoying task of breaking down the beliefs of a gloomy otaku for my sake.</p>

<p>Seriously, holding onto a belief like ‘three-dimension is trash’ is so outdated.</p>
<p>What’s the point? It’s not the entire real world that’s trash, it’s just certain people who’ve hurt you, right?</p>
<p>And besides, don’t you realize the 2D world we love so much is also created by people from the 3D world?</p>

<p>That’s why, Nezumayo——</p>
<p>From now on, I’ll treat you very nicely, just like an otaku’s fantasy.</p>
<p>Instead of resisting, let’s have a fun school life together, Nezumayo!</p>
