<h3>Interlude:『Dark Clouds』</h3>



<p>The next day. After eating lunch. Yui was sitting in front of the makeup table in her room.</p>



<p>She partly burrowed her face into her favourite fluffy stuffed sheep and stared at the mirror, which she had covered with a cloth, as she tried not to look at it.</p>



<p>（──Am…..a-am I…really that cute?）</p>



<p>I always hated looking at the mirror.</p>



<p>Whenever I did, I would constantly be reminded that I was 『different from others』, which was why I always avoided it.</p>



<p>（But Yuuma kept telling me that I was cute.）</p>



<p>Of course, I was flattered and embarrassed, and I hoped he wouldn&#8217;t do it so often, but I was happy nonetheless.</p>



<p>The very first time I met him, he was surprised by my white hair, but he didn&#8217;t think much of it and treated me like a normal human being.</p>



<p>Moreover, he was concerned about me and tried to help me cope with my communicative disorder and inferiority complex.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ehehe…..♪&#8221;</p>



<p>I know that I&#8217;m giving him a very hard time. But I&#8217;m happy about it.</p>



<p>（I a-also…have to do my best……！）</p>



<p>I&#8217;m glad that Yuuma is taking care of me, but I don&#8217;t think I should leave things as it is to him forever.</p>



<p>（I have to do what I can.）</p>



<p>With that thought in mind, Yui gazed into the mirror.</p>



<p>How long has it been since I&#8217;ve looked at my face so closely?</p>



<p>──I still hate my white hair. And if you asked me, are you sure? I wouldn&#8217;t know how to answer that. But…I think I&#8217;m fairly cute?</p>



<p>（Cute……I&#8217;m cute……because Yuuma said I&#8217;m cute……cute……definitely cute……）</p>



<p>Yui was self-suggesting to herself.</p>



<p>She promised Yuuma that she would come to play with him again today, and it was almost time for him to come pick her up.</p>



<p>Yui would usually wear a hoodie to cover up her hair, but today she decided to go with something different──a white blouse.</p>



<p>Will he praise me like he did yesterday?</p>



<p>Yui was half-prepared as she nervously sat and waited.</p>



<p>　──Tsu, tsu♪　</p>



<p>A ringtone played from Yui&#8217;s phone due to a message she received.</p>



<p>She immediately looked at her phone. The one who had sent the message was none other than Yuuma. It read,</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, Yui, I may be a little late due to some errands I have to do.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the time being, she replied with a 『Okay』 and sighed.</p>



<p>The wait time seemed long.</p>



<p>（……Should I go to him instead……？）</p>



<p>Suddenly, a thought like this ran through Yui&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>From the very first day we played together until today, Yuuma would always come to my house to fetch me.</p>



<p>The apartment building where Yuuma lives is just around the corner, so there&#8217;s no way I can get lost.</p>



<p>（Would he be surprised to see me if I waited at the entrance of his apartment？ Would he feel happy to see me……？）</p>



<p>It reminded me of the day before.</p>



<p>When I left my house yesterday, I was so ashamed that I immediately clung to Yuuma&#8217;s arm for an extended period of time, but when we arrived at his home,</p>



<p>──He smiled happily and praised me for my efforts.</p>



<p>&#8220;…………Okay!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui said so with great motivation as she left the house.</p>



<p>　†</p>



<p>「Okay!」, so she said as she made up her mind to leave the house, but Yui was already starting to regret it.</p>



<p>She was so ashamed to go out all alone without concealing her white hair.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was because it was lunchtime during spring break, but when she walked out onto the street, there were a good number of kids around her age walking around.</p>



<p>Although Yuuma told me not to worry about what others say about me and stay confident, I couldn&#8217;t help but be wary of those around me.</p>



<p>I felt it,</p>



<p>──the stares of everyone all around me, the whispers.</p>



<p>（It&#8217;s okay……it&#8217;s okay……）</p>



<p>I repeated this to myself over and over in my head.</p>



<p>Unpleasant sweat was trickling down behind my back.</p>



<p>My chest was so tight I felt like I was going to choke if I was not careful.</p>



<p>I took in deep breathes slowly and pushed myself to go forward.</p>



<p>（Almost there. I&#8217;m almost to the apartment where Yuuma lives.）</p>



<p>Yui constantly repeated this over and over in her head.</p>



<p>（Actually, I was going to wait at the entrance until Yuuma came out, but I&#8217;ll call him and ask him to come out and help me. So until then, hang in there, just a little more me…but then──）</p>



<p>In front of her stood a group of three girls her age.</p>



<p>…She felt scared even though they were about the same age. She didn&#8217;t want to get any closer to them, to be frank.</p>



<p>However, she had no way of escape. The trio was spread out all across the sidewalk.</p>



<p>There was nowhere to run. Yui just stood rooted on the ground, wondering to herself, 『what should I do?』. As she did so, she ended up standing in front of the trio, blocking their way.</p>



<p>It was her fault for blocking their way, but Yui herself knew it all too well. Even if she were to keep out of their line of sight, they would still stare at her, whether she liked it or not.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uwa, your hair is all white.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gross.&#8221;</p>



<p>As if they were having a normal everyday conversation, they said this in a light tone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>These were the type of people who wouldn&#8217;t mind saying such things.</p>



<p>People like that are not worth worrying about.</p>



<p>……Even though Yui knew this, she felt her chest tighten, and her breathing started to become more ragged.</p>



<p>The thing that just happened to her earlier was something that happened in the past as well.</p>



<p>It was a case of bullying.</p>



<p>Memories of that time started to flash back through her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hah……Hah……&#8221;</p>



<p>[I…can&#8217;t…breathe…]</p>



<p>──Hypernea.</p>



<p>It was a condition caused by extreme anxiety or nervousness.</p>



<p>Yui knew this condition all too well…</p>



<p>Despite finding a good day to go to school despite her frail body, Yui&#8217;s high school days ended due to this symptom.</p>



<p>When Yui was in elementary school, she was bullied, which caused this symptom to appear.</p>



<p>As a result, she became increasingly anxious that these symptoms would occur again. That anxiety contributed to her being more vulnerable to it….making Yui fall into a vicious cycle. The opportunities to go to school, which were few, became even fewer.</p>



<p>(T-the last time I went out was a long time ago…so I thought I was cured, but……)</p>



<p>…I didn&#8217;t think I would relapse just because of a few words like that.</p>



<p>Yui was starting to get a little dizzy; her eyes were rolling back, her legs began to wobble, and then it happened,</p>



<p>──she collapsed on the spot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, isn&#8217;t that a little bad!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t know!&#8221;</p>



<p>Out of the corner of her eye, all the girls from earlier started running away.</p>



<p>（Breathe……h-how do I…w-what should I do…help…）</p>



<p>It hurts…</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yu….Yu….Yuuma…help…&#8221;</p>



<p>Before I knew it, I found myself calling out for Yuuma.</p>



<p>My head was in pain.</p>



<p>The scenery around me was spinning round and round in circles.</p>



<p>&#8220;──Yui!&#8221;</p>



<p>T-that voice…is that….Yuuma?</p>



<p>Yui was startled, and she gently opened her eyes.</p>



<p>Yuuma was right before me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuu…ma…&#8221;</p>



<p>I hugged Yuuma as if I were clinging to him.</p>



<p>……I knew how to deal with the symptoms.</p>



<p>And then I buried my face in Yuuma&#8217;s chest.</p>



<p>Calm yourself down and take a deep breath.</p>



<p>Try to breathe slowly.</p>



<p>Yuuma gently rubbed my back; it had a gentle feeling to it, making me feel safe.</p>



<p>A few minutes later, my symptoms had settled down safely.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes…thank you…&#8221;</p>



<p>I let go of Yuuma and noticed him staring at me worriedly.</p>



<p>──I&#8217;m so embarrassed…..</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t believe I let Yuuma see this unseemly side of myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ow.&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked at my knee and saw that it was scraped and soaked with blood. There seemed to be a rock on the ground where he had kneeled earlier.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Did you get hurt? Let me take care of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s okay, this much…is nothing…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t allow that. Even if it&#8217;s a small injury, the moment it gets infected, you&#8217;re in deep trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma scolded me lightly as he took me to the nearby park.</p>



<p>I washed my wounds at a water fountain in the park and was made to sit on a bench so that Yuuma could apply adhesive bandages on me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You carry adhesive bandages with you…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My sister insists that I carry tissues, handkerchiefs, and bandages with me at all times.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sounds like my mum…&#8221;</p>



<p>I wanted to have a cheerful conversation with Yuuma to show him that I was fine, but it had the complete opposite effect. My voice was trembling, and it sounded as if it was about to fade away at the very end.</p>



<p>──I didn&#8217;t want him to see me like this.</p>



<p>I wanted to go to Yuuma&#8217;s apartment by myself and show him that I had overcome a significant portion of my complex.</p>



<p>I wanted him to praise me.</p>



<p>I wanted him to be happy.</p>



<p>Ever since I started playing and going out with Yuuma every day, I thought that I was getting better than before.</p>



<p>But it was no use at all.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t do anything on my own.</p>



<p>Nothing had changed at all.</p>



<p>When I think about it, I feel so miserable that I want to cry.</p>



<p>&#8220;……What happened….?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……I-It&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>My voice was trembling.</p>



<p>Yuuma was looking at me worriedly.</p>



<p>On one hand, I wanted Yuuma to leave me alone and go back home…on the other hand, if Yuuma were to return home from here, I might get stared at again by the others around me.</p>



<p>I want to be left alone, but deep down, I also want to be comforted.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m so pathetic.</p>



<p>My feelings were in disarray.</p>



<p>&#8220;…If you don&#8217;t like it, I&#8217;ll stay here beside you; if you want to talk, I&#8217;m always here for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma said such a thing as If he knew how I really felt.</p>



<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t utter a single word, Yuuma still sat down next to me.</p>



<p>He was genuinely concerned about me.</p>



<p>──That&#8217;s right. We can do it in the chat room like we always do.</p>



<p>I was so panicked that I even forgot my smartphone existed.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll tell Yuuma what happened, but before that, I need to show him that I&#8217;m fine, so that he needn&#8217;t worry so much.</p>



<p>Yui took out her phone and typed in the characters. After that, she hit &#8216;send&#8217;.</p>



<p>Soon after, a Pekon♪ sound sounded from Yuuma&#8217;s phone as he received the message.</p>



<p>『Yuuma, can I talk to you？』</p>



<p>He replied, 『of course』to my message.</p>



<p>『I tried my best to get to Yuuma&#8217;s apartment, but on the way there, I met a group of gyaru-like chicks.』</p>



<p>&#8220;!&#8221;</p>



<p>『And then they started laughing at me, calling me names, such as『Weird』and 『Creepy』. Those people really don&#8217;t think about other people&#8217;s feelings, do they?』</p>



<p>She continued.</p>



<p>『I truly understood in my head that there were people like that. But…when they started calling me names…my mind went blank…and then I couldn&#8217;t breathe.』</p>



<p>『I was so frustrated, yet I couldn&#8217;t say anything back to them. It hurts so much…why must I be so pathetic..』</p>



<p>──Eh？</p>



<p>A drop of water fell on Yui&#8217;s phone.</p>



<p>Is it the rain?</p>



<p>…….</p>



<p>A-am I crying….?</p>



<p>Before I knew it, my eyes were overflowing, and I couldn&#8217;t stop.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no….why…?&#8221;</p>

<p>Yuuma patted me on the back and gently comforted me.</p>



<p>It felt embarrassing, as if I was being treated like a small child. And yet, for some reason, these tears of mine wouldn&#8217;t stop flowing.</p>



<p>After that, Yuuma sent me home.</p>



<p>I was so embarrassed to have Yuuma see me like this…but I&#8217;m relieved that Yuuma was worried about me and that he&#8217;s taking me back home.</p>



<p>──My mind is getting all messed up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t worry about it too much, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>In front of the house.</p>



<p>Yuuma comforted me as we parted ways.</p>



<p>&#8220;Their simply morons who don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re saying.&#8221;</p>



<p>──I knew. I knew that, yet, I couldn&#8217;t…</p>



<p>My mind was a mess, and then──</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me that like you know what I&#8217;m talking about……!&#8221;</p>



<p>The next thing I knew, I found myself saying such things.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yui?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just a weird girl! An ordinary person such as Yuuma has no way of understanding how I feel!&#8221;</p>



<p>After I said it, I realized.</p>



<p>──This is….. Even if I had considered it, I should never have said anything like that.</p>



<p>&#8220;…………Sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma apologized with a pained look on his face as he mumbled.</p>



<p>（No……No！Don&#8217;t apologize！I&#8217;m the one who needs to say sorry！）</p>



<p>And yet….not even a single word came out. I couldn&#8217;t even let out a single 『I&#8217;m sorry』. It was as if I&#8217;d forgotten how to speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then…I&#8217;ll be taking my leave.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that, Yuuma turned his back towards me.</p>



<p>『Wait！』I tried shouting with all my might, but nothing came out. I wanted to hold him, I wanted to hug him, but my body wouldn&#8217;t move.</p>



<p>And then…</p>



<p>Yuuma left without further ado.</p>
