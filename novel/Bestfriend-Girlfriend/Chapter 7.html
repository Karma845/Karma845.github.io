<h1>Chapter 7: Gal and MiniMon</h1>

<p>“Hey, Yoda, do you play MiniMon?”</p>

<p>A few days after walking to school with Tsumakawa. During the break of the fifth period.</p>
<p>Just like before, while my male friend went to the restroom, I was reading a light novel alone… then suddenly, Tsumakawa-san started talking to me.</p>
<p>By the way, MiniMon, formally called “Minit Monsters,” is a game where players capture and battle with cute adorable monsters.</p>
<p>Although not as much as with light novels, I do like games to some extent, so I answered her a bit puzzled but replied like this.</p>

<p>“I played the one that came out last month until I reached the Hall of Fame…”</p>
<p>“No way, you defeated ‘Genichiro of the Blue’?!”</p>
<p>“Yeah… As the rumors said, he was the only one with an oddly high difficulty! I finally managed to rip the badge off his chest after retrying about a dozen times… Honestly, when I won, I was almost in tears. I was like, ‘I won, aaahhh!’ while sniffling.”</p>
<p>“He’s seriously that strong, huh? Well, there’s a favor I want to ask you—because I just can’t beat Gen-chan, would you play MiniMon with me tonight?”</p>
<p>“Eh, I refuse.”</p>
<p>“Why do you always reject things like this without even thinking? Take a moment to consider it. Seriously, at least pretend to think about it. It’s not like I wouldn’t be hurt, you know?”</p>

<p>While wearing an annoyed expression, Tsumakawa said this while poking my shoulder.</p>
<p>…I’m sorry for her, but I can’t just happily accept Tsumakawa’s invitation just because she’s a bit kind to me as a gal!</p>
<p>Thinking that inwardly, I deliberately changed the topic, asking her.</p>

<p>“By the way, Tsumakawa, you’re not only into light novels, but you also play games?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t play games that much. But I really love MiniMon, so that’s the only one I play. …When I read SAO, I sometimes think about trying virtual reality someday. Metaverse, you know? If that’s like SAO with death games, it sounds fun!”</p>
<p>“That would be bad, seriously. Death games started in the metaverse… People playing the metaverse are seeking healing from the tough real world, so dDon’t lock them up in the cyber world for a death game! Are you a demon?”</p>
<p>” ‘Welcome, players of the Metaverse. From now on, you will participate in a death game with the aim of clearing it.’ “</p>
<p>“No way? Seriously, it started? Just a while ago, I was just playing ping-pong with animal avatars!”</p>
<p>“If you lose in a ping-pong match against a CPU, electric current flows from the electromagnetic pulse in your VR headset, frying the loser’s brain.”</p>
<p>“They can’t sell dangerous stuff like that on Amazon, can they?”</p>
<p>“Hehe, so what will you do? Will you aim to clear the metaverse together with me?”</p>
<p>“Please spare me. I can’t become Kirito-kun!”</p>

<p>As I said that, Tsumakawa laughed cheerfully and said, ‘Well, the metaverse doesn’t really matter,’ and then she shifted the conversation back to its original place, about whether or not we would play MiniMon together tonight.</p>

<p>“Yoda, which version of MiniMon did you buy, Opal or Amethyst?”</p>
<p>“I was torn between the opal and the amethyst, but I bought the opal…”</p>
<p>“I see. By the way, I chose Amethyst. If Yoda hadn’t completed the MiniMon Encyclopedia, I think I could have been of help.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“So, what do you say? Shall we play together online tonight?”</p>
<p>“…alright.”</p>
<p>“Hehe. You could’ve just said so from the start, you obstinate otaku.”</p>
<p>“Tsumakawa-san, aren’t you too good at persuading obstinate otakus?”</p>

<p>Although I’ve been careful not to get too involved with Tsumakawa, why are events with her so unavoidable?</p>
<p>Could it be that she has passed the Level 1 Otaku Handling Certification?</p>
<p>If that’s the case, it would make sense that she can easily handle unpredictable goods like obstinate otakus, who could explode at any moment…</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>With this and that, time passed, and it became evening today.</p>
<p>It was a little after 6 pm——</p>

<p>『Sorry, Yoda.』</p>
<p>『I’m running late with work, so it looks like I won’t be able to play the game until later tonight.』</p>
<p>『As an apology, I’ll send you a picture of some ‘ita-nails’ (decorative, anime-themed nails) I had done before!』</p>

<p>With such a message from Tsumakawa, a certain photo was sent through LINE.</p>
<p>When I opened it, there was Tsumakawa, smiling brightly, showing off her nails with intricately drawn characters from various light novels on the tips of her fingers.</p>
<p>By the way, a few of the characters depicted included Haruhi Suzumiya, Sena Kashiwazaki, Koyomi Araragi, Chiaki Minami, Minori Kushieda, Isana Tachibana, and Akane Hayasaka—just by looking at the nail art, I could easily discern her favorite characters.</p>

<p>『Whoa, what’s this… Isn’t this incredibly amazing? Can you really do stuff like this with nails?』</p>
<p>『Right?!』</p>
<p>『This is seriously awesome!』</p>
<p>『There’s a shop in Akihabara that does stuff like this, and that’s where I got it done.』『The ita-nails were super fun!』</p>
<p>『I see. Just like ‘itasha’ (decorative, anime-themed cars), they call drawing ‘moe’ characters on your nails ‘ita-nails’… This is exactly the kind of culture suited for someone like you, Tsumakawa, who is both a ‘gyaru’ and an ‘otaku.』</p>
<p>『No way!』『Isn’t it like the world revolves around me after all?』</p>
<p>『I know I brought it up, but don’t get too carried away.』</p>
<p>『lol WWwww』『Hey, Yoda, how about doing it together next time?』『Let’s both get ita-nails!』</p>
<p>『Uh, well… I cry just from stubbing my toe, so I’m a bit scared of anything painful…』</p>
<p>『Even though it’s called ita-nails, there’s no actual pain involved!』『Don’t try to sidestep the issue with a lame joke just because you don’t want to get your nails done.』</p>
<p>(TN: Ita-nail, ita (痛)= Pain/painful.)</p>
<p>『Same to you—could you not see through my attempt to decline with a joke?』</p>
<p>『Okay then, I’ll make a reservation at the shop here for next time.』</p>
<p>『If you try to escape, I’ll give you an ‘ita-punch’!』</p>
<p>『What on earth is an ‘ita-punch’?』</p>
<p>『Let me explain!』『Ita-punch is…』『It’s a punch that isn’t painful, delivered gently to the shoulder with the hand that has the ita-nails!!』</p>
<p>『So it’s not painful despite the name? …Guess you’re still kind-hearted at heart, you gal.』</p>
<p>『Wait!』『Praising me won’t get you anything, just so you know.』</p>
<p>『…then, how about I give you money or something next time?』</p>
<p>『That’s so overly generous it’s worrying—stop it!』</p>

<p>After exchanging such messages on LINE with Tsumakawa, a few hours later, around the time it was getting past 9 pm, I received a LINE call from her.</p>
<p>I was in my room, so I answered it. Then, her voice, sounding less energetic than usual, came through my wireless earphones.</p>

<p>『Yahoo. I told you on LINE, but sorry for being late… I’m just super tired from my modeling job. Yoda, comfort me, like, ‘yosh-yosh.’』</p>
<p>“…Wait, are you trying to be an office worker on your way home from work? Also, how do I even do ‘yosh-yosh’ over the phone?”</p>
<p>『Just whisper ‘yosh-yosh’ to your phone. Come on, say it quickly.』</p>
<p>“No way… it’s impossible for an otaku like me to say ‘yosh-yosh’ to a gal like Tsumakawa.”</p>
<p>『Are you really not going to comfort me with ‘yosh-yosh’ after such a tiring day at work? Aren’t you supposed to be my boyfriend? Be more aware of your boyfriend’s duties!』</p>
<p>“First of all, I have no memory of becoming a boyfriend’ thing you’re talking about!?! Just to confirm, Tsumakawa, I am not your boyfriend, and you are not my girlfriend!”</p>
<p>『Wha are you talking about? …Oh, right. Yoda, you’re not my boyfriend yet… I was confused because I was too tired from work. Sorry.』</p>
<p>“Even if you’re tired from work, would you really have that kind of confusion?”</p>
<p>『It’s not that, Yoda. You’re my virtual boyfriend, right?』</p>
<p>“Huh? Virtual boyfriend… What is that… an evolution of a ‘boyfriend’? Are there virtual boyfriend evolution lines like Pokémon?”</p>
<p>『Yep, ahahah!』</p>

<p>Tsumakawa said that with a chuckle and a slightly playful tone.</p>
<p>Through my wireless earphones, Tsumakawa’s voice seemed to have regained some energy.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>TN: The phrase “よしよし” (yoshi yoshi) is a comforting, soothing expression in Japanese that’s often used while patting someone on the back or head.</p>


<p>『For now, even if you’re not my virtual boyfriend, give me some comforting ‘yosh-yosh’. Otherwise, I won’t play Minimon with you, Yoda!』</p>
<p>“Why does it sound like I’m the one who wants to play Minimon… And do I really have to say that for things to progress?”</p>
<p>『Could you add some ikemen lines that you think are cool? Because I’ve worked really hard today and deserve some kind of reward! It wouldn’t hurt for you, Yoda, so comfort me a little! I’m going to kick that horrible photographer in the nuts one day!』</p>
<p>“Wow, the complaints just keep coming.”</p>

<p>Anyway, it seems like Tsumakawa is in a needy mode today due to being tired from her modeling job…</p>
<p>Understanding that, I let out a small sigh and, of course, as part of the joke, I tried my best to use a cool voice while saying,</p>

<p>“Welcome home, princess. You did well at work today. Yosh-yosh.”</p>
<p>『…Eh, not bad.』</p>
<p>“Not bad!? Uh, Tsumakawa-san!? R I was fully prepared for you to react like, ‘Eww, Yoda, that’s creepy!’ when I said that cheesy line! Now it looks like I actually meant it, and that’s even more embarrassing!”</p>
<p>『Then give me another one with a different style!』</p>
<p>“There’s no way I have another crappy line prepared for a situation like this!”</p>

<p>As I retorted with my emotions, Tsumakawa burst into laughter as if she couldn’t hold back.</p>
<p>Then, with a brighter tone than before, she continued,</p>

<p>『Yay, I really feel a bit better now. I guess it’s true having a ‘Suki-pi’ [someone you like] is really valuable. Thanks, Yoda!』</p>
<p>“Uh, okay…s-suki-pi…”</p>
<p>『Hehe. I’m sorry for the misunderstanding, but I don’t mean it in a romantic sense. Depending on how hard you work, it could totally go that way, so I hope you’ll keep working hard! In fact, I might even get mad if you slack off!』</p>
<p>“Why am I the one getting scolded here? It’s quite a mystery…”</p>
<p>『Alright, enough chit-chat. Let’s play Minimon already. How long are we going to talk about unrelated stuff?』</p>
<p>“Sorry, Tsumakawa, but I think you’re mainly the cause of all this idle chatter.”</p>

<p>As I retorted through my wireless earphones, she responded with a cheerful ‘Hahaha’</p>
<p>Am I being underestimated here?</p>

<p>Thinking so, I launched the Minimon game on my handheld console.</p>

<p>『Which world should we go to?』</p>
<p>“For now, can Tsumakawa-san be the host?”</p>

<p>After she said ‘Let’s go!’, we connected to the online game.</p>
<p>Then, after going through several steps, my avatar, a boy, arrived in Tsumakawa’s Minimon world——next to the Minimon Center.</p>
<p>When my avatar looked to the side, there stood a girl with flashy makeup, blonde twin-tails, and a revealing uniform with ‘Aiamu bitchi’ written on her back, waving her hand.</p>

<p>『Yahoo Yoda! This may come as a bit of a surprise, but it’s my avatar! Cute, right?』</p>
<p>“Not surprising at all. It perfectly fits my image of you, Tsumakawa.”</p>
<p>『Hehe… So, Yoda, you chose a boy avatar? Don’t otaku usually choose girl avatars?』</p>
<p>“Ah, so that stereotype still exists… No, Tsumakawa. Otaku who choose girl player characters are often more sociable, positive types. On the other hand, those like me, who would really like to adventure as a cute girl but are too shy to do so, and therefore choose a male avatar, are the true otaku. In other words, otaku who choose female avatars are fake otaku, mere imitators.”</p>
<p>『Hmm. ——Ah, Yoda, come over here! Let’s catch this one together!』</p>
<p>“Even if you’re not interested in what I’m saying, could you at least react a bit? Don’t you feel sorry for me?”</p>

<p>As we talked like this, we walked around Tsumakawa’s adventuring world for a while.</p>
<p>『It’s fun, even though we’re just walking around like this.』</p>
<p>Tsumakawa said, making me a bit embarrassed and ignoring her. You gal, how awful.</p>
<p>As we walked through the streets of the Minimon world, Tsumakawa suddenly said,</p>

<p>『By the way, Yoda, your character’s clothes are still in default. Want me to buy some for you?』</p>
<p>‘What are you, my mom?'”</p>
<p>『You’re in high school and you’re still letting your mom buy your clothes? Hehe. Anyway, when we’re walking around this game world controlling our characters like this, doesn’t it feel like we’re actually walking around the city together? This is pretty much a date. Maybe I should actually invite you on a date today.』</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>『Stop going silent when you’re in trouble, you virgin.』</p>
<p>“V-virgin?! W-why so sudden… you really surprised me…”</p>
<p>『Haha. The fact that you don’t even try to hide that you’re a virgin is cute. You’re a cute virgin (Dōtei kawaī).』</p>
<p>“What do you even mean by a cute virgin? I’m a virgin, but I’m not cute.”</p>
<p>While we were having such an unproductive conversation, the avatars of Tsumakawa and I left the town and entered an open field.</p>
<p>Taking this opportunity, I decided to talk to her about our goal for today.</p>

<p>“Anyway, let’s finally go and defeat Ao no Genichiro… My Minimon has leveled up quite a bit by now, so I think we can easily defeat the difficult Gen-chan.”</p>
<p>『Hold on a second, Yoda. Are you misunderstanding something? I don’t particularly want you to defeat Gen-chan for me. That’s not the point—I wanted to get advice from you on how I can win with my own Minimon.』</p>
<p>“Ah, I see… You want to do it with your own Minimon, huh?”</p>
<p>『Yeah! So for now, let’s have a Minimon battle!』</p>
<p>“Got it. Just a moment, let me organize my team…”</p>

<p>With that, to assess Tsumakawa-san’s abilities, a Minimon battle between her and me began.</p>
<p>First, I summoned a massive dragon-type Minimon.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tsumakawa unleashed the most famous Minimon in the Minimon community, “Denki Nezumi Minimon.” Her avatar spoke like this:</p>
<p>【Go, Pika Poyo!】</p>

<p>“You’ve given it a name like something a gyaru would use.”</p>

<p>As I retorted, I defeated it in an instant. Next, Tsumakawa’s avatar unleashed the ‘Yuki-onna Minimon (Snow Woman)’ with the following line:</p>
<p>【Go, Kanachamu!】</p>

<p>“Why do gyarus tend to give their stage names names like ‘-chamu’ or ‘~~poyo’? By the way, who’s ‘Kanachamu’?”</p>
<p>『My best friend!』</p>
<p>“Don’t give your Minimon the name of your best friend!”</p>

<p>While saying that, I defeated ‘Kanachamu’ in an instant.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa got angry, saying, ‘You’re being so mean to my best friend!’ but this was her fault for making her best friend a target.</p>
<p>Anyway, next, Tsumakawa’s avatar unleashed ‘Buta (Pig) Minimon’ with this line:</p>
<p>【Go, Tokyo X!】</p>

<p>“Don’t give a pig Minimon the name of a branded pig! Is it meant for consumption or what?”</p>

<p>As I quipped and quickly knocked out her creature, Tsumakawa’s avatar unleashed another ‘Fire-type Inu (Dog) Minimon’ with the following line:</p>
<p>【Go, Hotdog!】</p>

<p>“Cut the clever wordplay. Heh, see what I did there?”</p>

<p>As I retorted, I defeated it again in an instant.</p>
<p>Finally, Tsumakawa’s avatar summoned ‘Osakana (Fish) Minimon’ with this line:</p>
<p>【Go, Gudetama!】 (A lazy egg yolk character, often appears in various culinary settings, including sushi.)</p>

<p>“It’s already assumed to be for eating. Even your character’s lines sound like catchphrases from a restaurant commercial…”</p>

<p>As I retorted, I defeated it again in an instant.</p>
<p>My avatar happily struck a victory pose. It seemed I had won the battle against Tsumakawa-san.</p>
<p>As I caught my breath while looking at the victory screen, suddenly… from the other end of the wireless earphones, I heard something akin to angry cries.</p>

<p>『Hey, isn’t it too much for you to keep beating up my Minimon!? Haa!? It’s super creepy! You’ve overtrained that Minimon! Yoda, that’s awful! Why won’t you let me attack even once!? This is really terrible! Uwaaaaaa!』</p>
<p>“…Hearing a high school girl’s ‘Uwaaaaaa!’ has a kind of genuine intensity that’s different from when a child says it, which makes it hard to listen to…”</p>
<p>『Shouldn’t you hold back a little!?!? I felt like crying watching my beloved Minimon that I’ve traveled with all this time get beaten up by Yoda! Don’t mess with me!』</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Tsumakawa-san… I also thought about letting you attack since it was too one-sided, but I thought that with the weak damage you deal, it would only shock you even more. So, I decided to finish this off as quickly as possible…”</p>
<p>『Uwaaaaaaahhh!』</p>

<p>This was the first time I ever made a girl cry. What should I have done to avoid this…?</p>
<p>For now, I didn’t possess the advanced technique of consoling a girl, so all I could do was to offer some extremely practical advice.</p>


<p>“Anyway, about some advice… Gen-chan’s Minimon is weak against Dark-type Minimon, but it seems you don’t have any of those, and overall your levels are a bit low. From the battle we just had, it’s clear that you’ll need to level up another seven or eight Minimon, or it’s going to be quite tough.”</p>
<p>『Uuu… I understand…』</p>
<p>“It’s impressive that you’re willing to listen to advice even while you’re crying… Can I step in with a bit more?”</p>
<p>『…okay… what is it?』</p>
<p>“Alright then, to put it gently—Yuki-onna Minimon’s ‘Kanachamu’ has pretty low base stats in this game, so it’s better to remove her from your party.”</p>
<p>『How dare you say something like that about my best friendddd!!!!』</p>

<p>If this were happening in person, I felt like I might be punched in the face.</p>
<p>Well, regarding this matter, neither of us could really claim to be correct… If the goal is to defeat Gen-chan, then you should start by removing the weaklings like Kanachiyamu, but love makes it complicated.</p>
<p>While thinking about this, I apologized to her for my insensitive comment and continued speaking.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Tsumakawa-san… Do you want to keep using Kanachamu?”</p>
<p>『Yeah… She was my first friend since I started modeling… Without Kanachamu, there’s no meaning in becoming a legendary Minimon trainer…』</p>
<p>“Well, it looks like you’ll have to diligently level up then. Of course, I could also help you defeat Gen-chan and get you through the story for now, but—”</p>
<p>『I told you, I don’t want that.』</p>
<p>“Right. Then do your best with leveling up.”</p>
<p>『…Thanks for the advice, Yoda…』</p>
<p>“…Unfortunately, I didn’t really say anything significant.”</p>

<p>After that, I continued offering her advice as best as I could—suggesting priority moves to teach, hunting grounds that were good for leveling, and such.</p>
<p>She became full of confidence, saying, ‘Ehh, it’s like I’ve already won.’</p>
<p>She’s getting ahead of herself too quickly.</p>
<p>Moreover, the information I was giving her was already available in more detail on strategy websites.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, at times like this, instead of relying on the internet, asking someone around you for help felt more like her style.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, I forgot to ask during the battle… Why do you only have five Minimon with you? You can carry up to six Minimon, right? There’s an extra slot?”</p>
<p>『Uh… Well, I just… I’m kind of searching for one more. I’m looking for a partner that feels right.』</p>
<p>“Is that so… Well, it would be better to have one more, even if it’s only temporarily. Can you show me your Minimon Box? Let’s see if we can find a good Minimon.”</p>
<p>『Sure.』</p>

<p>Saying that, Tsumakawa manipulated her blonde gal avatar and extended her right hand upwards.</p>
<p>From there, a hologram resembling a Minimon Ball appeared, so I checked it and confirmed the Minimon stored in her box. Folders 1, 2, 3…As I glanced through the Minimon she had captured until now, I noticed a folder with the name ‘Traveling Party!’ mixed in with the existing ones.</p>
<p>Inside it, there was only one Minimon stored, labeled with that name.</p>

<p>“Oh? So ‘Traveling Party’ means there was already another regular member?”</p>
<p>『Ah——』</p>

<p>While pondering this, I checked that Minimon.</p>
<p>It was a Justice-type Ryuukishi Minimon, a cool-looking monster popular online.</p>
<p>Its individual values were decent, and it had a strong skill set.</p>
<p>Additionally, the affinity level with the player is also maxed out, so if she had used this character, she could have put up a decent fight against me. I wonder why Tsumakawa-san didn’t use this one this time——</p>

<p>“Hm? …Wait a second!?”</p>

<p>As I muttered that, I focused on a certain aspect.</p>
<p>It was the part where the player gives a Minimon a nickname… For some reason, this cool and strong Minimon with maxed-out affinity had been given the name ‘Yoda.’</p>
<p>A name that seemed weak for such a strong and cool Minimon.</p>
<p>Upon realizing this fact, the handheld game console suddenly displayed an error message.</p>

<p>【Connection has been terminated】</p>

<p>Surprised by this screen, I heard Tsumakawa’s somewhat panicked voice through the wireless earbuds as I was left in a daze.</p>

<p>『…Ahaha, did I get caught? Well, the truth is, I was progressing in Minimon with ‘Yoda.’ Of course, there wasn’t any deep meaning behind it; I just randomly chose it. But earlier, when I decided to play Minimon with you, I remembered that ‘Yoda’ was at my party… Um, isn’t it kind of creepy if you saw this ‘Yoda’ here? So, I kept it in my box… I wonder why I showed you my box’s contents so casually? Ahaha…』</p>
<p>“Oh, I see… I see what you mean….”</p>
<p>『Yeah, that’s how it is. I mean, it’s not that awkward for you to see it. It’s just like using the name of a close friend, right? Actually, Miona cares about ‘Yoda’ not just in reality but in the Minimon world as well.』</p>
<p>“I-I see…”</p>
<p>『Yeah, that’s all. Ahaha…』</p>
<p>“A-ahaha…”</p>
<p>『 ….. 』</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g9.png" alt="" />

<p>『You seem to be making things awkward.』</p>
<p>“That’s not a very nice thing to say, is it? “</p>

<p>Right after a brief silence, I was suddenly hit with an unreasonable remark. Reflexively, I retorted to it.</p>
<p>Then, Tsumakawa cleared her throat and continued.</p>

<p>『Hmm, I don’t know what to say…it’s not like I’m really that embarrassed. Because I like Yoda, even if it’s revealed that I used Yoda’s name for my Minimon, it’s just one of my characteristic actions, and there’s no reason for me to feel embarrassed about it——Ah, I see. Maybe hiding it a little to prevent Yoda from finding out is what’s making it really embarrassing now! Kyaa——!』</p>
<p>“Wait, ‘Kyaa——’? …I’ve never heard ‘Kyaa——’ from a gal before, that’s quite a cute scream…”</p>
<p>『 ‘Actually, I’ve been raising Yoda.’ ——I should’ve said this before we started playing Minimon! Why did I not want this to get revealed? Ugh… I messed up… If I knew I’d end up feeling this embarrassed, I wouldn’t have started playing Minimon with Yoda….』</p>
<p>“Right now, you’re casually saying some pretty mean things.”</p>
<p>『But, it was really fun playing together, so I guess it’s fine…』</p>
<p>“Can you stop making my emotions go on a roller coaster?”</p>

<p>I wonder if my retorts are even getting through to her.</p>
<p>Once again, Tsumakawa let out a deep sigh, and in a somewhat relieved and cheerful voice, she said:</p>

<p>『Well then! Since it’s getting awkward, see you later!』</p>
<p>“If you can say that, it’s not really that awkward… Alright, see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>『Yep! Thanks for today! Goodnight!』</p>

<p>With those words, the call abruptly ended.</p>
<p>…No, wait, did I just casually say ‘see you tomorrow’? Was I getting carried away?</p>
<p>Even though I’m just being used as a temporary toy by that popular gal, I’m overestimating how much she’s into me, aren’t I…?</p>
<p>As I reflect on this, I continue to play Minimon offline.</p>
<p>If the Minimon ‘Yoda’ that Tsumakawa had been training had been a dark-type instead of a justice-type, he would have easily defeated the powerful Gen-chan.</p>
<p>Even in the world of Minimon, he’s useless—just like me.</p>
<p>Come on, ‘Yoda’, hang in there.</p>
