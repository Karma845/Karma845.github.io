<h2>Chapter 7: Prejudice of Love</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>



<p>Sena Club was on the verge of falling apart before summer vacation.</p>



<p>That was my frank impression.</p>



<p>With the chaotic atmosphere before the final exams, conversations in the classroom had somehow diminished. While Nanamura, Miyachi, and I engaged in light chatter, we avoided touching upon the topic of the stand-in boyfriend.</p>



<p>As for Asaki-san, since that incident, she had ceased all casual conversations beyond the necessary exchanges as class representative. Whenever our eyes met, she would quickly look away, and once her business was done, she would promptly leave. It was clear that her confession at the cafeteria had left a lasting impact.</p>



<p>Our homeroom teacher, Kanzaki-sensei, maintained her composure on the surface as if nothing had happened. However, under the occasional scrutiny from some students who knew about the stand-in boyfriend, her stoic face occasionally faltered.</p>



<p>And then there was Yorka.</p>



<p>During lunch break, we had our lunch together alone in the art preparation room as usual.</p>



<p>“I tried to talk to my sister, but she avoided the topic.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“What about you, Kisumi? Did she tell you anything? You exchanged contact information, didn’t you?”</p>



<p>“Not really. I haven’t sent her a single message, nor have I received any,” </p>



<p>I had been mindful of my distance from Aria-san following Yorka’s lead.</p>



<p>“…Why do you sound so awkward?” </p>



<p>“Well, it’s because I feel guilty.”</p>



<p>It caught me off guard to hear Yorka speak so naturally.</p>



<p>“If that’s the case, you shouldn’t accept the role of a stand-in boyfriend from the beginning.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… Um, Yorka, are you upset?” I couldn’t help but ask, as her behavior seemed so normal.</p>



<p>“Who do you think I’m upset with? My sister? That class rep girl? Or maybe our homeroom teacher?” </p>



<p>Whoa, talk about a tough question where any answer felt like a wrong one.</p>



<p>“Um… my own behavior.”</p>



<p>“I know my boyfriend can’t turn a blind eye to someone in need because he’s just that kind-hearted. If I can’t handle that, then I wouldn’t have dated you in the first place.” Yorka looked exasperated.</p>



<p>I appreciated the generous nature of my girlfriend, yet at the same time, something felt weird…</p>



<p>“There’s no way my girlfriend is this much of a saint!”</p>



<p>“You’re way too paranoid!” Yorka finally snapped.</p>



<p>“Ah, that’s the Yorka-like reaction.”</p>



<p>“Why are you happy about being scolded? There’s a limit to being emotionally unstable.”</p>



<p>“Because you’re kind.”</p>



<p>“I might stop being so lenient…” </p>



<p>“I’m kidding, sorry. I love you, so please forgive me.”</p>



<p>“I don’t like how much my sister relies on you!”</p>



<p>“How much do you even like Aria-san!? Is she like a goddess to you!? You’re practically worshiping her beyond just sibling affection!” </p>



<p>There was a significant gap in our perceptions between Yorka and me.</p>



<p>“I don’t understand why my sister only relies on you, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“Right. She only taught me how to study.”</p>



<p>“…You haven’t done anything strange to my sister before, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s impossible, and it would be absurd. You’re my first in everything. Don’t make me say it again.”</p>



<p>After saying that, I felt a bit embarrassed and averted my gaze.</p>



<p>The plaster statues on the table ahead remained motionless, their blank white forms offering no conversation. While I could stare at an inanimate object comfortably, interacting with the opposite sex was always difficult.</p>



<p>My lack of experience always left me pondering and being tossed around.</p>



<p>I thought I had answered Yorka honestly without any pretense, yet she suddenly fell silent.</p>



<p>“…Y-yeah.”</p>



<p>When I turned my gaze back to her, Yorka seemed bashful. There was a hint of happiness in her gesture.</p>



<p>Just like when she invited me over to her house, her hand fidgeted with her hair nervously.</p>



<p>In this world, having ample experience often served as a strength, but it didn’t always guarantee everything. In that subtle gesture, I found myself easily reassured, gaining a boost of confidence.</p>



<p>Words were important, no doubt. But sometimes, affirmation came in ways beyond words.</p>



<p>Yorka, beautiful and capable as she was, unquestionably loved the ordinary me.</p>



<p>The girl I loved simply wanted to be with me, just the way I was.</p>



<p>“To Yorka, it’s alright to be just myself, right?”</p>



<p>“Huh? Of course.”</p>



<p>Our gazes met.</p>



<p>The pause between us was too brief to call it silence, and neither of us looked away during that fleeting moment. Her lips were so close.</p>



<p>I leaned in slowly towards her.</p>



<p>“Wait! We’re still eating!” she exclaimed and pushed me away, causing me to tumble to the floor.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry! Are you okay?” Yorka quickly helped me up.</p>



<p>The pain was nothing.</p>



<p>If anything, what worried me more was Yorka’s excessive admiration for her sister.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>It seemed like Yorka was overly conscious of the failed kiss attempt during lunch break, as she didn’t suggest meeting up after school today. Instead of heading straight home and potentially lazing around, I decided to study in the library until the end of the school day and then head home.</p>



<p>When I was walking home alone for the first time in a while, I received a call from Aria-san.</p>



<p><em>“Hey there, Sumi-kun. Where are you right now?”</em></p>



<p>“I’m on my way home from school.”</p>



<p><em>“Perfect timing! Let’s have a meeting! I’m about to reach the station, so meet me there.”</em></p>



<p>“Wait, right now?” </p>



<p><em>“I’ll treat you to a delicious dinner. Call me when you arrive,” </em>she said before abruptly ending the call.</p>



<p>My stomach growled at the opportune moment.</p>



<p>“Well, I guess it’s fine if she’s treating.”</p>



<p>After all, it was Friday; no need to fuss. Besides, my parents were home today, so I didn’t need to worry about dinner for Ei. I informed my mother that I would be having dinner with friends while studying for exams and walked to the station.</p>



<p>“Just in case, I should let Yorka know too.”</p>



<p><strong><em>Kisumi</em></strong>: <em>I was invited by Aria-san to discuss the stand-in boyfriend’s thing. I’ll report back once it’s over.</em></p>



<p>By the time the station came into view, I received a response from Yorka.</p>



<p><strong><em>Yorka: </em></strong><em>Got it. Thanks for letting me know. Be careful with the distance between you and my sister. Remember, I’m the only one allowed to get close to Kisumi. </em></p>



<p>Yorka’s message wasn’t from her sisterly affection; it was a reminder about maintaining boundaries because we were a couple. I found her convoluted way of expressing her affection adorable.</p>



<p>When I scanned the station rotary, I couldn’t spot anyone who looked like Aria-san. </p>



<p>Upon calling her back, she instructed, <em>“Just keep walking straight. I’m in the taxi parked right in front of you.”</em></p>



<p>The taxi door swung open, revealing Aria-san’s face. “Oh, still in your school uniform?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I came straight from school.”</p>



<p>“Did you and Yor-chan make out at school?”</p>



<p>“I’m just studying for exams by myself.”</p>



<p>“Whoa, that’s impressive. Actually studying for exams… I hardly ever did that.”</p>



<p>“That’s a privilege reserved for the smart ones.”</p>



<p>“Anyway, hop in,” she gestured, and I obediently slid into the backseat of the taxi.</p>



<p>“Do college students take taxis this often?” I asked as I fastened my seatbelt. The taxi silently pulled away from the nearest station.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to walk in high heels. When you’re escorting a lady, you’ve got to check the footwear.”</p>



<p>“You dressed up again today.”</p>



<p>“Of course, I had to look my best to meet you.”</p>



<p>“Thanks, but if it’s just to meet me, I’m fine with something casual.”</p>



<p>Honestly, it would be more relaxing if she dressed down like she did during her tutoring days.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you kind? I’ll take that sentiment. Unlike before, I have more opportunities to present in front of people, and I’ve been scolded by everyone around me to dress properly. That’s why I’ve been making an effort to look presentable when going out. Today’s meeting is really important.”</p>



<p>“You seem really busy. Yorka misses you.”</p>



<p>“For now, she has you.”</p>



<p>“How do you feel about your sister having a boyfriend, Aria-san?” </p>



<p>“A mix of surprise, gratitude, and a bit of murderous intent.”</p>



<p>“That’s quite a dangerous confession.”</p>



<p>“I genuinely want to congratulate my adorable little sister. I’m happy that she has found someone who can break through her delicate shell and make her open up. But at the same time, if anyone hurts her, they’ll have to deal with me.”</p>



<p>“Aria-san, you look scary.”</p>



<p>“But honestly, when I found out it was you, I felt relieved and reassured, Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Was that when you sent a sneaky photo from the tropical island?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, seeing the name ‘Sena Kisumi’ felt nostalgic, and I thought, ‘<em>He’s serious and reliable.’</em>” </p>



<p>“But I just got tutoring from you. Did you overestimate me, Aria-san?”</p>



<p>Aria-san paused for a moment before replying, “How should I put it… you have this way of making people feel at ease.”</p>



<p>“Do you mean I’m too average and easy to underestimate?” </p>



<p>“Think of it more positively, like you’re dependable and easy to rely on or seek comfort from. I’m giving you a compliment here.”</p>



<p>“And because of that, I end up being roped into a stand-in boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Haha, yeah, you do.”</p>



<p>Man, she’s quite the smooth talker.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, the taxi was heading towards a residential area.</p>



<p>“By the way, you really stirred things up last time. Thanks to you, the Sena Club is on the verge of collapse.”</p>



<p>Despite hearing different perspectives from Nanamura, I felt the need to voice my thoughts.</p>



<p>“I spotted a little bug eyeing my cute sister’s boyfriend. It’s only natural to feel concerned, right?”</p>



<p>“But you didn’t have to spill everything in front of everyone…”</p>



<p>“It just bothered me that everyone was playing nice while hiding their true feelings.”</p>



<p>“It’s not normal to see through that. Besides, exposing someone’s hidden feelings isn’t exactly noble, is it?” </p>



<p>Her keen insight stripped people bare, catching every subtle hint and piecing together the whole picture accurately. Even if Aria-san was protecting me, it still weighed heavily on my conscience, considering Asaki-san’s position.</p>



<p>“Is it because it’ll inconvenience you, Sumi-kun?” Aria-san’s eyes sparkled with curiosity as she directed her gaze towards me.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s part of it. She’s my partner for class duties. If things sour between me and Asaki-san, I don’t have the confidence to handle the busy events like the sports festival and cultural festival. Thanks to someone making the scale of school events bigger, the workload has increased!” </p>



<p>“That’s a sneaky way to dodge responsibility.”</p>



<p>“The one being sneaky is you. I don’t want any more hassle added to my plate and be forced to cut my time with Yorka.”</p>



<p>Truth be told, I hadn’t planned on being a class representative this year. I only took on the role because of a request from Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“Heh, it’s such a pain dating someone in the same class.”</p>



<p>“And who was the outsider who stirred up trouble, knowing that?” </p>



<p>“Don’t get mad, Sumi-kun,” Aria-san playfully tugged at my tie as if throwing a tantrum.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t tighten it too much!”</p>



<p>“…I’m not as mature as you think.”</p>



<p>She forcibly pulled my tie over close to her face. Without running away, I looked deep into her eyes.</p>



<p>“Hey, stop staring so intensely,” Aria-san said and released my tie.</p>



<p>“Aria-san, can I ask you a question?” </p>



<p>“As long as it’s not something perverted.”</p>



<p>“I want to know about the history between Yorka and you,” I continued, ignoring her playful remark.</p>



<p>“Still sounds kind of pervy to me.”</p>



<p>“How?”</p>



<p>“Because you’re interested in what’s inside her,” Aria-san gave a meaningful smile.</p>



<p>“Since you might become my sister-in-law, I do want to understand your relationship as a future family member.”</p>



<p>“Haha, are you thinking about marriage already even though you’re still in high school? You’re quite mature.”</p>



<p>“I’m serious.”</p>



<p>“I won’t allow it.”</p>



<p>“But you don’t have that kind of authority, do you?”</p>



<p>“Even so, I won’t hand her over to Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>I decided to delve a bit further into the history of the Arisaka sisters.</p>



<p>“If you’re so overprotective, why don’t you try talking to Yorka directly? Instead of just doting on her for your convenience, you should listen to her feelings.”</p>



<p>The other day, when Aria-san appeared at school and took me away, Yorka couldn’t resist her sister’s words. At the same time, it seemed like Aria-san intentionally avoided hearing Yorka’s words.</p>



<p>I felt like Aria-san was deliberately minimizing communication with Yorka despite knowing the excessive influence she had on her.</p>



<p>“I know, but Yor-chan is too serious and obedient. She listens to me too well,” Aria-san averted her gaze outside the car window.</p>



<p>“Yorka is already in high school. She may be sensitive, but she can think and make decisions for herself.”</p>



<p>Yorka wasn’t as much of a child as Aria-san seemed to think.</p>



<p>“Hey, Sumi-kun. Why do you think Yorka has grown to dislike socializing with others?” </p>



<p>“By asking that question, it seems like you have some idea about the cause, Aria-san.”</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re good at reading between the lines.”</p>



<p>“You’re the one who taught me to read the intentions of the questioner.”</p>



<p>“So, what’s your answer?” </p>



<p>When I heard about Yorka’s middle school days at her house, I understood it from Yorka’s perspective. She ended up feeling lost mentally because she inadvertently stopped pursuing her goal of emulating her sister. Not knowing what to do besides imitating her sister, she began to feel even more stressed by the scrutiny of those around her.</p>



<p>“Is it the disparity between the image of Yorka that everyone holds and Yorka’s own self-perception?” </p>



<p>Yorka’s goal was always to become like her sister, Aria-san.</p>



<p>“Whoa, that’s close. You’re quite sharp, Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Then, what’s the correct answer?”</p>



<p>“…It’s because everyone expects Yor-chan to be a carbon copy of me.”</p>



<p>In the confines of the taxi, Aria-san confessed.</p>



<p>“Like when we visited the faculty room the other day?” </p>



<p>During that visit, the teachers who surrounded the alumna, Aria-san, reminisced about the past while subtly comparing their current student, Yorka, to her.</p>



<p>Aria-san lifted the corner of her lips, looking satisfied, “Your impressive memory must have helped you pass the exam.”</p>



<p>Her hand reached out to lightly pat my head.</p>



<p>“That’s right. I hate to brag, but I’m really exceptional. I can do whatever I want and achieve better results than others. I enjoy the praise, and new challenges give me a thrill, so I can’t stop. I’ve been living happily every day.”</p>



<p>Arisaka Aria, naturally charismatic, enjoyed being carried as a <em>mikoshi</em><sup data-fn="a04e015f-a9fb-4db5-8b3f-890f2f4d1c0c" class="fn"><a href="#a04e015f-a9fb-4db5-8b3f-890f2f4d1c0c" id="a04e015f-a9fb-4db5-8b3f-890f2f4d1c0c-link">1</a></sup> and reveled in the attention it brought. In essence, her qualities and the admiration she received were perfectly aligned.</p>



<p>“I don’t mind being the one others expect things from. It’s fun. But expecting the same from my sister is irresponsible and cruel, don’t you think?” </p>



<p>Aria-san grinned. Her faintly visible white teeth seemed to resemble fangs.</p>



<p>“Yor-chan and I have a four-year age gap. We attended the same elementary school until partway through, but I don’t know what happened after graduation. Same goes for middle school, but it was three years, so we missed each other. I never really thought about how she spent her time after I graduated. What she went through in those years. That’s why I wished she would have gone to a different high school, away from my shadow. Maybe then, she could have lived more freely.”</p>



<p>Aria-san’s concern was valid. At Eisei High, there were plenty of legends about her.</p>



<p>“But given Yorka’s personality, wouldn’t that be difficult? Besides, at Eisei, there’s Kanzaki-sensei, and now me.”</p>



<p>“I can see that now.”</p>



<p>With those words, I could feel her frustration.</p>



<p>“Yorka was always compared to her great sister who graduated so effortlessly. Even since she was a child, she unconsciously tried too hard to meet the same expectations placed on her.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. From upper elementary to middle school, Yor-chan tried to take on a leadership role actively and wanted to be like me. It’s admirable.”</p>



<p>“It doesn’t quite fit, but I can imagine it.”</p>



<p>“Ordinary kids would give up quickly or realize it’s impossible at some point. But she’s smart and capable of imitating me.”</p>



<p>I caught a glimpse of Aria-san’s inner turmoil.</p>



<p>It was impossible for a family to control every aspect of school life. What Yorka did wasn’t an innocent act of a younger sibling imitating the older one. </p>



<p>Yorka, who should never have been able to emulate the incomparable Arisaka Aria, was nevertheless compared to her by others. She was expected to be a replica of Aria-san. Yet, she could never measure up to the real one.</p>



<p>“Yor-chan’s personality made it tough for her, however she tirelessly tried to meet the irresponsible expectations of others around her. And she started blaming herself for not being like me. Whenever we talked at home, she earnestly sought my advice. ‘<em>Onee-chan, tell me what to do.’</em>” </p>



<p>“Is that why you started avoiding her and said you’re busy?”</p>



<p>“I want to respect her efforts, but I can’t stand seeing my sister hurt because she compares herself to me. Everyone else listens to me, but my most important one, Yor-chan, does not.”</p>



<p>“Then you went to Kanzaki-sensei for advice.”</p>



<p>Finally, the connection between the past and the present became clear to me.</p>



<p>Yorka, who was desperately trying to match up her respected sister, wore herself out in the process. Meanwhile, Aria-san could only watch over her hardworking sister in frustration.</p>



<p>The Arisaka sisters loved each other dearly. Though they remained close, there was still an underlying sense of distance between them.</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan listened to me earnestly. She gave me a lot of advice, and it really helped ease my mind. But I failed to help Yor-chan.”</p>



<p>A sister who idolized her elder sister too much, and a sister who couldn’t guide her younger sister properly because she was too pure-hearted.</p>



<p>“‘<em>If she was disillusioned, seek a different path,’</em>” I quoted.</p>



<p>“…Did Shizuru-chan tell you that?”</p>



<p>“She just happened to mention it. What did you do exactly?” </p>



<p>“Hmm, persuasion didn’t work out, but something I said in passing apparently had an effect.”</p>



<p>“Is that about you getting a boyfriend in high school?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I just described Shizuru-chan as a male teacher and referred to him as my boyfriend.”</p>



<p>She revealed something outrageous so casually.</p>



<p>“…Wait, you did what?”</p>



<p>“I told Yor-chan about the school incident with Shizuru-chan as if she were a male teacher. Yor-chan got so angry, it was kind of amusing.”</p>



<p>“Could it be… Yorka didn’t know Kanzaki-sensei was a woman until she entered Eisei?” </p>



<p>Knowing Aria-san’s personality, I felt like she wouldn’t tell Yorka.</p>



<p>“How did you know, Sumi-kun?” </p>



<p>“You’re the worst! If you let Yorka think a male teacher made advances on her dear sister, it’s no wonder she treats Kanzaki-sensei as her archenemy!”</p>



<p>Her ideas have always been too outlandish. Changing the gender of her homeroom teacher and even fabricating a relationship? That was the kind of outrageous scheme that would make parents faint.</p>



<p>“It wouldn’t be surprising at all if I had a boyfriend at that age.”</p>



<p>“But you’re lying about the gender!”</p>



<p>Yorka must have been really shocked. As an avid fan, she must have suffered significant psychological damage after hearing her beloved sister’s first scandal.</p>



<p>Even knowing that Kanzaki-sensei was a woman wouldn’t erase Yorka’s resentment from back then.</p>



<p>“She stopped imitating me, but she’s gone to the extreme of pushing everyone away.”</p>



<p>“That’s bound to breed a deep distrust of people.”</p>



<p>“Yor-chan can be extreme too.”</p>



<p>“You’re one to talk, being so extreme yourself.”</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, you’ve been prickly since earlier. Be nicer.”</p>



<p>“Don’t mess around. Regardless of the past, you’re still messing with people’s emotions! Cut it out!” </p>



<p>And thus, under the influence of her laidback sister, she became the misanthropic Arisaka Yorka that I knew so well.</p>



<p>“Yor-chan used to be so ensnared by my image that she felt she had to go that far. I didn’t want to deceive my sister either…” </p>



<p>A hint of anguish still colored Aria-san’s profile. Despite her usual cheerful and playful demeanor, the occasional glimpse of her troubled side bore a striking resemblance to Yorka.</p>



<p>“…Maybe her life would’ve been easier if I’d just been an ordinary sister.”</p>



<p>“You’re someone who asked her sister’s boyfriend to pretend to be their homeroom teacher’s lover, that’s impossible,” I replied dismissively.</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, do you dislike me?”</p>



<p>“Would you kick me out of the taxi if I said yes?”</p>



<p>Aria-san looks startled. “You’d die if you jumped out while we’re moving!”</p>



<p>“I’m not planning on jumping!”</p>



<p>At least let the car stop. Jumping out like something out of a Hollywood movie would be too dangerous.</p>



<p>“Don’t say unnecessary things now; Stick with me till the end.”</p>



<p>“I’ve already agreed, a man never goes back on his word.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Even if everything goes south, I’ll have your back, Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“I appreciate that.”</p>



<p>The taxi stopped in front of an apartment building in a residential area.</p>



<p>“Huh, aren’t we going to the restaurant?”</p>



<p>“The food here is even better, don’t worry.”</p>



<p>We took the elevator up to a certain floor and headed towards an apartment door.</p>



<p>“Hello! We came for a strategy meeting ~”</p>



<p>“…Why is Sena-san here too!?”</p>



<p>Opening the door, we were greeted by Kanzaki-sensei in an apron.</p>
