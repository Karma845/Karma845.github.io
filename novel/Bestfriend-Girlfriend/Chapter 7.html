<h1>Chapter 7: Rotten Sea</h1>

<p>That day— the day I spoke to Fiodor at the inn, I immediately sprung into action as soon as he left.</p>
<p>To accept the slave trading association’s request and protect Suzume, it was crucial for me to contact her as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Fiodor admitted to having discovered a Kijin but remained silent about its location. It was surely a precautionary measure. Regardless of my ability to ride a Wyvern, it’s impossible to locate a girl in a forest as vast as a country. By withholding the location, Fiodor must have decided not to worry about me potentially surpassing him.</p>
<p>Fiodor probably never imagined that I could find the Kijin before him.</p>
<p>In fact, I was one step ahead of Fiodor.</p>
<p>However, the difference in our progress was so small that it wouldn’t be strange for him to overtake me at any moment. That’s why I needed to find Suzume immediately.</p>
<p>Well, knowing Suzume’s whereabouts was important, and I had a faint idea about it.</p>
<p>The Jiraiya Oaks tree where we parted should be nearby. Searching that area shouldn’t be too difficult to find Suzume.</p>
<p>By strengthening my body, I could significantly enhance the strength of my legs and physical power.</p>
<p>If Suzume’s home had some sort of magical or spiritual protection, it might be beyond my control.</p>
<p>Force might be a solution, but if it resulted in the barrier disappearing and Suzume getting captured, it would be a catastrophe. Considering that, I decided to bring Luna María and Seal along.</p>
<p>Luna María, a forest fairy elf, would be more sensitive to unnatural places in the forest, such as barriers to keep people out, compared to humans.</p>
<p>Next was Seal, an Ocelote with the keenest senses among the beastmen. Having her with us would make it easier to find Suzume.</p>
<p>The deep area was a place even high-level adventurers refrained from entering. In that sense, it was dangerous for both Luna María and Seal. However, as slaves, they couldn’t disobey my orders.</p>
<p>So, we ventured into the depths.</p>
<p>——————————————————————</p>
<p>“This is the depths of Tittis…”</p>
<p>Upon entering, we arrived at the cliff with the Lord of the Flies’s nest. When Luna María looked at the cliff, she exclaimed in surprise.</p>
<p>“The spirits are very active. It reminds me of the original forest in my homeland.”</p>
<p>Unlike Luna María, who narrowed her eyes with nostalgia, Seal looked at the forest with a tense expression.</p>
<p>“It’s incredible… It’s making me a little dizzy…”</p>
<p>She said that and stayed by my side, probably on high alert for the magical beasts in the surroundings.</p>
<p>Seal had grown a lot in her adventures but hadn’t reached a level where she could fight deep within the forest.</p>
<p>Before we set off, Luna María expressed her consideration, “I wouldn’t mind going, but I can’t say the same for Seal.” Despite that, I had to protect Seal.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I held Luna María on my right side and Seal on my left. They seemed nervous, but I didn’t pay much attention to it.</p>
<p>This was the fastest way to descend from the cliff, just as I had done when helping Suzume.</p>
<p>I leaped down the slope with the two of them. The cries of the elf and the beast girl merged with the sound of the wind blowing deep into the area.</p>
<p>Afterward, the two of them looked at me with worried face and puffed cheeks, then we headed toward Jiraiya Oaks.</p>
<p>Suzume and I had parted ways at this place. That meant her home must be somewhere nearby where she could return on her own.</p>
<p>I thought that by using this as a base for exploration, we would eventually find some clues.</p>
<p>However, as soon as we reached Jiraiya Oaks, I stumbled upon a clue that was easier than expected.</p>
<p>When I heard a surprised voice saying, “Wow,” from behind, I turned my attention to it. Seal furrowed her brow and covered her nose. When I asked her what was happening, she responded with some distress.</p>
<p>“S-Sorry! There’s a very strange smell in this area…”</p>
<p>“A strange smell?”</p>





<p>I also sniffed, but I didn’t detect anything noteworthy. I mean, in the Tittis forest, untouched by human hands, you could smell the earth, herbs, animals, monsters, living and decaying trees adrift, but I didn’t sense that “strange smell.”</p>
<p>Surely, Seal could detect the subtle differences. I suppose it was worth bringing her.</p>
<p>“What kind of smell is it, specifically?”</p>
<p>“It smells rotten. I don’t know exactly, but it tickles my nose and throat…”</p>
<p>Seal coughed a bit.</p>
<p>“Hm… Could someone be using smoke to ward off monsters? Can you determine the source of the smell?”</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment.”</p>
<p>Seal closed her eyes and continued to sniff for a while. And when it seemed like she had noticed something, she nodded and looked at me seriously.</p>
<p>“When the wind blows from the north, the smell becomes particularly strong. Maybe the source of the smell is in that direction.”</p>
<p>“Great, good job!”</p>
<p>After praising Seal, we headed north as she suggested. But I didn’t forget to cover the nose and mouth of the beast girl with a cloth. This would help minimize the smell.</p>
<p>As we moved forward, I noticed that the smell Seal described as “tickling my nose and throat” grew more intense.</p>
<p>Now, the odor was so overpowering that it could be clearly smelled even by a human nose.</p>
<p>Then, Luna María spoke up. She had a tense, sharp, and alert expression.</p>
<p>“Be careful, master. The spirits are screaming. They have been crying out for help for a while… It’s an incredible amount. It’s as if the plants and trees around here are all in pain.”</p>
<p>Luna María covered her mouth, feeling nauseous. Seal also made a pained expression. It seemed that the smell couldn’t be avoided even with the cloth.</p>
<p>After a while, the two of them regained their composure, and we continued moving, but they would surely reach their limits soon.</p>
<p>Should I return to the nest and let the two rest before that happens? As I pondered that and cut through the branches obstructing the path, “it” entered my field of vision.</p>
<p>— It was a sight of the dying forest.</p>
<p>The trees had deteriorated, the grass had withered, and the ground was rotten. A poisonous miasma constantly rose from the muddy soil. It was this miasma that Seal had been suffering from since the beginning. Just standing there made my nose and throat ache, and tears streamed from my eyes. It was a highly toxic atmosphere.</p>
<p>From the vegetation that had turned a dark purple color, a bittersweet scent reminiscent of overripe fruit emanated. When the leaves from the trees floated in the air and came into contact with the decaying ground, they turned black, like leaves thrown into a bonfire.</p>
<p>Upon seeing all of this, Luna María let out a scream as if warning us.</p>
<p>“Could this be… the Rotten Sea!? This is bad, master! We need to get out of here immediately!”</p>
<p>I nodded without hesitation.</p>
<p>We hurriedly retraced our steps and quickly moved away from the “Rotten Sea” as Luna María had called it.</p>
<p>She was appealing as much as she could with a desperate look on her face, so I held onto both of them and ran back to Jiraiya Oaks.</p>
<p>“Back to square one, huh?”</p>
<p>As I left them at the base of the tree, I let out a sigh while saying that. In a way, they didn’t react to my words and were breathing deeply. The two of them, especially Luna María, seemed to calm down, so I asked her for an explanation of what had happened earlier.</p>
<p>“The Rotten Sea is a phenomenon of land corrosion under specific conditions.”</p>
<p>Luna María, who responded to my question, began explaining while placing her hand on her chest.</p>
<p>“Think of it as a natural phenomenon that occurs in lands where the miasma has intensified due to some reason, such as volcanoes or battlefields. However, it’s really rare for it to intensify, and even if it does, it will naturally disappear in a few days, but…”</p>
<p>“No matter how you look at it, it’s unlikely to disappear on such a scale.”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>Luna María weakly nodded at my words. The Rotten Sea we had seen earlier was only a fraction of the vast Tittis forest. However, it was true that it was the size of a small town. I didn’t want to dwell on it, but it was possible that on the other side, where our eyes couldn’t reach, it was eroding immensely.</p>
<p>“I don’t think this is the only place rotting. I mentioned that the Rotten Sea is a natural phenomenon, but sometimes it’s caused by monsters. It is said that the enormous Rotten Sea that spread south of the Sacred Kingdom was the result of a poisonous Hydra dragon falling in ancient times.”</p>
<p>“Hydra… Do you think that mythical species has appeared? I’ve heard rumors that mythical species live in the deepest part of Tittis.”</p>
<p>“That would be impossible, master. According to the stories, a Hydra has nine heads, each longer than the walls of Ishka. There’s no way a giant beast like that could go unnoticed. At least, surely this incident has nothing to do with a Hydra.”</p>
<p>“Hm. Well, it’s a coincidence that a mythical species would show up.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>Whether it’s natural phenomena or other poisonous beasts.</p>
<p>In any case, the situation of decay in Tittis was very critical. Luna María opened her mouth and spoke with great concern.</p>
<p>“If the Tittis forest is swallowed by the Rotten Sea, the blessings of the forest will disappear. Medicinal herbs, woods, monster materials… the products that support Ishka’s economy will be lost all at once, and Ishka will be thrown into chaos.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. Additionally, the monsters in Tittis, having lost their habitat, won’t remain idle while starving.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Surely the monsters will attack people in large numbers in search of food. An outbreak of uncontrolled monsters would be inevitable. Moreover, there is a more serious problem.”</p>
<p>Luna María said it.</p>
<p>The Kale River, originating from the Tittis forest, is the lifeline for daily water and hybrid resources used in Ishka. If the Kale River is contaminated by the poison of the Rotten Sea, the damage would not only affect Ishka but also all the cities and towns in the Kale River basin. The poison damage would spread not only to humans but also to livestock and the soil. It’s not an exaggeration, this is a crisis that would affect Ishka and then the Kingdom of Canaria.</p>
<p>As I listened to Luna María’s words, I suddenly remembered the request I was currently receiving from the orphanage. The request to collect Aldo herbs. Perhaps the cause of the fever in the orphanage was due to the poison from the Rotten Sea.</p>
<p>It could be that the poison from the Rotten Sea had dissolved into the river water and entered the mouths of the residents—if that were the case, the first to fall would be the children, who had less resistance than the adults.</p>
<p>It’s just a supposition. But it’s a very plausible one. Knowing that, I have to take serious action.</p>
<p>Right now, I have two options. Identify the cause of the Rotten Sea outbreak or return to Ishka to inform them about it.</p>
<p>The longer the report is delayed, the longer it will take to take action. Delay only increases the damage.</p>
<p>In that sense, informing Ishka should be the priority. Identifying the cause is important, but widespread decay is not easy to find. Especially if you’re not an expert.</p>
<p>Now, the most important thing is to avoid wasting time. Taking that into account, the course of action was obvious.<br />
——————————————————————</p>
<p>— “Well, both of you will return to Ishka on the Wyvern.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Luna María and Seal looked at each other. Then Luna María spoke on behalf of both of them.</p>
<p>“Did you say ‘both of you’? What will you do, master?”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay and search for Suzume. That was our original purpose in coming here.”</p>
<p>“…I know the master’s power. But I think it’s reckless and dangerous. The Rotten Sea is not something that can be fought with a sword. And if something were to happen…”</p>
<p>I don’t think there will be any problems. If I die, you’ll be free from slavery—I tried to say it lightly, but looking at the two of them who were very serious, the  words disappeared.</p>
<p>In fact, I told the slave trading association to free them if I die. There are good and bad things in the world. This is probably the latter.</p>
<p>“…W-Well, there’s nothing to worry about. I have no intentions of dying. If something happens, I’ll just escape to the nest. The Wyvern will return once I’ve left you in Ishka.”</p>
<p>Luna María wanted to say something, but she simply closed her mouth without uttering a word. She was probably thinking that it would be useless to say anything, or that we shouldn’t waste any more time.</p>
<p>Seal remained silent like Luna María. I held both of them as they were and hurried to reach the nest of the Lord of the Flies.</p>
<p>“Well, I guess I should get going too.”</p>
<p>After watching Luna María and Seal fly away on the Wyvern towards the south, I slapped my cheeks and raised my spirits.</p>
<p>To be honest, I’m not entirely sure why I’m getting so involved in finding Suzume. It’s true that part of it is the thought of “I don’t want my few good deeds to be in vain,” but prioritizing a Kijin girl in the midst of the Rotten Sea situation must seem inexplicable to many.</p>





<p>—Probably, I’m sympathizing with Suzume based on what happened five years ago.</p>
<p>Of course, Suzume and I are in completely different situations, but it’s a situation where no one offers you help despite your efforts— that’s the only thing we have in common.</p>
<p>That’s why there was no option to abandon Suzume. Because if I did that, I would be no different from those people five years ago. That didn’t sit well with me at all.</p>
<p>I kicked the ground and started running with determination. I was convinced that I could run for three days and three nights without getting tired.</p>
<p>I wonder how far I’ve run. Then, I came across a strange place deep in the forest.</p>
<p>It was a small village. Wooden houses were lined up in a circular pattern in the open forest. They didn’t look like simple huts; each house was quite sturdy.</p>
<p>Earthen fences and wooden assembled doors. At first, I thought it might be a hidden village of the elves, but judging from the architectural style of the houses, they were clearly human-made. Building houses with trees instead of stones reminded me of the oriental architecture of Onigashima.</p>
<p>The number of houses exceeded twenty, and assuming that each house housed a family of five, the total number of villagers exceeded a hundred.</p>
<p>If there is a village of this size deep in Tittis, where monsters roam all the time, it should be known and talked about by many.</p>
<p>But if that’s not the case, it’s because this village was completely isolated from the outside world.</p>
<p>In other words, this is…</p>
<p>“The Kijin village?”</p>
<p>A village hidden by a barrier. Now, the landscape before me must be that.</p>
<p>“But then, why is there no one?”</p>
<p>I tilted my head in doubt as I looked at the quiet village. It’s too soon for them to have noticed my presence and hide.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I didn’t encounter any barriers or anything of the sort before reaching here.</p>
<p>I didn’t get lost, I wasn’t blocked by solid walls, and I wasn’t attacked by guardians. I was concerned about that aspect.</p>
<p>Then, as I entered the village and paid close attention to my surroundings, my brows furrowed more and more.</p>
<p>It was as if there were no signs of life in the houses. I had already seen a dozen houses, but all the doors were closed, and the windows were covered with wooden boards.</p>
<p>Rather than evacuating over time, it seemed like no one had ever lived here in the first place.</p>
<p>Looking at the damaged houses, I could only think of that. It was only natural that I couldn’t sense any signs of life.</p>
<p>As I ventured deeper into the village, I noticed a strange smell. This nose-tingling smell seemed familiar to me. I closed my eyes for a while.</p>
<p>After that, I decided to continue forward. And what awaited me, in a way, was a familiar sight.</p>
<p>The northern part of the village had been swallowed by the Rotten Sea. There was an enormous centuries-old tree, which seemed to be a symbol of the village, standing tall against the sky. But the massive tree was decaying from its roots. The trunk was cracked, the branches and leaves were torn, and it was practically dead. Then, I realized something.</p>
<p>—A monster was attached to the trunk of the massive tree.</p>
<p>In simple terms, the appearance of the monster resembled an eight-legged lizard. Poisonous scales of dark red color. It was over six meters long, and if you include its sturdy-looking tail, it could reach ten meters. It flicked its tongue in and out like a snake, occasionally emitting a sound of “Kyurororo.”</p>
<p>By its appearance, it resembled one of the “Poisonous monsters that could cause the Rotten Sea” that Luna María mentioned before returning to Ishka.</p>
<p>In other words, a Serpent King, a Basilisk.</p>
<p>According to the wise elf, the monster known as a Basilisk is characterized by the poison that emanates from its body. Once, a knight who faced a Basilisk died despite dodging all of its attacks.</p>
<p>He was poisoned through the lance he used to attack the monster. That was the monster known as a Basilisk.</p>
<p>As the monster advances, the herbs die, the ground decays, and the pristine springs turn into poisonous swamps.</p>
<p>A disaster-class monster that must be defeated immediately upon discovery.</p>
<p>The basilisk clung to the trunk with six legs and was gripping its captured prey with its remaining two legs.</p>
<p>Two horns that seemed very familiar. It was without a doubt Suzume trapped by the Basilisk.</p>
<p>Suzume’s face looked so grim even from here. She seemed unconscious, not moving at all. It was like she was dead. Given the toxicity of the basilisk that erodes the land, even approaching it is dangerous. Moreover, it’s touching her directly… it might already be too late.</p>
<p>“—Reborn Soul Equipment.”</p>
<p>Well, whether Suzume is alive or dead, the fact remains that I will kill the Basilisk. Energy surged through my entire body with just a breath.</p>
<p>I manifested my Reborn Soul Equipment and positioned myself. It seemed like the Basilisk didn’t notice me—perhaps it did, but it ignored me. I aimed at the serpent king as it opened its mouth to devour Suzume and casually swung my blade.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>The Guardian Forest.</p>
<p>That’s what the Kijin called the vast forest known by we human as Tittis. Suzume is a survivor of the Kamuna clan, who protects the Guardian Forest—the last of them.</p>
<p>Originally, the Kamuna village was a small settlement where around a hundred Kijin lived. Against humans, the policy was “Invade or don’t invade”; they wouldn’t do anything unless the forest was disturbed.</p>
<p>The choices for the Kamuna village were taken away from humans. Forty years ago, the Kamuna village was destroyed by a group of samurais from the east.</p>
<p>Despite the Kijin’s fierce resistance, the samurais’ power was overwhelming, and only seven survived. There were elderly people who were too old to fight and children who were too young to fight. Suzume’s parents were among those children.</p>
<p>After that, the surviving Kijin resumed their lives normally, but it was impossible for a group of elderly and children to live in the depths of Tittis, the nest of monsters.</p>
<p>Some fell ill, others were attacked by monsters, and others gave the little food they had to their children and died.</p>
<p>The Kijin dwindled more and more. By the time Suzume was born, her parents were the only surviving Kijin. And her parents were no longer there. Suzume’s father went hunting when she was three years old, but he never returned, and her mother died from an illness on Suzume’s sixth birthday. Seven years had passed since then. Suzume had been protecting the Kamuna village alone.</p>
<p>At sunrise, she searched for nuts and edible plants in the forest, returned to the village at night when monster activity was high, and carried out cleaning tasks. Including houses other than her own.</p>
<p>That’s what her mother used to do, and Suzume took over after she passed away. It was for when the residents would return someday—Suzume remembered her mother’s sad face as she said that.</p>
<p>And there was one more thing that Suzume inherited from her mother. That was the offering to the sacred tree that stood to the north of the village and performing a dance in dedication.</p>
<p>A ritual to calm the spirit of the serpent that slept in this land.</p>
<p>It was a ritual that the Kamuna villagers had been performing for generations, and even though they had reduced their food intake, Suzume’s parents had always prioritized the offerings.</p>
<p>Even for her sick mother, it was indispensable, and after she could no longer dance, she taught young Suzume how to do it.</p>
<p>Previously, Suzume was captured by the Lord of the Flies because the quantity of offerings wasn’t sufficient, and she ventured outside the barrier to gather more food despite the danger.</p>
<p>That’s when she encountered a human, and he helped her.</p>
<p>—It was the first time she had exchanged words with someone since her mother’s death. Until then, she was desperate to survive and had no time to spare. Monsters couldn’t enter the Kijin village due to the barrier, but small animals like squirrels, rabbits, hedgehogs, and birds frequently visited her. Talking to them made her feel less alone. Even if something happened, she never thought of leaving the forest and going to a human city.</p>
<p>But since that encounter, Suzume’s feelings towards humans had changed slightly.</p>
<p>That person wasn’t a monster who would attack a Kijin as soon as they saw one, but someone she could talk and laugh with.</p>
<p>When she found a lost human in the forest, instead of staying silent and running away, she spoke to him and guided him to the river.</p>
<p>He was a different person from the one who helped her escape from the Lord of the Flies, but he was still a human, and she thought she had repaid the favor in some way.</p>
<p>But there was no way a thirteen-year-old girl could predict that the person who helped her had sold her information to a slaver.</p>





<p>The location of the village could be specified because of that. Hunters were sent one after another.</p>
<p>Because of that, she couldn’t leave the barrier, and thus, she couldn’t foresee that the ritual for the spirit of the serpent couldn’t be performed.</p>
<p>Then, the Rotten Sea spread from the Serpent King’s appearance, swallowing part of the village, withering the sacred tree, and the barrier vanished.</p>
<p>Suzume faced the monster alone. The peculiar long pupils of a snake. Were those completely red eyes filled with delight at the delicious prey in front of it or with the hatred of being sealed for many years?</p>
<p>Suzume tried to escape up a small hill, but she received a powerful blow from the Basilisk’s trunk-like tail and was quickly captured.</p>
<p>With a throaty sound of joy, “Kyurororo,” the monster climbed the sacred tree while holding Suzume.</p>
<p>…..Ahh, am I going to die here?</p>
<p>Trembling with pain and fear, Suzume thought that. She wanted to escape, but her body wouldn’t move.</p>
<p>She knew it. Since the barrier protecting the village had disappeared due to the Rotten Sea, even if she could survive today, a harder life than ever would await her tomorrow.</p>
<p>A thirteen-year-old girl couldn’t survive in Tittis without any protection. In that case, if she died here, the suffering would be shorter. She could see her parents again.</p>
<p>“Please, be happy.”</p>
<p>Her mother died lamenting about leaving her young daughter alone. Suzume was sad because she couldn’t respond to those last words, but it was already impossible.</p>
<p>“…..I’m sorry, mother.”</p>
<p>She murmured with a trembling voice. The basilisk extended its long tongue as if laughing at that and licked Suzume’s face and body. A terrifying sensation ran through her entire body. But she no longer had the strength or energy to dispel it.</p>
<p>Her vision grew darker. Just like her consciousness. Right before everything was about to be engulfed in blackness, she felt that someone was in her field of vision— but surely, it was just her imagination. Suzume thought that.</p>
<p>There was no way someone could be here. Even if there was, they were probably some kind of reaper coming to take her away. Thinking that, she tried to surrender to her consciousness.</p>
<p>But at that moment…</p>
<p>“Kyurororo!?”</p>
<p>An explosion rang out near the monster, followed by a thunderous roar. Sensing something had happened, Suzume’s body felt weightless. The Basilisk, which had been squeezing her like a vice, released its grip.</p>
<p>The Basilisk had climbed the sacred tree while holding Suzume. But as it let go of her body, she fell according to the laws of nature. It was a great height. Moreover, Suzume couldn’t move her body. Was it due to the monster’s venom or a reaction to having given up everything? As she involuntarily closed her eyes, a voice reached her ears.</p>
<p>“—Oh, that was close.”</p>
<p>With such a voice, Suzume’s body was firmly held in the air and landed as it was. When she timidly opened her eyes, she saw a young man with black hair and eyes looking at her with a daring smile on his lips.</p>
<p>It was a familiar face. It was, but she didn’t know why he was here at this moment.</p>
<p>“…Sora-san…?”</p>
<p>The young man whom Suzume murmured to—Sora winked one eye. Suzume didn’t understand that, but she opened her mouth, intending to thank him. However, instead, her eyes widened in the next moment.</p>
<p>The Basilisk that was above Sora and Suzume had flames of anger in its eyes and charged downward—no, it gained momentum from there!</p>
<p>If you were crushed by the enormous body of the Basilisk, whether you were human or Kijin, there would be no salvation.</p>
<p>“Uhh… Uh…!”</p>
<p>Suzume tried to somehow warn Sora of the danger, but her tongue, like her body, didn’t move. Sora, who was holding Suzume in his arms, didn’t have a weapon to face the Basilisk.</p>
<p>No, even if he did, there was no way to counter the weight of a 10-meter Basilisk.</p>
<p>Run, Suzume tried to convey that to Sora. It didn’t matter if he had to abandon her, but he should run.</p>
<p>But just before Suzume could utter a word, the enormous Basilisk descended. In response to that, Sora looked up. Even as he saw the Basilisk approaching, he didn’t bat an eyelid. Not even a tenth of Suzume moved.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Sora slowly opened his mouth—</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>“Kaa!!”</p>
<p>A loud sound that could shatter eardrums echoed. At that moment, Suzume’s body jumped in Sora’s arms.</p>
<p>She was also startled by the loud noise, but because Suzume possessed a magical organ called a “horn,” she noticed and reacted to the immense magical power contained in the loud sound.</p>
<p>She shuddered to the core of her being. Her ears rang, and for a moment, every sound disappeared from her hearing. This was just the aftermath. If a direct blow was received, her body could literally break apart.</p>
<p>Suzume thought of that. Confirming that assumption, the enormous Basilisk, struck by Sora’s magical power, soared above gravity.</p>
<p>“Kyurororoooooooo!”</p>
<p>The 10-meter Basilisk flew through the air as if it had been hit by a cannon directly.</p>
<p>After witnessing that, Sora briefly spoke to Suzume, who was astonished.</p>
<p>“We’ll jump. Be careful not to bite your tongue.”</p>
<p>Jump? There wasn’t time to ask. In the next moment, Sora swiftly squatted down and kicked the ground while holding Suzume.</p>
<p>A powerful impact struck Suzume’s entire body, to the point where she was on the verge of screaming.</p>
<p>Then, Sora descended onto ground that had not yet been consumed by the rotten sea.</p>
<p>After setting Suzume down, Sora reached out for the katana that was impaled in the ground in front of him. He gripped the black katana emitting a mysterious power without hesitation.</p>
<p>At that moment, the ground shook violently. The Basilisk that had been sent flying by Sora’s magical power crashed to the ground. The Basilisk immediately fixed its gaze on Sora and let out a roar of intimidation.</p>
<p>The ground was rotten and muddy, so it seemed to have received little damage from the fall.</p>
<p>Aiming at that Basilisk, Sora casually swung his katana. It was a strike that wouldn’t reach it, yet it easily severed the monster’s leg. The monster’s leg danced in the air, spraying poisonous blood, and a howl of agony echoed in the area.</p>
<p>Looking again, the Basilisk, which should have had eight legs, unexpectedly now had five. If the earlier attack was the first strike, then the second—when Suzume thought of that point, she finally realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Sora, who hurried to this place, first cut off the two legs that had trapped Suzume. After that, he thrust the katana into the ground and, with his arms free, leaped to the base of the sacred tree to catch Suzume as she was falling. Then, after catching her, he repelled the Basilisk’s counterattack with magical power, jumped back into the air, and returned to this place. It was something a human couldn’t do.</p>
<p>“…Huh.”</p>
<p>While Suzume silently watched Sora’s back, he spoke to her in a soft voice.</p>
<p>“Suzume, step back a little further.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes!”</p>
<p>As she was told, Suzume quickly moved away from Sora. Sora, who confirmed it with a sideways glance, raised his katana into the air. The black tip pointed directly to the sky.</p>
<p>“—Illusory Sword Style.”</p>
<p>As soon as Sora murmured those words, Suzume felt a strong heat and let out a surprised voice. When she looked, the black katana held by Sora was burning red as if it had turned into a flame. A column of fire shot straight into the sky.</p>
<p>“Burn together with this rotten forest—Flames of Grudge!”</p>
<p>When Sora swung his katana, the flames that stretched toward the sky quickly turned into torrents and attacked the Basilisk. It enveloped and crushed the enormous Basilisk along with the rotting sea that surrounded it.</p>
<p>Suzume could only watch that sight as if she were dreaming.</p>





<p>“Hm, it’s really resilient.”</p>
<p>I muttered quietly so Suzume wouldn’t hear me. And as I said that, the Basilisk engulfed in flames continued to thrash about for a while. It’s a monster with the name of a king, so I suppose it’s not weak enough to be defeated by a single technique.</p>
<p>But that was the Basilisk’s last resistance. It was inevitable. Then, the soul of the dead serpent king came to me.</p>
<p>Immediately, my body trembled. It was a familiar sensation—the level increase.</p>
<p>Now my level is “8”. When I tried to exhale in satisfaction, I heard a weak voice saying, “Ah…” from behind. Then, I heard something falling. Looking over, Suzume had collapsed with a pale face.</p>
<p>I hurried over to her. I thought she had collapsed due to all the tension with the Basilisk, but her breathing was ragged, her face was pale, and there was a lot of heat when I touched her forehead. No matter how you look at it, these were symptoms of illness.</p>
<p>At first, I tried to take Suzume to one of the houses in the village, but I immediately changed my mind. The smoke rising from the burning rotten sea was a darker purple black. It was obvious that it was highly poisonous and contained substances that were harmful to the body. Depending on the direction of the wind, sparks could start a fire. Keeping Suzume in the village in this situation was dangerous.</p>
<p>…Did I rush to use fire? No, if I left the rotten sea as it was, it would surely engulf the forest and villages. If we think about it simply, it would be “A forest that continues to decay” or “A forest reduced to ashes.” Considering that, the latter was less harmful. A girl who lost her birthplace might come to a different conclusion, but everything will be resolved in due time.</p>
<p>“For now, we need to get away from here. Other monsters besides the Basilisk might attack.”</p>
<p>I remembered that we were still in danger. I surveyed the surroundings and left the Kijin village, carrying Suzume.</p>
<p>After that, I headed to the Lord of the Flies’s nest.</p>
<p>I placed Suzume on the bed that Miroslav had used when I brought her here before, and tried to give her the Jiraiya Oaks fruit that I had take. Suzume’s symptoms were worsening. I felt that, at this rate, things would go very badly.</p>
<p>However, Suzume had been unconscious for a while. In that state, she wouldn’t be able to eat the fruit. With no other choice, I decided to chew the Jiraiya Oaks fruit and feed it to Suzume mouth-to-mouth.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was a success. Suzume’s labored breathing gradually recovered. Her fever subsided, and I felt more relieved, but the problem was not yet over.</p>
<p>This time, her body temperature began to drop rapidly. Even if the poison disappeared, the lost physical strength wouldn’t return. At this moment, Suzume’s body had no room for warmth. Remembering, she remained unconscious even after eating the sour Jiraiya Oaks fruit. Perhaps her spirit had been exhausted to the core.</p>
<p>“This is bad… even if I take her to Ishka and have her receive healing magic, I don’t think she has enough physical strength…”</p>
<p>There was the option to go and buy a stamina potion or a superior potion—but the problem was the same. Suzume’s endurance wouldn’t last until I returned.</p>
<p>A feeling of frustration emerged from the depths of my heart. I couldn’t take her to Ishka, and there wasn’t much time. In that case, I had to do something with the things in this place. There should be a multipurpose potion in my luggage—no, wait. I was thinking about many things, but I remembered what Luna Maria said. That my blood is equivalent to that of a dragon.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘Drinking the blood of a dragon will cure any illness, and eating its meat will rejuvenate the body.’ It might be poisonous to a weak body… but we’ll have to try.”</p>
<p>At this rate, she won’t survive. So, we can only take a risk.</p>
<p>I bit into the flesh of my right arm, absorbed the blood that spilled, and put it into Suzume’s mouth. I repeated it two, three times, thinking I would stop if something went wrong.</p>
<p>As I did that, Suzume’s cheeks started to turn red. When I touched her forehead and arms, I could feel a certain warmth in her body that had been cold as ice.</p>
<p>Haaa. I exhaled, feeling a great relief. I think she’ll be fine now, but I can’t let my guard down. I lay down next to Suzume in case her condition suddenly changed.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Then, I remembered the events of today. I defeated the Basilisk. I saved Suzume. And I’m fine. They were really good results. The rotten sea still remained, but it’s not something I can handle alone. Summing up all of that, my thoughts naturally went beyond that point.</p>
<p>It’s about Suzume’s future. It will be difficult for her to live in that village swallowed by the rotten sea. I’m also curious about what happened to the other Kijin. I can give her this nest if she wants it, but if something happens, the rotten sea could affect this area.</p>
<p>If she wants safety, she must distance herself from Tittis, but—</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll think about it when she wakes up.”</p>
<p>I murmured softly and yawned. I still have plenty of energy, but as expected, my body feels heavy.</p>
<p>I could rest a little here. I thought about that and gently closed my eyelids.</p>
<p>The next morning at dawn, Suzume and I were in the city of Ishka. In front of us stood Fiodor, the slave trader who wanted the horns of the Kijin. He then opened his mouth, looking confused.</p>
<p>“—The ritual for the spirit of the serpent?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It seems to be a ritual that the Kijin performed to seal the monster.”</p>
<p>We were in a  residence owned by the slave trade association. I met with Fiodor and explained what happened yesterday in Tittis, including what Suzume told me.</p>
<p>Fiodor’s originally narrow eyes narrowed even further, and he occasionally glanced at Suzume, who was sitting next to me. For Suzume, it was like jumping into a nest of humans who were chasing her. Whenever Fiodor looked at her, her body trembled, and she grabbed the edge of my clothes.</p>
<p>While closely observing Suzume, Fiodor continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the Basilisk appeared because the ritual couldn’t be performed?”</p>
<p>“I believe it’s appropriate to consider that in the context of the situation.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… that means I indirectly summoned the Basilisk.”</p>
<p>Fiodor said with his hand on his dropped jaw. As a result of sending hunters with the aim of capturing Suzume, she had difficulty leaving the village, which prevented her from gathering the necessary food for the ritual.</p>
<p>As Fiodor said, practically the association bears greater responsibility for the Basilisk’s appearance—</p>
<p>Fiodor stared at me intently.</p>
<p>“Putting that aside, was the Basilisk truly defeated?”</p>
<p>“I confirmed that the monster was engulfed by the fire along with the rotten sea. It’s hard to imagine that it could have escaped from that fire.”</p>
<p>However, I added that I hadn’t examined the corpse, so I couldn’t say for certain that it was defeated.</p>
<p>“Although that wasn’t the purpose.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Fiodor continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Hoo. A Kijin helped a human? I heard that the Basilisk’s venom is powerful enough to corrupt the land. How did she manage to do it?”</p>
<p>“With this.”</p>
<p>I showed Fiodor the Jiraiya Oaks fruit. After looking at the yellow fruit, Fiodor turned his gaze towards Suzume. She noticed his gaze, and her body trembled once again.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that this fruit is a remedy that can repel the Basilisk’s venom?”</p>
<p>“It seems to be a secret that has been passed down through generations among the Kijin. Thanks to this, I was able to survive. Suzume-dono is my savior. And it’s not just about the venom. She was prepared to sacrifice her own village and set it on fire, and she plunged the monster into the flames.”</p>
<p>Saying that, I looked back into the slaver’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Perhaps the Basilisk was the source of the rotten sea. In other words, Suzume-dono is not only a savior to me, but also to the city of Ishka. If my belief is to repay resentment with resentment, and virtue with virtue, then I intend to protect Suzume-dono with my life from now on. I would like to ask for your cooperation, Fiodor-dono.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to help protect a Kijin? Considering what you said, isn’t there a possibility that she lied? She might be trying to enter Ishka through deception and planning something.”</p>
<p>Fiodor stared at Suzume. She trembled three times.</p>





<p>“Is it really a fact that the Basilisk appeared because the ritual couldn’t be performed? I have never heard of a method to seal a monster with just offerings and dances. It’s more believable to think that the Basilisk was summoned from the depths of the forest using a secret technique of the Kijin.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I suppose it’s inevitable to have doubts. If possible, I didn’t want to make Fiodor-dono my enemy… but, it’s a pity.”</p>
<p>I stood up next to Suzume. The escorts behind Fiodor placed their hands on their swords with sharp gazes.</p>
<p>At the moment, the ones in the room are Suzume, Fiodor, Fiodor’s two escorts, and myself. Only the two escorts were armed. I left my weapon at the reception. Furthermore, the slaver in front of me had over a dozen soldiers hidden on the roof and behind the walls. If he even tried, it would be easier for him to get rid of me and capture Suzume—that was as clear as day.</p>
<p>While preparing to manifest my soul equipment, I paid attention to everyone’s movements. The battle will begin when the escorts draw their swords. Thinking about that…</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>Fiodor raised his hand to control his escorts. The escorts quickly let go of the handles of their swords.</p>
<p>“I apologize sincerely, Sora-dono. However, I would like you not to make a hasty decision. What I said was just a supposition not the facts. Merchants are timid and suspicious. We can’t help but always think when a decision might be counterproductive.”</p>
<p>“I understand. I apologize as well. But I swear that protecting Suzume-dono will not harm Fiodor-dono or the association.”</p>
<p>“Hoo. How would that be?”</p>
<p>“With this.”</p>
<p>With that said, I showed the Jiraiya Oaks fruit again. And I continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Although the Basilisk was defeated, the rotten sea still remains. If there are already signs of illness due to the venom, the demand for an antidote will grow exponentially.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. So, are you suggesting that we leave the research and operation of the fruit to us?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s correct.”</p>
<p>I nodded clearly in response to Fiodor’s words. Then, I prepared for the final blow.</p>
<p>“Of course, I will also help when it comes to collecting the Jiraiya Oaks fruit. Having a Wyvern will greatly reduce the hassle and cost of round trips to Ishka. Additionally, this venom antidote technique can be used not only this time, but also in the future. Most poisons can be neutralized if you can neutralize the Basilisk’s venom. If such an antidote is created, adventurers and aristocrats in various places who fear poisoning will buy it without hesitation. It’s like the association would have a money tree.”</p>
<p>“HooHoo.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, there is no escaping the responsibility of interfering with the ritual and causing the Basilisk’s appearance, but the only ones who know about the spirit of the snake ritual are all present here. I have no intention of leaking information that could harm my collaborator. It’s a secret that I will take to the grave.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, when Fiodor and the association are no longer my “collaborator,” I will speak freely about everything. If this information is spread, not even the slaver trading association will come out unscathed. The appearance of a Basilisk and the rotten sea are major incidents that affect the Kingdom of Canaria. Saying “I knew nothing about the spirit of the snake ritual” won’t be an excuse.</p>
<p>I’ve said many things, but in the end, I only wanted to convey one thing.</p>
<p>—Stay away from Suzume.</p>
<p>For that purpose, I handed over the profits from the Jiraiya Oaks, and I will help him conceal inconvenient facts. In return, if they don’t harm her, then I will continue with this. I practically told him that.</p>
<p>The opponent is an experienced slaver. He may have seen through every one of my words.</p>
<p>Well, where does the balance rest in the slaver’s mind? Thinking about that, I awaited Fiodor’s response.</p>
