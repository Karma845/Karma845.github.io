<h1>Chapter 7: Shimizu-san and the King’s Game</h1>

<p>On a certain day off, I found myself standing in my home’s entryway, wearing my school uniform.</p>
<p>Why would I be wearing a uniform on a day off?</p>
<p>It’s because I’m going to school today for stargazing.</p>

<p>“I’m off.”</p>

<p>As I gripped the doorknob to open the front door, I heard a voice call out from behind me.</p>

<p>“Wait, Onii-chan.”</p>

<p>Turning around, I saw Teruno inexplicably standing in the hallway near the entrance.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Teruno?”</p>

<p>I should have already told Teruno that I was going to school today for stargazing.</p>

<p>“…Are you going?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, the weather is clear, making it an ideal day for stargazing. Do you need something?”</p>
<p>“…No, it’s nothing.”</p>

<p>With that, Teruno walked away from me.</p>

<p>(I wonder what’s bothering Teruno?)</p>

<p>Although I was a little concerned about Teruno, I remembered that the meeting time was drawing near, so I hurriedly opened the front door and left the house.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Hello.”</p>

<p>About ten minutes before the meeting time, I arrived at the Astronomy Club’s clubroom.</p>

<p>“Ah, Daiki-kun is here too. Now the Astronomy Club member is all here!”</p>

<p>Just as Ai-san said, the four other Astronomy Club members were already present in the clubroom.</p>

<p>“Sorry I’m late.”</p>
<p>“No need to apologize, Hondo. We were the ones who arrived too early.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, it’s still before the meeting time, so there’s absolutely no problem.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. By the way, what are we going to do now, Ai-san?”</p>

<p>I ask Ai-san as I take my seat.</p>

<p>“So, Ai, what exactly are we planning to do now?”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, well, since all the club members are here, I suppose I can tell you.”</p>

<p>For some reason, Ai-san strikes a mysterious pose.</p>

<p>“Just get to the point.”</p>
<p>“I agree with Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Impatient ladies, aren’t you? Fine, I’ll tell you my plan. What we’re going to do is…”</p>
<p>” ‘is’ what?”</p>
<p>“It’s The King’s Game! …uh? What’s with those faces? You all look so dumbfounded.”</p>
<p>“…Why go through the trouble of assembling us hours early just to play the King’s Game?”</p>

<p>Indeed, what could be Ai-san’s intention behind suggesting the King’s Game?</p>

<p>“You see, I’ve been thinking. It’s been over a month since we reformed the Astronomy Club, and I feel we still lack a sense of unity among members. So, I thought about how we could strengthen our bond, and I came up with this King’s Game!”</p>
<p>“Why the King’s Game? There are plenty of other better activities.”</p>

<p>As Yousuke-san points out, there seem to be other ways to increase our sense of unity, not just the King’s Game.</p>

<p>“Well, if it’s sports, then Kei would have an advantage with her amazing athleticism, and if it’s a quiz, Yousuke would likely win, right? So, I thought of a game that involves luck and can be enjoyed by everyone, and that’s how I arrived at the King’s Game.”</p>
<p>“…You have a point.”</p>

<p>Seto-san seems somewhat convinced by Ai-san’s explanation.</p>

<p>“I get that physical or intellectual games could be biased, so the King’s Game makes sense in that regard. But have you properly set the rules?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I don’t know how much everyone knows about the King’s Game, so I’ll explain from the beginning.”</p>

<p>With that, Ai-san took out five slender, angular wooden sticks from her bag.</p>
<p>They were probably splittable chopsticks.</p>

<p>“The tools we’ll use for the King’s Game are essentially these five sticks. First, everyone will draw a stick, and the person who gets the stick with ‘King’ written on it becomes the king. The king can then give orders by specifying a number from one to four. How about we give it a try?”</p>

<p>Ai-san then held up the five sticks, hiding their lower portions.</p>

<p>“Everyone, please draw one stick in turn.”</p>

<p>Following the instructions, we all draw sticks.</p>
<p>The one I picked has the number ‘two’ written on it.</p>

<p>“Okay, who’s the king? Who drew the stick with ‘King’ written on it?”</p>
<p>“It’s me.”</p>

<p>Seto-san slowly raises her hand.</p>

<p>“Alright, so this time Mio-chan is the king. You can declare a number from one to four and then give an order.”</p>
<p>“Is anything allowed?”</p>
<p>“As long as it’s within the bounds of common sense, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Alright. The number I choose is two.”</p>

<p>My heart skips a beat; that’s the number on my stick.</p>

<p>“The command is… if you have any sweets, I’d like one.”</p>
<p>“It’s not Halloween!”</p>

<p>It’s far too early in the year to be trick-or-treating.</p>

<p>“Hmm, that’s so like Mio-chan. Now, who has number two?”</p>
<p>“That would be me.”</p>
<p>“I see, Daiki-kun. Do you happen to have any sweets?”</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment.”</p>

<p>I rummage through my backpack and find a matcha-flavored dorayaki that I bought after hearing Seto-san talk about it some time ago.</p>

<p>“Will this do?”</p>

<p>I hand the dorayaki to Seto-san.</p>

<p>“Hondō-kun, are you a god?”</p>
<p>“…I’m glad if it makes you happy.”</p>

<p>Seto-san’s voice seems happier than usual.</p>

<p>“Alright, let’s call it there for now! Everyone got the basic flow, right?”</p>

<p>Everyone in the Astronomy Club except for Ai-san nods in agreement.</p>

<p>“Great, then it’s time for questions! If anyone has anything they don’t understand, feel free to ask! Although you can ask once we start the King’s Game as well.”</p>
<p>“I do have a question, actually.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Yousuke. What is it?”</p>
<p>“Does the person receiving the command have the right to refuse it?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, Yousuke, are you planning to give a bad command?”</p>

<p>A grin that can only be described as mischievous is plastered across Ai-san’s face.</p>

<p>“It’s to confirm how far we have to go in obeying commands when you’re the king.”</p>
<p>“I would never give such a terrible command! But you’re right, if we have to obey every command, things could get out of hand. So let’s do this: if everyone except for the person giving the command and the one receiving it says ‘no’, then the command is canceled.”</p>
<p>“Why doesn’t the person receiving the command get a say?”</p>
<p>“Because then people like Kei would likely reject every command directed at her.”</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>

<p>It seems that comment hit the mark.</p>


<p>“The right to refuse a command is necessary, but making all commands unacceptable would ruin the fun.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, that might be true.”</p>
<p>“Since Yousuke seems satisfied, let’s move on to the next question. Does anyone else have anything to ask?”</p>
<p>“Not at the moment for me.”</p>
<p>“Okay, how about the rest of you juniors? Any questions?”</p>
<p>“None for me.”</p>
<p>“Me neither.”</p>

<p>All eyes in the club turn to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“…None for me either.”</p>
<p>“Alright, that concludes the explanation of the King’s Game rules. Let’s get the game started!”</p>

<p>“Who’s the king?”</p>
<p>“It’s me, I’m the king!”</p>
<p>“It’s you?”</p>
<p>“It seems that Lady Luck favors me.”</p>

<p>This time, the King is Ai-san.</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of command she will give this time.</p>

<p>“Who should be my target this round?”</p>

<p>Ai-san says this while scanning the room.</p>
<p>I instinctively averted my eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, you looked away? In that case, maybe I’ll choose Daiki-kun.”</p>
<p>“You can’t just choose someone like that!”</p>

<p>While that’s true, saying it now feels like I’m jinxing myself.</p>

<p>“You said it, huh? Then let me show you my power. Command: the people with the numbers two and four must go hand-in-hand to the vending machine and buy a juice!”</p>

<p>I see, the King can give commands to multiple people at the same time.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I haven’t checked my number yet. I look at the slip in my hand; it reads ‘four.’</p>

<p>“Who are the people with numbers two and four?”</p>
<p>“I’m number four.”</p>
<p>“Okay, the other person, please raise your hand quickly.”</p>

<p>After a few seconds, someone reluctantly raises her hand.</p>

<p>“…I’m number two.”</p>
<p>“Alright then, Daiki-kun and Kei, go hand-in-hand and buy some juice. Here’s the money.”</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Ai-san hands me 200 yen.</p>

<p>“Hey, I want to refuse, so let’s have a vote.”</p>
<p>“Really, a vote already? Well, fine. Yousuke-san and Mio-chan, is this command acceptable or not? Raise your hand if it’s not. Go!”</p>

<p>Only Yousuke-san raised his hand.</p>

<p>“Hey, Seto!”</p>
<p>“If today was a weekday, I’d say no. But today is a day off and the school is not very crowded. So there’s not much worry about being seen by many people. It’s barely acceptable.”</p>
<p>“In that case, please proceed with the command. Oh, by the way, if you let go of each other’s hands at any point other than when buying the juice, you’ll have to start over.”</p>
<p>“Grrr…I’ll remember this for later…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seems genuinely frustrated.</p>

<p>“Try it. Now hurry up, you two, and hold hands.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, let’s get this over with quickly, shall we?”</p>

<p>I stand up and offer my hand to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Wait a second.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Shimizu-san closes her eyes and takes a deep breath.</p>
<p>Does it really require that much resolve?</p>

<p>“…Let’s hold hands.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s left hand gradually approaches my right hand. As her hand gets quite close, I grasp it.</p>

<p>“Hyaa—”</p>

<p>An unexpected squeal comes from Shimizu-san. Then her face turns beet red as she glares at me.</p>

<p>“Sorry, did I grip your hand too hard?”</p>
<p>“…Pretend you didn’t hear that squeal.”</p>
<p>“Uh, okay.”</p>
<p>“Fine, let’s go.”</p>

<p>Thus began our journey to the vending machine, with me and Shimizu-san hand in hand.</p>

img here

<p>Several minutes after leaving the clubroom, we still hadn’t reached the vending machine.</p>
<p>The reason is that the school on this day off was surprisingly crowded.</p>
<p>We had to hide in the shadows to avoid being seen by people and sometimes even backtrack.</p>
<p>Also, the vending machine was quite a distance away from the clubroom to begin with.</p>

<p>“There are more people in the school on a day off than I thought.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san says this while still remaining vigilant of our surroundings.</p>
<p>Seeing Shimizu-san so cautious, I suddenly remembered that I hadn’t yet commented on her hairstyle today.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit late to say this, but you have your hair half-up today, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Why bring that up out of nowhere? What’s wrong with it?”</p>
<p>“No complaints here. I just thought it suits you.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Your usual long hair makes your beautiful hair stand out too, but this half-up style gives off a totally different impression from usual, so I think it’s nice.”</p>
<p>“N-no one asked you to go that far!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s grip on my hand tightens.</p>

<p>“My hand’s starting to hurt a bit.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry…”</p>

<p>The pressure suddenly decreases.</p>
<p>I feel that Shimizu-san’s hand is warmer than before.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, your hand feels warmer now. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“…It’s just your imagination.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“What else would you have me say?”</p>
<p>“I was wondering if Shimizu-san is also nervous like me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ve never experienced holding hands like this before. To be honest, my heart’s pounding. Aren’t you nervous, Shimizu-san?”</p>

<p>There’s no response from Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>Did I say something wrong?</p>
<p>Just as I start to worry, Shimizu-san finally speaks.</p>

<p>“I’m different. Holding hands like this doesn’t embarrass me at all…”</p>

<p>For some reason, Shimizu-san’s voice is softer than usual.</p>

<p>“Is that so? Then maybe it was just my imagination that your hand felt warm.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was. Come on, let’s go already.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>

<p>I wonder if Shimizu-san has ever held hands with someone before.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, it would make sense that she’s not nervous.</p>
<p>The thought of that makes my heart feel a little prickly for some reason.</p>

<p>Several more minutes pass, and we finally arrive at the vending machine.</p>
<p>Ai-san said we could let go of each other’s hands when buying the drink, so I temporarily released Shimizu-san’s left hand.</p>

<p>“Ai didn’t specify which type of juice to get, so I’ll pick something at random. Ai can drink pretty much anything. Put in the money Ai gave us.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>

<p>I inserted the money that we got from Ai-san into the vending machine.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Shimizu-san chooses soda.</p>

<p>“I’ll keep the change.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll hold onto the sparkling water.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then let’s hold hands again.”</p>

<p>I extend my right hand towards Shimizu-san once more.</p>


<p>“Give me a moment to prepare.”</p>
<p>“Sure…Shimizu-san, are you actually nervous about holding hands?”</p>
<p>“I told you I’m not!”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then we should be able to hold hands right away, right?”</p>
<p>“Ugh..”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san had a look of agony for a few seconds, but then, as if making some kind of decision, she met my gaze.</p>

<p>“…I am…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I couldn’t hear you. Could you say that one more time?”</p>
<p>“I said I’m nervous! I’ve never held hands with anyone, so of course I’d be a little nervous, no matter who it is.”</p>

<p>So Shimizu-san hadn’t experienced holding hands with anyone before. It seemed that my guess was off.</p>
<p>The moment I realized that, the prickly feeling I had seemed to vanish.</p>

<p>“Happy now? Let’s go. Give me your hand!”</p>
<p>“O-okay.”</p>

<p>I extend my right hand to Shimizu-san again, and without hesitation, she firmly grasps it with her left hand.</p>

<p>More than ten minutes must have passed since we set out. Finally, Shimizu-san and I have returned to the club room.</p>

<p>“Ah, you two are finally back.”</p>
<p>“Here, happy now?”</p>

<p>Saying that, Shimizu-san tossed the plastic bottle toward Ai-san, who managed to catch it somewhat frantically.</p>

<p>“Nice catch!”</p>
<p>“Don’t praise yourself.”</p>
<p>“Did you two hold hands properly on the way?”</p>
<p>“Of course we did.”</p>
<p>“And what do you say, Mio-chan, our watchdog?”</p>
<p>“Just like Shimizu-san said, they held hands the entire time except for when they were buying the juice.”</p>

<p>A voice came from behind us, and turning around, there was Seto-san.</p>
<p>Judging by what Ai-san said, it seems Seto-san had been secretly watching Shimizu-san and me.</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed her at all.</p>

<p>“Okay, then mission complete!”</p>
<p>“Satisfied now?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely. Anyway, how long are you two planning to hold hands?”</p>

<p>Neither Shimizu-san nor I said anything, but we both let go of each other’s hands at the same time.</p>

<p>“What, you’re letting go? You know you can hold hands even without being told to, right?”</p>
<p>“Who would want to hold hands without being forced?”</p>
<p>“You say that, but Kei, you looked like you wouldn’t mind continuing to hold hands.”</p>
<p>“I did not! Don’t take this person’s words seriously, Hondō!”</p>
<p>“O-okay.”</p>
<p>“You seem a bit flustered, how cute. So, Daiki-kun, how did it feel to hold hands with Kei?”</p>

<p>I wonder when I’ll be able to predict Ai-san’s curveball questions.</p>

<p>“I was pretty nervous. Holding hands like that is nerve-wracking.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, what do you say, Kei-san?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me! What Hondō thinks has nothing to do with me…Let’s move on.”</p>
<p>“You’re not being honest. Well, it did take longer than I thought, so let’s hurry and choose the next King!”</p>

<p>“Who’s the king!”</p>

<p>I check the stick I’ve drawn. It says ‘King’ on it.</p>

<p>“I drew the king.”</p>
<p>“I see, then the next King is Daiki-kun. Now, King, please give us your command.”</p>
<p>“Um, I command that the number ‘one’ person will continue to imitate an animal of my choice until someone else guesses what it is.”</p>
<p>“Oh! That’s an interesting command! So, who is the number one?”</p>
<p>“Me.”</p>

<p>Seto-san raised her hand.</p>

<p>“Alright, you two get ready.”</p>

<p>I type the name of a certain animal into my smartphone and show it to Seto-san.</p>

<p>“Alright…”</p>
<p>“Are you ready? Then, let’s start the imitation!”</p>

<p>Seto-san first slowly stands up, and then shapes her hands like cat paws.</p>

<p>“Growl…”</p>
<p>“Pfft..”</p>

<p>It was a complete monotone impersonation, but unexpectedly, Shimizu-san burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“Right, a lion!”</p>

<p>Ai-san answered energetically.</p>

<p>“Close, but that’s not it.”</p>
<p>“In that case, it must be Kei when she’s in a bad mood!”</p>
<p>“Are you calling me an animal close to a lion!?”</p>

<p>Seemingly at her limit, Shimizu-san retorted.</p>

<p>“Hey Ai, don’t turn this into a comedy show.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Okay then, Mio-chan, please continue.”</p>
<p>“Growl…”</p>

<p>The reply has transformed into that of a wild beast.</p>
<p>It seems like she’s trying to fully get into the character of the animal I choose.</p>
<p>After pondering for a moment, Seto-san started moving closer to me.</p>

<p>“Grrr.”</p>

<p>She lets out a growl while tapping my backpack with her hands still shaped like cat paws.</p>

<p>“Um, Seto-san? There’s no Dorayaki left in my bag, you know?”</p>
<p>“Grrr…”</p>

<p>The growl seems a bit less energetic this time.</p>
<p>As I was thinking that maybe I should have bought one more Dorayaki, I felt a gaze on me.</p>
<p>Looking around, I noticed Shimizu-san glaring intensely at me.</p>

<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“S-Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“A female panther. (女豹)”</p>
<p>“C-correct.”</p>

<p>The real answer was simply a ‘panther(豹)’, but it seems okay to count it as correct.</p>
<p>Actually, I feel like it has to be counted as correct.</p>
<p>(TN: In JP slang, 女豹, can be used metaphorically to describe a girl who is aggressive or assertive, especially in a romantic or sexual context.)</p>

<p>“Wow, Kei, you’re sharp!”</p>

<p>Ignoring Ai-san’s words, Shimizu-san turned towards Seto-san.</p>

<p>“Hey, it’s over now, Seto.”</p>
<p>“…Huh, my heart had fully transformed into a leopard’s.”</p>
<p>“A leopard wouldn’t want Dorayaki.”</p>

<p>Somehow, it seems like the relationship between Shimizu-san and Seto-san has improved compared to before.</p>
<p>I wonder if something happened between them that I’m unaware of?</p>

<p>“Alright, now that Mio-chan has returned to human form, let’s move on to the next round!”</p>
<p>“Next time, I’ll be the king…”</p>

<p>“Looks like I’m the king again!”</p>
<p>“Why is it you again…”</p>

<p>The King’s Game third round. Ai-san became the King for the second time.</p>
<p>Maybe Ai-san is incredibly lucky.</p>

<p>“Now, who should I choose next? Should I choose Mio-chan?”</p>
<p>“Don’t.”</p>
<p>“Oh, too bad, I got rejected. Then maybe I’ll choose Kei.”</p>
<p>“If you think you can guess my number, then try it!”</p>
<p>“You said it! Then, my command is: Number three should do a ‘kabe-don’ on the number four person and say a cool line.”</p>

<p>This pattern… I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>Checking my number once more, it was just as I had expected: it was ‘three.’</p>

<p>“…Number three is me.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Kei, What did you say? I couldn’t hear, you were too quiet.”</p>
<p>“This has to be cheating! There’s no way you could consecutively get the numbers you aimed for!”</p>

<p>It seems that it was Shimizu-san who drew number four.</p>
<p>Indeed, Ai-san has already become the King twice and has been giving orders to the people she aimed for every time. So far, she’s been spot-on.</p>
<p>It’s not unreasonable for Shimizu-san to be suspicious.</p>


<p>“Then how do you think I’m guessing everyone’s numbers?”</p>
<p>“Grr…”</p>
<p>“Accusing me of cheating without any evidence is terrible…”</p>

<p>Ai-san covers her eyes with a handkerchief.</p>
<p>I can say with one hundred percent certainty that she’s not actually crying.</p>

<p>“…I’m going to get the evidence for sure.”</p>
<p>“Good luck, Detective. Now, please execute the command!”</p>

<p>What kind of trick is behind Ai-san’s clairvoyant abilities?</p>
<p>Before I get a chance to ponder that, first, I need to carry out the command Ai-san gave me.</p>

<p>“Ai-san, what should I say for a cool line?”</p>
<p>“I’ll leave that to you, Daiki-kun. If you can’t think of anything, I can make a suggestion.”</p>

<p>I think for a moment but, unfortunately, I can’t come up with a cool line.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t think of anything. Can you give me a line?”</p>
<p>“Sure! Let me whisper it in your ear.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Ai-san comes closer and whispers to me.</p>

<p>“…do I really have to say that? It’s kind of embarrassing…”</p>
<p>“If you can think of a cooler line, Daiki-kun, go for it. Otherwise, please use that one.”</p>
<p>“Hey, what are you planning to make Hondō say?”</p>
<p>“That’s top secret. You’ll find out soon.”</p>

<p>Ai-san winks at Shimizu-san, who brushes it off with her hand.</p>

<p>“…Okay, then I’ll go with Ai-san’s line.”</p>
<p>“Good, very good. Both of you, prepare yourselves!”</p>
<p>“I think our positions should be about here.”</p>

<p>Currently, Shimizu-san and I have been driven to the wall of the club room by Ai-san, who is both king and director of this situation.</p>

<p>“I’m not really familiar with ‘kabe-don,’ what exactly should I do?”</p>
<p>“It’s simple. Corner Kei against the wall, slam the wall with your left hand and say the line, then finish with another slam with your right hand and say another line!”</p>
<p>“That explanation is way too vague….”</p>
<p>“That’s not the case. You get it, don’t you, Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“Well, sort of…”</p>

<p>I’m not unfamiliar with the concept of ‘kabe-don,’ so I think I can pull it off.</p>

<p>“Great! Are both of you ready for this?”</p>
<p>“I’m good to go.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Nice response. Start when I say so.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san wears a serious expression.</p>
<p>I also decided to cast aside my embarrassment and focus on the act.</p>

<p>“Alright, start!”</p>

<p>At the sound of that command, I corner Shimizu-san against the wall.</p>
<p>Soon, her back hits the wall and she can no longer move back.</p>
<p>At that moment, I slapped the wall beside Shimizu-san’s face with my left hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve got nowhere to run now.”</p>
<p>“…w-what are you planning to do?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san doesn’t know what I’m about to say, so this is her genuine reaction.</p>

<p>“You still don’t get it after all this?”</p>
<p>“I, I don’t know…”</p>

<p>In the next moment, I forcefully slapped the wall on the right side of Shimizu-san’s face with my right hand.</p>

<p>“I won’t hand you over to anyone. Stay by my side forever.”</p>
<p>“W-wha…”</p>

img here

<p>“Cut! That was a great ‘kabe-don’! Even I was thrilled watching it!”</p>

<p>I quickly put distance between myself and Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>Looking at her face, it’s definitely redder than before.</p>
<p>Probably, my face is the same. It’s not just embarrassment; I really want to disappear.</p>

<p>“How was it, esteemed audience?”</p>
<p>“Hondō-kun, you’re good at acting. It’s an unexpected talent.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san also had a good reaction.”</p>
<p>“The audience loved it! Please look forward to the next part if we get another chance! For now, let’s take a break!”</p>
<p>“A break?”</p>
<p>“Kei got incapacitated by Daiki-kun’s whispering voice, after all.”</p>

<p>Looking over at Shimizu-san again, she’s sitting down where the ‘kabe-don’ took place and placed her hand against her cheek.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The King’s Game continued even after the break.</p>
<p>Ai-san became the king every other turn and did whatever she pleased, like having Seto-san give her a lap pillow or Yousuke-san massages her shoulders.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Shimizu-san never got to be the king during this time.</p>

<p>“Is it okay if I draw the lot first for the next round?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yousuke-san? What’s gotten into you all of a sudden?”</p>

<p>For some reason, Ai-san is visibly flustered. I wonder what’s going on?</p>

<p>“What, is something wrong? “</p>
<p>“N-No, not at all? If the juniors are fine with it, then why not?”</p>
<p>“Then it’s settled. Let’s draw the lots.”</p>

<p>We all drew lots, still unclear about Yousuke-san’s intentions.</p>

<p>“Who’s the king!”</p>

<p>I checked the number. My number this time is three.</p>

<p>“…It’s me.”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san is holding the stick that says ‘king.’</p>

<p>“Hey, Ai.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“If you want to apologize to everyone, now’s the time.”</p>
<p>“…I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“…Fine. Then here’s my command. The person with number two must answer my questions truthfully, saying whether the content is true or false, without any deceit.”</p>
<p>“…Uh, number two is me, but what are you planning to ask, Yousuke?”</p>
<p>“What you’ve been doing. To borrow Kei’s words, the mechanics behind your cheating.”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san said something completely unexpected.</p>

<p>“Everyone, look at the top corners of your lots. Do you see any corners that have been shaved off?”</p>

<p>When we looked at our lots as instructed, indeed, three of the four corners were slightly shaved off.</p>

<p>“I get it now. The person with number one should have one corner shaved, number two should have two, and number three should have three. The corners correspond to the numbers on the lots. By the way, the lot that says ‘king’ doesn’t have any corners shaved off.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Kei seems to have figured it out. Ai has been becoming the king and issuing commands to her targeted individuals by checking the shaved corners on the lots. Isn’t that right, Ai?”</p>

<p>Everyone’s gaze turns toward Ai-san simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Heh, hehehe, Aha-ha-ha-ha!”</p>
<p>“A-Ai?”</p>
<p>“If I’ve been caught, there’s nothing to be done. Yes, I’ve been becoming the king multiple times by tampering with the lots in advance!”</p>
<p>“So you admit it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, good deduction, Detective.”</p>
<p>“I don’t remember becoming a detective, though…”</p>
<p>“Well, the mystery is solved, and the case is closed! Now, what shall we do next…?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san suddenly grabbed Ai-san’s shoulder firmly.</p>

<p>“Huh? What’s going on? Eekkk!”</p>

<p>Ai-san screamed. The Shimizu-san holding her shoulder had a fearsome expression.</p>

<p>“How dare you cheat so blatantly. Do you realize what’s going to happen to you now?”</p>
<p>“W-what’s going to happen?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san displayed a menacing smile unlike any I’d seen before.</p>

<p>“Step out into the hallway.”</p>
<p>“Eh, wait. N-no, I don’t want to. I’m sorry, really sorry. Forgive me, help me, I don’t want to—”</p>

<p>Despite Ai-san’s desperate resistance, Shimizu-san dragged her out into the hallway.</p>

<p>“Gyaa——”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s scream echoed back into the clubroom.</p>

<p>“…Hondō-kun, there are some scenes in life that are better left unseen.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>What happened in the hallway after that was known only to Shimizu-san and Ai-san.</p>
