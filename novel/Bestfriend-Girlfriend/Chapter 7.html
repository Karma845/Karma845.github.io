<h1>Chapter 7: A Love That Falls Behind Finally Catches Up</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-left">The park, about a five-minute walk from home, was surprisingly spacious for a residential area in the heart of Tokyo. It was big enough for children to play tag with unrestrained energy. I used to play here a lot when I was a kid.</p>



<p>Upon Ei’s request, we played a badminton. With only two rackets for the three people—Ei, Sayu, and myself—we decide to take turns in pairs. I sat on the bench and started off as referee.</p>



<p>I picked up a branch and drew lines roughly the size of the court. Since there was no net, I relied on estimation. The game began under the rule that the first to score ten points wins.</p>



<p>“Ei-chan, here it comes!”</p>



<p>“Alright, Sayu-chan!”</p>



<p>Sayu’s athleticism remained outstanding. Even in badminton, which was outside her expertise, she effortlessly handled the game without prior practice. Her serve gracefully reached the opponent’s court.</p>



<p>Ei was equally formidable, showcasing that typical agility unique to elementary schoolers as she sharply returned Sayu’s serve.</p>



<p>“Nice one, Ei-chan!”</p>



<p>“Ei is the best in her class!”</p>



<p><em>If you’re the best, why bother practicing</em>, I silently complained in my mind. The two continued their rally while casually chatting, yet the shuttlecock’s speed was notably fast.</p>



<p>Sayu initially seemed to treat it as a recreational activity, but Ei’s serious approach influenced her, and now they engaged in a serious game.</p>



<p>Faced with an opponent who was using all her strength, Ei was very excited and attacked unabashedly with a smile. She unleashed a sharp smash aiming for the sidelines. Sayu caught up and narrowly returned the smash, using the well-honed legs and agility from her basketball days.</p>



<p>“Huh, you guys are pretty skilled. I’m out of your league here.”</p>



<p>I marveled at my sister’s unexpected agility. When did she become so good? Come to think of it, her physical education grades had consistently been a solid A since her first year.</p>



<p>“Well, if you’ve got that much stamina, don’t make me carry you on our next trip.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, did you say something?”</p>



<p>Ei asked while tracking the shuttlecock mid-air. Moments later, a powerful smash pierced through Sayu’s court. Sayu ran at full speed, but her racket fell just short of reaching the shuttlecock.</p>



<p>“Referee, look here! That was barely outside the line. Out, it’s out!” Sayu protested to the referee.</p>



<p>“Don’t get worked up against an elementary schooler. It’s clearly in. Yes, Ei wins.”</p>



<p>“Yahoo!!” My sister celebrated victory with unbridled joy, jumping up and down. Wait, she moved that much, yet she can jump like that? Kids’ stamina knew no bounds.</p>



<p>“Did you see that match? Ei-chan is way too good. Are you sure she’s really in elementary school?”</p>



<p>“I’ve been living with her since she was in diapers, so she’s definitely an elementary schooler.”</p>



<p>“Elementary schoolers these days are impressive.”</p>



<p>“If you’re not satisfied with the result, how about another match? I’ll gladly give up my turn.”</p>



<p>“Nope, I’m exhausted. My body won’t hold up without a break.”  Sayu collapsed next to me on the bench.</p>



<p>“Alright, it’s your turn, Ki-senpai. Show us something cool,” she said, handing me a racket.</p>



<p>“Ei, are you not taking a break?”</p>



<p>“I’m fine,” Ei who was still full of energy urged me on.</p>



<p>“I don’t feel like I can win, but as an older brother, I can’t lose.”</p>



<p>Honestly, I wasn’t good with sports involving equipment.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, want me to go easy on you?”</p>



<p>“There’s no such thing as a big brother inferior to his sister!”</p>



<p>And thus began the battle of pride and determination between the Sena siblings.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, Ei-chan, good luck!”</p>



<p>Encouraged by Sayu’s cheer, Ei served. I followed the shuttlecock’s trajectory and moved to its landing point, swinging the racket with force. However, the racket cut through the air and the shuttlecock landed inside the court.</p>



<p>“…One point for Ei-chan. Looks like it’ll be a landslide victory.” As foretold by Sayu, I suffered a defeat at the hands of my sister by a large margin. </p>



<p>“This is frustrating beyond words.”</p>



<p>“You did well, Kisumi-kun.  I was consoled by a fourth-grader.</p>



<p>“Call me ‘onii-chan’…”</p>



<p>The third match unfolded between Sayu and me.</p>



<p>“The time has come to settle this. I’ll claim victory in this match.”</p>



<p>“I must avoid a total defeat!”</p>



<p>It was a battle I couldn’t afford to lose. Learning from my match against Ei, I managed to keep the rally going against Sayu.</p>



<p>“Did you go easy on Ei-chan? You seem to have improved since earlier.”</p>



<p>“Hey, I could say the same for you. For someone who just finished entrance exams, you’re surprisingly nimble.”</p>



<p>“Senpai, for someone who quit the basketball club, you’re unexpectedly skilled.”</p>



<p>“I can’t afford to lose to you, Sayu!”</p>



<p>The rally went on and on. It was hot. I was sweating. Despite it being May, it felt like summer.</p>



<p>I executed a powerful smash, tying the score. There was still a chance to win.</p>



<p>“You don’t even hold back against girls.”</p>



<p>“Would you be happy if I went easy on you?”</p>



<p>“…You know me well,” Sayu smiled happily, “Hey, Senpai. How about a reward for the winner of this match?”</p>



<p>“Sure, you’ll treat me to a drink if I win. What about you, Sayu?”</p>



<p>“As for me…” Sayu’s lips quivered faintly, then she conveyed her wish. “If I win, believe everything I say afterward. Every word, as the absolute truth.”</p>



<p>“…I don’t really get it, but is that okay?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, please listen to it seriously, not just as a joke or a lie.” Sayu’s expression was deadly serious. There was no hint of teasing or playfulness. It felt like the intensity she showed during our middle school basketball practice.</p>



<p>“Here we go!”</p>



<p>“Ready!”</p>



<p>“Hah!”</p>



<p>“Hup!”</p>



<p>An intense back-and-forth ensued. Both of us were giving our all. At the critical moment when the shuttlecock seemed about to fall, Sayu, with sheer determination, scooped it up. She didn’t miss my mistake and precisely smashed it in.</p>



<p>After a fierce battle, the victory belonged to Sayu.</p>



<p>“Woo-hoo! I win!”</p>



<p>“Darn it, I lost. I really wanted to win this one.” I lowered my head, sweat dripping down my face. How long have we been at this?</p>



<p>“Ah, I’m exhausted,” I slumped onto the bench, “Let’s take a break. It’s dangerous not to hydrate.”</p>



<p>“Then, Ei-chan, could you buy some drinks from that convenience store over there? Me and Ki-senpai will have water. Ei-chan, feel free to get whatever snack or ice cream you like.”</p>



<p>“Got it!” After accepting money from Sayu, Ei walked to the convenience store just a stone’s throw away.</p>



<p>“I’ll pay it,” I reached for my wallet.</p>



<p>“It’s a gift from the winner. Just take it quietly. But, in return, you remember what I said during the match, right?”</p>



<p>“I should believe everything you say, right? What on earth are you talking about?”</p>



<p>It was hot. I flapped my shirt collar to seek some coolness from the breeze.</p>



<p>“….Sayu?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, a sense of unease crept in. I looked at my junior who was standing before me with a serious expression.</p>



<p>“Sena Kisumi-san, I like you. Please go out with me.” Under the sun, with flushed cheeks, Sayu confessed her feelings. It was different from her usual joking confessions. There was no hint of a playful smile in her words. Instead, I could sense her nervousness vividly.</p>



<p>“Is this some kind of joke?”</p>



<p>“I’m no longer your carefree junior from middle school. That’s over now.”</p>



<p>“Why now?” I was perplexed. Our houses were close, and we spent a fair amount of time together in middle school due to club activities. Still, I never thought that she harbored any special feelings for me.</p>



<p>“…Well, it can’t be helped. I only realized I genuinely like you when I wouldn’t be able to see you anymore.”</p>



<p>“Is it because I graduated that you can’t see me anymore?”</p>



<p>“More accurately, it’s after you retired from the club. You no longer came to pick me up for morning exercises, and I had to walk home alone after club activities. Every day felt strangely lonely.”</p>



<p>“But Sayu, you have plenty of friends, so there must have been others to hang out with.”</p>



<p>“At first, I thought so too, but it was different. Friends weren’t enough. Realizing that, I finally understood that Sena Kisumi is special.”</p>



<p>“But even after I retired from the club, we used to stop and chat in the hallway. I didn’t sense any of that at all.”</p>



<p>With entrance exams and everything, the frequency of meeting Sayu naturally decreased. Still, we exchanged words occasionally until graduation.</p>



<p><em>…This girl has liked me since then?</em></p>



<p><em>No way.</em></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_1_18-book_reader_readera.png" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“That’s because you were too close, too familiar. Whenever we talked, I reverted to the usual me.”</p>



<p>“If it were you, you would take the initiative to pursue me once you realized you liked me…”</p>



<p>“That’s why your understanding is wrong!”</p>



<p>“…I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>The girl confessing now was not the Yukinami Sayu I had in my mind. It was an image built from the days of being senpai and kouhai. But even then, the person I knew as Sayu might just be the surface.</p>



<p>People didn’t reveal their inner feelings easily, especially if it was matter of love. No matter how close you were, it was difficult to open your heart. </p>



<p>Just like Arisaka Yorka, who was unattainable beauty, actually liked me back.</p>



<p>Just like Hasekura Asaki, who was a fellow class rep, liked me in secret.</p>



<p>Just like Miyauchi Hinaka, who was my close friend, hid her affection for me.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a surprise that even Yukinami Sayu, my junior from middle school, had a one-sided crush on me.</p>



<p>So, I must properly listen to her feelings.</p>



<p>“Though many guys like me, this is the first time I’ve genuinely fallen for someone. It’s not easy for me to confess like this.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“Even when I started going for morning practice alone, every morning, I used to pass by your house before heading to school. I was half-expecting you to pop your head out of the window.”</p>



<p>If she were to go to the school, stopping by my place would have been a detour. I never thought she would go to such lengths.</p>



<p>“You’d probably plan to call me in the morning with a tone like, ‘<em>Unfair, you’re the only one still sleeping~</em>,’ wouldn’t you?”</p>



<p>“You’d get mad if I did that, right?”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>“That’s why I didn’t do anything, I’m afraid you might not like it.” I could see the innocent of a maiden.</p>



<p>“You were studying so seriously to get into Eisei High so I thought I shouldn’t get in the way.”</p>



<p>“Well, I appreciate you being considerate. Thanks to that, I managed to pass.”</p>



<p>There was no doubt about that. With my academic abilities at the time, getting into Eisei High was nearly impossible. It was precisely because everyone around me said it was impossible that I became stubborn and studied hard. Thanks to an excellent tutor at the cram school I attended, I somehow managed to pass.</p>



<p>“After the exams, I was all geared up to approach you. But when you passed, I got all nervous. I became too conscious and in the end, I couldn’t do anything before graduation…”</p>



<p>I could only stare in shock at the surprising backstory being unfolded now.</p>



<p>Yukinami Sayu genuinely likes me.</p>



<p>“Ah, I’ve mentally prepared myself, but this is still incredibly embarrassing!”</p>



<p>Sayu seemed unable to contain herself any longer and forced a laugh.</p>



<p>“What is this humiliation? You’re exposing my past at the worst possible moment!”</p>



<p>Her eyes drifted away as she playfully hit me. “I’m pretty embarrassed too, you know.”</p>



<p>“…Ah, sorry.”</p>



<p>The close distance between us made Sayu came back to her senses and sat next to me meekly.</p>



<p>“…You were always this nervous, weren’t you?” Blushing intensely, Sayu nodded silently.</p>



<p>“──I did consider confessing when I became a third-year. That’s why I reached out, asking you to come support me for my retirement match… Even if others, whom I didn’t really care about, showed up, you were the only one who didn’t.”</p>



<p>The true purpose behind that message wasn’t to have me support her; it was for Sayu to confess to me.</p>



<p>“This is late, but I apologize. I’m sorry for not giving you a response. Sorry for not being there to cheer you on.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay. I misunderstood things a bit too. I realized during that karaoke session how tough last summer was for you, Senpai.”</p>



<p>“Even though I didn’t go to support you, did your feelings not change?”</p>



<p>“I was the most surprised. I missed my chance to confess, so I should have been mad and hated you… but I just couldn’t.” Sayu murmured like it was someone else’s story.</p>



<p>“So, did you enroll in the same high school for me? Was the uniform thing a lie?”</p>



<p>“T-This interrogation is mentally difficult!”</p>



<p>“Sayu, this is the reward time you wanted.”</p>



<p>If she backed down here, everything would become uncertain. Thinking that, I pressed on with my questions.</p>



<p>“Are you enjoying tormenting me?” Sayu’s initial determination and resolve seemed to waver.</p>



<p>“Why did you keep quiet about enrolling at Eisei?”</p>



<p>“I-I was waiting for the right moment! I wanted to go see you, but when I thought of going, you announced that you’re in a relationship with Yor-senpai…”</p>



<p>After a long unrequited love, Sayu worked hard at subjects she wasn’t good at to get into the same high school as me. And in the end, the rival in love, Yorka, appeared. It was normal to be intimidated by her.</p>



<p>But Sayu appeared before me once again. And today, she made a sincere confession, not a fake one.</p>



<p>Despite the relentless sweat, my fingertips were cold with tension. After a brief silence, I posed a question.</p>



<p>“…Even though you know I have a girlfriend, why did you still confess?”</p>



<p>“Right now is my reward time. I won’t stop.”</p>



<p>Sayu, on the verge of faltering, fortified herself as if encouraging the part of her that was wavering.</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai is on a completely different level than your average beauty. You wouldn’t think she’s just a high school student; it’s like having a celebrity around… She’ll eventually dump you sooner or later.”</p>



<p>“That’s because you don’t know Yorka…”</p>



<p>“Please calm down. Do high school romances last forever? Do you really think love alone can sustain it? Reality isn’t that simple!”</p>



<p>“Everyone’s different. It doesn’t concern you, Sayu.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want the person I like to get hurt!” Sayu raised her voice.</p>



<p>“…Don’t arbitrarily decide my future for me.”</p>



<p>“You can’t see reality because you’re in love.”</p>



<p>“Are you telling me to date you before I get hurt since we’ll eventually break up? That’s too much. Who can predict the future?”</p>



<p>“Even so! I want to be by your side! I don’t want us to reach a point where we can’t talk again!”</p>



<p>I couldn’t look Sayu in the eyes anymore. “Even if it’s Sayu, if you speak ill of my girlfriend, things won’t go back to how they were…”</p>



<p>It was pity for me too if I became distant from Sayu again. It’d be sad, but under these circumstances, it would be difficult to continue our relationship. A half-hearted attitude would only hurt Sayu more. If I couldn’t reciprocate her feelings, it’d be better to cleanly sever ties.</p>



<p>“…Then I won’t speak ill of her, so let me do as I please.”</p>



<p>“Huh?” Before I could ask, I was pushed down onto the bench. “Wait, what are you doing?”</p>



<p>“I won’t let you off the hook so easily. I won’t let yourself be the only one feeling relieved.” Sayu, pinning me down, showed her white teeth and smiled ferociously. “Alright then. You don’t want to hurt Yor-senpai, right? I understand your intentions.”</p>



<p>“You don’t understand! You probably don’t understand anything!”</p>



<p>“I’ll also stick to my decision! I don’t care how things turn out anymore!” Sayu straddled me, pressing my shoulders down with both hands.</p>



<p>“Wait, wait! What are you planning in broad daylight? This is a public park! People might see!”</p>



<p>“I can’t wait any longer! I’m going for it! Now! Right here! I’m going to kiss you! It’s a done deal!” With her declaration, Sayu moved her face closer. Her body, pressed against my chest, felt warm and moist.</p>



<p>“Don’t sell yourself short!”</p>



<p>“I want to give senpai my first kiss.” As Sayu inched closer, her eyes slowly close.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, as long as you stay quiet, there won’t be a problem. I’ll keep it a secret too.” Sayu forcefully pressed on, unabashed. It was an intense temptation, testing a man’s self-control.</p>



<p>A girl’s face loomed in front of me, her sweet fragrance unsettling my core. Her shadow blocked the sunlight. </p>



<p>Just accept it. </p>



<p>No need to fret. </p>



<p>Relax. </p>



<p>It’s a secret.</p>



<p>Lips getting closer.</p>



<p>“──!” I quickly grabbed the racket and held it in front of my face, blocking Sayu’s attempt to kiss me.</p>



<p>“…Isn’t this defense excessive?”</p>



<p>“Emergency calls for unconventional measures.”</p>



<p>“If you don’t like it, you could’ve just pushed me away,” Sayu softly retreated.</p>



<p>“Easy for you to say.” I sat up from the bench.</p>



<p>“You seemed flustered.”</p>



<p>“I’m not used to these things.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be relieved like that. You’ll get hurt again.”</p>



<p>“Sayu.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. I chose this prolonged battle on my own.” Sayu, with her face hidden by hair, didn’t reveal her expression.</p>



<p>“Are you going to continue?”</p>



<p>“My feelings haven’t changed! That moment was close, but it made my heart race too.”</p>



<p>“Sayu!”</p>



<p>“I’ll leave the decision to senpai. Ideally, I’d like us to share mutual feelings and become a couple. “</p>



<p>“That’s why I…”</p>



<p>“I want to stay by your side.”</p>



<p>Looking at Sayu’s pleading face, I found myself momentarily at a loss for words.</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan, Kisumi-kun! I’ve bought them ~!” Ei was swinging a convenience store bag and running towards us.</p>



<p>“I’m heading home. See you at school, then.” Sayu turned away, grabbed her drink from Ei and exited the park.</p>



<p>“What happened? Is Sayu-chan leaving already?”</p>



<p>“She said something came up suddenly.” I casually brushed it off.</p>



<p>“Ohhh. Maybe something good happened.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan is smiling while crying.”</p>



<p>“…Ei. Water, please.” Leaving the racket on the bench, I gulped down the cold mineral water. Soon, a LINE message chimed on my phone.</p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>I’m waiting for a ‘yes’. Feel free to consult Yor-senpai. Oh, and be careful not to make her jealous, okay? (lol)</em></p>



<p>“‘Lol’ my ass…”</p>



<p>While I had experienced waiting for a reply to my confession, this was the first time someone ran away after confessing to me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>After Sayu’s confession, I grappled with what to do.</p>



<p>No, the conclusion was already clear. Yorka was my girlfriend. That wouldn’t change.</p>



<p>However, in that moment when I saw Sayu’s face, I hesitated.</p>



<p>Even when Ei was approaching, I should’ve answered Sayu right then and there. The delay only meant I had to face Sayu more seriously later. The mental exhaustion and the anticipation of dealing with this weighed heavily on my mind. I couldn’t just disregard her sincere feelings.</p>



<p>Badminton became an afterthought, and my match with Ei turned into a one-sided game. Ei, winning by a large margin, was more concerned about my lackluster performance than frustrated.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, something’s off. Wanna head home?”</p>



<p>“Sorry, let’s do that.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I’ll even carry your racket for you.”</p>



<p>Being overly cared for by my elementary school sister, she held my hand as we walked home. Upon returning, the souvenir I meant to give Sayu sat untouched at the entrance. I retreated to my room and collapsed onto the bed.</p>



<p>“Dropping a bomb like that…”</p>



<p>During Golden Week, I couldn’t meet with my girlfriend due to her trip abroad. At the height of loneliness, Sayu dropped a confession with the determination to shatter any hesitation. She forcibly kissed me to create an established fact and proposed a secret relationship where everything would be fine as long as I kept quiet.</p>



<p>“She must have been desperate to do something so reckless…”</p>



<p>I hadn’t noticed at all. My heart ached. Sayu surely anticipated even my guilt before confessing. By shaking things up and taking bold actions, she likely aimed to forcefully change our dynamic.</p>



<p><em>A man who might yield if pressured. </em>In my middle school days, I might have gotten carried away and awkwardly accepting the situation despite the embarrassment.</p>



<p>“Sure, the essential part might remain the same, but if she thinks things haven’t changed since then, she’s underestimating me too much.”</p>



<p><em>─I, too, have been growing.</em></p>



<p>Would Sayu, whom I reunited with, be able to accurately see my changes after just a few meetings? Even if she understood, what would be the meaning of confessing after knowing the heartbreak that would follow?</p>



<p>“…Is the confession itself more important than the outcome?”</p>



<p>I had a hunch that Sayu might see it that way. She couldn’t express her feelings during last year’s retirement game, and it brought us to today.</p>



<p>“Then I need to make things clear.”</p>



<p>We had become high school students. We couldn’t go back to those times.</p>



<p>“I forgot to give her the souvenir.”</p>



<p>I decided to reject Sayu’s confession. I made up my mind. Since she directly conveyed her feelings, it was only fair for me to answer face to face.</p>



<p>Late at night, a message from Yorka arrived. I purposely refrained from opening it until I could put closure to Sayu’s matter.</p>
