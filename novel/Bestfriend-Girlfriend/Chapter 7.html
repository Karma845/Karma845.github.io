<h1>Chapter 7: Lovey-Dovey or Die</h1>

<p>“Oh my, Osaki, you look even more… ah, charming today?”</p>
<p>“Well, thank you very much. Hiraka… Shinnichi-kun, on the other hand, with that lack of motivation, those relaxed eyes are quite charming. By the way, are you nervous? Calling me by my last name feels a bit strange. Didn’t we promise to use first names when it’s just the two of us?”</p>

<p>Bali, Indonesia.</p>

<p>“Hahaha, that’s right, Sumire…”</p>
<p>“Ufufu, Geez Shinnichi-kun…”</p>
<p>In a cafe located in the bustling downtown area at the heart of Bali, there was a former couple, both slightly blushing, sitting with their cheeks pressed together.</p>
<p>It was Tenjou-san who arranged the second one-on-one date in Bali for them.</p>
<p>“I want to go to a place where Osaki Sumire can wear a swimsuit and we can have a private space, preferably overseas,”</p>

<p>In response, Tenjou-san arranged accommodation with a private pool in Bali, apparently called a villa.</p>
<p>Although Tenjou-san raised an eyebrow, saying,”Wanting a private space for a swimsuit… quite something,”</p>
<p>Juujo-san compliments me on how well I plan things out.</p>

<p>Leaving their belongings at the accommodation, the two went out for lunch, and that’s when the incident occurred.</p>
<p>Maintaining a slightly distant walk as the appropriate distance for the former couple.</p>
<p>…Suddenly, Osaki intertwined her left arm with my right arm.</p>
<p>“Osaki…?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Shinnichi-kun? It’s fine if you put your arm around my waist as usual, you know?”</p>
<p>“Hm…? Shinnichi-kun? Waist…?”</p>
<p>“Come on, don’t be shy. We’re all alone, after all.”</p>

<p>Osaki took my right arm and brought it around her waist.</p>

<p>The sensation of her slender waist transmitted through my hand’s nerves. ‘Uwaa… this is…’.</p>
<p>“By the way, before coming, I made a reservation of a delicious-looking restaurant.”</p>

<p>She said this, showing me the screen of her smartphone as we walked.</p>

<p>“…Ah, it does look delicious.”</p>

<p>The note app was open.</p>
<p>The words displayed there were:</p>
<p>‘I am currently being monitored by someone from the Osaki holdings, They are blending in with the locals.’</p>

<p>I see, so that’s how it is. It was a bit disappointing that they had to come all the way overseas.</p>
<p>Well, it might be because I specified “preferably overseas” in the request, thinking that the signal from Osaki’s bug might not be transmitted abroad.</p>
<p>Although compatible with mobile data communication within Japan, it’s not guaranteed for roaming communication overseas. Moreover, the fact that a bug can be compatible with mobile data communication is a feat that only Osaki Holdings, the communication provider, can achieve.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it would be unnatural to assume a connection with overseas communication providers. If that’s the case, the recordings from Osaki’s home would be sent, at the very least, after returning to Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, the plan was to leave the bug and spend some time abroad before any intervention occurred. However, it seems the other party understands this well. Instead of relying on machines, they dispatched plainclothes agents for visual and auditory stalking.</p>
<p>One stalker is enough, though.</p>


<p>“I thought this restaurant was good, but what do you think?”</p>
<p>Saying this, she input another note.</p>
<p>‘So, let’s play the lovey-dovey couple.’</p>
<p>“Wha!?”</p>

<p>I unintentionally exclaimed at the text and quickly covered my mouth.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? Didn’t you like it?”</p>
<p>“N-no! It just looked so delicious that I couldn’t help but shout.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s good. There are other nice places too.”</p>

<p>Swipe and flick.</p>
<p>‘As for the regular reports injected into the bug, since back from Nasu, Hirakawa-kun has been madly in love with me. Season 1 seems to be confirmed for a first-place pass.’</p>
<p>“Why is that!?”</p>

<p>Oops, I accidentally blurted out my honest reaction. I mean, head over heels in love? I mean, what’s with that “madly in love”.</p>

<p>“W-How can they able to provide such high-quality ingredients?”</p>

<p>To avoid any strange noises, I quickly diverted the topic.</p>

<p>“You’ll understand when you see this.”</p>
<p>‘If I am judged to be second or below, I may have to dispose of the person in first place.’</p>
<p>“D-dispose…!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it seems they dispose of everything except the best.”</p>

<p>I wonder if the person monitoring us can hear my admiration for the distribution route of this restaurant or something.</p>
<p>“Um, what happens if this… doesnt go well?”</p>

<p>In other words, what would happen if we couldn’t play the lovey-dovey couple? I supplemented with a glance.</p>
<p>“…It would likely end.”</p>
<p>“End…?”</p>
<p>“It would go like this.”</p>
<p>‘I will be killed as a punishment for telling a lie.’</p>
<p>“What!? To that extent!?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Isn’t this image terrible? The shop closed down, and the place was destroyed to the point of being crushed… If it doesn’t go well, it could end up like this.”</p>
<p>‘W-Wait, killed? Not me, but Osaki? If we can’t act lovey-dovey? The Osaki family is thinking of some serious stuff…’</p>
<p>“Is it really that serious…? Well, what should we do…”</p>
<p>“If you’re so hesitant,”</p>

<p>Swipe, flick.</p>

<p>“Shall we go with the second option?”</p>

<p>Then she displayed another note on the screen.</p>
<p>‘So, let’s play the lovey-dovey couple.’</p>
<p>‘Well, I myself am not suitable as the second girlfriend, you know?’</p>

<p>…And so, the former couple, under the mysterious premise of being a lovey-dovey couple, found themselves acting accordingly.</p>


<p>In a cafe, local staff brought sandwiches and coffee.</p>
<p>Osaki had a sandwich with salmon and cream cheese, while I had one with chicken, avocado, and mayonnaise.</p>

<p>“You still love mayonnaise as much as ever.”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah. By the way, how do you still remember that?”</p>
<p>“Atsu!”</p>
<p>“Atsu?”</p>
<p>“Oh, did I say ‘as much as ever’? I just said, ‘You like mayonnaise.’ Did you hallucinate?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t point out the ‘as much as ever’ part, did I…?”</p>

<p>While inserting a retort, thinking that the cat was out of the bag, I noticed a vein popping on her temple.</p>
<p>Implicitly, it seemed to say, “Can you refrain from making inappropriate remarks for a lovey-dovey couple?” I’m sorry, I forgot…</p>

<p>“Osaka… Sumire, you still like cream cheese.”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Oh, you remembered that…?”</p>

<p>Then, Osaki widened her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>Well, that reaction. It’s an act.</p>
<p>“Oh, how can i forget what my beloved Sumire like?”</p>
<p>“Oh, um… thank you… I’m happy…”</p>

<p>Hey hey hey hey…! dont blushing and looking down all shyly… This kind of thing works because it’s just mutual act, you know…!?</p>

<p>“S-Should we eat?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah!”</p>

<p>We started to eat, pretending to hide various emotions and things by touching the plates in front of us.</p>
<p>Although they were called sandwiches, they were truly oversized, almost too big to hold with one hand.</p>
<p>We considered cutting them with a knife and fork, but since the sandwich bag (in this case, a burger bag?) was included, we wrapped them and took a bite with both hands.</p>

<p>“It’s delicious…!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>

<p>Thanks to it being really delicious, we didn’t have to act here.</p>
<p>Well, the taste of lovey-dovey and the taste of the food aren’t really related.</p>

<p>“Hey, Shinnichi-kun. There’s something on here, you know?”</p>

<p>Osaki pointed to the corner of her lips, indicating the mayonnaise on the corner of my lips.</p>

<p>“Oh…!”</p>
<p>As I tried to wipe it with my finger, my wrist was grabbed.</p>
<p>“Wait. This is a chance.”</p>
<p>Chance?</p>

<p>“…I, I’ve been holding back in front of the other bride candidates.”</p>

<p>She wiped the mayonnaise on my lips with her index finger and licked it off.</p>

<p>“Osaki…”</p>
<p>“…It tastes good.”</p>

<p>Osaki blushed again, perhaps embarrassed by what she had done. No, I’m the one who’s embarrassed…</p>
<p>Looking at me with slightly moist eyes due to embarrassment for a moment, and Osaki, who was starting to get a little nervous, looked at me and the sandwich she was holding,</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Wow, mine is delicious too! I really want Shinichi-kun to try it too!”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah… here.”</p>
<p>“Um, this is like an indirect kiss…”</p>
<p>Is it really necessary to go this far!?</p>
<p>“Ki-kiss… Now, don’t get all excited about such things at this point. Hira-Shinichi-kun, its not like its your first time! That’s why you never move on from your first love. Oh, That why ‘Shoshin’ and ‘Ubu’ written with the same kanji.”</p>
<p>Wait, why Osaki-san seems a bit too flustered… I don’t know what she’s talking about…</p>
<p>“Anyway, please eat it! An indirect kiss is not the enemy of us, who always secretly give each other french kisses! Right!?”</p>
<p>“F-French kiss.”</p>
<p>Osaki-san, aren’t you the president’s daughter? Is that choice of words appropriate!?</p>
<p>“Please, Hira-kun, don’t embarrass me any further…”</p>
<p>She says in a small voice while glaring at me with teary eyes.</p>
<p>I didn’t know what she would say next, so I took a bite of the sandwich from her hand.</p>
<p>“How-how is it? Is it delicious?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, um…”</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t really know the taste…</p>
<p>“Well, that’s good then.”</p>
<p>As we leave the shop, a slender, glistening-white hand slips into my right hand.</p>
<p>“Oofuu, Sumire…!”</p>
<p>It’s a lovers’ hold. Even when we were dating, we never held hands like this.</p>
<p>“Don’t react too much. They will know that you’re not used to it.”</p>
<p>“O-Okay…”</p>
<p>She whispers softly, but even your ears are bright red…</p>
<p><a id="duty-free-back"></a>We walk hand in hand for a while and arrive at the duty-free shop.<span style="color: #ff0000"><a style="color: #ff0000" href="#duty-free">¹</a></span></p>
<p>“Shinichi-kun, did you bring your passport properly?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>When I touch my waist where the passport…</p>
<p>“I won’t steal it, you know? Don’t you trust me that much?”</p>

<div><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/0022_Image_2_c7.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>And she lowers her brows, looking sad. Ah, this is her genuine expression…</p>
<p>Feeling a bit sorry for her, I explain briefly, ‘Well, recently my wallet was stolen, but I managed to recover it.’</p>
<p>It seems that Osaki understood with just that, and she smiles wryly, saying,</p>
<p>“It’s troublesome, even with that stalker. I don’t want her getting close to my Shinichi-kun.”</p>
<p>“By the way, the photo in your study abroad audition profile, it was your passport photo, right?”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? Well, I don’t really take photos…”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, that’s right. At that time…”</p>
<p>“At that time?”</p>
<p>“Uh, well…”</p>
<p>After hesitating, probably realizing there’s no point in evading, Osaki confesses</p>
<p>“You know, there was a time when we tried to take a purikura at the game center.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I remember…”</p>
<p>I recalling it while scratch my cheek.</p>
<p>Our first date after we started dating was at the game center, at the insistence of the sheltered Osaki. She’s probably referring to the time when I declined.</p>
<p>“It hurt quite a bit, you know? Even though I gathered the courage to suggest taking it together, you said, ‘It’s impossible, isn’t it…’ At that time, you still used honorifics.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s true…”</p>
<p>The first time I met Osaki, we were the chairpersons of the executive committee of a joint school festival.</p>
<p>Since we met as seniors and juniors from different schools, we naturally used honorifics.</p>
<p>However, after we started dating, around a little later, she said, ‘Hirakawa-kun, in a relationship, we shouldn’t use honorifics, shouldn’t we?’</p>
<p>After reading some column of advice, she prompted me to switch to casual language.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t ask that much at that time because it was too sad… But, if it’s okay, can I ask why you didn’t want to take the photo?”</p>
<p>Osaki, unusually considerate, looks at me, and since there’s nothing to hide, I decided to answer honestly.</p>
<p>“I just don’t like the way I look.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>
<p>Osaki lowers her eyes, looking a bit lonely at my simple answer.</p>
<p>“So that’s your self-evaluation. Well, everyone has their own perspective. It’s the opposite of my opinion, but that doesn’t mean I’m denying your sensibilities.”</p>
<p>“The opposite?”</p>
<p>‘Ah,’ I thought she would say that, but without doing so, Osaki continues.</p>
<p>“I think there are people who find your appearance attractive. Even if you don’t think so. Besides, your appearance is just a small part of what makes you who you are. In fact, I find everything about you, including your appearance, it is very charming.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, thank you, Sumire. I also—”</p>
<p>As I try to go along with Osaki’s act, she interrupts, saying, “No, that’s not what I mean.”</p>
<p>And then, she specifically tells me in a hushed voice,</p>
<p>“I’m not saying this because it’s an act. It’s the truth, Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>“So, Shinichi-kun, is there something you want? Souvenirs for the bride candidates or something?”</p>
<p>“Ah, well…”</p>
<p>I was speechless at the moment but in an attempt to cover it up, I hastily respond.</p>
<p>“Certainly, it might be a good idea to buy something for everyone. Ouch!.”</p>
<p>With her nails scratching the back of my hand that she’s holding, my voice unintentionally comes out.</p>
<p>“W-Well! I don’t have money to spend on other girls… I-I mean, I wanted to buy a present only for Sumire.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m happy!”</p>
<p>Sumire intentionally expresses joy.</p>
<p>“But, I’m okay with any presents. If you buy me a chocolate tablet for around 3,000 yen, I’ll be happy with that alone.”</p>
<p>“Chocolate tablet, is that a chocolate bar? ‘Around 3,000 yen’ – you’re probably trying to be considerate, but that’s quite expensive, you know?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Hey, seriously? Drop the act.</p>
<p>“Well, well, you’re really good at joking, Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, around 1,500 yen, right?”</p>
<p>“Ahaha… No, that’s not it.”</p>
<p>Seeing my blatantly forced smile, Osaki, who apparently judged that she couldn’t keep up the act any longer, lets out a sigh, dropping her shoulders.</p>
<p>“I thought our sense of money was not that different, but… Well, it seems it was. Your family has the motto ‘Those who don’t work shall not eat,’ right?”</p>
<p>“You remember that well, huh? That’s our family rule or tradition.”</p>
<p>The phrase she mentioned, ‘Those who don’t work shall not eat,’ is more of a tradition at our house.</p>
<p>From around the time I was in kindergarten, I earned pocket money by doing chores. Bath cleaning for 5 yen, dishwashing for 10 yen, taking out the trash for 3 yen…</p>
<p>It was like that, and from as far back as I can remember, money for me was compensation for labor.</p>
<p>Therefore, I have a pride in being more strict about money than most of my classmates.</p>
<p>“If I discipline a child like that, he will grow up to be a like Hirakawa-kun.you know?”</p>
<p>“Do you want to raise a child like me…?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Or rather, she keeps calling me Hirakawa-kun, but…</p>
<p>“I’m tired…”</p>
<p>After the farce, we returned to our mansion with a private pool. I wrote a message on a notepad I found there and showed it to her.</p>
<p>‘Is this place not under surveillance?’</p>
<p>Osaki looked at the note.</p>
<p>“You studied Indonesian, but the spelling is wrong,”</p>
<p>Osaki then writing below it.</p>
<p>‘Unfortunately, surveillance is still in place.’</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“But, it was close. This one is the correct answer.”</p>
<p>‘If we’re in the pool, our voices probably won’t be heard.’</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Well then, Shinichi-kun, I’ll go change.”</p>
<p>She went into her room, which looked like a small hut, by the side of the pool.</p>
<p>The rustling of the trees could be heard as the sound of shifting clothes.</p>
<p>After changing in the bathroom in an instant, I sat on a deck chair, trying to read a book I brought from the Roppongi Sky Tower Library.</p>
<p>However, nothing registered in my mind. Nevertheless, if I lifted my face and saw the private pool in front of me, I would likely imagine something inappropriate. I also cant ever looking at the glass-enclosed bedroom hut standing on the left, where she was currently changing.</p>
<p>Because she was changing behind those curtains.</p>
<p>Trying to calm my right eye’s optic nerve, which seemed to be on edge, I made an effort to read the words written in the book, and at that moment.</p>
<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting, Shinichi-kun.”</p>
<p>A clear and pure voice reached my ears, and I raised my face. And, I was left speechless.</p>
<p>…Its a goddess</p>
<p>Osaki is wearing a black bikini with lace ribbon on the chest.</p>
<p>Osaki fidgeting with embrassed manners..</p>
<p>“You told me to wear this?”</p>
<p>“I-I didn’t mean it like that…”</p>
<p>Trying to get my voice out somehow, I gradually regained my composure.</p>
<p>“It’s not like the purpose was to make you wear a swimsuit.”</p>
<p>“Then what was the purpose?”</p>
<p>“To… undress you?”</p>
<p>“W-what do you mean… you pervert.”</p>
<p>Well, that’s true, but that’s not the point. I just wanted to have a genuine conversation with Osaki without the eavesdropping devices.</p>
<p>For that, it was necessary for her to wear either a swimsuit or be naked, and if given the choice, she would probably choose a swimsuit. It’s better than choosing to be naked.</p>
<p>“So, How do i look?”</p>
<p>Osaki, once again, inquired while tying the strings.</p>
<p>“Uh, well… I think it looks great on you.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>Blushing despite her character, she turned her face away.</p>
<p>“So, shall we go into the pool, Hirakawa-kun?”</p>
<p>In the pool that was arranged for us, we just leaned against each other in silence.</p>
<p>The private pool is about a quarter the size of a school pool.</p>
<p>Although it’s too wide for just the two of us to spend time in, but neither Osaki nor I know how to do the kind of “kyaa-kyaa-ufu-ufu” (splash water on each other) that we do when we’re in love, so if we have to act lovey-dovey, this is the only way we can come up with.</p>
<p>…No, I shouldn’t be making excuses like this.</p>
<p>I haven’t forgotten the reason why I changed into a swimsuit.</p>
<p>But somehow, bringing up that topic seemed scary or embarrassing.</p>
<p>Because the content is more awkward than a breakup story, it’s a topic about ‘checking the answers to the breakup with my ex.’</p>
<p>“Uh… Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>…Even so, that time will come.</p>
<p>“Can I explain about that day?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>
<p>Osaki begins to talk.</p>
<p>“To begin with, the reason I approached you first was because my father told me to. It was sort of a political maneuver love affair.”</p>
<p>“I figured as much…”</p>
<p>I had guessed from the night talk in Nasu. Even so, a sigh escapes me.</p>
<p>“Then, what about joining the festival committee?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The fact that our schools decided to have a joint school festival was also a scheme by my father.”</p>
<p>“As expected of Mr. Osaki Holdings. He has incredible influence…”</p>
<p>“Not as much as your father.”</p>
<p>Osaki smiled with a troubled expression. When she makes this expression, I feel like she’s telling the truth.</p>
<p>“So, the confession on that day was also a lie?”</p>
<p>When I started dating Osaki, she was the one who confessed to me.</p>
<p>“You would think so. After all, your first impression was the worst…”</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault, is it?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember what you said first?”</p>
<p>“Ah… I-I don’t remember…?”</p>
<p>I try to feign ignorance, but since I remember, I unintentionally use the same words as back then.</p>
<p>Although I try to play dumb, she gracefully accepts my execuses and says,</p>
<p>“You said, ‘I’m determined to only do things that I think about and agree with.'”</p>
<p>She uttered every word without a mistake.</p>
<p>“I apologize for being presumptuous…”</p>
<p>Well, it’s not like my principle has changed even now…</p>
<p>“…It’s half and half, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Half and half?”</p>
<p>“The answer from earlier. It’s true that I confessed for the sake of a political love affair. But…”</p>
<p>Osaki once again showed a troubled smile.</p>
<p>“…The fact that I liked you is also true.”</p>
<p>“So, why did you suddenly disappear?”</p>
<p>I tried to remain as calm as possible, but a hint of sharpness crept into my voice.</p>
<p>“Your father didn’t intend to let you inherit the Hirakawa name. He told my father.”</p>
<p>“My father…”</p>
<p>“Yes. It seems he told my father.”</p>
<p>While it was news to me, it’s probably true. When I told my father, “I’m leaving home when I enter high school,” the timing aligns.</p>
<p>“I am just a pawn of the Osaki family. If you don’t become the president, when another engagement proposal comes up, our relationship would become an obstacle.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“Of course, I resisted. But if I did, my father hinted that he would harm you. I was most afraid that you would be hurt because of me.”</p>
<p>“So, that’s why you suddenly became unreachable one day…”</p>
<p>“Yes. I took the high school entrance exam and attended a different high school than before. I cut off all ties with you… or rather, was cut off. About two years passed. One day, I received a call from an unknown number on my smartphone. It was Jujoo-san, and the content was an invitation to a love study abroad.”</p>
<p>So, Jujoo-san directly invited Osaki…</p>
<p>“I immediately told my father about it. I said, ‘There shouldn’t be any problem if he becomes the president of the Hirakawa Group.’ Even then, my father, who doubted my feelings, approved with conditions. The condition was to ‘record and send all of my statements.'”</p>
<p>“So, that’s what happened…”</p>
<p>If I had known that at the time, I wonder if things would have been somewhat different. Well, even if I had known, what could I have done? Surely, if I had heard it at that time, I would have just been dazzled, thinking, ‘So that’s how it is…’</p>

<p> </p>


<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Lovey-Dovey or Die 4</strong></p>
<p>“Osaki herself, what does she want to become?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘want to become’…?”</p>
<p>I thought the question was a bit abrupt.</p>
<p>“Up until now, you thought it was right to act in the best interest of the Osaki family as the daughter, right? Well, now, what do you want to become? Do you still want to be something for the sake of the family?”</p>
<p>“I don’t care anymore, about the family or anything.”</p>
<p>“You don’t care?”</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes and tilted my head.</p>
<p>“Yes. If I can be with you, I can give up anything. If you say you’re going somewhere, I want to let go of everything and go with you. My dream is you, Hirakawa-kun”</p>
<p>Osaki stared at me with a serious face.</p>
<p>“…To live together with you.”</p>
<p>“Osaki…”</p>
<p>I was captivated by that feeling.</p>
<p>…But, what is it really? Well, why?</p>
<p>“Hirakawa-kun is my reason for living.”</p>
<p>The words that had reached my throat were covered up, and I quietly swallowed them.</p>
<p>I gently accepted that.</p>
<p>“Hey, can I ask Hirakawa-kun one thing?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“On that day, why did you accept my confession?”</p>
<p>“Well, why bring that up now…?”</p>
<p>“Please, I want to know.”</p>
<p>Even though I tried to resist, her eyes staring at me were unusually direct, and despite turning away, I ended up answering.</p>
<p>“…Because I liked you, that’s why.”</p>
<p>“Why? What about me?”</p>
<p>In response to my blunt words, she further questioning me.</p>
<p>There was no malicious smile on her face. It was an expression like a desperate child begging for answers.</p>
<p>“No, you might be disappointed if you hear it. The reasons why a typical middle school boy likes someone… Well, it’s embarrassing to say…”</p>
<p>“A middle school boy… huh? Could it be because you can do naughty things or something like that?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that…”</p>
<p>I scratched my cheek.</p>
<p>“Do I really have to say it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please. If you don’t say it, I’ll live the rest of my life thinking that you were only interested in my body.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want that…”</p>
<p>It was the memory of my first innocent love. It would be better if it were more delicate..</p>
<p>I resigned myself and confessed in a small voice.</p>
<p>“…I liked everything about Osaki.”</p>
<p>“Ev-everything…!?”</p>
<p>Osaki widened her eyes. That’s why I didn’t want to say it.</p>
<p>“E-everything, like, that ‘everything’? Is it the ‘everything’ I know?”</p>
<p>“What other ‘everything’ is there…? Ah, um, that, well, personality, face, voice, everything. The ‘everything.”</p>
<p>According to my mother, even though it might be ‘love,’ it might not be ‘true love.’ In reality, our interests didn’t align.</p>
<p>Still, at that time, there was no way for me to resist being confessed to by such a person.</p>
<p>“….!”</p>
<p>“Could you stop being silent for a moment…?”</p>
<p>“Your use of honorifics at this timing is really good…!”</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>I didn’t intend to tickle such a strange fetish…</p>
<p>“Uh, well, um, then… I’ll say it too.”</p>
<p>“I also like Hirakawa-kun’s appearance, voice, personality. …And then,”</p>
<p>Caught off guard by Osaki’s confession in the present, she continues her words.</p>
<p>“Even if all of that were to change, I would still love Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>“Osaki… :!”</p>
<p>“…Even now, that’s how I feel. Do you understand that much?”</p>
<p>Her wet black hair is illuminated by the moonlight, strangely beautiful.</p>
<p>“B-but still? Earlier, you were about to say ‘everything’ as ‘jienbu,’ right?” (Tl : Zenbu -&gt; Jienbu (『全部』-&gt;『じえんぶ』)</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Perhaps because her embarrassment reached its limit, Osaki, who had just changed her expression, starts to tease me.</p>
<p>“The habit of biting at crucial moments hasn’t changed, huh? Not just during that toast the other day, but also during the opening ceremony speech at the school festival…”</p>
<p>“Oh? If you’re going to bring that up, should I mention the things I’ve been quietly enduring? Like the time during the festival…”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>It seems that the parting wasn’t entirely Osaki Sumire’s fault. However, it was certain that I was hurt to some extent.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, would it be acceptable to return the favor like this?</p>
<p>“Since coming to Bali, you said I’m being monitored. Is that a lie?”</p>
<p>“…!!”</p>
<p>In response, her cheeks turn red enough to be visible even in the darkness of the night.</p>
<p>With that reaction, I change my expectation to certainty.</p>
<p>Talking about eavesdropping in Japan is probably true, but the claim that agents have been monitoring since coming to Bali is a lie created by Osaki herself.</p>
<p>“…Did you notice all along?”</p>
<p>“From the beginning.”</p>
<p>“From the beginning!?”</p>
<p>Osaki opens her eyes wide. It’s amusing to see her, always calm demeanor changed making such varied expressions.</p>
<p>“W-what’s your basis for that?”</p>
<p>“Because even if I liked Osaki, there was no need to change the way I addressed you and play the lovey-dovey couple. Furthermore, there was even less need for Osaki to act affectionate towards me.”</p>
<p>“A-a…!”</p>
<p>“Well, well! Why didn’t you point that out at that time…!”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t be sure. I thought it was better to go along with the act than to point it out and take the risk.”</p>
<p>“I’ve always hated that about you…!”</p>
<p>Osaki glares at me with moist eyes.</p>
<p>“Only thinking about your own risks. Can’t you consider my risks too…!”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I value risk management.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>
<p>Osaki, pouting like a child, hits my chest with a “mou!” Anyway, she must be thinking, ‘Why did you tell such a lie?’</p>
<p>“Well, I…”</p>
<p>Without asking me to say it, which would have been a long sentence like ‘You don’t need to say it since I can somehow guess,’</p>
<p>“I just wanted to do things that lovers couldn’t do back then with you, Hirakawa-kun…!”</p>
<p>Osaki continues,</p>
<p>“Holding hands, hugging, getting excited over indirect kisses, shopping together… I wanted to experience all of that! I wanted to do things like riding on a motorcycle together in Nasu too! I’ve wanted to do those things for a long time!”</p>
<p>“Osaki…”</p>
<p>I quietly swallowed the sweet and sour past, like ‘Even I wanted to be like that.’</p>
<p>Because I still don’t know if I can choose her.</p>
<p>“It’s fine like this for now, Shinichi-kun.”</p>
<p>Seeming to understand my feelings, she gently hugs me and whispers with a smile.</p>
<p>“…Someday, when our last names are the same, surely, you’ll call me Sumire.”</p>
