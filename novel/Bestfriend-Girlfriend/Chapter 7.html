<h1>Chapter 7: Tapeworm-san Wants to Abduct</h1>

<h3>First Day at Work after Setbacks</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takata, it&#8217;s time for work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid who identified herself as 『Cockroach』 came to the room again the next evening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there were no windows or clocks in the room, so the exact time was unclear. However, they had said work started at five in the evening, so it was probably evening now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just in case you were thinking of seeking help when you leave this room, it would be in vain. The Great Confinement King or the nature of this room. Even if you try to talk about them to someone, you won&#8217;t be able to..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The phrase 『you won&#8217;t be able to』 is quite peculiar. Not 『don&#8217;t do it』 or 『you&#8217;ll suffer if you talk』 but 『you won&#8217;t be able to.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I somehow understand. Perhaps it really is impossible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid walks briskly towards the entrance set up in the back of the room, motioning for me to follow as if urging me to hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t go outside dressed like this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem. Beyond this door is already the store&#8217;s locker room and break room. The uniform for the shop consists of a bikini top and a miniskirt for the bottom. The miniskirt will be provided by the store.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reluctantly, I follow her through the door, and there is a small room not even six tatami mats in size, lined with five steel lockers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre of the cluttered room, there is a folding long table, surrounded by six folding chairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid opens one of the lockers and takes out a plaid miniskirt, offering it to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, please change into this and wait for a while.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the maid goes out of the room.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s better than just a bikini, but…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, I put on the miniskirt. Even though it&#8217;s called a miniskirt, it&#8217;s so short that it hardly serves its purpose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m only wearing a bikini top and it seems like I&#8217;ve become even more obscene looking.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why do I have to dress like this…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but slump my shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From here on, I was alone and idle. After sitting on a pipe chair for a while, I heard a hesitant knock and a girl peeked her head through the slightly open door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Chiwaー!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl had a slightly longer platinum-pink short haircut. Her facial features were ordinary but her hair colour was definitely attention-grabbing. She was wearing a blazer-type uniform. However, I couldn&#8217;t tell which school it belonged to.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll be in your care starting from today! I&#8217;m Mako, nice to meet you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, uh, no, I&#8217;m, uh, starting today too…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, is that so? Nice to meet you! Hey hey, what&#8217;s your name?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I&#8217;m Takata.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Taka-chi, huh? Alright, O-k, O-k, I remembered.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She went out of her way to pull a chair closer and sat down, flashing a wide smile and getting closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why, but she seemed foolish and overly familiar.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s my least favourite type. Always trying to please everyone and going along with whatever, these kinds of kids end up getting into trouble without thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, three more girls, stereotypical gals, entered the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They came in saying [Ohaー] and [Yoruー] and with lots of giggles and chatter, they started changing into their bikinis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is this place&#8230;It&#8217;s like a nest of idiots, nothing else comes to mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once they finished changing, they spread out snacks on the table and bombarded me and Mako with questions without any restraint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhaa, where&#8217;d you get that tan? Tanning salon? That looks awesome. But seriously, if you&#8217;re going that far, you should do your makeup too, you know? It&#8217;s all about balance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makeup?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, your hair&#8217;s already that colour, and it&#8217;s a waste not to go all out with your makeup.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Mako joined in with the girls, giggling and enjoying, it was utterly impossible for me. Or rather, I didn&#8217;t want to be part of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stood there nervously with a strained expression, the door opened again and two more women entered the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One was the Cockroach Maid. However, when my gaze shifted to the other woman who followed her, everyone in the room involuntarily gasped.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the cluttered, narrow room, stood a stunning foreign woman in an extremely out-of-place evening dress. Her long silver hair shone like silk thread, reflecting the fluorescent light and sparkling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa! Who&#8217;s this? An actress? She&#8217;s seriously gorgeous!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait&#8230; why is she dressed as a maid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the gals exclaimed, the Cockroach Maid spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning. Starting today, there has been a change in ownership of this establishment. However, I assure you that there will be no changes in your treatment, so please rest assured.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, seriously? That perverted old man is gone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the silver-haired beauty spoke up.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been entrusted with this establishment by the new owner who bought this shop. You can refer to me as the 『Manager』 that would be fine. Please take care of me starting today. Also, although I mentioned that there won&#8217;t be any changes, the system for the popularity vote will be slightly different from before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Popularity vote? Oh, you mean like a beauty contest?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, exactly. It seems it was used for promotions and evaluations before, but from now on, the person who ranks first for the day will receive a bonus of 100,000 yen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A h-hundred thousand!? Seriously!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way, that&#8217;s super generous!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yabba! We&#8217;ve got no choice but to give it our all, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the gals began to get excited, the maid clapped her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now then, we will begin opening, so everyone, please get ready.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「Okay!!」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Led by the Manager, the gals left the room in a lively atmosphere. Only Mako, the Cockroach Maid and I remained behind in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that alright? The competition has already begun from the positioning stage, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pushed by the maid&#8217;s urging, I left the break room and on the other side was already the storefront. It was a shop with an absurdly long counter as its only feature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since the three gals had taken the middle positions, Mako and I stood towards the corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For today, I will handle the orders for the two newcomers. The two of you, please focus on interacting with the customers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid announced from behind and Mako smiled and said, [Ahaha, thank you!].</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, customers gradually started coming into the store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is Rena-chan working today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes. Yama-chan, what brings you here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! I&#8217;m head over heels in love with Rena-chan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A group of regulars seemed to have taken their positions in front of the gals, engaging them in lively conversation while sipping their drinks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Customer after customer entered and they all seemed to gravitate towards the three gals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Customers sure are coming in a lot today, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not knowing how to answer, I furrowed my brows and she leaned in, peering at my face before giving a mischievous smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, Taka-chi, you&#8217;re not doing well. Give us more smiles, smile!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh&#8230; Ah, sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As time went on, the shop became fully occupied. Customers filled the counter in front of me and Mako, seemingly pushed out from in front of the gals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you&#8217;re the new ones, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Call me Mako! Do customers come here often to this shop?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Mako smoothly began chatting with a customer, a plain-looking older man who had come up to me looked up, wearing a puzzled expression.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, you&#8217;re the new one&#8230; I assume?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A highball…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Highball?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily tilted my head in confusion.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is he talking about baseball? Is that what he wants to discuss?’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, from behind me, the maid handed me a drink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here&#8217;s a highball. Please serve it.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A highball is a type of alcoholic drink…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, I placed the highball in front of the older man with a thud. He looked puzzled again, then moved the glass he had been drinking from aside. Peering over my shoulder, he opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey, why a maid outfit?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I am responsible for educating the new recruits here. Please think of me as a sort of shadow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? I&#8217;d rather talk to you than that brooding girl over here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please understand. I might get scolded by the manager. Takata-sama, the customer would like to have a conversation. Something fun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A conversation? Uh, alright.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Challenged by the maid&#8217;s audacity, I pondered for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An interesting story&#8230; If I&#8217;m going to tell one, it might as well be something informative.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, I decided to explain to the older man in front of me just how harmful smoking and alcohol can be for the healthy development of young people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you an idiot?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Cockroach Maid stared at me with a scornful, lingering gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned her stare in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This happened in the locker room after the shop closed, once all the other gal members had left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Admittedly, if I only looked at the results, I ranked fifth out of five in the popularity vote.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Zero votes and I managed to upset two customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The drink back was worth four hundred yen for two drinks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, considering the goal of earning three million yen, the situation wasn&#8217;t great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s not my fault. It&#8217;s incredibly unfair that I have to lower my standards just to fit in with those kinds of people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let alone being blamed by the maid, there&#8217;s no reason for me to be held accountable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t deal with vulgar middle-aged men like that. I&#8217;m not someone who belongs to the dregs of society like this! The customers are scum and the girls at the shop are all scum too! It&#8217;s degrading to flatter, provoke and use your looks to be showered with money. It&#8217;s nothing but despicable!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I spat out these words, the Cockroach Maid raised an eyebrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Houu? The pure and righteous moral committee chairperson. Are you implying you&#8217;re a better person than them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I am!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Living earnestly. I&#8217;m correcting the moral decline and I&#8217;m studying diligently too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I declared with a fierce tone and the Cockroach Maid sighed as if exasperated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Living earnestly? What a joke.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa!? What are you trying to say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that okay? The gals worker you belittled today. Two of them are college students and one is studying nursing. They&#8217;re hard working students earning money on their own for their livelihoods.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those kinds of people?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, those kinds of people. And right next to those individuals who are desperately working hard to make a living, you pout, act spoiled and belittle others according to your own selfish standards. I have no words other than 『idiot』 to describe someone who justifies their own shortcomings while whining that they&#8217;re not at fault.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But even so, people who choose this jobs…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no distinction between noble and humble in occupations. Money exchanges occur because they&#8217;re necessary. That&#8217;s the nature of a capitalist society. Men who endure a tough world that students can&#8217;t even comprehend come seeking a fleeting bit of solace at this shop. And you call that indecent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-If they need a way to unwind, there are plenty of other, uh, options!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A bratty child who nibbles at their parents&#8217; coattails, lives a cosy life, trips others to feel superior and thinks they&#8217;re the leader of the pack. Truly, there&#8217;s no other word for it but repulsive. What purpose do you serve?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But a student&#8217;s main responsibility is studying! Teachers praise me, and so do my parents!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response, the Cockroach Maid exaggeratedly shrugged her shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, they&#8217;d praise you, of course. Easy customers are pleasant because they require little effort. Being praised, feeling good and deluding themselves into thinking they&#8217;re great. What&#8217;s the difference between you and those customers who were leaning on the counter?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha!? Don&#8217;t compare me to them!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the same. In fact, I&#8217;d like to know what sets you apart.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Well, I&#8217;m serious…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You keep saying 『serious』 but let me put it this way. 『How about working a bit more seriously?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaaa!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Engaging in disruptive behaviour resembling obstruction of business in a legitimate establishment. Angering important customers twice in one night, putting a damper on the atmosphere of the shop. Let me be clear, 『Moral Committee Chairperson』 Tonight, you&#8217;re the one who disrupted the business of this establishment. You&#8217;re inconveniencing everyone with your selfish behaviour.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8230; disrupted the business?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, in a school setting, this would warrant suspension. If it weren&#8217;t for the orders of the Great Confinement King, I&#8217;d be at my wit&#8217;s end too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Suspension…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that regard, today, Mako-sama, who just entered this shop, performed excellently. Despite not having regular customers, she ranked second in the popularity vote. The customers she attended to all left in good spirits. Despite having the same drink prices and cover charge, Maako-sama&#8217;s customers likely enjoyed their next day, while the customers you attended spent the day in discontent.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you say that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mako-sama is working to earn money for her sick mother&#8217;s hospital expenses. Now, between you and her, who called her trash, who is the real scoundrel?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was already lost, not knowing what to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on a foldable pipe chair, my shoulders slumped with exhaustion. Frustration, sadness and tears streamed down uncontrollably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Crying as soon as you&#8217;re scolded, you really are beyond help. Please take some time to cool off.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the Cockroach Maid left, the only sound left in the locker room was the sound of my sniffling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moou&#8230;what should I do now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sobs welled up from deep within my throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to escape. But if I run away from here, it won&#8217;t be that simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kobayashi-sensei, too, will undoubtedly face difficulties.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I tightly grasped the hem of my miniskirt, the locker room door made a small creaking sound as it opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Timidly peering in was a girl with platinum-pink hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mako&#8230; san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230; Are you okay? Taka-chi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she entered the locker room with cautious steps and gently took my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seemed like you were being scolded. I got worried and came back. It&#8217;s okay, Taka-chi, you&#8217;re cute. Today is still the first day. Let&#8217;s do our best together, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears started flowing uncontrollably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out what was making me sad or what was causing the pain, and holding onto Mako-san&#8217;s hand, I cried out loud like a child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lili-sama, Head Maid-sama. Cockroach and Earthworm. We have returned.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I reported while bending my waist, Lili-sama floated gently in the air and nodded slightly, saying, 『Good work, Devi』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to me is a girl with platinum-pink hair, who is named Earthworm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honoured by the role assigned by Lili-sama, both Earthworm and I are tasked with the carrot and stick of training onto the Disciplinary Committee Chairman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My words and actions are in accordance with Lili-sama&#8217;s scenario. Truly, there&#8217;s no other way to put it but to say it&#8217;s typically Lili-sama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems to be going well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the Head Maid-sama says this, Earthworm opens her mouth slightly, appearing somewhat proud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, Takata-sama asked me if I could give her guidance on serving tomorrow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is she at the moment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to the Head Maid-sama&#8217;s question, I answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She has returned to her room and is currently resting. We plan to bring her a meal when she wakes up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well. Continue to progress without any oversight.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Yes, ma&#8217;am!」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we responded, Lili-sama nodded with satisfaction and spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once you have completely corrupted the Disciplinary Committee Chairman, I will put in a good word for you to FumiFumi to have you both join him in his chamber, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Th-thank you very much!」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Earthworm and I exchanged glances, sharing our joy. With the dream of offering our virginity to the Confinement King almost within reach, we felt invigorated for Takata-sama&#8217;s training.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard that Lili-sama also assigned tasks to the Centipede and the Tapeworm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If possible, I hope all four of us could be favoured by the mighty Confinement King, that&#8217;s what I wish for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now, as we take our leave before Lili-sama. Earthworm and I bend our knees and shout together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「For the Great Confinement King!」」”</span></p>

<h3>First Bout</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">BGM is a surf sound. Occasionally, the sound of waves overlaps as sound effects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The walls of the store are painted in a light blue, and the ceiling decoration resembles a thatched roof from Bali. Hibiscus flower decorations are placed everywhere, creating a tropical atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Seaside Bound』 is a gals&#8217; bar with a theme of a midsummer sea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to online reviews, recommended cocktails are Frozen Daiquiri and Piña Colada. If you don&#8217;t mind the occasional smell of tonkotsu ramen from the neighbouring ramen shop, you can enjoy a vacation-like feeling—it seems to be quite a popular place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it&#8217;s a bar with an international atmosphere, as soon as my sister and I stepped inside, all eyes turned toward us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that&#8217;s normal too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『They&#8217;re foreigners! Uh-oh! What should we do if they talk to us!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m used to those looks. After all, just because of my appearance, I get double-takes even when eating yakisoba in the food court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『They&#8217;re foreigners! Eating yakisoba!?』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s fine, whatever! Foreigners can eat yakisoba too!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shouldn&#8217;t have done that. The conversation got off track.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess it can&#8217;t be helped. It&#8217;s a bit self-indulgent to say, but when two foreign beauties like us show up at a gals&#8217; bar in a place like this, that&#8217;s only natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Claudia&#8230;I think it&#8217;s probably the girl all the way on the right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as we entered the store, my older sister whispered that to me.</span></p>
<div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-94132128' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-94132128' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed her words and looked to the far right of the counter, where I saw a girl who looked a little different from what I had seen in the photo I had checked beforehand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a tan complexion, a short cut dyed green and small hoop earrings that jingled. But her distinctively defined features, like her eyes and nose, were unchanged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name tag attached to the tube top bra she was wearing read 『Hikari』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my sister and I approached the girl, she had a slightly puzzled expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey…..</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Gaijin-san.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> are sure you&#8217;re not in the wrong place?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, people like us don&#8217;t usually come here. To places like this…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I replied, she seemed visibly relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good, you can speak Japanese?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, I can&#8217;t speak English, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, I see. So, what drink will you have?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll have cola. And my sister?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bowmore 18-year-old, on the rocks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure thing, just a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She started preparing the drinks. As I gazed at the small bottle of star sand lined up at the end of the counter, I spoke to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Teruya-san…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand stopped abruptly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230; who&#8217;s that? My last name is Kasuya.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, that response was a lie. Within my field of vision, her face turned red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard that she was head over heels for a guy named 『Junichi Kasuya』 from Tachibana&#8230; It&#8217;s a little creepy that she chose the surname of the guy she liked for a fake name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it&#8217;s clear that she still holds feelings for Junichi Kasuya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well then, instead of talking about her sister, it seems more enticing to bring up Junichi Kasuya&#8217;s story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Junichi Kasuya&#8230;seems like you two broke up, huh? With that Kurosawa girl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, her reaction was dramatic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I mentioned the name 『Junichi Kasuya』 her eyes widened significantly, her thick eyebrows shot up, forming an expression of astonishment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. We&#8217;re on your side. We&#8217;d like to tell you more about Junichi Kasuya&#8217;s current situation, but could you find some time somewhere to meet?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I asked her, she showed a slightly puzzled gesture, then glanced around and lowered her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I&#8217;ll be taking a break in about an hour. Meet me in the back coin parking lot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, Tapeworm, am hiding behind a car in the shadow of the backside of the gal&#8217; bar where my target works – I mean, Teruya-senpai. I&#8217;ve been observing the situation from the coin parking lot for the past few days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After several days of observation, I&#8217;ve noticed that during her break time, the target comes out to this coin parking lot, holding a can of coffee and looking at her smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve concluded that if I&#8217;m going to abduct her, this is the right moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, today I&#8217;m going to abduct Teruya-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the orders came from Lili-sama, I thought, [Finally, it&#8217;s here!]</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believed that Teruya-senpai would face the same punishment as the four of us did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that wasn&#8217;t the case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The older sister of Teruya-senpai, who had become a substitute for the Confinement King and was arrested, and the one who had gone missing, seemed to have a strong possibility of being protected by a conflicting demon aristocrat in the demon world against Lili-sama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though it&#8217;s uncertain whether she&#8217;s being held captive or in a cooperative relationship, we can&#8217;t just leave it be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili-sama said that if we secure Teruya-senpai&#8217;s safety, we can use her as a shield when the time comes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, the mission assigned to me is abduction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as I don&#8217;t kill her, I&#8217;ve been told I can be as reckless as I want. Therefore, I plan to use my favourite battle axe to chop off both her hands and feet, and carry her compactly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It should be about break time…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Peering from the shadow of a parked Range Rover, I observe the back entrance of the store. I sense someone entering the coin parking lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I discreetly peek and see two foreign-looking women.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They seemed to linger as if waiting for something, staying in the area.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Chii&#8230; they&#8217;re in the way.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve been strictly ordered by Lili-sama to handle things with utmost secrecy. I can&#8217;t forcibly remove them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling frustrated, I wait for them to go somewhere, and then my target appears from the back entrance of the store. She walks towards the two foreign women.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Who are they? They don&#8217;t seem like friends…’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voices of the two foreigners are quiet and I can&#8217;t make out what they&#8217;re saying. In fact, it seems like Teruya-senpai&#8217;s acknowledgments are even louder. Well, she always had a loud voice to begin with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230;that means I can go back to school? To the track team?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heardSenpai&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after what seemed like a back-and-forth exchange, Teruya-senpai nodded emphatically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Junichi-sama, you&#8217;re free? I see, I understand. Alright&#8230;got it, I&#8217;ll cooperate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have no idea about the situation, but either way, attempting the abduction tonight seems difficult.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door that Lili-sama had opened was near the entrance to the coin parking lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s in a state invisible to others, so there&#8217;s no risk of being discovered. However, even if I want to retreat, I have no choice but to wait for them to leave.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Haaa&#8230;..need to start over.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I raised my head with a sigh, in that instant, I trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right in front of me stood a foreign woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the two who were just talking to Teruya-senpai. The shorter-haired woman had somehow turned to gaze down at me with sharp eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What are you doing here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s no use hiding it at this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as I don&#8217;t kill her, I can make as much of a mess as I want; she&#8217;s regenerable. She wasn&#8217;t on Lili-sama&#8217;s order list, but she looks exceptionally beautiful. If I offer her to the Confinement King, he might be pleased.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the battle axe I had prepared behind me and, without a word, mowed down the foreign woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the perfect timing for a decisive blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the blow that was meant to cleave her in half narrowly missed its mark. The axe swung with excess force, denting the hood of the Range Rover with a resounding thud.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was genuinely taken aback by this turn of events.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strike I just delivered could easily obliterate a magical beast like Orthros. It&#8217;s certainly not something a mere human could dodge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh&#8230;Hotta?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard Teruya-senpai&#8217;s voice, surprised at the sight of me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Chii, I&#8217;ve been seen. I need to make up for this somehow..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this rate, I&#8217;ll end up being punished by the Head Maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Raaah! Raaah! Raaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While keeping my eyes on the foreign woman in front of me, I swung the axe I held in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vertical strikes, diagonal cuts, horizontal sweeps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of intense wind cutting through the air reverberated, and the axe struck the ground, gouging the asphalt and causing it to explode.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, all my attacks were in vain, slicing through thin air and narrowly missing their mark, as she continued to evade them with uncanny agility.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dammit! Why can&#8217;t I hit her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s anticipating my every move. She&#8217;s dodging with the absolute minimum of effort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of visual acuity does she have to be capable of this? It didn&#8217;t seem like human skill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With shaggy blond hair in a short bob and a statue-like beauty, her limbs were so long and graceful it could inspire envy and her figure was impeccable. Her appearance was akin to a foreign model plucked from a fashion magazine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, even Head Maid has a foreign appearance. This woman must undoubtedly be a denizen of the demon world as well. Could she be one of the demon aristocrats Lili-sama mentioned, or perhaps one of their subordinates?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To attack so suddenly just because you were asked what you&#8217;re doing&#8230; you&#8217;re quite the dangerous one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I snapped, lifting my axe again. In the next instant, the woman&#8217;s figure disappeared from my sight. Or rather, it seemed to vanish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, the foreign woman had slipped within my guard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment after I let out an astonished cry, I felt a light impact on my chin. The woman&#8217;s fist grazed my chin with an uppercut-like motion as I desperately leaned back and away.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Khh, this kind of attack&#8230;!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I thought that, my vision suddenly blurred. My body wouldn&#8217;t respond.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The handle of the axe slipped from my fingertips, and I began to collapse to my knees.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wha-what is this&#8230;? Th-this is bad. I can&#8217;t be captured here&#8230;I can&#8217;t inconvenience the Confinement King&#8230; I can&#8217;t…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Struggling to keep my fading consciousness tethered, I managed to hold on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before me stood the foreign woman, poised like a boxer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu, uaahaaaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My legs wobbled, my knees buckled. I felt like I was about to fall over but I lunged at the foreign woman. Naturally, she evaded but that was fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continued my momentum, sprinting toward the entrance of the parking lot and then rolling into the hidden door, disappearing inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You saw that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“aa&#8230; I saw it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst an air of astonishment, my sister nodded in response to my question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Near the entrance of the parking lot, the maid suddenly disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I felt around the area where she vanished, I turned to my sister and asked again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not sure how to interpret it&#8230; but I guess we can consider it as evidence of demon involvement, just as Tachioka suggested.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that makes sense.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her finger on her chin, my sister showed a pensive gesture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even the maid just now&#8230; Although we did mess with her mind, it&#8217;s hard to believe she could move like that. She certainly doesn&#8217;t seem human.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Hikari. You seemed to know something about the maid earlier, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Caught off guard by the sudden question, Hikari flinched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, um, yeah. If I&#8217;m not mistaken&#8230;she&#8217;s probably Eri Hotta, a first-year track team member who went missing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, that means the connection between that door and the 『disappearance incident』 is pretty much confirmed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Door?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onee-chan, you didn&#8217;t see it? Right before the maid disappeared, she made a motion like she was opening a door. I think there might have been an invisible door-like thing there, something we couldn&#8217;t see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, if you can open these door-like things anywhere, it would be pretty easy to abduct the entire track team at once, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my words, Hikari&#8217;s face turned pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s true. This kind of talk would likely be overwhelming for ordinary people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It definitely seems like demons are involved.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘There are stories of making contracts with demons in exchange for souls…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought about it, the image of a certain person crossed my mind.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Maybe&#8230; if they don&#8217;t have a soul, my abilities wouldn&#8217;t work on them?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person I was thinking of was Saori Moribe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Tachioka had suspected Fumio the most, from the sensation of meeting him, he seemed just like an ordinary boy. And Saori appeared to have an adoring attitude toward him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was merely a hypothesis, but if Fumio&#8217;s seemingly fortunate circumstances were because Saori had sold her soul to a demon on his behalf.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I pondered, my sister pointed at the ground and spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230; what do we do about this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking down, there lay the maid&#8217;s belongings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Let&#8217;s just pretend we didn&#8217;t see anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A battle axe&#8230; seriously?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, it wasn&#8217;t something you&#8217;d come across in modern-day Japan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unbeknown to me, but it was a time when Claudia-san was trying to pick up the battle axe left by the maid and was taken aback by its weight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a room in a high-rise hotel in Shinjuku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, Kurosawa-san, in provocative lingerie, knelt on the carpet and traced her tongue along my shaft as she sat between my legs on the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her pink tongue licked up the vividly veined flesh, and I shivered in pleasure, my spine tingling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe&#8230; Fumi-kun, it feels so good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing my reaction, Kurosawa-san narrowed her eyes happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you tormented me quite a bit today, you’ll make it up by serving me all night long.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh..Fumi-kun was the one who ordered me to do it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her words carried a hint of dissatisfaction but her expression melted into delight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, boldly, she took my dick into her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a deliberate and vulgar sound,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Bubo, Bubo,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> her lips manipulated my shaft, lifting and stroking. The sensation of her warm wetness and supple touch caused me to arch my back involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she squeezed my flesh with her soft lips and flicked her tongue along the underside, a pleasure that resonated deep within me surged, and I instinctively placed my hand on her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with a soft pop, Kurosawa-san pulled her lips away and murmured in a dreamy tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmm&#8230;Fumi-kun, you&#8217;re amazing. So hard and wonderful…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing such words from a beauty like Kurosawa-san is genuinely a pleasant feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That excitement quickly transmitted to my groin, causing my veins to stand out even more prominently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waa–Ii, it&#8217;s gotten big again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san gently licked the glans, kissed the tip, and then nuzzled the underside before taking me in her mouth and moving her head back and forth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jyubo, Jyubo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> the seductive sound of slurping echoed once more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost simultaneously with me letting out an involuntary sigh of pleasure, the smartphone I had left by my side vibrated and played a loud ringtone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The area code was 03. It was an unfamiliar number, but I couldn&#8217;t help but twist my mouth in annoyance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s here, it&#8217;s here&#8230; Kurosawa-san, please continue as you were.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled slyly with upturned eyes, then vigorously shook her head while using her fingers to stroke the base.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the continuous lascivious sounds as the background music, I tapped the smartphone and answered the call.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, this is Fumijima.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah&#8230; It&#8217;s Kurashima from the First Beauty Office.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha- Kurashima President!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exaggeratedly feigned surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I appreciate your help. Th-Thank you very much for today. So&#8230; uh, what exactly is the reason for your call?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, for you and MISUZU. There&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to discuss privately. I apologise for the suddenness but could you come to our office tomorrow?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha,Haaaa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, you don&#8217;t need to be so cautious. It&#8217;s a good thing for you too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, but President…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I glanced involuntarily, Kurosawa-san vigorously moved her head back and forth, while using both hands to fondle my testicles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Receiving a sudden different sensation, I unintentionally let out a sound, and Kurosawa-san looked up at me with a mischievous smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the matter?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I apologize. I&#8217;m currently in the middle of a foot reflexology massage&#8230;.however, MISUZU-san has already left Tokyo and won&#8217;t be back for another week…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230; In that case, just you will do for now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sucking sounds continued as Kurosawa-san increased her efforts, pushing me further into the depths of pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, yes, ah&#8230; Haa, I am at your service in any way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, please come to visit me around 1 p.m.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-Understood!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I tapped my smartphone to end the call. I couldn&#8217;t bear reaching climax while listening to an old man&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“K-Kurosawa-san! I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m going to&#8230; I&#8217;m going to cummed!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I declared this, the movements of her head quickened and became more frantic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the intense fervour of her passionate fellatio, a scorching surge swirled in my lower abdomen, rapidly ascending.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuh! Guh, ugh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tightened my sphincter muscles, pressed my feet against the floor and struggled to hold back my climax. However, she seemed to consider my resistance futile as she relentlessly continued to pleasure me, effortlessly bringing me to climax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to cum! Kurosawa-san, I&#8217;m going to cum!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuru! Byururururu!!!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my exclamation, a hot, milky fluid surged forth, breaking through the dam and flowing into her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn,nnnnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite receiving a substantial amount of milky fluid, she didn&#8217;t stop her movements at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, she continued her affectionate service with even more vigour, seemingly asking for more with her actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gah, ughhh, being sucked away…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the throes of the suction that seemed intent on drawing out every last drop, I shuddered and released the milky fluid into her mouth.</span></p>

<h3>Is It Okay To Just Settle In The Global Society?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What! Tapeworm has been defeated!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, heh, heh&#8230; No problem. She&#8217;s the weakest of us, the Four Heavenly Insect King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But seriously, aren&#8217;t Tapeworm not a pest? It&#8217;s a parasite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re going to say that, then earthworms are beneficial insects too. It&#8217;s weird to call them pests.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute! Stay on track! The conversation is derailing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kohon&#8230;..Well then, next up is this earthworm!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What nonsense, that opponent is not something a centipede can handle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What did you say, earthworm? You should be the one to shut up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, um, well then, I,cockroach, will go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Sure, go right ahead!」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeeeh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched the maids playing Four Heavenly Insect King in the dining hall and thought to myself.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is way too ridiculous, seriously. Maybe I went a bit too far with this,Devi.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This happened just a few minutes ago.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maids, who had been standing upright in a row, began to lounge around like schoolgirls gossiping around a table during lunch break when I said, [You can relax a bit,Devi].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, with too much free time on their hands, they started this kind of game.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;m glad Freesia isn&#8217;t here for this,Devi’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This kind of playful nonsense is her favourite thing. I could almost see herself wanting to join in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, just for the sake of this, I might even have to summon another member of the Four Heavenly  Insect Kings from the Demon Realm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The siege of Castle Geal has resulted in our army&#8217;s victory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, the enemy&#8217;s attacks are sporadic.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to FumiFumi&#8217;s growth, the tide of battle has turned in our favour, but the situation is still delicate, and I cannot afford to let my guard down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of which, Freesia has been continuing her punishment of Tapeworm since last night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principle of rewarding the deserving and punishing the wrongdoers is the foundation of our organisation, so there&#8217;s no leniency, nor any intention of showing any. Due to the Tapeworm&#8217;s failure, it was a significant oversight to let the Saints become aware of our presence.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘However, these maids have become considerably skilled in combat. With a bit more training, they might even be fit for deployment in the Demon Realm…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pondering such thoughts, the door suddenly opened and FumiFumi walked into the dining hall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the maids hurriedly got up and assumed a standing posture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「Good morning! Thanks to the benevolent Confinement King, we are once again able to spend a joyful day!」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re up quite early this morning,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I did my radio callisthenics. After having breakfast, I plan to head back to Tokyo immediately.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha&#8230;I went a bit overboard yesterday, so I think she won&#8217;t be up until around noon.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s getting to the point where FumiFumi needs at least two people to keep up or she won&#8217;t be able to handle it anymore…,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I unconsciously shrugged my shoulders, FumiFumi looked around the dining hall and tilted his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t one of the maids missing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, Tapeworm is busy working on making sausages to feed Orthros,Devi..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Though I&#8217;m planning to delay the response for another week, so there&#8217;s no need to rush&#8230;Oh, and how&#8217;s Takata-san doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The training just started, but so far, it&#8217;s going well. Earthworm and Cockroach over there are working hard,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sounds pretty casual..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s better that way. If they came down, they&#8217;d just cause trouble and try to wipe out humanity right away,Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t that a bit extreme!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you look at stories like Noah&#8217;s Great Flood or various ancient and modern scriptures and religious texts, you&#8217;ll see that humanity has never been on the brink of destruction due to demons. Whenever humanity faces a crisis of extinction, it&#8217;s always divine punishment. The work of the angels,Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what about this foreign saint you mentioned?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;re like pawns in a game. Just for passing the time,Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa&#8230; that&#8217;s pretty harsh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you see, they&#8217;re not really a significant threat,Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. But speaking of these saints and foreigners, their numbers seem to be increasing lately. Even in today&#8217;s radio callisthenics, there was a foreign girl. I became friends with her a little while ago.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Foreigners…radio callisthenics&#8230;well, it&#8217;s a global society, after all,Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe, I ran into Kitora-chan earlier, and she was dressed really stylishly…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:The nurse of the school]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just before club activities began, Shima-senpai and I were having that conversation while changing, when Ninagawa-senpai abruptly cut in.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know, that thing, Senpai. She went on a date after work! Kitora-sensei, she’s got a boyfriend now, right? Rumour has it you&#8217;re about to score.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way! Seriously?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost simultaneously with Shima-senpai leaning forward, Coach Yolanda entered the clubroom and clapped her hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, listen up! In preparation for the tournament, we&#8217;ve added a new coaching staff member starting from today&#8217;s practice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coaching?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Staff?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an incredibly sudden announcement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from Takasago-senpai, who was dozing off in a pipe chair, everyone looked puzzled all at once.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in the next moment, as we laid eyes on the person who entered the clubroom, we all widened our eyes in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me introduce you. This is Hikari Teruya, who will be in charge of coaching for the short sprints.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A yankee-style jersey in black with gold stripes. Hair dyed green, with numerous piercings in the ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though her appearance had changed drastically, the person who had appeared was unmistakably Teruya-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As everyone was left dumbfounded, Coach Yolanda raised her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;ll be taking care of the short sprints&#8230; Moribe!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eek!? Ahh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly called by my name, I instinctively jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, switch to short sprints!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh!? B-but, I-I do high jump…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First of all, high jump is a mismatch for your height, and training for the short sprints will be beneficial even if you return to high jump! For the upcoming tournament, you&#8217;ll be participating in the short sprints!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In place of me, who was caught off guard to the point of freezing up, Shima-senpai confronted Coach Yolanda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute, Coach! This is getting out of hand, isn&#8217;t it? Right,Hatsu-chan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, the choice of events is based on the individual&#8217;s preference upon joining and although there&#8217;s only one short sprinter now with Ninagawa, if we switch to the short sprints, high jump will have only Takasago&#8230; Coach, what do you think about that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Captain Tashiro turned her sharp gaze, Coach Yolanda squarely faced her and spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I observed the practices the day before yesterday and yesterday. Takasago isn&#8217;t really practising. When they split up for event-specific practice, Moribe is practicing alone. Isn&#8217;t that more unhealthy?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takasago…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai let out a small groan. Indeed, with such a statement, there wasn&#8217;t much to say in return.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, in the next tournament, Moribe will participate in the short sprints!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Emphasised by Coach Yolanda, I reluctantly nodded.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stole a glance at Teruya-senpai.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Teruya-senpai is intimidating and loud&#8230;I don&#8217;t like it..’</span></i></p>
