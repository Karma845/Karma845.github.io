<h3>Epilogue</h3>

			
<p>Several days after—discharged from the hospital, I was riding in a carriage from the royal capital to the town of Ludlow where my home was located.</p>



<p>I’d talked to the adventurer’s guild about the Empire’s mage.</p>



<p>That the fight had been initiated by the Empire’s mages, and that they had been aiming for Aine.</p>



<p>Though, despite being called ‘the Empire’s mage,’ they didn’t seem to belong to the Knight Order maintained by the Empire. In other words, it was possible there was collaborators in the Empire’s knights, but it seemed to be difficult to identify their real identity from there</p>

<p>However, I got no intention to pursue it deeply. If I were on my own, I might be able to at least get into the Empire and settle it, but… I got Aine.</p>



<p>If I wanted to protect her, at least right now, it should be the correct choice to stay by her side and to also stay away from the Empire.</p>



<p>So, I’d several jobs canceled, and decided to return to my home.</p>



<p>Sitting next to me, Aine started to ask a question. “So the town you’re living in, how is it?”</p>



<p>“Nnn, well it’s just a normal place. It’s small compared to the capital, and there’s not a lot of people there.”<br>“Oh really… Then, why aren’t you working in the Capital?”<br>“I’m not some kind of a workaholic, you know? The time when an S-adventurer is needed is… well, I guess it’s when there is a national disaster.”<br>“You said it so simply, huh. I don’t want that happening so often, though.”<br>“Ahaha, at least, it’s uncommon since I became an S-rank adventurer. And there are also other adventurers. Besides, it’s not like I became an adventurer to protect the country. That’s the knights’ job after all. Right now, I’m here to protect you/”<br>“…Could you, not say embarrassing things like that to my face?”</p>



<p>At my words, Aine looked and faced away. When she pointed out that it was an embarrassing thing, certainly, that might be true. However, my feelings towards Aine were real.</p>



<p>We’d exchanged our ‘feelings’ to one another, so I got any intention to even hide that feeling.</p>



<p>“I’m telling you the truth, so what’s there to be embarrassed about?”<br>“…Really, you’ve got that side in you. Maybe by nature…?”<br>“By nature?”<br>“Nope, it’s nothing. But, I also don’t plan to only get protected,” touching the collar, Aine muttered softly. She definitely must be thinking—if only the collar did not exist, she could fight properly.</p>



<p>In fact, that was also the reason why she was targeted. With no risk of the collar, even Aine should be able to fight decently.</p>



<p>However, I did not wish for Aine to fight.</p>



<p>“Even though I’ve been saying I want to protect you, you can’t readily agree to it, can’t you.”<br>“T-that’s obvious. I don’t want to become a burden.”<br>“I will never think of you as a hindrance just because you’re by my side, you know?”<br>“I’m telling you that kind of talking is embarrassing! Sheesh!” Aine blushed a little and raised her voice.</p>



<p>I ended up teasing her a little, huh…</p>



<p>With a small smile, I touched her cheek. “Sorry, but that’s also the truth.”</p>



<p>“…Nn. Well, I’ll forgive you. And also, you can’t work until that eye heals, okay?”</p>



<p>She must be worried about my still eyepatched eye—even though I’d proven that I could fight even if both eyes couldn’t see, Aine was a worrywart to no end.</p>



<p>“Then, I guess I’ll leave housework to you.”<br>“! O-obviously I will do that! I’ll do anything!”<br>“You speak so highly there… Have you ever been so homely?”<br>“Wha, how rude… Even I have helped Mom with housework, so I can at least do that much.”<br>“Wasn’t that pretty long ago?”<br>“I’ve been living alone since becoming a knight! Just watch… I will show you my housework skills!” Aine blabbered so with a vigor.</p>



<p>Despite feeling a bit anxious, in the shaking carriage, I set out for my own home together with Aine.</p>



<p>I also got no plan to increase my adventurer’s work that much. I want to be by Aine’s side as much as possible and cherish her…. It was because I was thinking so.</p>



<p>For that reason, I supposed I’d definitely have to find a way to remove the collar. That’d be the start—but before that, I’d savor the happiness of being by her side for now.</p>



<p>After all, my life with her had only just begun.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>


		
<p>Dribble—the sound of the river flowing reached the ears. <em>I could see the sunlight when I looked up</em>,<em> but we ended up coming to the part of the forest where it’s very thick</em>; or so Aine felt.</p>



<p><em>Just how long we’ve been walking from where the bridge was, I wonder; it might have not been that long, but the bridge already couldn’t be seen when I looked back.</em></p>



<p>“Hey, how far are we gonna go?”</p>



<p>“Nn, let’s see. Until the river flow is a little more calm, I guess.” When she was asking Lunois walking next to her, that was his answer.</p>



<p><em>We’ve talked about going nearby, but how far Lunois is planning to go, I wonder</em>—such a question arose within Aine.</p>



<p>From time to time, Lunois would stop to touch the ground, examine the nearby vegetation to investigate what path the monster had traveled through.</p>



<p>A large monster would often leave particularly conspicuous traces.</p>



<p>However, as far as Aine could confirm, she could confirm not that many traces that the monster had already traveled through here.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it about enough already? I feel like we’re pretty far in, too.”</p>



<p>“No, let’s check just a little deeper to make sure.” Lunois kept on walking forward, not accepting Aine’s suggestion.</p>



<p>She kind of had the feeling but, when Lunois started working, he wouldn’t leave it half-way.</p>



<p>His intention of going to take down the monster if it showed up was clear to see. Lunois had originally planned to take down the monster, so there was no helping it, though.</p>



<p><em>But if it keeps like this, it really doesn’t look like we’re gonna stop, huh…</em></p>



<p>It would have been great if he would hear Aine’s words and stop, but there was no sign of that right now.</p>



<p>Having entered the forest, the signs of monsters other than the target one were, of course, could be felt from the surroundings. Those, too, seemed to be making Lunois’ wariness stronger.</p>



<p><em>In that case</em>…</p>



<p>With a determined expression, “the river flow around here is also calm, isn’t it?” Aine once again spoke to Lunois.</p>



<p>“There was a big rock a while ago after all. Maybe that’s why the flow is calmer.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s take the chance to rest here.”</p>



<p>“Here? It’s certainly not a bad place, but I do want to see things a little further ahead.”</p>



<p>“I’ve also checked for traces, but aren’t there hardly any left behind? I suppose it’s not around here”</p>



<p>“That possibility might be high. The attack on the bright was probably also like a passing whim, so it might not be making this place as its territory. However…”</p>



<p>Lunois looked as if he wanted to say something.</p>



<p>Sure enough, Lunois didn’t seem to be feeling like taking a rest yet.</p>



<p>However, Aine had no plan to back down here either.</p>



<p>She cast a glance towards the river, “we’ve been riding in a carriage for half a day,” and spoke up. “So I kinda feel like getting a quick bath.”</p>



<p>“Bath, huh. If you want to, then sure. Let’s take a rest around here.”</p>



<p>Where could the odd stubbornness from earlier go; just by Aine mentioning her wish to take a bath, he easily accepted it.</p>



<p>Lunois would always put Aine as the priority—and so, it ended up making Aine feel a little guilty, but right now she was more concerned about Lunois’ body.</p>



<p>Therefore, Aine told a lie in order to make Lunois rest.</p>



<p><em>If it’s just this much, it’s okay, right…?</em> Telling herself so, Aine and Lunois made their way to the riverside area where the flow was calm. The sound of the calm river flowing and the cries of small animals could be heard—it was a more relaxing place than expected.</p>



<p><em>If it’s here, even Lunois will—</em></p>



<p>“Alright, I’ll set up the tent, so you can go take a bath.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Don’t say ‘Eh?’ Didn’t you say you wanted to take a bath? Setting up a base doesn’t take up that much time, and I’ll be done with it while you’re taking a bath,” Lunois said, and hurriedly turned his back to Aine and started the preparation—indeed, it was all brought up by Aine.</p>



<p>During her time as a knight in the Empire, camping out had been a natural thing to do; and she’d been taking a bath near the campsite as a matter of course.</p>



<p>And to be undressing at this stage, where there were no eyes around was undoubtedly, not something to be embarrassed about.</p>



<p>However, there was Lunois in front of her. Only he would probably not do something like peeking while Aine was changing. She believed so; though, at the distance where they were not too far apart, she felt a little reluctant to take off her clothes.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>While still in silence, Aine sent a glance to Lunois. Without even appearing to notice her gaze, Lunois continued the preparations to set up the base, alone and silently.</p>



<p><em>Am I the only overly minding it, I wonder</em>—with this in her mind, Aine put her hands on her own clothes.</p>



<p>While occasionally sending glances at Lunois, Aine took off one piece at a time—and finally, she became stark naked. While trying to cover her chest and secret part with her hands, Aine’s cheeks blushed.</p>



<p>At this point in time, it might be odd to be embarrassed to be seen by Lunois.</p>



<p>After all, she had already crossed the line with Lunois—however, this and that were different.</p>



<p>Aine’s feeling of embarrassment wasn’t going away… though, however, there was no sign of Lunois going to look at Aine who was now naked.</p>



<p><em>H-he could at least look over here for a bit… He’s really so serious on weird points.</em></p>



<p>Lunois was by no means in the wrong. If anything, Aine should have been grateful as it was him being considerate to her, but for the current Aine, that consideration gave a little dissatisfaction.</p>



<p><em>What does this mean, not showing any interest at all in my naked body?</em> She thought.</p>



<p>Aine showed an expression like she had just come up with something and then went to approach Lunois quietly, trying not to make any footsteps.</p>



<p>Even if Aine was erasing her presence, Lunois might still be aware of her approaching him—however, without minding such a thing, Aine went to hug Lunois, who was sitting down and working.</p>



<p>“Wah!”</p>



<p id="jump-1">She tried to do it with such an exact force that her chest would hit Lunois’ head, but sadly, Aine didn’t have the chest size which would allow her to do that.<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup></p>



<p>Poing—the feeling of something hitting him was perhaps about as much like it was touching his head.</p>



<p>Lunois stopped his working hands immediately and slowly turned his gaze towards Aine.</p>



<p>And then, with a puzzled face, “what are you doing?” Indeed, he just asked a brief question.</p>



<p>Being told so, Aine, for the first time, began to feel embarrassed about what she had done.</p>



<p>She moved away from Lunois without a moment’s delay. And then, “I-it’s nothing at all! Dummy!” uttering such a sharp remark, Aine hurriedly fled the scene.</p>



<p>Aine also knew that it was completely nothing more than venting her anger, but she unintentionally got angry at Lunois’s attitude.</p>



<p>“Aine, don’t wander too far.”</p>



<p>“I-I know! I’m not a kid anymore!”</p>



<p>Towards Aine, Lunois threw words a parent would say, and she raised her voice once again.</p>



<p><em>Geez… You don’t understand my feelings…!</em></p>



<p>However, it didn’t mean it was Lunois’ fault.</p>



<p>Aine let out a short breath, and went to enter the river to cool down her head.</p>



<p>“Cold…!” Aine reflexively yelped as it was colder than expected.</p>



<p>However, she quickly became used to the water temperature. Furthermore, she went deeper in.</p>



<p>She couldn’t tell earlier as she had been looking from a distance, but the river water was surprisingly clear.</p>



<p>“Pretty…” Aine muttered a brief admiration. It was to the point that she could easily forget the anger from a moment ago.</p>



<p>And then, Aine felt somewhat nostalgic.</p>



<p>Her hometown’s river as well—she felt it was this pretty. Thinking about it, after becoming a knight, she’d never done anything like calmly admiring nature.</p>



<p>Had she never reunited with Lunois, this much freedom probably wouldn’t have been possible in the first place.</p>



<p><em>…If I invite Lunois, I wonder if he will come. It’ll be a bit of relaxation, too. But…</em></p>



<p>Aine confirmed her current situation. Speaking of what she got on her now, it was just the ‘Sexualification Collar,’ and right now she was stark naked.</p>



<p>With nothing but a collar, how would it look from someone else&#8217;s point of view?</p>



<p><em>B-but… I’ve already taken a bath with Lunois. Besides, we’re also doing lots of l-lewd things. Nothing to mind about at this point, right…?</em></p>



<p>Aine moved her gaze around to check the surroundings. Although it was obvious, there was no one but Aine and Lunois here—if that was the case, then there would be no problem since it’d only be with Lunois; it being embarrassing was unmistakable, though.</p>



<p>Aine made her decision. As she looked back, she called out to Lunois.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Lunois—”</p>



<p>However, Aine instantly stopped her voice.</p>



<p>After all, immediately after looking back, the one that came into Aine’s view was the sight of Lunois sitting down with his head down. She could tell even from a little distance; that Lunois had fallen asleep.</p>



<p>The base was already set, and even a campfire was skillfully created.</p>



<p>In front of it, he was sleeping, using the sword in its scabbard as a support.</p>



<p>“Come on, I’ve wasted my time thinking so much about it…”</p>



<p>Aine let out a small sigh. And at the same time, she felt relieved.</p>



<p>Lunois must have been tired—he never would want to show such a sight around Aine, but the fact that he could at least fall asleep at a distance where they could see each other meant that it was a relaxing situation for him as well. It ended up with nothing result wise, but it turned out the way Aine wanted it to.</p>



<p><em>While at it, I guess I should also take my time and then retur—nn?</em></p>



<p>Noticing something soft suddenly touching her foot, Aine looked down.</p>



<p>Then there was a semi-transparent Slime moving there, slightly different from the color of the water.</p>



<p>“This is Aqua Slime… right?”</p>



<p>As the name implied, it was a slime species inhabiting the waterside. It was said that among the slime monsters where their body was in liquid form, it required even more water content. Although a monster, it was known to be harmless to humans and animals.</p>



<p>Rather, it seemed that they would even eat dirt stuck on people’s bodies, and she had also heard that some people were using it to make a business. Maybe it was moving along wth the river flow.</p>



<p>The Aqua Slime showed a gesture like it was trying to stick on Aine’s body.</p>



<p>“What? You’re gonna wash me?” Aine said, making a confirmation; though, it wasn’t like it was possible for them to communicate with each other.</p>



<p><em>I don’t know how it’ll feel, but since it’s a perfect opportunity, it might not be so bad to have it wash me</em>—Aine thought, and bent down on the spot.</p>



<p>“How’s this?”</p>



<p>And then the Aqua Slime began to stick to Aine’s body in slow movements.</p>



<p>“Nnh, fuuh.”</p>



<p>The moment it touched around her belly and arm, she felt a stroking sensation up her skin, making her reflexively leak out her voice.</p>



<p>Aine was bewildered by the ticklish feeling which was more than she had expected.</p>



<p>It might be that Aine was just too weak, but without trying to shake off the Aqua Slime, she bit her lips and held still to endure it.</p>



<p><em>If I were to carelessly raise my voice here, it might end up waking Lunois up. </em>With this in mind, Aine suppressed her voice.</p>



<p>The Aqua Slime began to gradually expand the extent of its clinging to Aine’s body, perhaps seeing that she was not resisting.</p>



<p>“&#8230;uw, fuuh, uwh…!”</p>



<p><em>This is, tougher than I thought…!!</em></p>



<p>Aine couldn’t hide her surprise at this, something she only had heard about from stories.</p>



<p>They said the sensation of being massaged by a slime would feel good, but in reality, rather than it feeling good, it felt like it was making her want to squirm.</p>



<p>Although it did not try to come up above the neck, the slime slowly and surely, went to crawl up her body, which was making Aine shudder.</p>



<p><em>This might be, bad…!</em></p>



<p>By the time Aine realized this fact, it was too late.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>


			
<p>The Aqua Slime was spreading out while splitting its body—from her chest area all the way down to her inner thighs and her feet. Some of its body was already extending to her back as well.</p>



<p>For the record, shaking off a slime was not that hard.</p>



<p>It was just gently clinging to her body; if she were to strongly rush out of the spot, much of it would likely detach itself from her body.</p>



<p>Even just by making slight movements on the spot, she could probably shake it off of her body.</p>



<p>However, right now Aine was not in the situation to do so—because a little apart, Lunois was still asleep.</p>



<p><em>He-he’s finally, sleeping… I must not wake him up…!</em></p>



<p>That was the only reason Aine was enduring it.</p>



<p>Other than above the neck, the Aqua Slime also miraculously didn’t try to touch her genitals.</p>



<p>Perhaps it instinctively knew places where touching them would undoubtedly be disliked—however, it was tougher that way for Aine right now.</p>



<p>“Haah, haah…”</p>



<p>On her breasts and all the way to her nipples, it kept moving to caress them.</p>



<p>If she were to continue to be subjected to such an offensive, even getting into the mood wouldn&#8217;t be anything weird.</p>



<p><em>If-if it’s just a little bit… then…</em></p>



<p>Aine reached her hand out to her secret place.</p>



<p><em>Rather than keep getting worked up like this, it might be better to just orgasm once</em>. Aine thought so and then took action.</p>



<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/03/jfiwu9f04.jpeg"></img>



<p>“&#8230;uw, nnh… fuh.”</p>



<p>Slowly, she went to insert her fingers into her vagina.</p>



<p>The already aroused Aine’s vagina was wet and her fingers slid in deep.</p>



<p>“Ahn, fuh…”</p>



<p>Raising inarticulate voices, Aine began to move her fingers.</p>



<p>All the while the Aqua Slime stroking her whole body, indulging in pleasuring herself—</p>



<p><em>It-it’s different. There’s just, no other choice to not wake Lunois up</em>…</p>



<p>All the while reminding herself, Aine turned her gaze towards Lunois.</p>



<p>Even now Lunois didn’t seem to be moving, remaining quietly asleep.</p>



<p>However, if he were to wake up right at this moment, Aine’s freaky act would be exposed. If the sight of her indulging in pleasuring herself while covered by a slime were to be seen, she probably wouldn’t have any excuse if she were thought to be a pervert.</p>



<p>“Haahh, hah, nnh…”</p>



<p>Her breathing was becoming more ragged. There was a limit to how much of her voice she could suppress, but Aine was desperately enduring it while looking at Lunois.</p>



<p>Together with the peace of mind from seeing Lunois peacefully sleeping—<em>I wonder what will happen if he wakes up right now</em>.</p>



<p>Imagining the situation, Aine’s arousal reached its peak.</p>



<p>“Uwh, ah—”</p>



<p>With a small shudder of her body, Aine came once. Against her flushed body, the cold river flow felt just right.</p>



<p>However, without a time to soak herself in such a lingering sensation, Aine noticed the slime still fondling her body.</p>



<p><em>It-it’s still, not done yet…!?</em></p>



<p>Her body, which was sensitive from having just come, would be overly sensitive to the slime’s caressing.</p>



<p>“N-no!! You, can’t, right now…!”</p>



<p>Aine expressed her rejection.</p>



<p>However, without stopping, the Aqua Slime went further on its offensive on Aine.</p>



<p>“N-no—”</p>



<p>It was at this moment, that she raised her voice just a little bit louder. No sooner than the sound of splashes of water reached her ears, the sound of something cutting through the wind echoed in the surroundings.</p>



<p>What could slightly be seen was trajectories of a sword. Feeling that her body was floating lightly, she noticed—that Lunois was in front of her eyes.</p>



<p>As Aine was lifted by his arms, her eyes opened wide.</p>



<p>“Lu-Lunois…!?”</p>



<p>“Sorry, I thought of making sure that I could react to the surrounding ‘hostility,’ but I’ve been careless.”</p>



<p>Lunois’ expression was serious, and he was looking to be truly apologetic. The fact that he could react from Aine raising her voice just a little bit must mean that he’d been on alert.</p>



<p>In just a split second, he had cleared away the Aqua Slime clinging to Aine’s body, rescuing her.</p>



<p>He glanced down, and found the scattered Aqua slime trying to gather up together again.</p>



<p>“Is this… Aqua Slime? I’ve never heard it attacking people, but… having had its way with you, I guess I’ll just have to dispose of it,” extremely calmly, Lunois uttered.</p>



<p>Aine panicked, “wa-wait! Th-this child was, um… just eating the dirt on my body… err, it’s my fault for making weird noises,” and apologized. Lunois quickly sheathed his sword, perhaps after seeing Aine’s state.</p>



<p>“So I jumped to the wrong conclusion, huh. I messed up a lot.”</p>



<p>“N-not at all. I was glad, that you came right away.”</p>



<p>“If I hear your voice, I’ll come running in a heartbeat. But, as a result—I ended up seeing you naked up close.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Ah.” Hearing it, Aine realized her own state. She was still flushed and stark naked, forgetting to even cover her important bits.</p>



<p>While averting his gaze away, Lunois tried to lower Aine down.</p>



<p>However, Aine wrapped her hands around his neck and hugged him.</p>



<p>“Aine…?”</p>



<p>Lunois looked a little perplexed.</p>



<p>Close to his ear, Aine whispered: “seeing my naked body, you don’t even think of anything?”</p>



<p>Even from the fact that Lunois was averting his gaze, she knew that it didn’t mean that he wasn’t conscious of it.</p>



<p>However, Aine simply wanted to confirm it.</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s beautiful.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;!!”</p>



<p>And then, having received Lunois’ immediate reply, it was Aine who was perplexed instead.</p>



<p>“Tha-thanks…?”</p>



<p>Something that she managed to do was just thanking him. Not knowing what to follow it up with, Aine was just silent. And Lunois, he simply gave a small nod at Aine’s words without saying anything; while still carrying her in his arms, he got out of the river.</p>



<p>“Umm… sorry, you were asleep and yet.”</p>



<p>The first thing coming out of Aine’s mouth after being lowered down was another apology.</p>



<p>Lunois looked a little surprised, and immediately gave a wry smile.</p>



<p>“So you noticed. I didn’t mean to sleep, though.”</p>



<p>“But as I thought, you’re also tired, right? You even feel asleep and all. In that case I want you to take a good rest, and something like that as well, I don’t want you to hide it either.” Aine expressed her true feelings. Lunois surely, must be exhausted from being on his guard all the time.</p>



<p>However, prioritizing Aine, Lunois would never show her such a behavior—but, he gently covered Aine with the robe he was wearing, and replied: “yeah, I don’t mean to hide things from you. And it wasn’t like I was tired.”</p>



<p>“If that’s true—”</p>



<p>“Why was I sleeping, isn’t it? Well, maybe I definitely got a little spent; though, it’s because I knew there were no signs of enemies aiming for us, and above all, you’re here by my side.”</p>



<p>As Aine’s gaze swam around from hearing Lunois’ clear remark, “I-I see. Hmm-mm…? Well, if that’s the case… fine, I guess,” she showed an awkward, shy face.</p>



<p>He could feel safe with Aine—in other words, this was what Lunois’ words meant. Not a chance she wouldn’t be happy hearing it.</p>



<p>As she turned her face away to avoid exposing her delight as much as possible, she suddenly realized her own current state.</p>



<p>“—Oops, I have to get changed…!”</p>



<p>Aine tried to stand up, but she couldn’t properly muster the strength in her body and fell to her knees. At the same time, she felt the arousal that should’ve been calming down increasing again.</p>



<p><em>Cou-could this be…!?</em></p>



<p>Aine noticed—that her body was getting into ‘heat’ in this timing.</p>



<p>Lunois supported Aine’s body.</p>



<p>“Are you okay? Aine?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah… E-even though I just did it…”</p>



<p>“Nn? Just did it…?”</p>



<p>“! It-it’s nothing!! M-more importantly, I’ve to at least dry my body…”</p>



<p>“No, it would be best to settle it down quickly while you’re like this.”</p>



<p>“Eh—hyaah!?”</p>



<p>Her body was pulled by Lunois, and held by him.</p>



<p>As it was, Lunois began to extend his hand to Aine’s secret bit.</p>



<p>“W-wait sec…! I’m still wet!! Your clothes gonna get wet, too!”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind.”</p>



<p>Despite what Aine was saying, Lunois didn’t seem to be particularly bothered. In this state, she wouldn’t be able to properly muster the strength in her body.</p>



<p>Without being able to resist, Lunois’ finger touched Aine’s secret part.</p>



<p>“Nn…”</p>



<p>Without any hesitation in his movement, Lunois quickly inserted it deep inside Aine’s vagina upon confirming that it was already wet. Wet from having pleasured herself earlier—Lunois probably would never imagine such a thing, though.</p>



<p>Her already sensitive body was instantly aroused with just a little bit of fingering.</p>



<p>“No! Nnh, I’m still, like this…!”</p>



<p>With her legs slightly spread, Lunois’ middle finger was stimulating Aine’s vagina, pushing deep.</p>



<p>Lunois attacked Aine exactly where he thought she would feel good.</p>



<p>Next thing Aine knew, she was limp and surrendering her body to him; simply surrendering herself to the pleasure.</p>



<p>“Fuh, fuh, ahh…”</p>



<p>It was rough since she had just cummed earlier—however, Lunois wouldn’t know that. He was definitely thinking it was for Aine’s sake to finish this quickly.</p>



<p>As if asking it, Aine grabbed the hem of Lunois’ clothes, and Lunois held her hand with his other hand.</p>



<p>“&#8230;!! I’m, cum, ming…!”</p>



<p>Squeezing Lunois’ hand tightly, she made a faint voice. With a small shudder of her body, Aine orgasmed for the second time in just a short period of time.</p>



<p>While breathing so heavily, Aine looked at the finger that Lunois pulled out of her vagina.</p>



<p>Ooze—seeing the stretched love juice, she was suddenly overcome with embarrassment.</p>



<p>“&#8230;D-don’t look. Even though I told you I didn’t want it while looking like this…” Aine protested to Lunois, seemingly in displeasure. And he, simply had an apologetic look on his face.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>



<p>It was now night, and all that could be heard in the forest was the quiet sound of the flowing river.</p>



<p>Next to me was Aine sleeping soundly.</p>



<p>In the end, Aine’s mood hadn’t gotten much better until before sleeping. Although I said ‘hadn’t gotten better,’ it didn’t mean she was angry. It was common for her to be in a bad mood after calming down her heat.</p>



<p>Aine’s mood should be back to normal again by tomorrow morning.</p>



<p>When I took a peek at Aine’s sleeping face, her expression looked so peaceful. I stroke her hair gently, trying not to wake her up.</p>



<p>“Nnh…”</p>



<p>Aine let out a small breath.</p>



<p><em>It seems she’s sleeping well</em>—after confirming it, I quietly got up and walked out of the tent.</p>



<p>Inside the forest was so dark that even only a little moonlight could pass through. With just a normal sight, it wouldn’t be possible to see what might be just a few meters ahead.</p>



<p>In fact, I could barely see anything at all.</p>



<p>However, I’d trained myself to be able to move in such a darkness—to be able to adapt. I should perhaps say that I’d ‘tempered my senses’ in order to be able to move despite not being able to see anything.</p>



<p>I’d just proved recently that I could fight even when I was totally not able to see.</p>



<p>“Now then…”</p>



<p>I left the base and walked alone for a while.</p>



<p>Just as I faced the other side of the river where Aine had taken a bath, I stopped walking.</p>



<p>“—You’ve been waiting for us to sleep all this time, haven’t you? In that sense, you were so close during the day.”</p>



<p>No one to answer me; however, I pulled out the sword hanging on my waist and took a stance.</p>



<p>The presence was erased to the point it was almost imperceptible, but I knew. I sent out a bloodlust to the surroundings, and then several presence ran away—and one large presence began to move.</p>



<p>“!”</p>



<p>The ground behind me rose up. Splitting open the ground, a Glass Frog with its large, round body emerged.</p>



<p>Although I couldn’t fully verify its shape in the darkness, I knew that it was a semi-transparent, large bodied frog.</p>



<p>However, it was about a size larger than the ones I’d defeated in the past.</p>



<p>Without panic, I turned around and faced the Glass Frog. Up until it showed up, I couldn’t get a complete grasp of where it’d been.</p>



<p>It must have mistakenly thought that it was being targeted in response to the bloodthirst I’d purposefully sent to the surroundings.</p>



<p>Even during the day, I’d sensed its presence only for a brief moment—I’d woken up when Aine had been bathing not only because of hearing her voice.</p>



<p>“I knew you were trying to aim for Aine. And thank you for not showing up at that time; or Aine would be worried after all.”</p>



<p>If I were to fight the Glass Frog in front of Aine, it would cause her unnecessary worry. I’d promised her that I wouldn’t keep secrets from her, but—I’d like her to let me off the hook for this.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>The Glass Frog finally moved. I could see its large mouth was slightly opening—it was trying to intimidate its opponent with a loud voice.</p>



<p>I heard that its voice was so loud that it could cause the earth to tremble, and that a human could easily be knocked unconscious when hit by it from up close.</p>



<p>“—Sorry, but I’m not going to even let you make a death throe. It’ll wake her up.”</p>



<p>“!?”</p>



<p>While keeping its large mouth open, the Glass Frog opened its eyes wide.</p>



<p>Where I was standing was on the head of the Glass Frog. My sword, already deeply pierced into the head, was a fatal blow to the Glass Frog. The reason it couldn’t make a sound was because I’d sliced its throat—before I was standing here.</p>



<p>Its large body was wobbling, and slowly, lost strength and fell flat on the ground immediately after.</p>



<p>I sheathed my sword and looked at the Glass Frog.</p>



<p>“By hiding itself, it’s like exposing how slow its movements are. Well, I suppose that huge body alone would’ve been enough to display its strength, but it’s got the wrong opponent.”</p>



<p>The ability to move at that size while leaving almost no trace at all was great.</p>



<p>Perhaps, this level of a monster would have no natural enemies around.</p>



<p>By some possibility, it might’ve been planning to settle here—in that sense, I could say it was great I could subjugate it here.</p>



<p>“Yeah, looks like I’ve got no problem with fighting after all. All right, time to go back.”</p>



<p>I was lucky to be able to get one of the subjugation requests done here.</p>



<p>I turned my back on the Glass Frog and left.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>



<p>The next day—Aine woke up inside a swaying carriage.</p>



<p>“&#8230;? Eh, huh? Why, in a carriage…?”</p>



<p>“Morning, Aine.”</p>



<p>Aine looked to the side and found a smiling Lunois there.</p>



<p>“Lunois, err, what does this…?”</p>



<p>“You were sleeping so pleasantly, so I carried you here without waking you up.”</p>



<p>“Ca-carried… You could’ve just woken me up,” Aine raised her voice.</p>



<p><em>No way</em>, she thought, but it seemed he’d carried Aine from the forest without waking her up.</p>



<p>However, the feeling of ‘he should’ve just woken me up’ in her was greater.</p>



<p>With a wry smile, “sorry. I just wanted to watch your sleeping face a little longer,” Lunois said bluntly without a shred of embarrassment. It was Aine who ended up blushing after hearing Lunois’ words.</p>



<p>However, she could tell somehow from the air around Lunois—<em>I feel like he’s hiding something</em>.</p>



<p>“I-I won’t fall for it. Something happened, right?”</p>



<p>“Not really, nothing happened. You’re just overthinking.”</p>



<p>In response to Aine’s question, Lunois remained composed.</p>



<p>“Don’t lie. Yesterday, you said you wouldn’t keep any secret.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’re right. Then I guess I’ll tell you when we arrive at the next town.”</p>



<p>“Can’t you just say it now?”</p>



<p>“I could tell you now, but I just think it’s better at a place where we can relax.”</p>



<p>“A place where we can relax…? Ah, don’t tell me, you didn’t fight any monsters while I was asleep, did you!? And so you’re thinking I’ll get angry, aren’t you!?”</p>



<p>Hearing Aine, Lunois’ expression turned surprised for an instant, but he quickly resumed smiling, “&#8230;Hahah well, let’s talk later, shall we?” and said evasively.</p>



<p>“You’re being evasive… that means you did, right!? I’ve told you so much you can&#8217;t fight since you’re injured!!”</p>



<p>“Aine, it’s dangerous to stand in a carriage.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it your faul—waah!?” The carriage suddenly jolted greatly, and Aine lost her balance.</p>



<p>Lunois supported her body, and now they were both face to face.</p>



<p>“I’ve told you; it can get shaky.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;’Cause, you’re keeping secrets or something… nnh.” While having a dissatisfied expression, Aine suddenly made a coquettish voice.</p>



<p>She immediately understood what was happening to her body—and then, Lunois was quick to respond.</p>



<p>“This is great. While the carriage is moving, it shouldn’t get exposed even if you&#8217;re making some noise.”</p>



<p>“We-we’re still not done, talking, okay!?”</p>



<p>“Let’s continue the talk after quickly dealing with it.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;! I-I don’t quite agree…!” Aine complained so, but it couldn’t be helped since she was in ‘heat.’</p>



<p>Inside the shaking carriage—Aine’s coquettish voice was echoing, but it wasn’t for long.</p>
