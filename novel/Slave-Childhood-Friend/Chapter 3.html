<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Next morning, without mentioning anything about yesterday&#8217;s night, I was preparing to set out after breakfast. While sitting on the bed, Aine asked me. “Work today?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m thinking of doing one of the requests I got yesterday. Something can be done near the capital… so I guess monster subjugation on the north main road.”</p>



<p>“Monster on the main road… it’s near the capital, but the knights aren’t gonna take it down, huh.”</p>



<p>“I say near, but that place is covered with trees all around. Besides, there are opponents you can’t fight without a degree of ability even if you’re used to fighting. You also got that, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well, guess so. Especially since requests to subjugate monsters are a daily occurrence, too. They’ve even appeared in the royal capital’s underground.”</p>



<p>“Those requests also occasionally come up in the royal capital. Anyway, even adventurers are pretty busy, too.”</p>



<p>“Right… so, umm.”</p>



<p>Aine stumbled on her words, showing a gesture of wanting to say something. Even I knew what she wanted to say—she must be wanting to ask if she could come along.</p>



<p>The ‘heat’ hadn’t come yet today… Going out of the royal capital and heading out to the main road would increase the chances of running into monsters. If she were to go into heat in that situation, it would certainly be dangerous.</p>



<p>However, if we weren’t acting together, until I came back, she would have to wait in constant suffering were she to go into heat.</p>



<p>That was why, I was thinking it was correct to take Aine along.</p>



<p>“Of course, you’re also coming. But, yesterday was the first time you’ve held a sword in a while after all… so I’ll take down the target monster. Other than that, I think I’ll have your help if any other monsters try to attack us.”</p>



<p>“! O-okay. I’ll try not to hold you back, too!”</p>



<p>Aine’s expression turned bright in an instant. At least, she should be able to deal with the monsters near this royal capital without becoming a burden.</p>



<p>If there was a problem, it really was the ‘heat.’ Regarding that, there was also something I got to confirm with her.</p>



<p>“But, I wanna talk about if the effect of your collar were to be active when outside, though.”</p>



<p>“! Y-you’re right. That’s also a problem, doesn’t it.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I’m sorry, Aine, but… umm, we may even have to do something like that outside, but are you, okay with that?”</p>



<p>“It’s hard to say that ‘I’m okay,’ but… it’s a nuisance, isn’t it.”</p>



<p>“Nuh-uh, I’m okay with it; as long as you’re okay with it. Besides, you also feel more at ease when we’re together, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s, right. I guess I’m more at ease that way.”</p>



<p>“Then it’s settled.”</p>



<p>While it was impossible to not care about it, it’d probably also cause a lot of stress to care about it on a regular basis.</p>



<p>Of course, if the ‘heat’ were to come early in the morning at least it wouldn’t come again that day, so we wouldn’t even have to worry about it, though.</p>



<p>Aine and I finished our preparation, and then left the inn to head for the carriage waiting area.</p>



<p>Although generally called ‘royal capital,’ the inside was divided into several towns, and the land was also vast. There were carriages going around inside the royal capital, and you could pay for it to move around to certain designated places.</p>



<p>My destination was the north main road—we got to take a couple of carriages.</p>



<p>Together with Aine, I headed for the north inside the shaking carriage.</p>



<p>“Hey, what kinda monster are we going after this time?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it is some kind of monster named ‘Gray Bear.’”</p>



<p>It was a huge bodied monster with gray fur. Both arms grew thick, and the three claws could easily tear apart even a large tree. Recently, the monster seemed to have moved its territory closer to the royal capital, and there were about three cases of damage just this month alone. It was mainly carriages loaded with food and stuff getting attacked, and several adventurers working around the north main road getting killed.</p>



<p>The request must have been directed to me since there were two A-rank adventurers among them.</p>



<p>The request might go to another S-rank adventurer had I not taken it, but as the guild leader was saying, I got the feeling that many of the other S-ranks had a strong peculiarity.</p>



<p>Although I’d only met with some of them a few times, they all varied from those who wouldn’t take a request unless it was a real national crisis to those who would make daily money from requests that beginners would do on a whim.</p>



<p>In the first place, only few of them would properly respond to the adventurer guild’s summon. I was in the position where I got to do all kinds of jobs because of this, though.</p>



<p>“Since it’s requested of you, it means it’s plenty strong, right?”</p>



<p>“I wonder about that. Well, I guess it’s not like it can be left alone, though.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Don’t push yourself, okay?”</p>



<p>“Hahah, do I look like the type who will?”</p>



<p>“You’re the type who will, you know that?” Aine said with a worried expression.</p>



<p>Not like I planned to overdo myself. At the very least, I planned to withdraw immediately were there to be anything that might endanger Aine’s safety.</p>



<p>But based on the information I’d seen, It was an opponent that even I could deal well with.</p>



<p>In the first place, adventurers recognized as S-rank fell under the class called ‘hero’ even in the country. I supposed it would make for a bad example if you could not win against a single monster appearing in the vicinity of the royal capital all the while that much of your ability was being recognized. But I wasn’t even interested in such a position, though.</p>



<p>Changing carriages, Aine and I arrived near the north main road. After passing through the gate, the main road would continue for a while, but it’d be covered with forest from then on.</p>



<p>Many monsters wouldn’t change their habitat, but a monster would occasionally grow as an ‘individual,’ and the monster that had gotten stronger would change its habitat from place to place.</p>



<p>The prime example of this would be the monster called ‘dragon.’ Many of them, known as the strongest naturally, did not have a fixed habitat to live. The dragon called ‘Wandering Dragon’ was also called so because it changed its habitat in a particularly short period of time.</p>



<p>The target this time was not a monster like a dragon, but a type of monster called ‘Gray Bear,’ few in numbers but there were some examples of its subjugation.</p>



<p>“Then, let’s go. Let’s first try going to the spot where the damage was first done.”</p>



<p>“I’ll leave it to you. I mean, I’m not even familiar with this area. But, how do we search for the monster? If it’s a knight order, it’s the basic to search with a human-wave tactic, though”</p>



<p>“Well, I guess we’ll just have to find it with our feet. There aren’t that many large monsters around here, and maybe we can immediately know from the sound if it’s acting violently.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I guess that’s how it is, huh. I’ve got something similar happening, too.”</p>



<p>The first was to search for the monster—regardless of the rank of the job as an adventurer, everything got to start there.</p>



<p>The first place Aine and I visited was a fork up ahead on the main road. Although it was a fork on the road, one of the paths would lead to a dead end—exactly around here was the location of the first damage.</p>



<p>“A peddler was attacked here. Five carriages, and several mercenaries were hired as escorts. It seems in this case it was so engrossed in the load, so there were some injuries but no deaths. At that point, it was confirmed that it was a monster called ‘Gray Bear.’”</p>



<p>“Does this mean, it’s more about targeting the load than attacking people?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Apparently, most of the load was fish being transported from a seaside town. Especially since the smell of fish is so strong. I’m thinking it went into hiding using that load of food as a reserve.”</p>



<p>A few days later, yet another peddler had gotten attacked. It’d happened a little further down the road, and similarly had been loaded with food, apparently.</p>



<p>And then, the last one to be attacked had been several adventurers. It appeared that they’d suddenly gotten attacked when leaving the path and entering the forest.</p>



<p>Apparently, their original purpose had been to mine the ‘magic stone’ from a cave deep in the forest.</p>



<p>Magic stones were used in many households; for example, the equipment used to draw water was using the magic stone as a source of power. It also often came out as a request for adventurers; and probably including the A-rank adventures, they’d taken a large number of procurement requests.</p>



<p>As a result, only two people survived. The strong ones, including the A-rank adventurers, had stayed on site and never come back.</p>



<p>It didn’t mean their corpses had been recovered, but according to the surviving adventurers, they most likely wouldn’t survive.</p>



<p>“That means, won’t its den be around the cave?”</p>



<p>“I can say that’s the most likely case. Aine, I’m thinking of entering the forest now, but we’ll continue on while making stopping points to be on the safe side”</p>



<p>“Got it. That’s also something the knights often do.”</p>



<p>Aine and I walked out of the main road and into the forest.</p>



<p>The footing was a little bad because of the overgrown vegetation, making it hard to proceed. I continued to walk ahead while trampling the grass to make it easier for Aine who was walking behind me.</p>



<p>Inside a forest, you would have to be especially alert to your surroundings. The visibility was often poor, making it not possible to even see several meters ahead.</p>



<p>Not only the front, but you’d also have to focus your attention to the right, left, and the back. I’d be fine even just on my own, but right now I was acting with the two of us together.</p>



<p>“Aine, keep watch on the rear. I’ll watch the front.”</p>



<p>“! Okay.”</p>



<p>In case of acting in a party with multiple people, it’d be a good division of roles. With Aine, I wouldn’t have to worry about entrusting the rear to her. She may not be an adventurer, but as a knight, she must have experiences in these kinds of places.</p>



<p>In fact, Aine was more alert towards the surroundings. The first was to find a more open space and make it the initial base.</p>



<p>I called it a ‘base,’ but we wouldn’t be pitching a tent to stay the night.</p>



<p>At the current situation, it should be the correct one to leave any large luggages there and start searching the area. But, right now I was not carrying any particularly large luggage.</p>



<p>The things we would do was maybe lighting a fire so that we could have a simple mea—</p>



<p>“Aine.”</p>



<p>“Nn, I know.”</p>



<p>I stopped my feet and called Aine’s name, and she replied back.</p>



<p>I could feel the presence of something watching over here from a little distance—<em>four… no, five, huh</em>.</p>



<p>“Looks like small monsters. Be on guard.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Carnivorous?”</p>



<p>“Both you and me aren’t carrying any food, so around here it’s probably Bell Wolfs. It’d be certain if we could hear barks, though.”</p>



<p>When I touched the sword hanging on my waist, Aine touched that hand of mine. When I looked back, Aine was looking at me with a serious expression.</p>



<p>“Leave it to me. I can do it on my own if it’s just five.”</p>



<p>That must be Aine wanting to prove herself ‘to be useful.’ The Bell Wolf was a black furred, wolf monster that acted in a pack of up to ten.</p>



<p>Its characteristic was that it’d use a ‘bell-like’ bark to coordinate with its group—it was not a bark in actuality, but a bumping of the stone-like organs located in its throat.</p>



<p>Besides the chirping of birds could be heard in the forest, a reverberating ‘clink’ sound could be heard from close by—<em>looks like it’s Bell Wolf no doubt.</em></p>



<p>Their one-on-one fighting ability wasn’t that high, and even a D-rank adventurer should be able to take it down.</p>



<p>However, if it was in a pack, a certain level of ability was needed. …With someone about as strong as Aine, I believed there shouldn&#8217;t be a problem, though.</p>



<p>“Alright. I’ll be keeping watch on the surroundings; I’ll leave it to you, Aine.”</p>



<p>“Thanks. Then I’m going—” Aine kicked the ground at the same time.</p>



<p>With a quick movement, she dashed towards the direction of the pack; a quick and agile movement ignoring any vegetation and such. Aine pulled out the sword hanging at her waist and swung it.</p>



<p>“—”</p>



<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/fj3t83094.jpeg"></img>



<p>First one. It was cut down without being able to respond to Aine’s movement at all.</p>



<p>Two of them immediately moved towards Aine, who’d moved suddenly. They tried to pinch Aine from the left and right, but Aine stooped low and delivered a revolving strike—the two who had jumped at her fell flat on the ground lifelessly.</p>



<p>The remaining two must have comprehended Aine’s strength. And whoosh, they kicked the ground and vanished. It was settled within a few seconds.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Phew.” Aine let out a small exhale and brushed off the blood on her sword. It was a pretty, no-waste movement.</p>



<p>“That was really great. Looks like I can leave the monsters around here to you, Aine.”</p>



<p>“Sure, you can leave it to me. You’d have to fight the Gray Bear anyway, so you should save strength as much as possible. If you like, I can also walk in front, you know?”</p>



<p>“Nope, I’ll take the front. You don’t know where the cave is, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Then you don’t have to arrange the footing so much, okay?” Aine said, following my words, but then added so.</p>



<p>It seemed she’d noticed that I’d been fully arranging the footing. Not like that much was enough to be a burden, though.</p>



<p>“That’s not enough to make me tired, you know?”</p>



<p>“Just leave it; please just do like you always do. I’ve told you, right? I’m not gonna be a burden.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;In that case—okay, I’ll go as usual.”</p>



<p>After our first battle, Aine and I proceeded on our way again. After once again confirming Aine’s abilities, we continued our search for a place to make our base.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


			
<p>After proceeding inside the forest for a while, Aine and I found a place to be our base point. This must’ve been used often by other adventurers… There was a trace of bonfire.</p>



<p>Surrounding it, suitable rocks had been placed as chairs. <em>Let’s just go straight to using this place</em>.</p>



<p>“After a short rest, we’ll head to the cave. It shouldn’t be that far away if it’s from here.”</p>



<p>“Nn, okay.”</p>



<p>“Aine, are you feeling all right?”</p>



<p>“I’m basically in healthy shape. …It’s a hassle since it comes rather suddenly, though.”</p>



<p>For the time being, Aine’s condition seemed to be fine. If only the ‘heat’ would come right now when on a break like this… What a hopeless thing to think about.</p>



<p>For her, that was nothing but a burden—but, the more time passed, the more likely the heat would occur.</p>



<p>Currently it was still before noon, but since my reunion with Aine, the ‘heat’ basically would happen from noon through evening.</p>



<p>It was still the second anyway, and according to Aine, it could happen any time in ‘one day.’</p>



<p>For example, it seemed that there had been times when she would go to ‘heat’ at night and then go to heat again before morning.</p>



<p>So, I would take care of it as quickly as possible as long as I was with her.</p>



<p>I had no desire to have any wicked thoughts at the sight of such Aine.</p>



<p>“I want you to tell me right away if it’s getting tough. This is the spot to return to after all; I’m thinking of setting up a simple tent just in case.”</p>



<p>There was a single-person tent that could be folded up small in my luggage. I had only one tent since we were going to make it a day trip anyway, but we would probably need a larger tent in case the investigation would’ve to be done over several days.</p>



<p>“That means, doing it in a tent, right?”</p>



<p>“Well, and since there aren’t any people around here, I think making some noises or two also gonna be all right, though.”</p>



<p>“!, i-it’s not like I make noises because I want—I mean, I don’t even make that much noise!” Aine denied so with her face blushing slightly.</p>



<p>She clearly hadn’t been able to keep her voice down, but I didn’t intend to make a mention of that.</p>



<p>“It’s just a ‘what if,’ alright.”</p>



<p>“I-I see. That’s fine, then.”</p>



<p>“Anyway, I’m setting up a tent for tha—!”</p>



<p>My words were interrupted by a loud thud sound. It was coming from a direction where the cave was.</p>



<p>Aine and I made eye contact and immediately started running.</p>



<p>“Aine! You stand by in the back. Don’t step forward even when encountering an enemy!”</p>



<p>“I-I know. I’m not gonna force myself.”</p>



<p>It was a few dozen minutes walk from our base point to the cave.</p>



<p>I thought of running while matching Aine’s movements, but her movements were as agile as she had shown earlier even with all the vegetation. To be honest, it really helped that far from having to match her, it was totally not a problem even if I went a bit more serious.</p>



<p>When we came out into another opening in the forest, what came into our view was a big cave entrance—and a large-bodied monster.</p>



<p>“Stop.”</p>



<p>“!, that’s a Gray Bear…”</p>



<p>“Yeah. But, it’s acting weird.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Eh?”</p>



<p>Thud—it took a step forward, and its body was swaying and staggering.</p>



<p>It didn’t mean it noticed us. On a second look, I could see crushed claws on its big arms and scars throughout its body. And just like that, the Gray Bear slumped forward and fell down.</p>



<p>“Wha…? Wh-what does this mean!?”</p>



<p>“Aine, you stay here.”</p>



<p><em>Maybe inside the cave or in the bushes nearby—in any case, someone has crushed a Gray Bear single-handedly.</em></p>



<p><em>I can’t see it well from here, but it looks like there&#8217;s a big wound on its back—a single cut from a blade, huh.</em></p>



<p>I began to get closer to the fallen Gray Bear. At that moment, I felt a presence from behind.</p>



<p>“Aine! In the back!”</p>



<p>“!!” Aine turned around in response to my voice. Standing there was a giant with a blood-stained axe—it was Dill the adventurer.</p>



<p>“<em>Haahh, haahh.</em>”</p>



<p>“You—!!” At that moment, Aine dropped to her knees on the spot. At this timing, I understood what happened to her.</p>



<p>Dill brandished his axe. I understood that he was trying to attack Aine.</p>



<p>I kicked the ground and dashed—even faster before he could swing down his axe, I held Aine and fell back. In that instant, I swung my sword and struck a blow.</p>



<p>I grazed Dill’s left shoulder causing it to bleed, but Dill moved forward without seeming to care about such an injury.</p>



<p>“Lunois… Styler, I will, kill you…!!!”</p>



<p>“Dill… You are…”</p>



<p>Something was clearly weird.</p>



<p>However, I had no means to stop him who had entered a battle state; because I understood that his real ability was at least close to that of an S-rank adventurer if he had defeated Gray Bear single-handedly.</p>



<p>“Lu, nois…!”</p>



<p>With ragged breathing, Aine yelled out a worried voice. I lightly touched that hand of hers and said: “No need to worry—it’ll end immediately. That’s why, can you maybe close your eyes?”</p>



<p>“Eyes…?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, please believe me.”</p>



<p>“Nnh, I… believe you.”</p>



<p>Aine closed her eyes just as I’d told her. I let out a small exhale and looked at Dill with narrowed eyes.</p>



<p>Regardless of the reason, he was once again standing in front of me. And then, he was trying to hurt Aine.</p>



<p>“It’s the third time now—Dill.”</p>



<p>“AAAAAAARRRRRGG!!!”</p>



<p>Raising a warcry, Dill kicked the ground. The ground was gouged out, and clouds of dust fluttered. A proof of an abnormal leg strength—however, none of it mattered.</p>



<p>“AAAARRH—Ar?”</p>



<p>Dill’s voice broke off. Fresh blood flew all around. A strike as we passed each other—his neck, I cut it off with my sword.</p>



<p>The body that had lost its head collapsed forward with the momentum. The axe flew off in a different direction with great force.</p>



<p>Shing—I shook the blood on my sword and headed back to Aine’s side. She, with her body shaking, “Lu, nois…?” opened her eyes to check. I gave her my usual smile.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll set up the tent when we get back; I want you to relax and rest.”</p>



<p>And then, I held up Aine. I left that place behind without looking back to the fallen Dill.</p>



<p>Taking Aine with me, I returned to the base point.</p>



<p>I tried to quickly get the tent ready for her, who looked like she was having a hard time—just in case, I thought of setting up a place for her that would at least block the view, even though there was no sign of people in the open.</p>



<p>“What about, that guy…?”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about that now. That aside, I’ll get the tent ready immediately.”</p>



<p>However, Aine grabbed the hem of my clothes as I tried to set up the tent.</p>



<p>“I-it’s… fine, just, touch me.” I nodded quietly as I was asked so.</p>



<p><em>It must be pretty tough for Aine</em>—Aine went to kneel and lowered her underwear just slightly. Ooze—I could see her love juice stretching out like a thread.</p>



<p>I took off my gloves; I reached my right hand to Aine’s private place while supporting her body with my left arm.</p>



<p>I touched the already wet Aine’s private place, and gently slid my fingers into her vagina.</p>



<p>“Nnh, fuhh, uwh.”</p>



<p>Aine clinged to my body while her body was trembling in small tremors.</p>



<p>Perhaps, while doing this act, she would have to have something to hold on to.</p>



<p>Although the power was feeble, I knew that she was desperately clinging to me.</p>



<p>With her head down, Aine was trying to suppress her voice.</p>



<p>“Nnh, nnnh, kuh, no…!”</p>



<p>Aine’s voice leaked out everytime I moved my fingers, but still, she didn’t let out any loud voice. Maybe Aine minded about the talk regarding her voice earlier—only at a time like this did I get to sense her hating-to-lose part.</p>



<p>There was no one around. The best possible way to relieve Aine of her current suffering was to make her cum.</p>



<p>“Aine, I’m gonna move it just a bit harder.”</p>



<p>“!, nahh, noohh…! Ahh, uwhh, nnnhh….!”</p>



<p>I could feel Aine’s body jolting up.</p>



<p>While supporting Aine’s body seeming about to fall over, I quickened the movements of my fingers inside her wet vagina.</p>



<p>Her wet, so slippery vagina was sucking my fingers as if in response.</p>



<p>Even so, I proceeded to increase the pace little by little—before long, Aine, who was looking down, looked up, and, “no, noo… Don’t, do, it… so fast, like thaaat…! My, my voice, gonna, get oout!!”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to worry about that.”</p>



<p>“Nahh, nooh, it’s emba… rrassiiiing!!”</p>



<p><em>If you were to tell me that with moist, upturned eyes</em>—<em>even I don’t know myself if I can keep my cool forever.</em></p>



<p>She, who was even drooling sloppily, was looking at me as if she was always desiring me.</p>



<p>“&#8230;If it’s embarrassing, I can do something to stop your voice from going out, though.”</p>



<p>“N, nnh, p-please!! Auh, c-close, my mouth…!”</p>



<p>In response to Aine’s words, I gently exchanged kisses with her; at a place where there was no need to suppress her voice, just to distract her from her embarrassment.</p>



<p>As our tongues intertwined, Aine’s vagina tightened more around my fingers. And just like that, I moved my fingers, tracing her vaginal walls.</p>



<p>Aine’s eyes opened wide, and she tried to pull her hips back in a disliking manner.</p>



<p>“Nnnh, fuhh, nn, uwh…!”</p>



<p>However, I held on tightly to Aine’s body to keep her from escaping.</p>



<p>Aine was also clinging to me, with only her hands tightly wrapped around my back. And finally she, with her body shaking greatly, reached orgasm as we kissed.</p>



<p>“—!! Fuh, fuh… nn, fuhh…”</p>



<p>Her body was convulsing, and love juices were dripping from her thighs. Drip drip—the sound of water wetting the ground also reached my ears.</p>



<p>I slowly pulled back my lips and then faced Aine.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You okay?”</p>



<p>“Hahh, hahh, nn… I’m, okay.”</p>



<p>Despite looking embarrassed, Aine also stared back at me. I continued to support her body until she calmed down for a while.</p>



<p>After letting Aine rest for a while, I decided to go back to the scene. I had Aine stand by at the base, and I went to check it out myself.</p>



<p>Once Aine was back in shape to some extent, she wouldn’t lag behind the monsters in this forest. Now that the Gray Bear had been defeated… I supposed there was no need to worry so much.</p>



<p>Near the cave entrance—the Gray Bear’s den was definitely there. And the one who had taken down that Gray Bear had been Dill, an A-rank adventurer.</p>



<p>There was no doubt that Dill had inflicted the wound on the Gray Bear’s back—at least, with his previous ability, it shouldn’t have been an opponent he could take down by himself.</p>



<p>There was no sign of his companions, and it was somewhat strange for him to be in this forest alone.</p>



<p>I touched Dill’s fallen, headless body—the wound on his arm, amazingly, had almost closed up.</p>



<p>“Is this… a magic potion or something being used? Maybe having a blood sample would be a good idea, just in case.”</p>



<p>Whatever had happened to Dill, I had no idea about it either. However, the state he had been in when coming to attack me hadn’t been normal. Cutting his head off since he’d appeared in front of me again… hadn’t been the only reason.</p>



<p>Simple because he hadn’t looked like an opponent that could be easily dealt with.</p>



<p>A man, whose arm I could easily cut off until yesterday, in merely one day, was healing his wound and coming to attack me—to be honest, it was a pretty abnormal situation.</p>



<p>It was a strengthening through some kind of magic or drugs… even I could tell.</p>



<p>Although I was not well versed with medicine or potions, if Dill had become stronger, it would have been something along those lines. There was something that seemed to be healing his arm and suddenly making him stronger.</p>



<p>“&#8230;For now, looks like recovering the body is impossible. And if we go back, there’s a chance the monsters will eat it to pieces anyway.”</p>



<p>Taking a blood sample was also because of that reason. I would also be taking back the proof of the Gray Bear subjugation, but it wasn’t me who had taken it down.</p>



<p><em>Let’s first explain the situation to the guild, and ask for help for investigation regarding this incident.</em></p>



<p>I left Dill’s body and stood up—in response to the presence I suddenly felt, I quietly touched the sword hanging on my waist.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Who is it; the one over there.”</p>



<p>No particular answer was given to my question. After a while, the presence went to disappear like a mist. After a moment of silence, I took my hand off my sword.</p>



<p><em>I don’t know who it is, but somebody&#8217;s watching me—</em>the moment I understood that, I immediately ran off to Aine’s side.</p>



<p>Although the presence hadn’t disappeared in the direction where Aine was, there was always the possibility. Once I returned back in a hurry, Aine greeted me with a slightly surprised look on her face.</p>



<p>“W-what’s wrong…? In a hurry like that…”</p>



<p>“No, I’m just worried about you, Aine.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t a lie—fearing the possibility of danger to Aine, I told her so accordingly. But I wasn’t going to tell the reason for it, however.</p>



<p>Hearing it, Aine looked just a little flustered.</p>



<p>“I-is that so…? I’m already all fine here, you know?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s good to hear. Let’s report to the adventurer’s guild about Dill’s case. And about the Gray Bear, too.”</p>



<p>“All right. It’s leaving kinda a bad aftertaste, but for now, the request was completed—is like that okay, I wonder?”</p>



<p>“But in the end it was Dill who took down the Gray Bear. Well, there are no more dangerous monsters around here… I think that’s how it should be reported.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Couldn’t we just say you’re the one who took it down?”</p>



<p>“If you’re in my shoes, would you do that?”</p>



<p>“Well, I won’t, though…” Aine replied in a slur.</p>



<p>She was also an honest person—whatever the reason, she wouldn’t do such a thing like stealing achievements. I didn’t know if it’d be alright to take the credit from Dill, but at least, I supposed we could say that this matter was ‘settled.’</p>



<p>“Alright, then let’s go back before it gets dark. That’s it for today’s work.”</p>



<p>“Nn, okay. I’ll go pack things up.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, please do.”</p>



<p>And then, Aine and I were getting ready to go back. And for the result, although I couldn’t say that the request was completed, the threat about the Gray Bear was gone. …In a way, though, it’d turned out to be a very concerning incident.</p>



<p>This was how Aine and I ended our first work together.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>


<p>In front of the cave where the dead bodies of the Gray Bear and Dill were laid, several monsters appeared. They showed up to feast on dead flesh.</p>



<p>As the monsters approached the dead bodies to check, a large wall suddenly appeared in front of them—the monsters were surprised and ran away from that place.</p>



<p>The wall was shattered, and from the inside emerged a giant man about four meters tall. And his arms, they looked even larger in contrast to his large frame. He put his fists composed of rocks on the ground and looked at the fallen body of Dill.</p>



<p>He slowly walked up to the body—a small rumble occurred each time he put his hands on the ground.</p>



<p>“This guy, useless. Killed by a man like that.”</p>



<p>“—Although you say ‘a man like that,’ that&#8217;s the adventurer who bought Aine-san, you know? The name is Lunois Styler… Undoubtedly an S-rank adventurer, isn’t he? Fufu, truly a strength that can be called a ‘hero.’ Did you see? That swordsmanship.”</p>



<p>A man, named Domiro, appeared from behind the giant named Gremarev. With a smile, and not even taking notice of Dill’s dead body, he asked Gremarev.</p>



<p>“I don’t see. I, only hear sound.”</p>



<p>When Gremarev replied, Domiro, to further confirm, “then, how was it with the ‘sound’?” asked so.</p>



<p>Gremarev replied with a slight gesture of thinking. “Wind, I heard cutting sound. Certainly quick. But, just that.”</p>



<p>“You can’t be underestimating your opponent, Gremarev… It’s your bad habit, isn’t it. Even earlier, you were noticed when you got just a little bit closer, right?” Domiro said in a slightly reproaching way. Noticing the presence of Gremarev hiding underground—from Domiro’s point of view, that was abnormal enough.</p>



<p>Even if someone was good at detecting presence, that was far beyond.</p>



<p>Not only did he have a high ability with the sword, but he even had a high ability to search for enemies, which was a threat.</p>



<p>“Certainly, that’s surprising. I, also killed my presence. If noticed, don’t hide and fight him head on?”</p>



<p>“Fighting head on is of course also not a problem, but let’s make it so that we can get a sure win.”</p>



<p>“Sure win… You got, a plan?”</p>



<p>Asked by Gremarev, Domiro chuckled, and showed a suggestive smile.</p>



<p>Most importantly, he could tell by watching Lunois’ actions—that his weakness was right next to him.</p>



<p>“Fufu, it’s something very simple. We can just aim at the weak point… nothing special. It seems that Aine-san is a very important existence to him, you know?”</p>



<p>Domiro and Gremarev—the two mages began to move. And the destination was the royal capital where Lunois and Aine were staying.</p>
