<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Aine’s body was thrown out, rolling on the ground.</p>



<p>There was a huge explosion sound, but Aine’s body hardly felt any impact.</p>



<p>While not being able to put in any strength as she wished for being in heat, Aine tried to raise her body somehow.</p>



<p><em>Lunois tells me to close my eyes when it turns into battle—that’s most definitely because he doesn’t want to show his appearance.</em></p>



<p><em>But,&nbsp; this is not the time to follow those words</em>. Aine immediately made sure to check on Lunois’ state.</p>



<p>Several buildings were blown away by the explosion—and amidst the screams coming from everywhere and people running away, Lunois was there.</p>



<p>“Lu, nois…!” she called her name, somehow managing to squeeze out her voice. Seeing him standing straight with his back facing her, Aine was relieved.</p>



<p>And in front of Lunois, there was a single man standing; wearing a hat pulled down over the eyes and a black suit. While having a gentle smile, “my oh my, Gremarev has been very helpful,” he looked at Lunois and Aine and spoke. “The meaning of pairing with him is surely because then something like this can be pulled off. Sacrificing himself, he managed to do that much damage to you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You did it, didn’t you? I can’t believe you’d drag your companion into a magic attack.”</p>



<p>“And it has paid off well, no?”</p>



<p>“Lunois… what does that mean?” Despite talking to him, Lunois didn’t look back. It was as if he was hiding something from Aine.</p>



<p>Drip drip—seeing red drops dripping down, Aine desperately tried to raise her body and approach Lunois.</p>



<p><em>This is not the time to mind my body’s ‘heat’</em>—having a bad premonition, Aine simply called out to Lunois. “Come on, look here…!”</p>



<p>Driven by frustration, Aine approached to draw closer to Lunois, who was standing in front of her.</p>



<p>Even so, while still facing the front, Lunois gently spoke to Aine.</p>



<p>“Aine… don’t worry and just wait there. I’ll end this immedi—”</p>



<p>“There’s just no way, you can!!”</p>



<p>With a trembling body, Aine stood with her sword as a support.</p>



<p>She tugged on Lunois shoulder and was at loss for words—at those injuries she caught a glimpse of. All over his body were lacerations and rocks piercing him as if being gouged out.</p>



<p>Worse than that was both of his eyes—bleeding was flowing from both of them like tears. …Right now, Lunois couldn’t see with both of his eyes.</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/efnoi3wo.jpeg"></img>


<p>“No, way…”</p>



<p>She grew pale. The reason Aine, who was together with Lunois, had not suffered any injury was because he had protected her—she immediately understood it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I just didn’t want to cause you any unnecessary worries.”</p>



<p>“Not making me, worry… but, you got such, injuries…” Her voice was shaking.</p>



<p>Aine did not know what she should do. And before them, the man moved closer.</p>



<p>“A dying swordsman who has lost both his eyes, and a slave who can’t even move properly… Fufu, I’m sure myself alone would suffice. Oops, my apologies. I am called Domiro. Pleased to make your acquaintance… That said, that might not even be necessary.”</p>



<p>The man—Domiro courteously gave a slight bow. Although not knowing his motive, he and Gremarev, who had been caught in the explosion earlier, were aiming for Aine.</p>



<p>Immediately, Aine stood in front of Lunois.</p>



<p>“What, do you want…!? Why, me…?”</p>



<p>“Indeed. Perhaps you have the right to know about it. At any rate, you’re wearing that collar after all.”</p>



<p>“Col, lar…?”</p>



<p>Domiro pointed at Aine’s bottom of the neck. Aine touched the collar—that cold, seemingly iron-made object was an existence simply there to torment Aine even now.</p>



<p><em>Does that mean, there’s a value in this collar?</em></p>



<p>Although Aine didn’t know it, Domiro daringly laughed after seeing that.</p>



<p>“Fufu, it’s one of those special sealing tools, you see… What we desire is what’s inside that collar, and to begin with, we were looking for a vessel to be put on with that collar, you know?”</p>



<p>“What are you, saying?”</p>



<p>Aine couldn’t immediately understand what Domiro was saying.</p>



<p>However, at least, there was a worth in just aiming for Aine’s collar—at the same time, it became clear that the reason it’d been put on Aine was to take out its content.</p>



<p>“Fufu, just being able to put on that collar makes it worth it, you know? And we just have to wait and see… I never would have thought you’d be sold to an S-rank adventurer, but it seems I’m able to recover you safely.”</p>



<p>“Re, cover…?”</p>



<p>“Yes, if there’s no significant change, I plan to remove that head of yours and just recover the collar. For now, may I have you come with me?”</p>



<p>Smiling, Domiro took another step closer. Aine took a step backwards, trying to protect Lunois. And towards Aine, “if you would obediently come with me, I wouldn’t mind sparing him, you know?” Domiro declared.</p>



<p>“&#8230;!”</p>



<p>She couldn’t imagine that proposal would be true.</p>



<p>However, the current Aine couldn&#8217;t fight properly. Lunois also lost both his eyes—and he could even barely stand. It should be impossible for Aine to rely on the current Lunois.</p>



<p>“Aine… don’t listen to him,” Lunois spoke up. Trying to protect Aine, he tried to get her to step back.</p>



<p>Even in his current state, Lunois was trying to prioritize Aine’s safety without any hesitation—however, Aine resisted. With desperate effort, Aine stood in front of Lunois.</p>



<p>“Aine…?”</p>



<p>“Don’t, say that, idiot. Just what you’re going to do, in that state…?”</p>



<p>“I will fight, I’m going to.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be stupid!!” Aine raised her voice. Lunois showed a surprised expression.</p>



<p>Right now, her burning up body was inconsequential. For Aine, the only thing she could feel was worry for Lunois.</p>



<p>“There’s no way I can let you fight right now, right!? You’re protecting me, and getting hurt! If… if only…! If only I just, wasn’t here…!”</p>



<p>Aine fell into self-loathing. On her reunion with Lunois, all she could think of had been that she didn’t want to be seen like this. However, Lunois had been kind to Aine—still the same as ever, but stronger than ever. And to such Lunois, Aine had ended up relying on him.</p>



<p>“If, I go with you… you’ll spare Lunois, won’t you?”</p>



<p>“Why yes, of course. I have no interest in a dying man.”</p>



<p>With her sword as support, Aine tried to walk away from Lunois&#8217; side. However, Lunois grabbed Aine’s arm, not letting go.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Let go.”</p>



<p>“Aine.”</p>



<p>“Let me go!!”</p>



<p>“Aine, listen to me.”</p>



<p>“Just let me g—”</p>



<p>“AINE!!” Lunois pulled Aine’s body and grabbed both of her shoulders. The bleeding on his body still hadn’t stopped even now, but even so, Lunois showed a gentle expression and said: “you should have heard it. That guy, he easily plans to take even your life.”</p>



<p>“That’s, fine.”</p>



<p>“As if that’s fine. I said I will protect you. These are the injuries I received for that.”</p>



<p>Those words of Lunois were something that penetrated Aine’s heart. After all, Lunois had gotten hurt to such an extent in order to protect her.</p>



<p>“I… don’t wish, any of that. I don’t want you… to get hurt like that.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I apologize for that. But, that’s why… I want you to be by my side. Or else, I’ll lose sight of what I was protecting you for.”</p>



<p>“Even if, you told me that…”</p>



<p>Aine did not know what she should do. Even for Aine, of course she would want to be with him. However, she wouldn’t allow herself to say it.</p>



<p>Towards the bewildered Aine, “&#8230;yeah, I might’ve been saying something hard to you,” Lunois spoke. “Even so, I swore to protect you. Not to anyone… to me, myself. But, that might’ve been a mistake—that’s why, I will swear to you, right here, right now. I will protect you. And I will not give up my life for it. I swear, that I will live and protect you. So, believe me.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;!” Aine couldn’t respond to Lunois’ feelings. Despite Lunois saying to that extent, the reason why Aine couldn’t respond to it was—after all, for the current her, she could only imagine that It would hurt Lunois even more.</p>



<p>“No, I don’t want it… I don’t want you to get hurt more than this… and yet, I want to believe you. What, should I do…?” Aine said, as if she were pleading.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lunois’ expression did not change. Gently, he touched Aine to soothe her. “Then, I want you to watch this time,” Lunois spoke up like so to Aine, who was wishing for an answer.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Watch?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I want you, to watch me fight. I’ll make that as a proof—that I, have the power to protect you.”</p>



<p>Lunois gently made Aine sit, and faced Domiro once again.</p>



<p>If not stopped, with both eyes losing its sight and wounds all over his body, Lunois would now fight the enemy.</p>



<p>Despite all this, Aine was unable to move; it was because Lunois had said, ‘I want you to watch me fight.’ Lunois’ determination had reached Aine.</p>



<p>Seeing such Lunois, Domiro sighed in astonishment.</p>



<p>“Oh really, it turns into ‘this’ in the end. I wasted time waiting, you know?”</p>



<p>For Domiro, someone like Lunois who was in a state where it wouldn’t be weird for him to collapse at any moment was probably not even considered as an enemy. An overwhelming sense of complacence could be felt from him.</p>



<p>“Yeah, looks like I kept you waiting a bit. But, it’s not like you were waiting, weren’t you? From the start, you planned to kill me after all,” Lunoise stated clearly. It was a powerful statement through and through.</p>



<p>“Oh my, it seems I’m not trusted.”</p>



<p>“That’s just obvious. But I want you to be grateful—that life of yours, it got extended for just a little bit as a result, right?” Lunois said to provoke him.</p>



<p>Looking amused, Domiro’s mouth warped into a smile.</p>



<p>“Pff—HAHAHA! What a funny joke. Or perhaps, do you really think you can win against me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I promised her I’ll absolutely win.”</p>



<p>“Kuh, fufu… This is just wonderful. To win against me in that state, that is. However, it seems you have considerably looked down on me. By the way, just how you plan to win against me I wonder? Even though you can’t even see with your eyes!”</p>



<p>Domiro took out a single ball from his pocket. The magic engraved on there was probably the same explosion magic from before.</p>



<p>And he threw that towards Lunois, who couldn’t even see.</p>



<p>“LUNOIS!” Aine screamed out his name.</p>



<p>In his current state, he shouldn’t even be able to detect the lightly thrown ball.</p>



<p>Indeed, not only Domiro, even Aine believed so.</p>



<p>The ball that had been thrown at him, Lunois cut it off—without hesitation in a state where he couldn’t even see, he even sliced off the resulting blast.</p>



<p>Unhurt, he pointed his sword at Domiro.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?” Domiro watched the spectacle with a surprised expression; the same for Aine. As if he could see with both eyes, Lunois faced Domiro straight on, his sword set at the ready.</p>



<p>“I am also called ‘The Second Sword Saint.’ To be blunt, I’ve no interest in such a title… However, it’s not just a rumor that I&#8217;m being called so—don’t think you can win against me just because you took my sight,” Lunois clearly proclaimed in front of Aine.</p>



<p>Aine’s gaze was fixed on Lunois’ back. Since he had promised her, Aine would also respond to that promise, by making sure to watch the fight with her eyes.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


			
<p><em>I can feel my grip on my sword. I also can both smell and hear—then I can fight. I can sense where the enemy is.</em></p>



<p><em>Even fighting in the dark was something I’ve experienced many times before. It often happens when you’re an adventurer, so I trained myself to be able to fight in the dark</em>.</p>



<p><em>As long as my body can move, I can fight. I can fight to protect Aine behind me.</em></p>



<p>I readied my sword and pointed it towards the man—Domiro.</p>



<p>I was listening to what he was saying; that he was scheming something by using Aine; and that he was making Aine suffer by attaching the collar for that scheme. I’d already decided what I should do—<em>I will kill this man to protect Aine</em>.</p>



<p>“—”</p>



<p>Stomping my feet on the ground, I closed the distance between me and Domiro. Even without sight, I could tell the distance between me and him.</p>



<p>Domiro then reacted to it and retreated back. I kicked the ground even harder to accelerate.</p>



<p>Domiro’s movements were clearly an attempt to get away from me and keep the distance. He must be thinking that I’d lose him if he could just keep up a certain distance.</p>



<p>In fact, that was not a mistaken decision.</p>



<p>In order to not lose Domiro, I’d have to not let him get away.</p>



<p>“Kuku, you look so desperate. You’ve just surprised me just a little bit earlier, but looking at those movements, aren’t you perhaps pushing yourself pretty hard?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I really am pushing myself. However, it’s not a problem if it’s just to bring you down.” With these words, I took a big step forward.</p>



<p>“!!” I could tell that Domiro was surprised. Instantly closing the distance between us, I swung my sword.</p>



<p>The sound of an empty space being cut reached my ears—but, there was a slight sensation that the tip of my sword had grazed something.</p>



<p>It had most likely slightly cut Domiro’s clothes.</p>



<p>“It seems it’s not a lie that you can fight even when you can’t see. Then… how about this!?”</p>



<p>What Domiro had scattered was the ball that had caused the explosion earlier—I could tell that his primary way of attacking was a magic that could control explosion; by carving a magic crest on an object or body to create an explosion.</p>



<p>Very simple once you knew it. I dodged and weaved my way through the scattered balls, and even used the blast to speed up.</p>



<p>Once again, I closed the gap between us.</p>



<p>“&#8230;!”</p>



<p>Domiro didn’t release the ball even though I was approaching very close to him. And I could understand why.</p>



<p>“So at this distance, the big explosion like the one earlier can’t be used? I mean, You will get caught up in it after all. However, a small explosion enough to kill a human won’t be able to kill me, you know?”</p>



<p>I swung my sword at a point-blank range. There was a solid response this time—it was Domiro’s left arm that I’d cut off.</p>



<p>“Guh, urgh… Certainly, it seems I must not be afraid, to get caught up in it!” Domiro grabbed that left arm and threw it towards me.</p>



<p><em>He plans to explode that left arm, huh—but, there’s no need to avoid it if it’s just that</em>.</p>



<p>I stabbed the left arm and diverted the trajectory to the side. The blast passed to the rear, avoiding me.</p>



<p>“Wha…!?” Domiro shouted in astonishment. He must’ve been surprised that even an attack that sacrificed his own arm was easily deflected.</p>



<p>This fight had already been decided the moment I’d managed to cut off his arm.</p>



<p>“As I thought, it looks like you’re trying to keep the blast from going in your direction. Even though you can make the call to sacrifice your own arm, you can’t make the call to risk your own life. You’re a weak human, someone who can’t think of anything but using someone else.”</p>



<p>I put the tip of my sword right on Domiro’s neck. We both stopped moving, and were now facing each other.</p>



<p>In this state, I could cut off his head at any time.</p>



<p>“This is a checkmate. I told you, right? If it was just to bring you down, just this much of a handicap was nothing.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Really, I was so surprised. To think that I would be driven to a wall by a dying swordsman.”</p>



<p>“Or maybe if you’d fought with the determination to sacrifice yourself, it might’ve turned into a slightly different battle. However, I would be the one to win either way.”</p>



<p>“What a lot of confidence. Speaking of which… the reason you haven’t immediately killed me was, because you have something to ask, was it?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ve got questions to ask you.”</p>



<p>Domiro’s aim was Aine’s collar. Just why had he taken the trouble to pursue Aine, who had fallen into slavery, going to be sold?</p>



<p>In the first place, was something being hidden by that collar? …There was a lot I got to confirm.</p>



<p>Hearing my words, Domiro smiled slightly.</p>



<p>“Fufu, is that so? However—”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to worry. This time, I’m keeping Aine waiting, and I don’t have any intention to forgive you—I’ll kill you immediately.”</p>



<p>Interrupting Domiro’s words, I slashed. I sent off his head flying, and then delivered another strike to his body. Towards the end, I knew that Domiro was going to turn his own body into a bomb—it was only when he’d recognized his defeat that he resorted to that move.</p>



<p>For this reason, I cut down Domiro’s body before that magic was completed. I could feel the magic that he had accumulated in his body dissipating.</p>



<p>Domiro’s now lifeless body tumbled on the ground, and I let out a small sigh. I sheathed my sword and walked back to Aine, who was waiting behind me.</p>



<p>Although I couldn’t see her expression, as calm as possible, “see? I told you so, didn’t I?” I spoke to her.</p>



<p>“&#8230;For someone like me, you’re being so absurd, like this…”</p>



<p>“Please don’t belittle yourself. I’ve told you I will fight to protect you. Just this much isn’t absurd or anything. That aside, we first have to relieve your—”</p>



<p>“T-that can, wait for, later… We have to, quickly go to the hospital!!”</p>



<p>Even Aine must barely be able to stand. However, she was desperately trying to support my body to take me to the hospital.</p>



<p><em>Certainly, I’m also at my limit. Let’s just listen to Aine here.</em></p>



<p>I left that place behind while being supported by Aine. Actually, it might be better to just stay here to explain the situation, but right now I got to do something with these injuries and relieve Aine’s ‘heat.’</p>



<p>For now, I’d succeeded in taking down the danger looming over Aine, the Empire’s Mages; though, there was also something they were aiming for in Aine&#8217;s collar… And that fact, too, I was able to grasp it.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>



<p>There were many injured and sick people receiving treatment at the Registhea Grand Hospital normally. I’d also used the hospital several times, but this was the first time I’d have to be hospitalized.</p>



<p>Fortunately, my both eyes weren’t completely broken, and I could already see with my right eye. The left eye seemed to be going to take a little longer, so it was now covered with a bandage.</p>



<p>And as for body injuries, there were no life-threatening ones—when I returned to the hospital room I was admitted to after finishing the treatment, Aine was sitting on a chair waiting for me.</p>



<p>She just kept her head down silently, without even looking in my direction.</p>



<p>I let out a small sigh and sat down on the bed. This must be the treatment for an S-rank adventurer as I’d gotten admitted to a single room, even though I hadn’t especially requested it. But to be honest, this would make things convenient.</p>



<p>“Aine, can you come over here?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m, fine.”</p>



<p>Aine must also know what I was planning to do.</p>



<p>She replied to me and showed a gesture of refusal. Aine should’ve been enduring it for quite a while now. And in the time when I’d been receiving the treatment, she’d simply just been continuing to be in heat.</p>



<p>Only this was something she shouldn’t be able to do anything about. And then, it was something I’d have to relieve.</p>



<p>“Just come over here.”</p>



<p>“Today is, fine. I can, hold it, so…” she said with a fragile voice and her body shaking—there was no persuasiveness in those words at all. However, I could tell clearly that Aine was worried about me. …And at the same time, she must be feeling reserved.</p>



<p>Perhaps she was still blaming herself that it was her fault that I’d gotten injured.</p>



<p>“I’m worried about you. I don’t think I can rest easy with you like that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;! That way of putting it is, sly.”</p>



<p>“Haha, in any case, it’s not an injury you need to worry about.”</p>



<p>“It’s not about how much, the injury is… Because of me, you got—”</p>



<p>“Aine,” I called her name, interrupting her words. I tried to be as admonishing as possible, however… my tone might’ve been a little strong.</p>



<p>After a brief period of silence, Aine slowly came over to me and sat down next to me; with her gaze still not pointed towards me.</p>



<p>I touched Aine’s skirt to check.</p>



<p>“A-as expected, right now is…”</p>



<p>“It’s all fine.”</p>



<p>“Ah—”</p>



<p>When I flipped up the skirt, I could see Aine’s underwear wet with her love juice. Her secret place was so wet that it showed through it.</p>



<p>Aine quickly pressed down on her skirt.</p>



<p>“Y-you’re mistaken. I did endure it, but as expected, can’t… To think that, I’m getting wet, even at a time like this…! I don’t want you to, scorn me…” she told me, as if trying to squeeze it out.</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but sigh—<em>as I thought, that’s what she’s concerned about</em>.</p>



<p>“Do you think I’m gonna scorn you for something like this? That’s actually a little more shocking, though.”</p>



<p>“T-that’s not it! I know that you’re not someone like that! But…”</p>



<p>Aine was stuck for words. I took Aine’s hand and smiled at her.</p>



<p>Finally, Aine looked towards me.</p>



<p>“Lunois…?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I get what you’re trying to say. But, I’m not gonna hate you or anything for such a reason. If anything, I should be the one apologizing. If I had handled it better, I wouldn’t have caused you any unnecessary worry. Frankly, there’s a part of me that always wanted to look good in front of you, you know?”</p>



<p>“Is that, so?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I wonder if you would scorn me then?”</p>



<p>“! I-I’m not gonna scorn you! Because, Lunois, I like you—ah,” tightly grabbing my hand, Aine declared clearly. I could instantly see her in fluster for having said so much.</p>



<p>And I, hadn’t meant to make her say that much.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sorry.”</p>



<p>“Ah, uwh… Y-you’re right. Being told something like that, it’s just gonna be a bothe—”</p>



<p>“N-no, that’s not what I mean. It’s an apology for ending up making you say it. Something like that is, umm… I just think it’s something the man should be saying.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Eh?”</p>



<p>Aine, who had looked away, looked at me again. towards her, who looked like she could start crying at any moment, I took a small breath, “I like you, too,” and continued to ease the tension. “Umm, probably, I think since long ago. To tell you the truth, I don’t really understand the feelings of love, you see? But, my feelings of wanting to protect you is real—that’s why, I think I like you, too.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean, ‘I think’? Even I, can say that I like you.”</p>



<p>“Hahah, in that sense, I guess it’s uncool after all.”</p>



<p>“Nope. From my view, you’re always so cool, you know—”</p>



<p>With those words, Aine leaned forward. Two lips touched, and then quickly separated.</p>



<p>With her face blushing, Aine almost lost her balance. She was pushing herself pretty hard with a body that couldn’t muster any strength.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I think that’s the first time you’re the one giving it.”</p>



<p>“I-just thought that was the right moment… Didn’t, like it?”</p>



<p>“Nah, I’m really happy. It’s just, you’re also already at your limit, right? I’m gonna touch you now.”</p>



<p>“W-wait.”</p>



<p>When I tried to touch Aine’s private place, she grabbed my hand and stopped it. Perhaps something in her mind was still holding her back.</p>



<p>While her gaze swimming around, Aine showed an expression of wanting to say something. And yet, she seemed to be worrying about whether she should say it.</p>



<p>I asked Aine reflexively. “&#8230;What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“I, uhh… I’m thinking, it’s not the right time to say this at a time like this, but umm…”</p>



<p>“Don’t be reserved about it. I’ve told you I can’t rest easy leaving you like that.”</p>



<p>“Uw, Lunois, your injuries… is it already, okay?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, even getting hospitalized is an exaggeration. I’ve even gotten injured worse than this. Something like this doesn’t even count as an injury.”</p>



<p>I could hardly feel any pain in my body already. If what Aine was worried about was the injury, she wouldn’t have to worry about it.</p>



<p>Hearing my reply, Aine spoke in a fading voice, still hesitating. “Then… I want to, do it, with you.”</p>



<p>“What do you want to do now?”</p>



<p>“I’m saying, I want to have se…<sub>sex</sub>, with you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;? What do you really want to do with me? I can’t hear you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;! It-it’s noth—”</p>



<p>I suddenly pushed Aine down as she tried to gloss it over.</p>



<p>Since it was so sudden, Aine showed a surprised expression; to her, I smiled gently.</p>



<p>“I heard you said you wanted to have sex with me… but did I hear wrong?”</p>



<p>“!! Y-you heard it after all!!”</p>



<p>“Hahah, sorry. When you’re being shy, you see, you just look so cute.”</p>



<p>“D-don’t say that…!! And you’re currently injured, so if you don’t want—”</p>



<p>“It’s not at all that I don’t want to. Sorry for teasing you… I was also thinking of wanting to do it with you.”</p>



<p>When I said it all to her, Aine was flustered again and trying to hide her face.</p>



<p>However, not being able to hide it, she turned her face away while only hiding her mouth with her hand; only her gaze was directed towards me.</p>



<p>It was always like this—the sight of Aine was all too sensational. I started to take off my own clothes as I undressed Aine.</p>



<p>Today, we’d confessed to each other… and then, we were about to head to our first night together.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>



<p>I laid Aine down on the bed and spread her legs. Although the lights were dimmed, Aine’s wet secret place looked glossy under the light.</p>



<p>As Aine stirred about, she hugged a nearby pillow. Despite hiding her face, her moist eyes were peeping at me.</p>



<p>“It-it’s my first time, so…” Aine said, quiveringly. Just like the time when I’d first seen it—the sight of her was very charming, sensational, and beautiful.</p>



<p>When I touched Aine’s vagina that was so wet that fingering wasn’t necessary, her body shook a bit.</p>



<p>“N, nnhh…”</p>



<p>It must be because she’d been enduring it for so long—Aine looked like she’d end up cumming right away, but she seemed to be enduring it, hugging the pillow tightly.</p>



<p>I brought my already erect penis closer, slowly moving it to touch Aine’s vagina.</p>



<p>To be honest, this would also be my first time—however, in order to not worry Aine, “I’m gonna put it in, okay?” I spoke to her as softly as I could.</p>



<p>I asked for confirmation, but there was no response from Aine. But, she seemed to be waiting solely for that moment.</p>



<p>Slowly, I inserted my penis into her vagina. Aine’s inside, which seemed to suck even on two fingers, gave a very clamping sensation even by just inserting it.</p>



<p>As tears were amassing on her eyes, Aine let out a small voice. “Nnh, fhu, uw…”</p>



<p>I’d been inserting my fingers while trying not to injure Aine’s hymen—but today was different. I’d been gentle when inserting it, however, I slipped it all the way in when breaking the hymen so the pain wouldn’t last. Together with a small bleeding, Aine’s body jolted slightly.</p>



<p>“Ah, cumm…”</p>



<p>The strength squeezing the pillow got stronger. Aine did lightly cum, and I could feel it through her vagina. Yet, Aine still gave an enduring look.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to endure it so much, you know?”</p>



<p>“Haah, hahh… B-but… f-for my first time, I want to, cum together, with you…” Aine said such a thing despite showing an entranced face and drooling, unable to endure it. <em>How admirable and adorable you are, my childhood friend</em>.</p>

<p>I grabbed her hands as she was trying to endure it, and intertwined our fingers.</p>



<p>I put the pillow aside, and now was facing Aine.</p>



<p>“Noo! Don’t look, my face, too much!”</p>



<p>As expected, she’d been hiding her face because she was embarrassed. However, to not look at the sight of such a cute Aine was not an option for me.</p>



<p>When I moved my hips to poke in slightly, that alone was enough for Aine to react in a big way.</p>



<p>“Uwh, ahh! Nn, nngg…!”</p>



<p>“Aine, you’re very adorable, you know?”</p>



<p>“D-don’t say, such a thing, now!!”</p>



<p>“I’m saying it because it’s a fact. I’m gonna move, so try to endure it, okay?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Uwh, nnh.”</p>



<p>With Aine’s will in consideration, I gave her a reminder.</p>



<p>When I slowly moved my hips, I felt the softness of the inside of her vagina and the clinging sucking sensation.</p>



<p>While feeling the pulsing of her body, I began to speed up the movement of my hips.</p>



<p>“Ah, ah, uwahh, ngcum, ming… uwh…!”</p>



<p>The sight of Aine desperately enduring it was endlessly arousing, and the hard clamping of her vagina felt extremely good.</p>



<p>I’d also been holding it back for so long, so I was getting sensitive.</p>



<p>I felt the feeling wanting to ejaculate gradually getting stronger—as I went to drape over Aine, I quietly exchanged kiss with her.</p>



<p>“—Nnn!? Nn, fhu, nggh, uuuuuwwh!!”</p>



<p>Aine’s eyes opened wide, and her body shook greatly. As expected, the inside of her vagina got tighter when I kissed her, making it feel better. When I kissed her now with my tongue intertwining hers, I could feel Aine’s body reaching the limit of its endurance. I separated our lips and clasped Aine’s hand tightly.</p>



<p>“I’m also, gonna, ejaculate…! Aine!!”</p>



<p>“M-me too, already…! Cumming, ah, ahn… aaaah!”</p>



<p>With a jolt, Aine’s body sprung up greatly, and my penis throbbed. I shot out my accumulated sperm into her, and it leaked out of her vagina like an overflow. As we both were breathing deeply, I brought my face closer to Aine once again.</p>



<p>“Aine, I’ll say it once again. I like you.”</p>



<p>“Me, me too. I like you, I love you…!”</p>



<p>We exchanged a kiss once again—that day was our first time having sex; that one round felt all too good, and then we fell asleep cuddled up close, satisfied with each other.</p>



<p>Thus with Aine, I’d crossed the line.</p>
