<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>I quickly returned to the inn I’d booked nearby and paid the innkeeper additional fees. Together with my childhood friend—Aine.</p>



<p>Without having had enough time to really talk with Aine, I’d promised that I’d pay the remainder of the money to buy Aine later, after having had proved to the slave merchant that I was an ‘S-rank’ adventurer.</p>



<p>I’d thought that he would overcharge, but he was upright… putting it that way was weird, but I supposed he was a decent slave merchant.</p>



<p>She was expensive, still, but nothing I couldn’t afford. It was more or less… enough to deprive me of most of my earnings, though.</p>



<p>When we returned to the room, I immediately had Aine sit on a chair, sitting face to face with me.</p>



<p>“Errr, for starters… Long time no see.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>Aine didn’t reply to my words. She kept her head down with a gloomy expression.</p>



<p>I’d bought her some clothes to cover herself with on the way, but she was shaking, gripping the hem of those clothes tightly. &#8230;I couldn’t help but wonder how I should approach the conversation.</p>



<p>This was our reunion after a long time of not seeing each other—the truth was, there were a lot of things I’d want to talk about.</p>



<p>Some part of me also would like to boast that I’d become an S-rank adventurer.</p>



<p>However, right now was not the time for that. Just as I was thinking: <em>I have to hear what she has to say first</em>—</p>



<p>“I didn’t want to be seen like this. Just by you&#8230;” Aine said in such a manner while biting her lips.</p>



<p>It was the same when she’d been held up in the carriage—not trying to see me in the face, looking like she was trying hard not to be seen one way or another. &#8230;Certainly, she must not want to bee seen that she had become a slave.</p>



<p>But, I was more worried about Aine.</p>



<p>If I hadn’t come across her, she’d have been sold to some unknown person, and I might never have been able to meet her again. So, I clearly told her: “I’m happy, you know; I get to meet you again. It’s in this way, but—”</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m not happy at all! To think that I became a slave, and have you buy me, I… I’m just causing trouble&#8230;!! It’s much better if we never—”</p>



<p>“Aine.”</p>



<p>“!!”</p>



<p>When I called her name, her body trembled with a start. &#8230;Moving gently to her side, I admonished her as gently as I could.</p>



<p>“Everything’s alright. You don’t have to worry about money and stuff. I’m so happy, that I can meet you again.”</p>



<p>“Uuwh, uuwh… I-I’m sorry, I-I—”</p>



<p>Aine was crying, trying to stifle her voice.</p>



<p>I could ask her about it later. For now, I’d start by making her feel at ease.</p>



<p>On Aine’s neck was attached a collar, one of the symbol of being a slave.</p>



<p>Shackled with a chain, it was depriving her of her freedom.</p>



<p>As I was thinking: <em>is there any way I can get it off…?</em>; Aine stopped crying and pulled away from me.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry… and, thank you.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s fine. And so… umm.”</p>



<p>“I know. About how I became a slave, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah, if you don’t want to talk about it—”</p>



<p>“No, I’ll talk. I mean, you came to save me, and you’ll know about it if you look it up anyway.”</p>



<p>Even though Aine was averting her gaze, she continued her words as if she’d made up her mind. “I became a knight in <em>Laveira Empire</em>—did you also hear that from the village?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that one time when I returned. I’ve been thinking about going there eventually, though&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Then you’re lucky you didn’t come. Right now in that country, the power struggle is escalating. It’s a domestic dispute. I became a knight in such a country—I’m a real idiot, aren’t I? I’m not interested in that kind of thing, but my evaluation as a knight was way too high for the so-called commoner. That’s why… they accused me of the ‘knight killing’ that happened during an expedition.”</p>



<p>“Knight killing, you say?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I heard several people including a fort’s superior officer were killed. I wasn’t there, but the other knights testified they saw me do it. Even if I denied it, the witnesses were too many—and so, I was jailed as a criminal.”</p>



<p>—Aine had been betrayed by her comrades and degraded from a knight to a slave—</p>



<p>It was too unreasonable, but I supposed the Empire’s internal affairs were that tense.</p>



<p>She might not have been interested in such a dispute, though.</p>



<p>“If it’s you, you could&#8217;ve just run away, couldn’t you?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Running away from a crime I didn’t do, I hate it. That’s why I waited for a chance to explain myself—but, in the few days of being jailed, it was immediately decided that I would be reduced to slavery.”</p>



<p>Probably, they knew that there was a chance she might run away.</p>



<p>Also, the last time I’d seen her was about four years ago, but her ability was high, to put it bluntly.</p>



<p>The current me thought so, so probably an ordinary knight wouldn’t be a match for her. &#8230;This was what she had become because she was upright.</p>



<p>After finishing her story, Aine smiled deprecatingly. “What do you think…? It’s just so stupid, isn’t it. Someone like me, really isn’t worth savi—”</p>



<p>“Aine, don’t make me repeat myself. There’s no need for you to feel that way. That’s exactly why I bought you. I’ve judged that you just have that much worth.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;!! Hey, since when can you talk like that, really.”</p>



<p>Hearing my words, Aine showed a slightly surprised expression.</p>



<p><em>I said something rather embarrassing…</em>. That was indeed the case when I thought about it, but first and foremost it was for Aine.</p>



<p>As if I had made up my mind, I replied to her words. “Yeah, actually… I’m an S-rank adventurer now. I worked really hard to catch up with you, you know.”</p>



<p>“Ooh, an S-rank—wait, S-rank…!? You are a first-class adventurer…!?” Aine said in a loud voice, blasting away the gloomy atmosphere from earlier.</p>



<p>“Y-you’re too loud.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I-I’m sorry. But… right. You are, an S-rank… I also wouldn’t have expected that either.”</p>



<p>Apparently, Aine hadn&#8217;t known.</p>



<p>Although the Kingdom and the Empire were a neighboring country, they were quite the distance apart.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like I knew all the adventurers active over there either, and she probably had been busy with her job as a knight as well.</p>



<p>“Yeah, so for now, you don’t have to worry about money. And then, about this collar—”</p>



<p>“! Th-this is…!!”</p>



<p>Aine quickly touched her collar and distanced herself from me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8230;<em>As expected, maybe she didn’t want to talk about the collar, the symbol of a slave</em>—meanwhile, Aine started to talk evasively while averting her gaze.</p>



<p>“Th-this is… umm, called, ‘Sexualification Collar’.”</p>



<p>“‘Sexualification Collar’&#8230;? So there are different kinds of slave collars?”</p>



<p>Hearing my question, she nodded.</p>



<p>“You can’t take it off?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;If it’s easy to take off, a slave might quickly riot, right? So that you can’t do things like that, it can’t be taken off. In a normal way, at least.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see. Then we have to find a way to—what’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Nn, no, it’s, nothing… nn,” suddenly Aine replied in such a way with a blushed face.</p>



<p>No matter how I looked at it, it didn’t look like ‘it’s nothing.’ The sight of her trying to resist something while writhing her body was strangely sexy, making me avert my gaze reflexively.</p>



<p>“Th-there’s no way it’s ‘nothing.’ Just what’s going on…?”</p>



<p>“Hah, nnn… at times, like this…!”</p>



<p>Looking reproachful, Aine’s breathing was becoming rough. To the point it made me think: <em>could it be some kind of curse or illness?</em></p>



<p>“&#8230;Are you not feeling well? Let’s get a doctor for now.”</p>



<p>“I, I’m, okay!!”</p>



<p>“No way you’re ‘okay.’ I’m worried about you. I’ll be back quick—”</p>



<p>“It-it’s this collar’s, fault!!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;This collar’s?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah… nahh, th-this collar… this ‘Sexualification Collar’ is, used for… sex, slaves&#8230;” Aine continued her words while panting roughly. While looking at me with moist eyes, “once a day, I’m forced, nn, to go into, heat&#8230;” Aine said it straight in a desperate voice.</p>



<p>—I finally understood the situation Aine was in—</p>



<p>She was right now… no, probably since a while back. She was being forced into a state of being in heat.</p>



<p>I laid Aine on the bed, who was unable to move without my support.</p>



<p>Still breathing roughly, she was looking at me with a blushed face. &#8230;I’d never seen Aine like this before.</p>



<p>Looking at her state, it must be quite rough. I’d like to relieve her right away, however, “will it get better in time…?”</p>



<p>“N-not time… err, i-it won’t do, unless I do, naughty, things,” Aine said, quickly turning her face away. &#8230;It was quite the nasty collar someone had put on her.</p>



<p>I suppose it was made so you could be brought into heat under any circumstances.</p>



<p>Aine looked to be desperately enduring it, but she was being forced into a state of arousal by the magical effect. She probably wouldn’t be able to just endure it.</p>



<p>Surely, she might not be able to stand the fact that I was watching her in this state.</p>



<p>I turned my back towards Aine. “I will, umm… be out for a bit. Errr, so you can, by yourself—”</p>



<p>“By myself, won’t, do… I need, someone to, nn…!”</p>



<p>I spontaneously turned around again at Aine’s voice, which sounded like she was pleading with me.</p>



<p>Moist eyes, and blushing cheeks. The rough breathing made my childhood friend look so sensual to no end.</p>



<p>I’d never seen Aine like that before—I thought I’d never, but now that I saw the current her, I felt like I was being tested as well.</p>



<p>Letting out a small breath, I sat down next to Aine.</p>



<p>When she said ‘I need someone,’ I supposed there was no choice but for me to do it. Right now I was her master after all.</p>



<p>“Aine… so, can I?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nn”</p>



<p>Whether it was a reply or a pant, I didn’t know, but Aine flipped up her clothes herself without saying a word.</p>



<p>—When her secret area, which was not even wearing any underwear, was revealed, it was already wet with her love juice. And then, when that beautiful skin came into my view, Aine hid it with her hands as if she’d noticed something—</p>



<p>“I-it’s not that it’s not, growing, I-I shaved it…!”</p>



<p><em>&#8230;</em>I didn’t ask about that.</p>



<p>However, Aine must’ve noticed it and then hid it. Of course, when we were kids, we’d had at least naked times together—but now that we were both grown up, we hadn&#8217;t got the chance to see each other. Not like there had been any either.</p>



<p>And she’d fallen into slavery, was made into heat forcibly, and now she was hiding her lady parts in embarrassment.</p>



<p>If I were to be honest, it was so hot—however, she might not like the idea that I thought that way either. So, it was necessary for me to handle it calmly.</p>



<p>“Aine, can you move your hands for me?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230;uwh.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay; It’s very beautiful.”</p>



<p>“No, d-don’t, say that, stuff like that…!”</p>



<p>I meant to compliment her, but Aine glared at me with an incredibly embarrassed expression.</p>



<p>Reluctantly, I forced her hands away. Perhaps the current Aine had no strength to resist, so I could easily move her hands away by just gently holding her hands.</p>



<p>I could see her twitching and quivering vagina. Aine’s body was also trembling as if she was frightened.</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2021/11/drhrtjsxe.jpeg"></img>


<p>Holding the gloves I was regularly using on my mouth, I took them off and I gently touched Aine’s lower part.</p>



<p>That alone was enough to make Aine’s body spring up greatly.</p>



<p>“Niihh!?”</p>



<p>“! S-sorry!” I instantly apologized. In the first place, I never had this kind of experience.</p>



<p>Aine shook her head from side to side and hugged the pillow that was nearby. While hiding her face, she looked at me and said: “it-it’s fine.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Eh?”</p>



<p>“If it’s you, Lunois, it’s fine; as you like, touch it…?”</p>



<p>—I’d never seen my childhood friend showing such a meek gesture like this—</p>



<p>It must be hard for her, too… Although she must have such a feeling, I felt that I had to respond to her feelings more than anything else.</p>



<p>I touched her vagina with my fingertip and gently opened them. Both the area of the folds and the clitoris were a beautiful pink.</p>



<p>“It’s fine, with, just, fingers. I-if I cum, I’ll get better&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Got it. Please bear with it for a bit.”</p>



<p>“Nn, nnh, hyahh!?”</p>



<p>Stroking her, I touched her private parts.</p>



<p>While thinking: <em>I wonder what to do to make her feel good…</em>; I checked for her reaction. The pillow had completely changed its shape, perhaps because she was hugging it so strongly.</p>



<p>Trembling, she looked so fragile to no end, and yet, very sexy.</p>



<p>Stroking her vagina as gently and tenderly as I could, I proceeded to insert my fingertip.</p>



<p>With a jolt, Aine’s body greatly sprung up.</p>



<p>“Naahh!? Wa-waiiit! B-be more gen, tle&#8230;”</p>



<p>I thought I was being gentle, but Aine’s reaction was strong.</p>



<p>&#8230;Either she was getting quite sensitive, or she was sensitive to begin with. The inside of her vagina was quivering as I continued to stick in my finger.</p>



<p>She was already wet, so my finger slid in.</p>



<p>“I’m, still, a, virgin… so, that’s why; that’s why, the finger, until deep iiis&#8230;”</p>



<p>Under this circumstance, she was still a ‘virgin.’ If the current her were sold as a sex slave, perhaps that would be where they’d found the worth in her.</p>



<p>A virgin young knight—there were some people who’d prefer it.</p>



<p>I complied with her words, stroking my finger inside her vagina and touching her clitoris with my thumb as well.</p>



<p>Again, Aine’s body sprung up greatly.</p>



<p>“Hiih, ahh, no, I’ve told youu, to be gentleee…!”</p>



<p>“I’m already being gentle enough, you know? Aren’t you just sensitive, Aine?”</p>



<p>“Wro, wr-wrong! I’m, not, a dirty, girl…!”</p>



<p>Seeing her no longer able to talk cohesively anymore, I couldn’t seem to contain my arousal either.</p>



<p>However, to insert myself into her here—surely it would be wrong.</p>



<p>With just my fingers, I kept touching her until she came.</p>



<p>Before long, Aine’s body trembled greatly, “nn, hiih, ah, AAAHHH!!” and went limp and weak, and stopped moving. When I pulled away my hand, a sticky thread of her love juice was pulled.</p>



<p>For the time being, her heat seemed to have settled down—But, Aine, who couldn’t move and was with tears in her eyes, seemed to be struggling to keep her rough breathing under control for a while.</p>



<p>I, too, took a small, deep breath and calmed down my heart. &#8230;Having bought her meant that I’d have to do this kind of thing every day.</p>



<p>For a while, Aine was lying on the bed without saying a word.</p>



<p>&nbsp;I, too, sat back down on the chair and turned my back to her and started to think.</p>



<p><em>Speaking of the first thing I could do would be to take her collar off somehow.</em></p>



<p><em>Although inevitable, it shouldn’t have been Aine’s intention to be forced into it.</em></p>



<p>As I was in my thoughts, I could hear the sound of her getting up coming from the bed with a creak.</p>



<p>When I looked back at her, a pillow came flying at my face.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Don’t look, yet.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sorry.”</p>



<p>“Ah, uwh… umm, I’m the one, who should apologize. Even though, I’m not really in a position, to talk, like this,” awkwardly, Aine said such a thing.</p>



<p>I took a deep breath once again and placed the pillow on the table.</p>



<p>Aine was still looking embarrassed and averting her gaze—it must be hard to forget about that act that had just happened. However, we must talk about what was to come.</p>



<p>“Let’s see, for now, I’ll find a way to get that collar off you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;This?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. You hate it to be that way forever, right? From now on—it’s inevitable, but your… umm, I’d have to help you with it. I’m sure you probably don’t wanna keep living like that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>My words were met with silence from Aine.</p>



<p>While looking to be hesitating, she put her hand over her mouth and, “it’s not like, I hate, it.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“—!! I-it’s nothing! Anyway, if you’re going to take it off then, yup. I think I wanna find a way to. But, I don’t wanna trouble you, so&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Aine, don’t think you’re troubling me, please.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Even if you’re like that, I think I am!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Even if you are, alright. You can’t even act independently as it is, can you? Or maybe, you want to have someone else take care of it?”</p>



<p>“Th-that’s… in the first place, I can’t, do that, though.”</p>



<p>“Nn, you can’t?”</p>



<p>“I mean, my current owner is you. You put your magic power into the collar, right?”</p>



<p>“Ah, yeah. It’s necessary for the contract he said—don’t tell me.”</p>



<p>When I heard those words, I realized the truth.</p>



<p>By putting my magic power into her collar, the owner was now me.</p>



<p>So, in the event that she went into heat because of the collar—that meant I’d be the only one who could do anything about it. &#8230;In that case, I’d have to help her anyway.</p>



<p>“Then, there’s no choice but to rely on me, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“That’s, true… but doing that kind of thing with you every day, is a bit&#8230;”</p>



<p>Aine’s eyes were swimming around. As expected, she was also a girl—she must not like to have someone who was not her lover touching her precious parts.</p>



<p>However, she’d have to put up with that for a while.</p>



<p>“I’ll try to make it as quick as possible. In addition, I’ll also do my best to get the collar off soon. I’m an S-rank adventurer now. So, I want you to believe me.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I-it’s, not like I don’t believe, you.”</p>



<p>“Then, I take it you&#8217;re okay with me?”</p>



<p>“I get it. In any case, I’m a slave you bought after all. It’s not like I have a choice,” Aine said, turning her gaze towards the window.</p>



<p>For the time being, it seemed I’d gotten the OK from her.</p>



<p>Our current goal was decided—the first step was to take off her collar.</p>



<p>If we could do just that, I could have Aine’s freedom back. Until then, I’d have to force her to endure it, though.</p>



<p>”Alright, for now, best regards, Aine.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Best regard, Lunois.”</p>



<p>And in this way, Aine and I were reunited and became master and slave.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


		
<p>Although we might not be able to immediately return to the relationship we once had, I hoped that eventually we’d even be able to have a match again.</p>



<p>“Alright, then I’m gonna go out for a bit.”</p>



<p>“!! Are you, going somewhere?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll be back quickly,” I quickly replied when I saw Aine’s expression looking somewhat lonely.</p>



<p>Since she would likely not like it if I pointed that to her, I left the room after simply saying that.</p>



<p>I planned to go to the place of the slave merchant and pay for the remainder of the money to buy her.</p>



<p>&#8230;And then, there was one more thing I’d like to confirm.</p>



<p><em>If this guy was the one who put the collar on her… let’s first try asking him if he knows how to release it. Calm down, me. Killing is surely not gonna be a good idea, alright.</em></p>



<p>&#8230;Because surely, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to forgive the one who’d done that to her. Admonishing myself, I left the inn, leaving Aine behind.</p>



<p>After dropping by the ‘adventurer’s guild,’ I went to visit the slave merchant.</p>



<p>Basically, I had them make it an installment for the high paying requests that I’d completed.</p>



<p>When reaching an S-rank, you’d be able to have such flexibility.</p>



<p>Originally, the ranks of adventurers had ranged from E to A, with A being the highest. And then a higher rank, the S rank, was added a few years ago—currently, there were only a few of them active in this country. And as a result of being one of them, my face was quite well known even in town.</p>



<p>The slave merchant was a man I’d never met before, but he knew about me the second time I met him. &#8230;Probably, he’d gotten the information from one of his customers.</p>



<p>I was not that tall and had a little long-ish black hair; giving off such a feel of someone you could find anywhere, but as an adventurer, it seemed to stand out instead. I used to get mistaken for a girl when I was a kid, but not so much anymore—still, I’d been told that I was androgynous, though.</p>



<p>I didn’t even come on strong to the slave merchant, who were addressing me humbly.</p>



<p>Simply as a customer, I paid for the slave I’d just purchased and asked about her collar in a natural way.</p>



<p>According to the slave merchant, he’d merely bought Aine as well—and at that time, she was already wearing the ‘Sexualification Collar.’</p>



<p>I didn’t know much about slaves, but that collar seemed to be pretty rare and expensive. Not many people were able to create tools with magical effects, even if they were ‘mages.’</p>



<p>Although there were people who could make simple tools to make slaves obey orders, when it came to adding further magical effects, they were limited, he said.</p>



<p>He said the quickest way was to have the person who created it release it, but he didn’t seem to know whether that was even possible or not.</p>



<p>In other words, there was no progress so far. As for whoever put the collar on Aine, I’d probably have to ask her myself about it.</p>



<p>The fact that Aine knew the name of the collar, meant that she must also know the person who put it on. &#8230;The slave merchant came from the Empire, so no doubt they’d be from the Empire, though.</p>



<p>“&#8230;But, it doesn’t look like Aine would wanna go immediately, though.”</p>



<p>That was what I was worried about. Even not asking about the collar to her directly was because I didn’t want to make her remember anything unpleasant.</p>



<p>As expected, I also couldn’t propose going to the Empire just immediately after our reunion.</p>



<p>I wanted to immediately make her free, though… Actually, I’d have to repeat ‘that’ again if I didn’t set her free.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>Having almost recalled it, I involuntarily held down my eyes and sighed.</p>



<p>&#8230;Her bashful sight, and the pleading look on her face; all very adorable.</p>



<p>Even though Aine must be in great hardship, I ended up thinking such a thing.</p>



<p>“For now, let’s go back.”</p>



<p>The purchasing of Aine had ended peacefully. And now, although she’d still be under the position of a slave, she’d be able to more freely under me.</p>



<p>Regarding the daily ‘heat,’ she’d just have to put up with my felp for a while.</p>



<p>As I was heading towards the inn, I spotted a bakery on the way. I remembered how she’d deliciously eat the bread that my mother often made. Not that it was ‘baiting with food,’ but I wanted to at least try to cheer her up somehow.</p>



<p>And as for me, I also got a lot of things to talk about with Aine anyway. After buying some for me and some for her, I headed to the inn.</p>



<p>Thinking: <em>If her taste hasn’t changed, Aine should prefer sweet bread</em>; as I walked back to the front of the room, I could hear some voice coming from the inside.</p>



<p>“&#8230;? Ai—”</p>



<p>“Nn, no… Lu, nois… nh.”</p>



<p>“—”</p>



<p>Instantly, I stopped moving on the spot; because I knew right away that this was something I shouldn’t be listening to. Quietly backing away from the front of the room, I let out a small breath.</p>



<p>“Weird.”</p>



<p><em>Weird. Aine’s heat should’ve been taken care of earlier somehow.</em></p>



<p><em>And yet, inside the room right now, she’s masturbating. Perhaps, it might be that I was inadequate.</em></p>



<p><em>No, but her heat certainly should’ve settled down…</em></p>



<p><em>For now, let’s make happy loud footsteps on the way back to the room.</em></p>



<p>Thus, I backed away from the door; and put it into action. Thud thud—as I was returning back while making such an unnatural sound, I could also hear the sounds of panicked movement coming from the room.</p>



<p>Just in case, I knocked on the door.</p>



<p>“Aine, It’s me… I just got back.”</p>



<p>“Com, c-come, come in.”</p>



<p>&#8230;Hearing a very obviously flustered reply, I entered the room.</p>



<p>With a slightly flushed face, Aine was staring at the window, not at me. Wanting to freshen up the mood, I showed the sack in my hand to Aine, and said: “Err, I bought some bread, want some?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I-I’ll have some. It’s also been a while since I’ve had real bread.”</p>



<p>I handed the bread to the honest Aine, and decided to have my now completely late lunch.</p>



<p>And then, after finishing our meal, Aine and I just stayed in our room. I originally came to the royal capital because of a job, and it wasn’t like I’d decided to take it either.</p>



<p>In the end, because of her, I’d ended up withdrawing money from the adventurer’s guild only.</p>



<p>As I remained seated on the chair, she moved to the bed again. &#8230;<em>Now then, how should I go about this?</em></p>



<p>In fact, after a long time of not seeing each other like this, I had no idea what to talk about. And there was also the ‘act’ from earlier, making it just so awkward.</p>



<p>In the past, at times like this, Aine’s cheerful personality would’ve made it easier to talk, but as expected, I wouldn’t be a man to put my hope in that.</p>



<p>“Umm—”</p>



<p>“Did you, come here for adventurer’s job?”</p>



<p>“Ah, yeah. That’s right, though.”</p>



<p>Just as I was about to start talking, Aine started talking.</p>



<p>“I see… Even in the Empire, an S-rank adventurer is treated like a hero, you know? And to think you became one, I’m just surprised.”</p>



<p>“Haha, well… I didn’t think I’d make it that far either. Maybe it&#8217;s because of my training with you?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;There&#8217;s no way you can make it that far with that, right? It’s because of your ability, and effort.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m happy hearing you say that, but I’m the person I am today because of you, Aine. If not, I surely wouldn’t be an adventurer right now. I didn’t even get the chance to hold a sword after all.”</p>



<p>“Well, I just kind of knew you had the talent. Now that I got it right, it makes it like I’ve got a discerning eye, doesn&#8217;t it?”</p>



<p>Finally, Aine showed me a little smile.</p>



<p>I answered that also with a smile. &#8230;Honestly, I never thought that she’d give me a direct complement like this. So, I, too, brought up something about her.</p>



<p>“So, you became a knight, right? Aine.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah, not for that long, but I think I was pretty well evaluated.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. But still, I’d never have thought you’d become a knight of another country, you know?”</p>



<p>“I mean, I’ve also had stuff going on. In case you’re wondering, I also did take the Kingdom’s knight exam.”</p>



<p>“Ah, I see now. Maybe, the treatment was better in the Empire?”</p>



<p>“The treatment is the worst.,” Aine said, pointing at her neck.</p>



<p>I was at a loss for words. Seeing me like that, she let out a chuckle and said: “I’m just joking. Umm… you know, for your help, I’m really thankful for it.” She then gave me a smile. However, different from earlier, I could tell she was forcing it.</p>



<p>—To be honest, I’d been careful with my words; because I didn’t want to say anything that could hurt Aine in anyway—</p>



<p><em>But, yeah… I’ll tell her what I must tell her</em>.</p>



<p>I got up from my seat and walked to Aine’s side. With a puzzled expression, Aine was looking at me.</p>



<p>“Lunois…?”</p>



<p>“Aine, I could become strong because of you. I became strong, for you.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;? —Huh, fueeh!? Wha, wha-wha-what are you saying!?” Aine raised her voice in a flustered fashion. I didn’t think I’d said something that crazy.</p>



<p>Because I, wanting to become stronger to surpass Aine, became stronger to compete with her. Taking Aine’s hand, I said: “Right now, I’m an S-rank adventurer. However, that is merely the indicator of the adventurer’s guild. But, if it could reassure you, I’ll exaggerate even if I have to. I, will protect you. That’s why, just rest assure—”</p>



<p>“O-okay, I get it. Fo-for now… my hand, can you, let go?”</p>



<p>“Ah, s-sorry!”</p>



<p>I got so heated with my feelings that I was spontaneously grabbing her hand.</p>



<p>Different from the past; both me and her were not kids anymore—she’d probably not like it to be thoughtlessly touched.</p>



<p>“Y-your feelings, Lunois, umm… I understand, I get the message. If that’s how you feel then, umm… yep.”</p>



<p>Aine seemed to want to say something with a blushed face, but her voice was so quiet it almost disappeared. <em>Considering what I saw earlier—don’t tell me</em>.</p>



<p>“&#8230;By chance, are you in heat? Your face is red and all.”</p>



<p>“! I-I’m not!! Anyway, I… believe in you. That’s all!”</p>



<p>And Aine quickly pulled the cover over her head and hid herself. I felt like… she had cheered up a bit.</p>



<p><em>In the end, I didn’t manage to bring up the collar, but I guess I can just go about it little by little.</em></p>



<p>Thus, for a little while, I watched over her tucked under the cover.</p>




<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>



<p>For Aine Crossint, there was not a single shred of hope left. After all, the path she had chosen had been a mistake, and she in fact had ended up being reduced to the status of a slave.</p>



<p>Even if she were to become a slave, Aine had intended to take a resolute attitude—though, Aine’s heart was on the verge of breaking in reality. No, you could say it was broken.</p>



<p>It was because, her body, through the effect of the ‘Sexualification Collar’ that she had been forced to wear, would be made into ‘heat,’ leaving her with no choice but to live as a slave.</p>



<p><em>In that case, death might be a better option</em>—as she was thinking such, the place she was brought to was the royal capital. She had mixed feelings about the possibility of being able to meet Lunois, but she also absolutely didn’t want to be seen in her current state.</p>



<p>Even though of her feelings of rather to be sold as a slave to some stranger than meeting him… Lunois was there.</p>



<p>Despite not having seen each other for several years, she recognized him right away. She wanted to hide herself, but couldn’t… The only feeling she had was helplessness, but the next moment, he saw Lunois pointing his sword at the slave merchant’s neck. &#8230;That alone was enough for Aine to know that he had grown even more without her knowledge—for this reason, she felt so pathetic.</p>



<p>She ended up thinking that if Lunois saw the current her, he would surely come to help her; even supposing that he didn’t have the power to help her, he would likely put the effort to.</p>



<p>Hating herself, Aine had been trying to keep her distance from Lunois one way or another. And yet—</p>



<p>“Right now, I’m an S-rank adventurer. However, that is merely the indicator of the adventurer’s guild. But, if it could reassure you, I’ll exaggerate even if I have to. I, will protect you.”</p>



<p>—While wrapping herself under the cover, she ended up remembering his words earlier.</p>



<p><em>I wonder since when… did Lunois become a man who can say such cool things</em>, she thought.</p>



<p>Even though he should’ve just ignored someone like her; someone who had been degraded into a slave<em>.</em></p>



<p>However, Aine was agonizing under the cover, trying not to be found out that she was remembering Lunois’ words.</p>



<p><em>Uwh, sa-saying things like that, to someone like me…!</em></p>



<p>It was also understandable for her to be like this.</p>



<p>After all, Aine liked Lunois.</p>



<p>In those days when they had always been training sword together, she had started to feel that way at some point. Aine was agonizing alone, feeling even more embarrassed that she had masturbated while remembering the ‘act’ with Lunois.</p>



<p><em>Isn’t that basically already like a ‘confession’&#8230; Even though I’m a slave now…! B-but, to feel happy is…!</em></p>



<p>Surely, Aine and Lunois were both oblivious to such subtle differences in their thoughts.</p>



<p>For a short while, Aine wasn’t able to turn her face towards Lunois; just couldn’t do anything but wait for the time to pass.</p>




<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>



<p>After that, Aine and I were talking about trivial things.</p>



<p>The details about how I became an adventurer, and the details how she became a knight—all the while trying not to touch on the ‘Sexualification Collar’ too much.</p>



<p>Of course I wanted to ask, but it’d be important to find the right timing.</p>



<p>And as we were spending our time like this, Aine spoke as if she had just noticed something. “&#8230;Speaking of which, there’s only a bed.”</p>



<p>Although that was exactly what she’d been using all this time now, It’d be a bit too small for two people to sleep in.</p>



<p>If it would come to this, I should’ve chosen a room with two beds, but it was impossible for me to have predicted this.</p>



<p>Other rooms were full anyway, and if we were to move to another inn, we probably should’ve done it a little earlier—But, not that it was a big problem.</p>



<p>“You can go use the bed.”</p>



<p>“And what about you…?”</p>



<p>“I’m fine with the chair and all.”</p>



<p>“That’s not good. It won’t even help you with fatigue, no?”</p>



<p>“Ahaha, that’s not true. I’ve gotten used to an adventurer’s life by the way… I can rest quite well even with sitting on a chair. I can even sleep while standing, you know?”</p>



<p>“Sleep while standing… you’ve gotten really tough before I knew it, huh.”</p>



<p>Aine seemed impressed, yet dumbfoundead.</p>



<p>The three years since I’d become an adventurer—a short but seemingly long period of time, had made me stronger.</p>



<p>I often slept in the forest, and I’d even spent the night in a monster’s den.</p>



<p>Perhaps because I’d gotten used to such a life that I could, of course, get my body to rest in bed, but that didn’t mean I couldn’t get rest if I didn’t..</p>



<p>Rather, Aine probably hadn’t had a chance to sleep in a bed for a while. Considering this, I wanted to get her to get some proper rast for today. However, “but still, no. I mean I, umm… can also sleep without a bed anyway.”</p>



<p>“It’s not the time to compete, really. You can just take it easy and sleep.”</p>



<p>“!! I’m not trying to compete. I mean, it’s really making me feel bad&#8230;”</p>



<p>It seemed that Aine was feeling awkward with me. Even if I told her not to mind it, she’d likely still mind it. &#8230;Nonetheless, I had no intention of letting Aine sleep in a chair or on the floor. Because, really, sleeping in a chair was not a problem for me.</p>



<p>As I was thinking how to persuade her, “&#8230;I-in that case, err… it can’t be helped, and only if you don’t hate it, though&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Hmm, you got any ideas?”</p>



<p>“Wa-wanna sleep together?” Suddenly, Aine brought up something like that. It must be the conclusion she reached after much brooding—I could tell by the look on Aine’s face.</p>



<p>As expected, the bed would be too small for the two of us to sleep in, and from the way she was acting, she probably didn’t feel so comfortable about it either.</p>



<p>“Nuh-uh, you don’t have to force yourself too—”</p>



<p>“I-I’m not forcing myself or anything!”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to be concerned about someone like me, you know.”</p>



<p>“!! aren’t you the one being so concerned!? Even though I already said I’m fine with it.”</p>



<p>“That is&#8230;”</p>



<p>I was suddenly lost for words.</p>



<p>Certainly, I was concerned about Aine as well—that was also the case for her.</p>



<p>With a sudden look of realization, Aine averted her gaze and, in a muttered voice with her face looking down, said: “I-I’m sorry. I’ve said too much… I’m not even in a position where I can say such a thing, aren’t I?”</p>



<p>Once again, Aine ended up self-deprecating herself—in order to shorten the distance between her and me, it seemed I would have to first revise my thinking.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I got it. Let’s sleep together.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Eh? Err, really?”</p>



<p>“Aren’t you the one who proposed it? Or maybe I really should just sleep in the—”</p>



<p>“Th-that’s not what I meant!! &#8230;W-we should’ve just gone with that from the start.”</p>



<p>Quickly averting her gaze, Aine pouted her lips. It had been a while since I’d seen her showing this kind of sulking gesture—seeing her like this, I felt relieved.</p>



<p>It might have been the first time Aine and I’d slept together in a bed since we really were kids. She should’ve been a year older than me, but I was now taller than her.</p>



<p><em>She used to be bigger than me, though</em>…; thinking such a thing made me all kinds of nostalgic.</p>



<p>Then, as time passed and it was getting late into the night, I took off my equipment, changed into a shirt and pants, and sat down on the bed.</p>



<p>Aine moved to the end of the bed to make room for me.</p>



<p>And I went to lie down, facing the table. As expected, if I laid on my back, our bodies would be touching each other.</p>



<p><em>I knew it’s gonna be too small for two people to sleep in</em>—<em>on the contrary, I feel like I’d get exhausted</em>. <em>But, since this is the compromise I&#8217;ve reached with Aine, it’s already too late to reverse it now…</em></p>



<p>As I was having such thoughts, I heard the sound of her moving on the bed with a creak.</p>



<p>Softly, a blanket was draped over my body; Aine’s hand was also tenderly resting on it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Aine?”</p>



<p>“This way, you can move in closer now, right?”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to force—”</p>



<p>“I don’t. I‘ve said it already; if it’s you, it’s fine,” Aine said, huddling closer to me.</p>



<p>I couldn’t see her face, but right now she didn’t seem to hate it.</p>



<p>Certainly, I might be the one who was being overly concerned. I felt a greater feeling of not wanting to make her remember anything unpleasant; to her, who had ended up becoming a slave.</p>



<p>For this reason, I still hadn’t been able to ask her something I must ask. <em>That’s why, let’s ask her about that first thing tomorrow.</em>, having decided to do so, I closed my eyes.</p>



<p>“Lunois.”</p>



<p>“Nn, what’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nope, it’s nothing. Good night.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, good night.”</p>



<p>Thus, this marked the end of the first day of reuniting with my childhood friend whom I hadn’t seen for a long time. Feeling Aine’s warmth beside me, I was strangely able to fall asleep in no time at all.</p>



<p>Next morning—after finishing the breakfast provided by the inn, I decided to have a talk with Aine. The first thing after waking up was unlike yesterday; it felt awkward, but now it was normal.</p>



<p>Once again, I finally asked her about the ‘Sexualification Collar’ around her neck. “You know, about that collar&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>



<p>Aine’s response was a bit gloomy, but fortunately, she seemed to be willing to walk about it. Then I continued on. “Just who put it on you?”</p>



<p>“Who… What are you gonna do from asking that?”</p>



<p>“If we follow the acquisition route of the person who put it on, we might just even be able to find out who made it.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I mean, we don’t even know if it’s made recently, don’t we?”</p>



<p>“That may be true, but&#8230;”</p>



<p>I didn’t manage to get any leads from the slave merchant in the end—since it had turned out that way, the information from Aine would naturally be the most reliable.</p>



<p>Even though Aine was a little perturbed, “it was someone of the Empire who put it on. It was, just when I was being taken to jail.”</p>



<p>“I knew it&#8230;”</p>



<p>“But, don’t say we’re going to the Empire, okay…?” Aine said, as if anticipating my words.</p>



<p>Of course I didn’t expect she’d want to go—I could go there alone, but if I were to do that, then her ‘heat’ would be a problem.</p>



<p>It was because the effect of this would force it to happen, and it would have to be me, the current master, who could manage it.</p>



<p>It was almost like a curse, though perhaps it was a suitable thing for a sex slave…</p>



<p>“Of course, I’m not gonna force you to go. But, you don’t want to stay that way either, right?”</p>



<p>“I… don’t want to. But, if it’s you&#8230;” Aine said in a really faint voice. Her voice was getting quieter and quieter, to the point where I couldn’t hear her well.</p>



<p>“Nn, me and…?”</p>



<p>“—! I-it’s nothing! Anyway, I’m just saying we don’t have to be in such a rush!”</p>



<p>“No, but—”</p>



<p>“I’m saying it’s fine!”</p>



<p>Aine strongly insisted on me, and I nodded my head in agreement for the time being. Of course I didn&#8217;t entirely agree, but for now, I’d give her voice priority. However… I couldn’t let her keep on getting burdened forever. <em>Let’s look for some solutions, including through the adventurer’s guild.</em></p>



<p>“That aside, don’t you have a job to do too…?”</p>



<p>“Nn? Yeah, I’m gonna ask about it today. And then, we’ve got to buy some clothes for you, too. The truth is, I wish I could’ve bought it yesterday, though&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Clothes for me…?”</p>



<p>“That one as a little too thin. Besides, it’s gonna be necessary from now on. I also have nothing but men’s clothes in my home. It’s just… I’m not familiar with women’s clothing, so I’d like to have you choose, but will it be better to ‘wait’?”</p>



<p>Hearing my question, Aine didn’t look like she was able to understand it at first. However—maybe she finally understood it—her face was getting redder and redder.</p>



<p>“I-I mean, I also don’t know when it’s gonna happen… waiting is, maybe not realistic.”</p>



<p>“I guess so. It’d be nice if it can be controlled or something, though.”</p>



<p>“Con-controlled&#8230;!?”</p>



<p>“I-I don’t mean it in a weird way. But, yeah… so it might be hard on you, but I guess it’s better to have you wait. I’ll be back as soon as I can; besides, you also don’t wanna be out with that collar on, right?”</p>



<p>Even from the appearance, anyone would end up able to tell that she was a slave.</p>



<p>And as an S-rank adventurer, my face was known to a certain extent, and if I were to be accompanied by a slave, I might stand out.</p>



<p>I wouldn’t care, but Aine probably would. However, Aine shook her head and said: “It’s not like I care if anyone thinks I’m a slave or not. I’m an actual slave after all.”</p>



<p>“Doesn’t matter if you’re a slave or not. But, are you gonna be okay?”</p>



<p>“If I wait, umm… It might be hard when it happens. If you don’t like accompanied by a slave, I wish you’d just leave me, though.”</p>



<p>“There’s just no way I’d hate to go together with you, Aine.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;!! I-I see. In that case, I wanna go with you.”</p>



<p>For some reason, Aine was looking down in embarrassment.</p>



<p>“Then, first let’s buy your clothes. After that, let’s go to the adventurer’s guild. I want you to tell me right away if it’s becoming hard for you.”</p>



<p>“Nn, alright.”</p>



<p>The things to do today had been decided—choosing clothes for Aine, and then about the job at the adventurer’s guild.</p>



<p>After finishing our preparations, Aine and I quickly left the inn.</p>
