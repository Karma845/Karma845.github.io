<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

			
<p>After returning to the city, I went to explain the details of the matter to the guild.</p>



<p>About how the Gray Bear subjugation had been done by an adventurer named Dill, and also about how I’d killed Dill because he’d come to attack us.</p>



<p>It seemed that it was rare for adventurers to talk that much without hiding anything, and most of them seemed to hide it, thinking it’d turn into some kind of crime. Setting aside if it was inside or in the neighborhood of a town, it’d be rather hard to prove if the matter took place in a forest, in fact.</p>



<p>So, reporting wouldn’t mean I was somehow to blame. Rather, it was Dill who’d come to attack us, which was warranted based on his usual attitude.</p>



<p>I gave the sample of his blood to the guild. If there was some kind of substance in the blood, it could tell us what had happened to Dill.</p>



<p>Regarding the remuneration… since I’d taken some of the proof that the Gray Bear had been defeated, such as the fangs and claws, it was treated as me having subjugated it. It seemed the guild decided that it was no problem since, in the first place, they’d requested it because I could win.</p>



<p>Although my first job with Aine had turned into an inexplicable result, the job was completed with this for now.</p>



<p>“About today, umm… I’m sorry.” Night—Aine suddenly talked to me like so. Not knowing what she was apologizing for, I asked Aine back, “about what?”</p>



<p>“I mean, that… When Dill came to attack.”</p>



<p>“Aah, so about that. You don’t have to worry about it.”</p>



<p>“I said I won’t be a burden and yet, at the most crucial time I… It’s really pathetic.”</p>



<p>Apparently, Aine was referring to the timing when she’d been attacked by Dill. Certainly, it’d been the worst timing—after all, Aine could’ve been killed if I had been a little slow.</p>



<p>But, with her personality… even if it hadn’t been Aine’s intention, she would end up worrying about it. She was the one who had said she would like to come after all.</p>



<p>“This is just a what-if, but if you were in my shoes, would you blame me?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Eh?”</p>



<p>“Let’s say I couldn’t move for some reason, and you saved me. And then after that, I wonder if you’d say that it’s my fault I couldn&#8217;t move.”</p>



<p>“S-such a thing—no way I’d say that…”</p>



<p>“Then this conversation ends here. I also don’t think it’s your fault, and in fact, I was taking you with the intention of protecting you from anything that might happen. Actually, the job turned out a bit off, but it turned out well, didn’t it?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’re, right. But, like… putting it that way is, unfair,” Aine said, pouting her lips. Even if she told me that, I wouldn’t blame her for something she wouldn’t blame me for.</p>



<p>I was always being told that I’d never been seen angry, and maybe I wasn’t the type to mind about it in the first place—that was why, I’d asked Aine to close her eyes at that time.</p>



<p>When Dill had attacked Aine, anger was all I’d got. Seemingly calm, I’d intended to kill him, no matter the reason.</p>



<p>I had no idea what kind of expression I’d had at that time. But, I somehow hadn’t wanted Aine to see it—I had no idea whether that was my selfishness, though.</p>



<p>“Anyway, today’s job is over. I don’t particularly plan to do any work tomorrow, so go get some good rest today as well.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Okay. Then, can you lie down?”</p>



<p>“Nn, it’s still too early to go to bed, though—”</p>



<p>“Not going to bed, I’ll give you a massage.”</p>



<p>“A massage? Can you do it?”</p>



<p>“D-don’t make fun of me. Even I got complimented when I was in the knight order.”</p>



<p>Although not sure whether Aine got the confidence, I laid down at her urging. <em>Even though she must be tired, too</em>… She applied just the right amount of pressure to my shoulders and waist. It felt rather good, but the one who spoke out the first doubt was Aine. “&#8230;Aren’t you too stiff?”</p>



<p>“Well, I’m not using it that much and all.”</p>



<p>The fight with Dill was just about the only time I’d swung my sword. If anything, it should be Aine who’d done her best to fight in the forest.</p>



<p>I got up and pulled her by the shoulders.</p>



<p>“Fueh, hey, w-what are you…!?”</p>



<p>“Well, I’m all good, so I’m just thinking of giving you a massage. You’re more tired than I am, right?”</p>



<p>“Ah! I see, a massage! So it’s a massage!”</p>



<p>I tried to get Aine to lie down, who looked flustered for some reason, but she put up just a bit of a resistance… Perhaps there was something else to do other than that.</p>



<p>“I-I’m also all good!”</p>



<p>“Don’t say that. I know you must be tired.”</p>



<p>“That’s not… Hinyan!!”</p>



<p>When I pushed a pressure point around the waist of Aine who was lying face down, she made a coquettish voice that wouldn’t seem to have come from her. …This was supposed to be just a massage, though.</p>



<p>Aine remained looking down while trembling.</p>



<p>“Aine, aren’t you pretty stiff?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yep.” Aine gave an honest nod. In the first place, it should have been a while since she’d moved her body.</p>



<p>Thinking about it, it also wouldn’t be surprising that the fight in the forest was becoming a burden.</p>



<p>Of course there was that too, but… seeing Aine’s reaction was just fun. When I, once again, put a pressure on my thumbs to massage Aine’s waist, “uhiiii!! W-wait, give me a pause!” Aine moved her body and tried to resist in response to my acupressure. However, I just held her down in a horse-riding fashion.</p>



<p>“It’s all right, just leave it to me. I became an S-rank adventurer with this massage, you know?”</p>



<p>“T-the Lunois I know is not someone who would say something like that!”</p>



<p>“I suppose people do grow up.”</p>



<p>As a matter of fact, Aine used to be the better one with the sword, and also the type to pull some kind of pranks on me. Although not a payback by any means, Aine’s reaction like this was very refreshing to me.</p>



<p>So, I would like her to think of this as a kind of light skinship.</p>



<p>“Lu-Lunois… I did apologize, right?”</p>



<p>“Yep, I’m really not angry about that, or even bothered by it. I’m just thinking of returning back a massage since you massaged me.”</p>



<p>“Wa-wait… I don’t need any kind of massa… ah, aaahhhhh!!”</p>



<p>…I really was just giving a massage and yet, for some reason, Aine sounded like I was doing something even more questionable than usual to her.</p>



<p>While I was giving Aine a massage, her voice continued to echo in the room.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>



<p>Aine sometimes would dream about the past; and that, about the time when she and Lunois had been training with swords.</p>



<p>Aine’s father, an adventurer, would return from time to time, to accompany her in her sword training. Aine’s mother, who had been an adventurer, would always watch. And Aine, who had been raised by such two people, had got her talent as a swordswoman blossomed from an early age. …And as a result, there were things she could understand despite being very young.</p>



<p>That was: Aine certainly had the talent, but she couldn’t become an adventurer like her father&nbsp; and mother.</p>



<p>Aine’s father was an A-rank adventurer, and her mother had also been an A-rank adventurer. However, she could tell from seeing her father’s swords—that he was much, much better than that.</p>



<p>And that Lunois, who had been training with Aine, was more talented as a swordsman, and not Aine.</p>



<p>Therefore, Aine would have a teasing attitude towards Lunois.</p>



<p>That was not at all because she hated Lunois—she’d wanted him, someone with the talent, to grow stronger. Aine had had the feeling that if Lunois were to become stronger, she could become even stronger.</p>



<p>That If the competing partner were to be stronger… Aine could grow more. It was at the age of thirteen that she’d understood that this was what ‘running away’ was all about.</p>



<p>Aine had come to harbor a certain feeling as well as expectation for Lunois, who was growing remarkably.</p>



<p>—She liked him for being kind at all times, she liked him for trying to protect her even when he was weaker, and she liked him for being so competitive when it came to a sword match—</p>



<p>She couldn’t become stronger together with him while harboring such feelings—feeling this way, she’d decided to leave Lunois’ side.</p>



<p>Aine had tried to be strong, not as an adventurer like her father and mother, but by living a different path as a ‘knight.’ …And the result, she’d ended up in the way of life of a slave. No way she would have imagined it.</p>



<p>Since the severals days of Aine becoming a slave, no, since she’d been fitted with the ‘Sexualification Collar,’ Aine had not had a single day of peace of mind.</p>



<p>If she were to go to ‘heat’ in the dead of the night, there would be no one to help her relieve it.</p>



<p>Rather—perhaps to harass Aine—there had even been times where she would be left alone the whole day with arms bound.</p>



<p>Aine’s feelings had nearly been broken many times… even so, she’d act brave on the outside.</p>



<p>An every day of simply having her body harassed, just to be sold as a virgin sex slave, without even a plan to break out of it—the dreams of the past she had had during those days simply had made her miss them, feel miserable, and cry.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nn.”</p>



<p>Morning; Aine woke up. Still only four days since Lunois had bought her—despite it being such a short time, she felt that she was able to close the distance between him and herself significantly.</p>



<p>Seeing Lunois asleep in front of her eyes, Aine made a small smile.</p>



<p>After several years of not seeing Lunois, she found nothing had changed about him, but he had become very strong… and, this made her feel at ease when she was with him.</p>



<p>She never would’ve thought that the day would come when she could dream about the past and miss them normally.</p>



<p>“Lunois, it’s already morn—”</p>



<p>Aine hushed as she tried to wake him up who was sleeping next to her.</p>



<p>He had said no job today, that it was a rest day. In that case, there would be no need to wake up early.</p>



<p>Quietly, Aine lay down on the bed again and slept, snuggling up close to Lunois. …When she was close to Lunois, she could smell his smell.</p>



<p>Although it was not even the effect of the collar, thinking about Lunois with him being close made her… feel weird.</p>



<p>Despite being forced to go into heat, being touched by Lunois gave her a feeling she’d never felt before. Even though that was exactly what she had been trying to endure with her willpower so far, she couldn’t in front of Lunois.</p>



<p><em>Could it be that I’m… a pervert?</em></p>



<p>She even ended up thinking such a thing—if it were to be known that Aine was harboring such a wicked feeling towards Lunois, would he scorn her?</p>



<p><em>Lunois is kind so he would never</em>… despite thinking so, she was afraid of having her feelings be known.</p>



<p>For this reason, Aine tried to close the distance between Lunois in a roundabout way.</p>



<p>Trying to take a bath together, trying to give a massage—she thought: if she increased the amount of skinship, Lunois could turn to feel that way.</p>



<p>Not doing the ‘act’ simply because it was necessary to Aine, who would be brought into heat by the effect of the collar… but to yearn for Aine. In the end, she also scorned herself for being able to only have such fawning thoughts towards Lunois. Now that she was a slave, did she have the qualifications to fall in love with Lunois?</p>



<p>Therefore, Aine made every effort to be as helpful as possible. Lunois had told Aine that he would protect her—whether this was from his ‘liking’ or just pure kindness… Aine currently didn’t know.</p>



<p>Even supposing it was just from kindness, if they could be together then… Aine was content simply with that.</p>



<p><em>But if we can be together, that’s fine. I’m… not wishing for more.</em></p>



<p>Thankful to be with Lunois like this, Aine continued to live her day today.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


			
<p>I’d regularly make a day off work. Not that I’d have some kind of plan on that day—sometimes I’d just end up randomly walking around town, or spending the whole day training with my sword.</p>



<p>Today was one of those days off, but the difference from the usual was that I got Aine. After finishing breakfast at the inn, I went to discuss with Aine about the day’s plans. “I haven’t decided anything in particular to do today, but is there something you wanna do?”</p>



<p>“I mostly trained with my sword on my days off, though…”</p>



<p>“Ah, that’s so you, Aine…”</p>



<p>Of course I wouldn’t mind that either, but It’d be a waste to end the day with swinging a sword since the morning.</p>



<p>Going out somewhere would be fine, too, and I also felt like wanting to get a proper rest if it was a rest day. I’d also be fine if there was something Aine would like to do, though.</p>



<p>“Then, wanna go somewhere?”</p>



<p>“! Well yeah, I was thinking so, too.”</p>



<p>Aine made such a suggestion. I gave her a response, and proceeded the conversation towards going out.</p>



<p>Even Aine would need an opportunity to freshen up. The job yesterday must have taken some kind of burden as well.</p>



<p>“Even if I ask where you want to go, you’re not that familiar with the capital, huh.”</p>



<p>“Guess, so. I don’t really have anywhere I want to go to, though… Haven’t you got any, Lunois?”</p>



<p>“Me? I… let’s see. Usually when it’s a day off, I’m just taking a walk, I guess.”</p>



<p>“Then why don’t we decide as we walk? Let’s go to a good place if we find any.”</p>



<p>“That sounds like a good idea. Okay, let’s get ready then.”</p>



<p>An outing with no particular plans for both of us—I supposed that was also a thing.</p>



<p>After getting ready, Aine and I went out to town without having a specific plan in mind.</p>



<p>When it came to the royal capital, there were a lot of people everywhere. Surely, there was vast enough space to use carriages to get around, but it must also be that the population was large to begin with.</p>



<p>We both decided to enjoy the feeling of sightseeing as we followed the flow of the main street.</p>



<p>And Aine, she seemed to have gotten used to walking around outside for a bit. Even now I didn’t feel her being bothered by the surroundings’ eyes because of the collar.</p>



<p>“Lunois, you often come here, no?”</p>



<p>“Well, I only come here because of jobs and not for any sightseeing, I guess. So, maybe I’m not very familiar with here.”</p>



<p>“Uh-huh… Even though you’re familiar with the location of the cave in the forest.”</p>



<p>“That’s work related after all. In that sense, I’m more familiar with roads like the complicated underground maze than the capital streets, you know?”</p>



<p>“Fufu, that’s funny. You don’t even look like someone living only for work, but you sound like a craftsman.”</p>



<p>“I wonder. I mean come on, Aine, you must’ve spent your days off only swinging your sword, right?”</p>



<p>“I… Well yeah. I mean I wanted to be strong.”</p>



<p>“I think you’re plenty strong.”</p>



<p>“Even if you say that to me.”</p>



<p>It was an honest feeling, but certainly between me and Aine right now, I must be the stronger one.</p>



<p>It was just a matter of one-on-one sword fighting in the end; for instance, Aine was someone who’d been working as a knight—I heard that knights, if anything, mainly worked in several teams more than adventurers.</p>



<p>There was also strength in that sense, but thinking about it, I came to the answer that Aine was, if I had to say it, more of a type to move independently.</p>



<p>“But, I’m gonna take that as a compliment,” Aine added like so while I was troubled about how I should respond. I’d originally meant it as a compliment, so it helped me if she took it that way.</p>



<p>“Ah.” Then suddenly, Aine stopped in her tracks like she’d noticed something.</p>



<p>Beyond that gaze of hers was a cafe—I turned my gaze in that direction as well and then asked. “Do you know that place?”</p>



<p>“Not that I know about it, but… I just thought there&#8217;s a big parfait.”</p>



<p>“Parfait?”</p>



<p>When I shifted my gaze downward, there was a big parfait advertisement on a signboard. Apparently, ‘Gigantic Parfait’ was the advertising pitch in the first place.</p>



<p>“Let’s go there then while at it.”</p>



<p>“Eh, are you gonna eat that parfait?”</p>



<p>“I suppose that’s a preference, but… well, I guess I’m feeling like taking a little break.”</p>



<p>“Nn, right. Well, let’s try going there then.”</p>



<p>Then Aine and I entered the cafe. The interior of the cafe was very organized and neat looking. We were shown to an empty seat by the window and sat down facing each other.</p>



<p>“&#8230;So Aine, are you gonna have parfait?”</p>



<p>“W-why it comes to that…”</p>



<p>“Nah, I just wondered if you also liked sweet things a lot.”</p>



<p>Just from what I remembered, Aine&#8217;s mother used to make fruit pies often.</p>



<p>And I remembered that that was Aine’s favorite food. …And it should&#8217;ve been rather sweet pies.</p>



<p>“Well, I don’t hate it, but… eating it alone is just…”</p>



<p>“Then you can just split it with me.”</p>



<p>“I thought you weren’t good with sweet foods?”</p>



<p>“That’s not true. I just don’t eat much of it.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that just what you call not good with it?”</p>



<p>“I just don’t eat it, really. Ah, excuse me, this one parfait and coffee, please.”</p>



<p>“Wha, don’t just…!”</p>



<p>Aine showed a bit of an angry look, but immediately kept quiet. As as expected, it seemed that it was true that she wanted to eat it because she was interested in it.</p>



<p>I ordered an extra drink for Aine and then waited for the parfait to come. The coffee, which I’d ordered first, arrived, so I took it to my mouth while looking out at the streets.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You don’t put any sweetener.”</p>



<p>“Nn? Yeah, because I’m about to eat something sweet.”</p>



<p>“Like, even though you didn’t have to go along with me.”</p>



<p>“I’m not going along with you. I just wanted you to not be reserved if you wanted to eat it.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I-it’s gonna be a lie if I say I don’t want to eat it, but to say I want to eat that amount is just, umm… embarrassing, right?”</p>



<p>Apparently, that was the reason why Aine had been evasive with her words.</p>



<p>I didn’t think it was an embarrassing amount to eat it after sharing it, but from how Aine talked, she seemed to want to eat that amount by herself.</p>



<p>Seeing Aine like that, I couldn’t help but smile.</p>



<p>“W-what.”</p>



<p>“Nope… I just thought you care about that kind of thing.”</p>



<p>“I-I do care about it. I mean, I don’t want to look like a glutton.”</p>



<p>“If you can eat it, then so much the better. You and I are both doing physical work—sweet food turns into energy after all.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Somehow, I feel like you’re looking down on me, huh. It’s like the composure of an adult. Even though I’m the older one…” Aine said discontentedly. Although older, it was only by a year—that was exactly a gap where you wouldn’t have to mind it.</p>



<p>And as we were talking, “thank you for waiting.” The waiter brought a big parfait and placed it on the table.</p>



<p>It was covered with fresh cream and wheat cookies and the like, and furthermore, decorated with several kinds of fruits. Looking at it from the front, it was big enough to cover Aine’s face—it was truly just a gigantic parfait.</p>



<p>There were two forks stuck into it, probably on the assumption that I’d be eating it as well.</p>



<p>As Aine brought the parfait closer to me as well, “&#8230;You’re also eating, right?”</p>



<p>“After I finish this drink that is. You go ahead and eat.”</p>



<p>“Nn, I’ll dig in.”</p>



<p>While scooping the cream with the fork, she brought the cookie and fruit to her mouth. The moment Aine ate it, her expression slackened.</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/02/rgfesoj4g4.jpeg"></img>


<p>Seeing Aine like that was just making me chuckle.</p>



<p>Aine came to herself and showed a surprised look, and then sent a glare at me. She scooped up the parfait with the fork again and leaned forward to bring it to my mouth.</p>



<p>“You’ll also understand it if you eat it.”</p>



<p>“Even though I told you after I finished my coffee.”</p>



<p>“Just take it.”</p>



<p>I reluctantly ate the held out parfait. It was just as it looked… extremely sweet. Aine was staring at me, but I just gave her my honest impression.</p>



<p>“It’s sweet.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Isn’t that just an obvious impression?”</p>



<p>“What do you expect from me, really.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Not really. You’ve already taken a bite, so you don’t have to force yourself to eat the parfait.”</p>



<p>I didn’t know if Aine was being considerate of me or that she wanted to eat the parfait by herself, but as she returned to her seat to eat the parfait again, “&#8230;!!”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing!” She was hesitating as though she had remembered something, but immediately started eating the parfait. And then, her expression relaxed in the same way.</p>



<p>In the end, I left the cafe with a satisfied-looking Aine, who had eaten the parfait practically all by herself.</p>



<p>“Where should we go next?”</p>



<p>“Right… A place where you can move your body sounds good.”</p>



<p>“Body, huh… Then maybe around the park will be a good one.”</p>



<p>“Is it close?”</p>



<p>“It’s just after the main street. Then let’s go over there.”</p>



<p>It was an understandable objective that the reason for it was because she had eaten a gigantic parfait, but I wouldn’t be mentioning it. The two of us were heading to our next destination—on the way there, “&#8230;!!”</p>



<p>“! Aine, are you okay?”</p>



<p>“Nnh, I-I’m okay…”</p>



<p>Aine’s breathing grew a little ragged. Although the time today was a little early, it seemed the time for the ‘heat’ had come.</p>



<p>I immediately supported Aine’s body and headed towards a deserted alleyway. If this was the case, it might’ve been better to take a little more time in the cafe.</p>



<p>“H-here, people, nnh, will…”</p>



<p>“No, there’s no sign of anyone nearby. Or maybe we should go back to the inn?”</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be hard for me to go back with Aina in my arms. But Aine showed just a little bit of a troubled look, “here, is, fine…” and replied so in a disconnected voice.</p>



<p>As expected, it might be easier on Aine if the heat was calmed down as soon as possible.</p>



<p>As I supported her body, Aine also reached for her underwear—</p>



<p>“! Aine!”</p>



<p>“Fueh…!?”</p>



<p>And I held AIne’s body and jumped from that spot. Immediately after, a large ‘rock hand’ appeared from beneath where our feet had been.</p>



<p>The rock hand moved with a jerk like it was trying to grab something, but Aine and I were not there anymore.</p>



<p>However, what that hand was aiming after—it was clear that it was me and Aine.</p>



<p>“W-what… just?”</p>



<p>“Aine, sorry, but please endure it for a bit—who are you? You were also near me yesterday, weren’t you?” I asked the rock hand. They were hiding, but I knew they were very close.</p>



<p>And then, the rock hand disappeared into the ground like it was melting. In exchange, a huge man appeared. He was clad in a robe, but his size was far too large for a human.</p>



<p>However, I recognized that appearance. It was precisely because of one of the requests I’d taken, one that was also my immediate objective.</p>



<p>“Dodged. Even though, that was complete opening.”</p>



<p>“Never would’ve thought you’d show up from there. You also matched the description—a mage from Laveira Empire, huh.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;!!? E-empire, what does this…?”</p>



<p>Aine reacted in surprise to my words. I hadn’t told her about the Empire’s mages. I hadn’t intended to add unnecessary worries, but I had no choice now that it’d turned out like this.</p>



<p>“I’ll explain later. Try not to move too much.”</p>



<p>“N-no… nnh, I-I’ll become a, burde—”</p>



<p>“You won’t. I have no problem while carrying you,” I declared, cutting off Aine’s words. That there was no problem with taking her along—and now, I’d prove it.</p>



<p>“Like Domiro said. That woman, important to you. That is, your weak point,” the huge man pointed at me and declared so. By weak point, it’d mean that they’d apparently been targeting me and Aine since a little while back.</p>



<p>The presence I’d sensed yesterday where I’d defeated Dill might have been this man.</p>



<p>I had no idea what the intention was, but at least I knew that someone was aiming after Aine, in spite of the fact that she’d been sold as a slave—that was all I needed to know.</p>



<p>“Lu, nois—”</p>



<p>Seeing my face, Aine’s body trembled. Immediately, I held up my hand to block her gaze, “it’s all right. Can you close your eyes for a bit?” and asked her to do so again. It seemed that I currently got an expression that ended up scaring Aine. Putting my hand around Aine’s waist to support her, I placed my hand on the sword at my waist.</p>



<p>And then, I faced the enemy that had appeared before my eyes. As I measured the distance between me and the man, I quietly stared at him.</p>



<p><em>A distance of several meters away. It’s a distance I can get into range in a single step, but I’m concerned about the man’s body. Probably, it’s a state like wearing an armor of rocks and sand—when he puts his oversized hands on the ground, a small rumble happens.</em></p>



<p><em>In the alleyway, it looks like he’d be barely able to move with that huge body, but seeing the way he attacks, it’s probably best to assume that the disadvantage due to location does not exist</em>.</p>



<p><em>In fact, it was a rock hand that appeared from underfoot that tried to attack me.</em></p>



<p>“Lunois… I-I’ll, be fine, so put me down, and fight…” Aine spoke to me despite closing her eyes, following my words.</p>



<p>From what the enemy was saying, Aine was the target. Knowing that, I wouldn’t separate from her, nor would I have any reason to separate myself from Aine in her current state.</p>



<p>“You’re a worrywart, huh, Aine.”</p>



<p>“I mean… nnh.” Aine, trying to reply to my words, looked a little pained.</p>



<p>In this current state, I couldn’t afford to have her wait for so long.</p>



<p>“It’s okay, it’s gonna be a bit tough on you, but… I will end this quick.”</p>



<p>“That’s my line,” the man said in response to my words, and then his body went to sink into the ground. Earlier, he’d suddenly appeared out of the ground, too—the magic he was using was undoubtedly earth attribute magic.</p>



<p>Magic could be activated by carving a ‘magic crest’ on the body and the ground—or even in the air. Carving it onto the body wouldn’t take time to activate, but it would then take time to replace it.</p>



<p>Looking at the man’s magic, he must be applying ‘earth attribute manipulation type’ magic to his own body.</p>



<p>At the same time as he disappeared, the ground beneath my feet was contorting mushily again. In the same way, I kicked the ground and jumped backwards—and that landing place was also wriggling.</p>



<p>I kicked the nearby wall and landed on a different spot.</p>



<p>Then, a big rock hand appeared again from the ground and came right at me.</p>



<p>“Fuhh—”</p>



<p>A slash together with my breathing. The sword I’d swung vertically cut off the big rock hand. The hand broken right in half went on to shatter into pieces. One after another, big hands appeared from around me, however—what I must do had not changed.</p>



<p>I cut an approaching hand with my sword, and avoided an attack coming from underfoot.</p>



<p>He must be thinking that my sword couldn’t reach him as long as he was in the ground. Certainly, that was not wrong.</p>



<p>As long as I was fighting with a sword, I’d also have to get close and slash to fight an enemy that was in the distance. If I was on my own, I got other options, but there was Aine now.</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t make any crazy moves—right, that must be what the enemy was thinking.</p>



<p>That was why he hid himself and just sent rock hands at me.</p>



<p>However, in the sense that ‘my attack can’t reach him,’ the same went for the enemy.</p>



<p>If a rock hand appeared from the ground, I’d leap and get away from that place. Of course the rock hand was chasing me, but I cut it off as I passed it, and it crumbled away.</p>



<p>I got no deciding moves, but the attacks the man set up couldn’t finish me off.</p>



<p>“Fuuh, uwh, nnh…” Aine’s moans reached my ears. I didn’t plan to take too much time—<em>I guess I’ll also take a shot</em>.</p>



<p>I cut down all of the rock hands that came at me again, and asserted while looking at my surroundings. “It’s useless. This level of attack—no matter if it continues for a hundred or thousand times, it will never reach me. I suppose your magic power will run out first, and that’ll be the end of it. Or maybe, you’re thinking of bringing me down with this level of magic?” I asserted to the hiding man clearly.</p>



<p>My opponent probably also knew that he wouldn’t be able to finish me off by continuing like this.</p>



<p>That was why I purposely threw out provocative words.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>No response—however, the silence meant that my opponent had taken up on my provocation. Probably, he was looking for an opening while hiding at the bottom of the ground.</p>



<p>However, that didn’t mean both of our wins and losses were aligned. After all, I even got the option of running away if he didn’t come at me.</p>



<p>The possibility of me getting away would probably be something the man would want to avoid. That was why, in the middle of the silence—he showed up from behind me.</p>



<p>“—”</p>



<p>I turned around with a slash. As if crossing, the blow of the man’s gigantic arm and my sword intersected.</p>



<p>I cut off his big arm, and then followed up with a strike. My sword reached all the way to the man’s ‘main body’ inside the huge body.</p>



<p>“Ng, guh…!?”</p>



<p>The man’s voice was distorted in pain. He swung his other arm, but I also cut it off flying, and then stood over the man’s body.</p>



<p>I thrusted my sword into the rock armor and stopped it right at the man’s neck. All it’d take was just a little more force and I could kill him.</p>



<p>“I’ve told you. That it is ‘useless’.”</p>



<p>I’d also have to find out from this man why he was aiming Aine. Moreover, there were supposed to be two mages from the Empire. I’d also have to find out where the other one was.</p>



<p>“Guh, fuh, fuh…”</p>



<p>Breathing heavily, the man sent only his gaze to me.</p>



<p>He might be trying to find an opening from me, but at this distance, taking down the man was not difficult no matter what happened.</p>



<p>“I have some questions for you. What’s your name?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I am, Gremarev.”</p>



<p>“Gremarev, huh. I suppose you’re a mage from the Empire?”</p>



<p>“Gu, fuh, what will you, do about—”</p>



<p>“Just answer the question. I’m not planning on wasting time answering you.”</p>



<p>I pressed the sword against the man’s—Gremarev’s neck.</p>



<p>Gremarev let out a slightly scared voice. With this, it looked like he’d answer my question.</p>



<p>“&#8230;There should still be another one of you. Where is he?”</p>



<p>When Lunois asked, Gremarev replied in a slow tone, despite his eyes darting around.</p>



<p>“Don’t know. But, with this, it’s according to plan.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What did you say?”</p>



<p>“You, will protect this woman. So, Domiro will do something for the rest.”</p>



<p>“What are—!!”</p>



<p>There, I noticed magic power flowing through Gremarev’s huge body. I noticed that a big magic was being invoked—not his, but someone else’s.</p>



<p>“Huh, Domiro… this will, kill me to—”</p>



<p>Gremarev’s voice trailed off—a big light wrapped up the surroundings. I immediately jumped away from that place all the while protecting Aine. Immediately afterwards, the surroundings were enveloped in a huge blast.</p>
