<h3>Afterword</h3>

			
<p>Nice to meet you, or long time no see, I’m Sasa Tougorou.</p>



<p>This happens every time, but I’m quite torn by what to write in an afterword.</p>



<p>Should I talk more about the story, or should I write an author’s idle talk; something like that.</p>



<p>I basically talk only about the story, but this time I’d like to talk a little about myself.</p>



<p>I actually got a cat this year, but once you start having a cat, they become an essential existence, don’t they…</p>



<p>My cat fawning time is short, but the strength is impressive when it’s time to.</p>



<p>The cat’s fawning so much that I found the butt placed on my face the next thing I knew, but this is one of those moments when you start to question whether you’re being fawned upon.</p>



<p>Now then, I think it’s time to stop talking about my cat and start talking about the novel.</p>



<p>I basically write fantasy; actually, practically only fantasy for a series, and I think this one is classified further as ero fantasy.</p>



<p>I think it was about more than two years ago that I started writing the series on the internet.</p>



<p>I’ve always wanted to write a classic erotic fantasy; in addition, I’ve decided to have only one heroine, and that was how it came to be.</p>



<p>Well, as expected, if the series runs that long and there is no specific talk about getting novelized, updating it completely becomes a pastime, but as I was slowly updating the story, it has now come to the point where this work is being novelized.</p>



<p>Since the content is rather extreme, there is a genuine question as to whether it will be all ages, but I have heard that novels are less restrictive. Letters are amazing.</p>



<p>I suppose this story is filled with elements that will definitely appeal to those who like the idea of protecting an enslaved childhood friend, or so I’d like to think.</p>



<p>When you add “childhood friends” to the master-slave relationship, it gives all sorts of good feelings, doesn’t it?</p>



<p>However, the protagonist of this story, Lunois, doesn’t treat the heroine, Aine, like a slave; nor does he consider himself as the master; he just treats her as a normal childhood friend.</p>



<p>And instead, it’s the heroine Aine who is the one feeling inferior from being a slave… I suppose that is the idea.</p>



<p>Furthermore, although they like each other, Aine likes Lunois rather straightforwardly, and Lunois always had feelings close to admiration for Aine; it is also a subtle discrepancy.</p>



<p>In this story, the feelings of the two coincide with each other at the end, though.</p>



<p>Anyway, I hope you’ll pay attention to their relationship.</p>



<p>And now, I would like to take this space to express my thanks.</p>



<p>Kikuta Kouichi-sama in charge of the illustrations.</p>



<p>We had Lunois drawn cooly, Aine cutely, and then erotic.</p>



<p>It brings out a strong sense of classic fantasy for the work, and I’m really happy that you’re in charge of it. Thank you very much!</p>



<p>Mr. K, editor in charge. I greatly appreciated all the detailed support you have given me. Easy to talk to, and sometimes I feel like I’m being too frank, but I’ll keep the vibe going.</p>



<p>And then, I’d like to take this opportunity to thank all those involved, thank you very much!</p>



<p>And, to everyone who has picked up this book, thank you very much!</p>



<p>I hope to see you again in the next volume.</p>
