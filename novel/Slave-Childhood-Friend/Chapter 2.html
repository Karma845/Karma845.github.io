<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

			
<p>I went to a clothing store with Aine. I did tell Aine that she could pick any of them, but what she chose was a simple shirt and skirt without any particularly conspicuous design. And we also bought some underwear as well, but Aine looked somewhat restless.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? Don’t tell me—”</p>



<p>“Y-you’re wrong. I’m just, kinda not used to the skirt.”</p>



<p>“Oh really, I thought you’re pretty used to something like that, you know.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s easier to move in trousers, or rather pants style.”</p>



<p>“Then you really should’ve just gone with that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Because there’s ‘that’,” Aine said in a murmur.</p>



<p>It still hadn’t come now, but the ‘heat’ would eventually become a concern, apparently.</p>



<p>In short, it would probably mean that it could get wet if it was in close contact with the skin.</p>



<p><em>What a very troubling problem…</em> Without getting deep into the matter, Aine and I headed straight for the adventurer&#8217;s guild.</p>



<p>On our way there, Aine showed the gesture of minding the eyes from the surroundings.</p>



<p>“As expected, maybe we really should just hide the collar?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;If we hide it, it might get you greatly misunderstood when exposed, won’t it? Walking around with a slave but hiding the fact they’re a slave is gonna make you only look guilty about it.”</p>



<p>“Not that I care, though.”</p>



<p>“Go care about it! I will… get used to it after a bit, so it’s fine.”</p>



<p>Aine continued to walk while trying to hide behind me.</p>



<p>The old her was the type who would take the initiative to walk in front, but… I supposed it couldn’t be helped given the current situation.</p>



<p>I also didn’t have someone I was close with either; only to the extent where I would just return a greeting if someone lightly greeted me while I was walking downtown. &#8230;Sometimes there would be people who would try to talk to me in a friendly way, and other times they would also come aggressively at me for some reason.</p>



<p>Fortunately, we made it to the adventurer&#8217;s guild without running into any of those people.</p>



<p>It was a three-story building, and in terms of size alone, it could accommodate quite the number of people.</p>



<p>They were running a tavern inside, in which people could recruit others for their party. I basically worked alone, so I hadn’t made use of it much, though.</p>



<p>As soon as I entered the guild, I made my way towards the receptionist lady.</p>



<p>Apparently noticing me, the lady smiled and bowed her head.</p>



<p>“We have been expecting you.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, sorry about yesterday.”</p>



<p>“No problem, you said it was urgent after all. About the job request, I was told that the guild leader would explain it personally… but I believe he will be back in a short while, however.”</p>



<p>“Personally, eh. Is it that big of a deal?”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s enough to send the request to you after all—and so, who that might be?” The receptionist lady glanced at Aine who was behind me.</p>



<p>Though hesitantly, Aine walked to the front of the lady.</p>



<p>As expected, her gaze fell on the collar.</p>



<p>“You know, about yesterday’s money, I had to withdraw it to buy this girl.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. By bringing her here, does that mean she is also fighting?”</p>



<p>“Well, pretty much,” I answered in a slightly evasive manner.</p>



<p>If I were to be open, Aine would only look like a slave that I had bought to help me with my job. Aine as well, she seemed to intend to try to get people to perceive her in this direction.</p>



<p>With a smile, “I never thought that Lunois-san would buy a slave, but you sure are really cute,” the receptionist lady said to Aine.</p>



<p>“Th-thank you, very much.” Aine looked down in embarrassment at the compliment, perhaps not used to being told so.</p>



<p>With a giggle, the receptionist lady smiled at Aine.</p>



<p>“I do believe it’s a very good fortune to be bought by Lunois-san, you know? After all, he is an S-rank adventurer at such a young age!”</p>



<p>“Nothing will come out of your praise, you know.”</p>



<p>“—Yeah, I guess so. A guy like you became an S-rank surprised me, you know that?” Suddenly such a voice could be heard from behind.</p>



<p>When I turned around, there was a giant, muscular man—an ‘A-rank’ adventurer, Dill Soltiness. One of those adventurers who would get tangled up with me in any way.</p>



<p>“Do you need something?”</p>



<p>“Nothing, really. It’s just, a guy like you becoming S-rank ahead of me; even now it’s still just unbelievable.”</p>



<p>“Dill-san, fighting inside the guild is—”</p>



<p>“We’re just chatting a bit here. Just shut up.” He glared at the receptionist lady, making her silent. &#8230;There were guys like this occasionally.</p>



<p>About when I just started as an adventurer, he was a B-rank adventurer. He certainly had the ability, but his personality was a problem—he ended up becoming an A-rank adventurer in the end, but that had originally been hindering him.</p>



<p>“And so, now that you’re an S-rank, you can afford to buy a female slave? Oh I’m so jealous.”</p>



<p>“Not quite like that, though.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>I glanced at Aine and saw that she had a blatantly displeased expression on her face. She was also not good with this kind of guy—actually, she probably hated them. If it was the old her, she would’ve lashed out upon realizing that someone was trying to pick a fight, but she was averting her gaze and enduring it. &#8230;<em>I guess it’s better to get out of here quickly</em>.</p>



<p>Before we could though, Dill was looking down at Aine and, “What, you’ve got things to say? You’re just a slave, the hell are you glaring at me for…?”</p>



<p>“Nothing, not really.”</p>



<p>“I’m saying the hell is that attitude. Since the master’s a guy like that, the slave got the nerve to get all cocky.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;! Lunois has nothing to do with this!”</p>



<p>“Aine, don’t mind it.”</p>



<p>“But…!”</p>



<p>“Hah! ‘Lunois,’ eh. If you let your slave talk to you like that, then no wonder the slave got all cocky, huh. Oh right… Let me train her for you. She got a cute face on a second loo—”</p>



<p>“Don’t touch her.”</p>



<p>Dill suddenly stretched out his hand towards Aine. I grabbed his arm, stopping him.</p>



<p>I ended up grabbing it so hard that the sound of bones creaking could be heard. &#8230;I didn’t care about anything said to me, but I would not tolerate anyone who tried to do anything to Aine.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Tsk, you’re a guy who can’t even take jokes.”</p>



<p>Dill shook off my hand and walked away from there. His comrades were also observing the situation from the surrounding at a distance.</p>



<p>Once Dill’s figure was out of sight, Aine sank down on the spot as if she had lost strength.</p>



<p>“Aine!!”</p>



<p>“A-are you all right!?”</p>



<p>“I-I’m okay… but, umm, Lunois.” Aine glanced at me, signaling me with her eyes.</p>



<p>She tried not to let it get discovered by the receptionist lady, who was looking at her worryingly close by—her ‘heat’ started at this moment. Were it to be a bit earlier, it might have happened at the worst timing, but right now the timing was rather just right.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, but can we borrow a small room? I want to let her rest.”</p>



<p>“O-okay. It’s this way!”</p>



<p>Led by the receptionist lady, I moved Aine by carrying her in my arms. To calm Aine down, who was having rough heavy breathing, the ‘act’ would have to be done.</p>



<p>I decided to borrow one of the guild’s reception rooms to let Aine’s body rest. Of course, ‘letting her rest’ was only the front, and it was necessary to calm her ‘heat,’ though.</p>



<p>After requesting that no one should come into the room for a while, I put Aine down on the sofa.</p>



<p>Already breathing roughly and with a pained expression on her face, she still grasped the hem of my clothes with her weak hand and, “why, didn’t you… talk back, and just let the guy earlier, say whatever.”</p>



<p>“About Dill, huh. It’s not like there’s a need to talk back, right?”</p>



<p>“Y-you’re, being made fun of, like that… nn.”</p>



<p>“Aine, no need to talk about that now. I’m gonna calm you down first.” As I gave my confirmation, I put my hands on Aine’s underwear. Her love juices were already flowing from her secret part to the point that it was pulling threads.</p>



<p>With an angry yet embarrassed expression, “I don’t like it… if you’re, made fun of,” Aine said to me.</p>



<p>“I mean, in the past you used to make fun of me a lot, you know?”</p>



<p>“Th-that was, differe… nnahh.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I know. I’ll get angry if there’s something to be angry about.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Like, earlier?”</p>



<p>Like earlier—I nodded to her words.</p>



<p>When Dill tried to touch Aine, I grabbed his arm in earnest and stopped him from doing so.</p>



<p>“I don’t care about anything anyone says to me, but if anyone tries to lay their hands on you, I’m not gonna forgive them. That much is how I feel.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;!”</p>



<p>Hearing my words, Aine averted her gaze with a complicated expression on her face.</p>



<p>Seeing that she didn’t say anything more, she might not have been convinced with it—but I supposed the conversation was over for now.</p>



<p>Gently, I touched Aine’s vagina. First, I touched it in a stroking manner, and Aine’s body maade a small jolt.</p>



<p>“Nn, yahh.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I guess your voice may be a bit too loud.”</p>



<p>“E-even if, you say that, nnahh!”</p>



<p>I knew that Aine was desperately trying to suppress her voice; because I could feel the strength she put into her body even as she was teary eyed.</p>



<p>And then all of her efforts, would be reduced to nothing with just a gentle touch from me.</p>



<p>Even before I put my fingers in, I could see her vaginal opening overflowing with love juices.</p>



<p>I would like to put as little burden on Aine as possible, but I just didn’t have the skills. It would be nice if I could do something about it with my swordsmanship, though.</p>



<p>I pulled out a handkerchief from my pocket, and placed it on Aine’s mouth.</p>



<p>“Here, you can bite this; I want you to bear with it for a bit.”</p>



<p>“Nn, nngh.”</p>



<p>Following my words, Aine bit hard on the handkerchief.</p>



<p>She then folded her arms, taking a posture just for the sake of enduring the stimulation.</p>



<p>Once I confirmed that, slowly, I inserted my fingers into Aine’s vagina.</p>



<p>The already wet vagina of hers was slippery and slick. Aine’s body was making small trembles from the stimulation of my fingers entering her little by little.</p>



<p>When I gently stroked the inside of her vagina, Aine’s voice reached my ears even though she was suppressing it.</p>



<p>“Nnh, fuuhh, nnnnhh! Nnghh!”</p>



<p>The voice wasn’t loud enough to reach the outside yet somehow.</p>



<p>While taking in and out my middle and index finger, I continued to make the stimulation as gentle as possible.</p>



<p>However, I had no idea whether this was the correct choice—I didn’t want to increase the stimulation so as not to hurt Aine, but even just keeping the stimulation gentle might be a burden for her.</p>



<p>This was still only the second time I was doing this… I was also seeing things out as I went.</p>



<p>When trying to make Aine feel good, I knew that her voice would get louder. I also knew that I got to make her cum, but her voice was getting louder and louder as I tried to do so, even though she was biting on a handkerchief.</p>



<p>“Fuhh, fuhh… nnn, ahh, fuhh, uwh&#8230;”</p>



<p>&#8230;It would likely be too cruel to tell her not to make a sound now.</p>



<p>I wouldn’t really mind if people saw me doing something like this. However, she surely wouldn’t want to be seen in her current state. There would be no way she would want to be seen being forced into heat by the power of the collar.</p>



<p>As I was observing Aine and stroking her secret place for a while, the sensation of being sucked in eventually became stronger. The inside of her vagina tightened up; also apparent to me that Aine was gradually making her way to cum.</p>



<p>But, just at that moment, Aine grasped my hand with her feeble strength. She also let go the handkerchief she was biting on and, “wai, waihh a bit, I need, a break, I caaan’t…!”</p>



<p>“Aine, just a bit more.”</p>



<p>“Nn, w-weak, stimulation is, unbearable…!” Aine complained when she was almost there.</p>



<p>I’d thought of being as gentle as possible, but it seemed to have become an extra burden on her. With shaking hands, she managed to reach out to her secret place to protect it. &#8230;But, stopping now for a break wouldn’t relieve Aine. She would just continue to be in heat.</p>



<p>“—Sorry, Aine.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Wh-what are, ahh!”</p>



<p>I grabbed both of Aine’s wrists and forcefully held them up by the top of her head.</p>



<p>Even with only one arm, it wasn’t hard to pin down the current her. It now looked like I was forcing Aine to do things she didn’t want to, but I’d just think about relieving her for now.</p>



<p>“Hah, nooo…. It’s, my limit!”</p>



<p>“It’s just a bit more.”</p>



<p>“Nn, hiahh, naaaahhh!!”</p>



<p>While restraining Aine’s hands, I quickened the movement of my fingers inside her vagina. I also occasionally reached my finger to Aine’s clitoris and touched it so that she could cum sooner.</p>



<p>The sight of Aine looking at me with a pained expression gave a sense of guilty pleasure.</p>



<p><em>It’s for her</em>—telling myself so, I was forcefully doing something I&#8217;d hate to do.</p>



<p>Unable to suppress the loudness of her voice, Aine panted in a shaky voice.</p>



<p>“No, aahh, Lunois, pl-pleaeeease&#8230;!! Stop, alreadyyy..!”</p>



<p>“Aine, just bear with me a bit longer.”</p>



<p>“I caaan’t!! I can’t anymooore!!”</p>



<p>Aine was not liking it like a child throwing a tantrum, perhaps as a result of trying to suppress her voice—at this rate, her voice would end up being heard outside.</p>



<p>Once more, I apologized to Aine in my mind—and gently lapped my lips over hers.</p>



<p>For a moment, Aine must not have been able to understand what had just happened; she opened her eyes wide and showed a surprised expression.</p>



<p>As my lips overlapped with hers so as not to let her voice escape, I sped up the movement of my fingers fingering the inside of her vagina. When our tongues became entwined, Aine’s body finally began to tremble greatly.</p>



<p>“Nn, mmh, nnnh, cum, mming!!”</p>



<p>Her hips were floating and then lost strength. I slowly pulled away from Aine, who had stopped moving. Saliva stretched from our mouths like a thread; and when I pulled my fingers, her love juice also stretched like a thread.</p>



<p>With moist eyes, “Lu-Lunois, you dummy&#8230;” Aine muttered quietly.</p>



<p>“Yeah… sorry,” I just apologized to Aine.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, I successfully managed to calm her heat down—<em>I have a feeling I probably won’t ever get used to this</em>.</p>



<p>After calming down Aine’s ‘heat,’ I simply waited for the time to pass. Also without a word, Aine sat down on the sofa and was staring out the window.</p>



<p>Although inevitable, I forcefully snatched a kiss from her… That was, probably not something that would ever be forgiven.</p>



<p><em>&#8230;But first, let’s wait for her to calm down</em>, I thought. Though, suddenly, “&#8230;it’s not like I’m angry, okay,” Aine spoke up<em>.</em> “I mean, it can’t be helped. I mean, I’m also the one getting help. So, I don’t really mind.”</p>



<p>The way she said it was obvious that she was minding it, but doing like this to each other couldn’t be helped either.</p>



<p>If that was what Aine had to say, then I would also respond to her words. “&#8230;Yeah, sorry.”</p>



<p>“I already said I don’t mind it.”</p>



<p>“I know.”</p>



<p>I just thought I’d apologize one last time. Aine cast a glance in my direction and, “but, th-that kinda thing, should be more… um, like, the situation is&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Situation…?”</p>



<p>“Ah geez, it’s nothing! Anyway, this conversation is over! Thank you, for helping me,” Aine said, trying to get back into form.</p>



<p>I nodded in reply. When I thought that this might happen again tomorrow, as expected, I still would like to resolve the problem with her collar as soon as possible, though.</p>



<p>“&#8230;For now, please stay here and rest, Aine. The guild leader also could be back soon. I’m gonna tell them so no one will come inside, okay?”</p>



<p>“Then I will also… ah.”</p>



<p>Aine tried to stand up, but lost her balance. It should take a bit more time for her to get back into form.</p>



<p>I supported her body and slowly sat her down on the sofa.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to force yourself. I’ll be back quickly.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Okay.” Aine nodded her head in understanding.</p>



<p>I left the room leaving her behind.</p>



<p>As I was about to go back to the receptionist, I was called out by a woman before I could.</p>



<p>“Yo, I was a bit surprised you’re accompanied by a girl, you know?”</p>



<p>When I turned to look, there was a black-haired woman with a mature feel to her. Her hair was tied in a braid, and she was wearing a black-rimmed glasses. Although she gave off a docile feel at first glance, her attire was a very revealing one to contradict that.</p>



<p>Runan Kirdl—a former A-rank adventurer currently working as the guild leader of this adventurer’s guild. She was one of the top adventurers in terms of ability, but had to retire at a young age due to injury and was now in her current position.</p>



<p>She was all grinning—likely wanting to tease me about the fact that I had bought a girl slave.</p>



<p>“Guild leader, you called me here but now you’re late?”</p>



<p>“Still as sassy as ever, aren’t you.”</p>



<p>“You’re giving off the feeling that you’re looking down on me so&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Oh, you know—wait, it’s not like I’m making light of you, alright. I just thought even you will buy a slave, huh; something like that.”</p>



<p>I supposed Runan was saying that out of pure doubt. I’d had a lot of chances to talk to her so I knew. Being a guild leader, I believed that she was someone trustworthy, setting aside her personality.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well, I just thought I could have some help for my job.”</p>



<p>“Ooh. Well, you bought a slave and… I’m not gonna tell you what to do ‘cause of it. I was just kind of touched that you’re also interested in girls.”</p>



<p>“I think saying it like that is misleading, though&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Hahaha, that might be right. Now, don’t just stand and talk. Let’s continue this in my room.”</p>



<p>In reply to Runan’s words, I followed after her.</p>



<p>The guild leader’s room was located at the back of the building’s third floor.</p>



<p>I entered the room and was greeted by an abundance of weapons, giving off the resemblance of some training ground as always.</p>



<p>Once Runan and I were seated facing each other, she quickly laid out papers on the table; all containing information about nothing but monsters and the like.</p>



<p>“Go ahead, take whatever you want. If you like, you can even take all of them!”</p>



<p>“All of them? Are you trying to get me to die from overwork?”</p>



<p>“Ahaha, as long as it’s nothing urgent, you can take your time doing it. They’re pretty much requests from the country after all.”</p>



<p>Many of the requests that Runan brought to me were requests coming directly from the Kingdom. They were also supposed to be maintaining a military force, the so-called ‘Knight Order,’ but still… they would send requests for things impossible to resolve or things they couldn’t handle to the adventurer’s guild.</p>



<p>“With this many jobs, it’s making the country’s future worrying, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“It’s always good to know that we have jobs. On the flip side, I suppose that means there are few capable people. Well, there are few decent people even at S-rank, so it helps when there are relatively decent guys like you, you know?”</p>



<p>“I believe it should be plenty decent and not relatively, though.”</p>



<p>I picked up the request papers that was handed to me and started to flip through it.</p>



<p>“Hey, the first request is the ‘Wandering Dragon’ Granvalis who came to this continent for the first time in five years, you know? You should take a better look at it.”</p>



<p>“How many people will be working on this request…?”</p>



<p>“Well, no doubt it’s going to be large-scale I suppose. I won’t stop you if you want to do it alone, though!”</p>



<p>Of course, I never said a single word I would accept it.</p>



<p>It seemed to have been handed to me appropriately; requests of high importance were grouped together at the upper part—at the lower part, there were more investigation requests and such.</p>



<p>Although not high urgency, there were also requests that were top secret. And one of them caught my eye.</p>



<p>“&#8230;The Empire?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it seems to be two ‘mages’ who came across the border without permission. I heard it’s also unknown why they came here, you know? The ‘Knight Order’ still can’t deal with it, so it looks like they sent it here as a request. Well, the urgency is not that high.” So Runan said, but it was also a well-timed request for me.</p>



<p>This meant, that someone from Laveira Empire were coming to our side in secret. Doing such a thing would most likely akin to something related to a job from the country.</p>



<p>I decided to take on several jobs, including that one.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


			
<p>Aine was alone, left behind in the room waiting for Lunois to return. ‘Heat’ that would come without fail once a day—only this was something she couldn’t do anything about.</p>



<p>Always being left alone and such until becoming docile when she had just fallen into slavery… She had gone through nothing but misery.</p>



<p>Because of the effect of the collar, Aine hadn’t had even a single peaceful day in her life.</p>



<p>However, there was Lunois now. Aine knew full well that he cared for her to no end.</p>



<p>Gentle with his fingers, and would never try to do anything Aine would hate—that had been the case yesterday. …Though, today was a bit different.</p>



<p>“&#8230;” Recalling what had just happened, Aine’s body shivered.</p>



<p>She had thought she could endure it, but being touched by Lunois was a whole different story. His slow, gentle fingers felt so good in every way, and at the same time, so excruciating for Aine.</p>



<p>By no means did it feel unpleasant—but today, she just hadn’t been able to endure it.</p>



<p>So she had resisted, but Lunois had forcefully restrained her from doing so and continued the act.</p>



<p><em>…A-am, am I, aroused…?</em></p>



<p>The heat should have already stopped, yet she could feel her own private part getting wet—she could feel her body burning up when she remembered it.</p>



<p>Additionally, even the kiss at the time she’d been fingered forcefully… Her face was burning up; she couldn’t help but cover her face even though there was no one around.</p>



<p>It was because, she hadn&#8217;t expected Lunois to be so aggressive.</p>



<p><em>It’s, my fault I couldn’t hold down my voice, but… t-to think he went for a kiss… B-but…</em></p>



<p>—She couldn’t believe that the act earlier had felt the most pleasant—</p>



<p><em>No, that makes me… sound just like a pervert, doesn’t it. I mean, Lunois did it so my voice wouldn’t get out, so…</em></p>



<p>She could tell that he was being really earnest regarding Aine in every way. He had also apologized about the kiss; she could also tell that Lunois somewhat hadn’t bought it even after telling him that she didn’t mind it. And of course, saying she didn’t mind it would be a lie.</p>



<p>What bothered Aine was, whether Lunois hadn’t been reluctant himself about the kiss.</p>



<p>She would like to confirm it, but there was no way Aine could confirm such a thing out of her mouth.</p>



<p><em>If he were also doing it regularly and instead of at a place like this… he doesn’t hate it, maybe</em>, Aine thought in such fashion.</p>



<p>Her voice had ended up becoming loud, so he had decided to kiss her without a second thought. For example, if this was at his home or a situation where she could let out her voice and it wasn’t blocked…</p>



<p><em>…I, shouldn&#8217;t even be in a position to think about such a thing… I wonder if it’s okay.</em></p>



<p>Hugging her knees, Aine was just repeatedly wondering to herself<em>.</em></p>



<p>Always so in the time Lunois was not around—Aine liked Lunois. However, now a slave, she thought that she had no qualification to have feelings for Lunois.</p>



<p>And yet—although the effect of the collar—as she was touched by Lunois and the act kept on, that feeling grew stronger and stronger, a far cry from being repulsed.</p>



<p><em>Lunois… please come back soon</em>.</p>



<p>Aine was alone, worrying until Lunois came back.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>



<p>Carrying several request papers with me, I returned back to the reception room where Aine was waiting for me. When I entered the room, Aine sent a glance at my direction, saying, “welcome back. It took a bit long, didn&#8217;t it.”</p>



<p>“Is that so? I don’t think it took that long, though…”</p>



<p>“I feel like I waited pretty long.”</p>



<p>“Then sorry to keep you waiting. Let’s now go back to the inn.”</p>



<p>“Nn.” Aine nodded and stood up.</p>



<p>Her body seemed to have recovered and she didn’t look wobbly.</p>



<p>Today’s objectives were done with this—though, I had planned to take some more jobs, but there was Aine so I hadn’t taken that many.</p>



<p>I needed to stay in the royal capital for a while to complete several jobs. For the most part, the requests were about ‘monsters’ subjugation. It wasn’t like it was only jobs that couldn’t be taken unless you were an S-rank, but the adventurer’s guild was flexible in that regard.</p>



<p>If the request was something needed to be done quickly and was of high urgency, it would often be sent to me.</p>



<p>In fact, there had been a time where I’d been requested to deal with monsters that had appeared near the main road connecting the royal capital and another town requiring the ability comparable to A-rank.</p>



<p>Although called ‘comparable to A-rank,’ there were also some monsters with a strength requiring manpower on the scale of several people; some monsters even possessed the strength of ‘many in number.’</p>



<p>And adventurers who were able to deal with all of that would be recognized as S-rank.</p>



<p>In my case, I was the type who was more suited to a one-on-one fight rather than a fight against several monsters, though.</p>



<p>When I exited the adventurer’s guild carrying the request papers I’d received under my arm, Aine peeked with a glance curiously.</p>



<p>“What kind of requests did you get?”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing that hard.”</p>



<p>“Hmmm, can I see it?”</p>



<p>“Sure—ah, I guess after we get back. There’s also some top-secret request here.”</p>



<p>“Ah… If that’s the case, then all right. But, ‘top-secret’ and all, you look like an S-rank adventurer.”</p>



<p>“Ahaha, I am an S-ranked adventurer, though.”</p>



<p>I had almost shown Aine the requests there and then.</p>



<p>Among the requests I had taken—there was a request for investigation regarding ‘the Empire’s mages.’ There were two of them; one of whom was a man in a black suit with a hat pulled down over the eyes.</p>



<p>The other one was a giant man; clad in a robe, but he was said to be so large that he could be mistaken for a monster.</p>



<p>Both of them seemed like the type of combination who would stand out when seen in any town, but according to the story, they even had arrived in this royal capital.</p>



<p>It was also one of the reasons why I had decided to stay here for a while.</p>



<p>Of course, it didn’t look like these two knew about Aine, thus it also didn’t look like I would be able to obtain any information about ‘Sexualification Collar.’</p>



<p>However, it might even become a stepping stone towards the Empire—if I were to accomplish this job, I’d be able to demand a value-added reward, which would be to have an investigation done on information about the Empire.</p>



<p>Merely anticipating a similar situation to arise in the future, I would like to know about the Empire side of things… Were I to give such a reason, even an adventurer like me would be able to get quite a bit of information.</p>



<p>It might be a roundabout way to go, but this was where I intended to start my investigation.</p>



<p>If Aine were to know this, she might even end up misunderstanding it as me ‘trying to go to the Empire;’ I would not want to add unnecessary worry to her.</p>



<p>I would like to have her get used to this life first, and have her return to the girl she used to be—a relationship where we could improve each other, sword to sword.</p>



<p>Suddenly, with that in my mind, an arms store dealing with bladed weapons caught my eye.</p>



<p>It was a small store and had items that suited it. A store that was just right for someone just starting as an adventurer. Aine also, she was looking at the store with interest.</p>



<p>“Say, let’s stop by there.”</p>



<p>“! You have something to buy?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like that, though; well, there might be just some good buy or something.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;If you wanna go take a look, okay then.”</p>



<p>Aine didn’t outwardly say that she ‘wanna look,’ but that expression of hers looked somewhat happy.</p>



<p>Before she had become a knight, she had just been a ‘swordswoman.’ She must be especially interested in weapons she herself had handled, such as swords and daggers.</p>



<p>Along with Aine, I entered the store. I already could tell from the outside, but it really didn’t seem to have that unusual of equipment—however, they were all simple made and looked easy to handle.</p>



<p>The large number of different types of straight sword to suit various physiques and such was astounding.</p>



<p>I used to look at weapons in places like this when I had just become an adventurer as well.</p>



<p>“Ooh, there’s quite a lot of stuff. Since knights only get supplied stuff, I think it’s been a while since I took a look at stores like this.”</p>



<p>“I see. Are you still using straight swords?”</p>



<p>“Right. The heavier ones really are easy to swing. I mean there are lots of girls using rapiers, but they’re easy to break against something like hard monsters. Well, it won’t matter if you just reinforce it with magic power, but straight swords really just have more power to it.”</p>



<p>“I think I’m with you there. Well then, should I buy a sword that suits you?”</p>



<p>“! For me…?” Aine said, looking slightly surprised.</p>



<p>I nodded and looked at the lined up swords. “Which one you like?”</p>



<p>“Wa-wait a second. You said you’d buy a sword for me… umm, is that okay?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s fine… Is there a problem?” I asked and Aine held her tongue.</p>



<p>Seeing her reactions, she must still like swinging swords. …Even if life as a knight had become a traumatic one, the core of who she was shouldn’t have changed.</p>



<p>So, that must be why she was looking at the swords wistfully.</p>



<p>“Not really a problem, I mean… Is it okay, me using a sword?”</p>



<p>“If you don’t want to fight anymore, then I’m not gonna give you a sword. But, if you still want to swing a sword, I just think it’s better to carry one. In any case, we also have to do jobs together.”</p>



<p>“Your jobs…? But, I, umm… have, <em>that</em>.”</p>



<p>Just from the word ‘that,’ I knew what Aine tried to say.</p>



<p>She even had ended up in ‘heat’ at the adventurer’s guild today—she must have a fear of holding me down because of that were we to do jobs together.</p>



<p>Naturally, I’d also think twice about taking Aine to do my jobs together if I gave that a second thought.</p>



<p>However, it might become a burden to her if I wasn’t together with her and made her wait; more than anything, I was worried about leaving her alone.</p>



<p>I also believed that being together would have the distance between me and Aine to shorten. If there was any danger, I would just have to give my all to protect her.</p>



<p>“In that case, I’ll manage it so it’s gonna be all right.”</p>



<p>“Manage it… Doing it outside is, a bit…”</p>



<p>“Ah, that’s what you mean, huh…”</p>



<p>“B-but! I want to help you with your job, Lunois. Even now, I want to do what I can. That’s why, can we… buy this?”</p>



<p>What Aine chose was a sword with a silver blade with a slight green tinge.</p>



<p>It was a straight sword that looked easy to use and matched her physique—I took the sword Aine had chosen and, “I’m gonna go buy it, just a minute.”</p>



<p>“Okay, thanks.”</p>



<p>Carrying the sword, I headed towards the shopkeeper.</p>



<p>Aine was indeed a keen observer of swords—I felt, too, that she had picked a rather good one out of this store. Once she was a little more comfortable, I would like to bring her to some of the better stores. Because right now, she must have a bigger feeling of being reserved.</p>



<p>After sheathing the sword I had purchased, I made my way back to Aine.</p>



<p>And there—I saw a group of men standing in front of Aine.</p>



<p>“Lookie here, just when I thought someone glaring, it’s Lunois’ slave. What the hell you’re doing here?”</p>



<p>A big man—Dill—was standing in front of Aine, looking down at her.</p>



<p>Aine as well, she faced Dill undaunted.</p>



<p>The fact that I hadn’t taken a strong stand against him earlier, as expected, must have caused this. Aine, too, was conveying a clear intent to confront him. However, Aine clenched her fists tightly to hold it in, “&#8230;I’m not glaring or anything,” and she replied, briefly.</p>



<p>However, not looking pleased with that attitude of hers, Dill approached her while glaring.</p>



<p>“Hah! What a real irritating little girl. Got a good face, though… How ‘bout it? Really want me to train you?”</p>



<p>“I’d rather die.”</p>



<p>“The hell? You’re just a slave don’t go act all cocky!” Dill raised his fist.</p>



<p>Aine also readied herself in preparation for the blow. That sight of Aine bore a close resemblance of the old her. But, that fist was never swung down to Aine.</p>



<p>I drew out the sword on my waist and struck a blow—creating a wound on Dill’s big arm, deep enough to reach the bone. Blood scattered; I threw the robe I was wearing over Dill’s wound so that it would not hit Aine.</p>



<p>Dill was trying to hold down his wound in pain, but that movement of his came to a complete halt.</p>



<p>In surprise, Aine was also looking at me—at me who was positioning my sword against Dill’s neck.</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2021/12/eigjieshg3eiszhilsssiioi.jpeg"></img>


<p>“Arg, guh, bastard…!?”</p>



<p>“Lunois…!?”</p>



<p>The two were surprised. I looked down on Dill who fell on his knees, “it’s the second time, Dill,” and bluntly said to him.</p>



<p>“W-whaat…?”</p>



<p>“I have told you not to touch her. And yet, it looks like you tried to break it again. …It might be because I was being soft. So, this is your last warning—don’t touch her, don’t go near her, don’t show yourself in front of me again. If I ever see you again… I’ll cut your head off.”</p>



<p>Dill’s complexion changed. I’d never shown myself this headstrong before—I had never even drawn a sword in a town in the first place.</p>



<p>Dill’s followers were looking at me with a completely frightened look.</p>



<p>Although a quarrel between fellow adventurers could easily become a problem… if one side showed a thorough attitude, the problem could be solved surprisingly easily.</p>



<p>It took a form like redeeming from what Aine had criticized me earlier was not because what she had said—was to be honest, hard to say.</p>



<p>However, if I openly made this kind of display, at least there should be nobody who would try to mess with Aine.</p>



<p>Even Dill, who had been making an arrogant attitude towards me until now, finally showed an expression of unwillingness to fight, “I-I got it…! I’m not gonna appear in front of you anymore. I’m leaving this town…!” and said, hurriedly leaving with his comrades to run away from us—seeing that, I let out a small sigh.</p>



<p>“Aine, I want you to come to me right away in a situation like that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I-it’s because I thought you wouldn’t say anything back again.”</p>



<p>“If Dill didn’t raise his fist, I probably wouldn’t have said anything back, though. But, he tried to harm you—I’ll be mindful to do it that way from the beginning next time. Here, your sword.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Next time, I will at least protect myself,” Aine said as she received the sword from me.</p>



<p>Certainly, she should at least be able to protect herself if she had a sword—with that in mind, if we ever came across such a situation, I would swing my sword faster than her next time. I swore so in my heart.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


			
<p>I returned back to the inn with Aine for the time being. Once again, we were faced with the problem of the room—having only one bed in the room would indeed be too small.</p>



<p>“Okay, I’m gonna go out again for a bit.”</p>



<p>“Eh, even though we just got back?”</p>



<p>“I just forgot to check if there are any free rooms in other inns. It’s still pretty early in the day anyway.” When I was about to leave the room, Aine grabbed me by the hem of my clothes. I reflexively stopped walking and looked back. “Aine?”</p>



<p>“I, don’t really mind it like this, though,” Aine spoke up.</p>



<p>Perhaps, she might be thinking that changing inn would be another burden on me.</p>



<p>Certainly, this inn’s rent was cheap. Though, it didn’t mean that I would be living a difficult life with that degree of burden on me.</p>



<p>“I can at least afford to rent two rooms, you know.”</p>



<p>“T-two…?”</p>



<p>“Nn, so don’t worry about it, okay…?”</p>



<p>“It-it’s fine with just one room. Umm, it’ll be troubling when it suddenly comes, so…”</p>



<p>“Ah, I guess you’re right…”</p>



<p>At night—it could possibly come when sleeping.</p>



<p>Having that in mind, perhaps it would indeed be better with only one room.</p>



<p>“Even the bed, it’s also not that cramped to sleep in. …If you think it’s hard for you, then I think we should just change the room, though.”</p>



<p>“I’ve said I can sleep even when sitting, haven’t I? I also don’t mind it if you’re all right with it, Aine.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m, all right with it.”</p>



<p>We were confirming each other’s OK with it, and settling it there. It was indeed still hard for me to not be too considerate.</p>



<p>Now it’d come to this, then I would have to sleep closely with Aine again today, huh—I didn’t mind it, but I was worried whether it would be a burden on Aine.</p>



<p>She was a girl, and she also didn&#8217;t seem to like having me sleep sitting on a chair. I didn’t want her to be self-deprecating too much, but… it might be hard for her who had fallen into the position of a slave.</p>



<p>As I was in my thoughts, Aine suddenly grabbed the sword that just had been bought and unsheathed it from its scabbard. While looking at the sword blade, she was grasping at the hilt as if to ascertain it.</p>



<p>“Fufu… Like, it’s been so long since I’ve held a sword,” she said with a smile.</p>



<p>I was relieved seeing Aine like that—as expected, she was who she was because of the sword.</p>



<p>“I think it’d be nice to have some training with you after so long, you know?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s nice to hear, but I wonder if I can be your match.”</p>



<p>“To think that you’re being modest with swordsmanship.”</p>



<p>The old Aine would have at least asserted: ‘I’m sure I’ll win even if we did it, though!’</p>



<p>With a slightly dissatisfied expression on her face, “wh-when I saw your swordsmanship, even I’m gonna be anxious. …After not meeting for so long, you’ve become too strong unlike someone like me. When you cut the arm of that guy named Dill or something, I could hardly follow it with my eyes after all,” Aine said.</p>



<p>She must be talking about the swordsmanship I’d shown earlier.</p>



<p>Kicking the floor from the inside of the store, and striking a blow with the momentum—at that distance, it wouldn’t even be that hard to kill most people.</p>



<p>Even monsters; if I were to target precisely at their weak points, I could slain them in less than several seconds. Certainly, you could even say that I was excelling in swordsmanship now. However, Aine was the reason I was who I was now.</p>



<p>“I might’ve told you this before, but you’re the reason I got this far. Well, it’s because you’re my goal.”</p>



<p>“Y-your goal… if you’re making someone like me a goal, you’ll become weak, you know?”</p>



<p>“Nope, I won’t; that’s how I got this strong. While at it, how about we go to the yard and have a bit of training?” following the flow, I suggested so to Aine. If it had been so long since she’d held a sword, then training would indeed be necessary.</p>



<p>We would be acting together from now, so a part of me also would want to see her current ability with the sword. And Aine nodded, showing no apparent disapproval.</p>



<p>“Right… I’m gonna be helping you from now on anyway. And I suppose I won’t have such luxury like an S-ranked adventurer watching over me.“</p>



<p>“It’s nothing that big of a deal, you know.”</p>



<p>“That modest part of you, it really hasn’t changed at all.”</p>



<p>Being told so, “is that so?” I replied like I was playing ignorant.</p>



<p>I didn’t mean to be modest. Just that there were many more people stronger than me.</p>



<p>When I had that in mind, I couldn’t even bring myself to make such a big deal out of it. …If it was to protect Aine, I could say and even do just about the right things, though—in that sense, I might always had been too considerate of her and unable to close the distance between us.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Lunois?”</p>



<p>“Ah, it’s nothing. Well then, let’s do some light training today.”</p>



<p>I left the room with Aine—thus, for the first time in a long time, I would train together with her.</p>



<p>There was a slightly large yard behind the inn. Guests of the inn were free to use it, and there were times when people doing light exercise or families with children were hanging out here.</p>



<p>Now it was just me and Aine—while grasping the hilt of the sword as if to ascertain it, Aine put a light step forward.</p>



<p>“Fuuh—”</p>



<p>In one breath, a flash. A quick sword strike cutting through the empty space.</p>



<p>Next, two strikes. Aine had said she hadn’t held a sword in a long time, but her movement was pretty without showing any signs of weakening at all.</p>



<p>I ended up charmed by that sight—her movement had become much more refined than when we had trained before.</p>



<p>“How, is it?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, very pretty.”</p>



<p>“P-prett…?!”</p>



<p>“No wasted movement. It doesn’t look like ‘it’s been so long’ at all.”</p>



<p>“Ah… O-of course. It’s the swordsmanship, right,” Aine said with some kind of disappointment. I meant to honestly praise her, but perhaps she was unhappy with the movement just now.</p>



<p>And the sword I’d bought for her seemed to fit her well, as she herself had chosen it.</p>



<p>“And then next is your swordsmanship, c’mon show it.”</p>



<p>“Alright. I’ll also do three light swings.”</p>



<p>Urged by Aine, I drew my sword from its scabbard. The sword blade with a slightly black luster was made from an ore called ‘Chlorestia.’ It was extremely hard, requiring high heat and dedicated processing tools to process it.</p>



<p>It might be obvious, but for adventurers using a sword, the weapon itself was their life. For me, who seldom relied on using magic in the first place as my fighting method, a sword that could be used for a long time was precious as well as essential.</p>



<p>Although it was an expensive material, I had obtained it myself and requested a workshop to make it into a sword.</p>



<p>Lightly grasping the hilt, I took a stance. While feeling the wind blowing on my skin, I focused my mind.</p>



<p>I took a step with my right foot and slashed horizontally. Following the sound of the wind being cut, the second strike. I swung the sword downwards, and stopped just right before it touched the ground. Followed by the third strike—a strike like slashing up, returning the blade. Once the general flow was complete, I released my stance.</p>



<p>“Something like that, I guess.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Aine?”</p>



<p>“As expected, you’re growing so much. To the point it’s presumptuous saying it that way.”</p>



<p>“I mean, you’re also growing.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah. But, you really are special. I feel somewhat relieved.”</p>



<p>I thought Aine would be feeling down again, but what she showed was a smile.</p>



<p>As she stood next to me, she pointed at her feet, “when you took the step for the horizontal swing of the first strike, you still put in quite the strength, right? It’s slightly gouged into the ground. It’s always been like that, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. Even though I’ve taught you the first strike will be delayed then. …Well, the level of the swinging speed is different to begin with, so maybe it’s not worth worrying about, though.”</p>



<p>“Nuh-uh, I want you to teach me about things like that. This is training after all.”</p>



<p>“I-is that so…? Then, what about me? Is there anything…?”</p>



<p>“Your sword is… pretty and no hesitation I’d say.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Not like that, I’m hoping for points of improvement.”</p>



<p>“Nothing comes up.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Ahahah, that part of you hasn’t changed either. You suck at teaching!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sorry about that.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s fine. Just feel free to tell me if there’s anything catching your attention; because today I want you to train me.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, got it.”</p>



<p>Without crossing swords, Aine and I did practice-swinging, examining one another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it turned out to be a worthwhile training and it even made me feel somewhat nostalgic. Sword—it was connecting me with Aine. Indeed, I could assure that.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, we were training together until nightfall.</p>



<p>A while later after finishing training, I was alone in the bathroom adjacent to the room. Despite the bathroom being small, it even got a bathtub. Though, I thought of just going with shower today.</p>



<p>I was making Aine wait—I’d told her to go first, but she’d told me she would want to go in after resting for a bit.</p>



<p>I recalled the training earlier all the while showering with warm water.</p>



<p>Aine was saying that it’d been so long since she’d held a sword, but even judging from the practice swinging alone, she would be plenty capable as an adventurer.</p>



<p>There should be no particular problem for her and me to act together. If anything could be a problem, it would be the ‘heat’ that would come once a day—when that happened, Aine would weaken her so much she would be unable to move.</p>



<p>For example, if that were to happen while we were in the middle of our job… it’d be fine when resting time, but thinking that it could be happening when fighting monsters and such made me anxious. Even telling her to just stand back and watch because I was worried about that would surely end up hurting her. …In that case, I’d just have to do my best to protect her, though.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Guess I’ll go wash up.”</p>



<p>When I stopped the running water, I could hear the door suddenly opening with a creak.</p>



<p><em>I guess I didn’t close it properly</em>. When I turned around trying to close the door—my gaze locked with hers as she stood there.</p>



<p>“Aine, sorry. I made you wai—!?”</p>



<p>I couldn’t help but open my eyes wide in surprise.</p>



<p>What came into my view was her, stark naked. She was standing there, with her right hand trying to hide her chest and her left hand her private part. She might be trying to cover them, but I could see the pink nipples through the gap between her fingers.</p>



<p>The sight of her, naked and wearing the iron collar, was somewhat immoral.</p>



<p>She was slender, but her body that had worked as a knight looked firm. While biting her lower lip and with her face bright red, “d-don’t look too hard,” she said in a small voice.</p>



<p>“S-sorry!”</p>



<p>I quickly averted my gaze. …No, something was weird.</p>



<p>It was Aine who walked into the bathroom naked. She knew I was inside and was coming in—the sound of the door closing reached my ears, and I could feel Aine was standing so close to me.</p>



<p>I did see her secret place yesterday and today, but… this was the first time I saw her stark naked like this.</p>



<p>“E-errm… I’m going out now, okay?”</p>



<p>“Then there’ll be no meaning in me coming in.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Meaning?”</p>



<p>“You helped me with training… so at least, I’m gonna wash your back.”</p>



<p>Apparently, she entered the bathroom for that reason. This bathroom was quite small for two people, but… Aine grabbed me by the shoulder and had me sit on the small stool in the bathroom.</p>



<p>“I’ll always come with you if it’s just raining, so you really don’t have to do this…”</p>



<p>“I-I’m doing this because I want to. Or, is this just bothering you…?” Aine’s voice became small.</p>



<p>I turned my gaze slightly towards her—without any reason, I was a little hesitant about seeing her naked.</p>



<p>However, I would never feel unpleasant towards Aine’s goodwill. I looked back to the front, “then, I’m leaving it to you.”</p>



<p>“! S-sure thing!” I could hear Aine’s slightly cheerful voice at my words.</p>



<p>After a bit of silence, she started scrubbing my back with a cloth in her hands. <em>I wonder how long it’s been since I’ve had someone wash my back</em>—with just the right amount of force, it felt somewhat good.</p>



<p>“Thanks for today,” Aine said so while scrubbing my back.</p>



<p>“About the sword? Don’t worry about it.”</p>



<p>“About the sword, about the training… Somehow, it feels like it’s been so long since I spent a normal day. Because I really didn’t have anything like freedom.”</p>



<p>“In that case, I’m the one who should be saying thanks.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Because it’s been a while since I&#8217;ve had fun, I guess. It’s really been so long since I’ve swung a sword for fun.”</p>



<p>Swinging a sword for an adventurer’s job and swinging a sword with Aine were completely different—I really enjoyed the time we spent together.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s making me a bit embarrassed somehow, being told that.”</p>



<p>“More embarrassing than now?”</p>



<p>“D-don’t mention it. There’s no way, it’s not embarrassing.”</p>



<p>“S-sorry.”</p>



<p>I thought of cracking a joke a bit, but I immediately apologized after hearing Aine’s words. Thinking of our current situation, there would be no way she wouldn’t be embarrassed.</p>



<p>And after another bit of silence, Aine spoke up. “Then, time to switch.”</p>



<p>“Eh, switch…?”</p>



<p>“W-we’re already in together now, and I’ve also taught you about the sword, so this much is okay, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;If you’re all right with it, then I don’t mind, though.”</p>



<p>I stood up in the small bathroom and tried to switch places making sure to avoid seeing Aine’s naked body to the utmost. However, she just stood in front of me, this time without showing any gesture of covering herself.</p>



<p>“A-Aine…?”</p>



<p>“If you keep looking away like that, you can’t wash mine, right…?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Aren’t you the one who said not to look.”</p>



<p>“Yep, but… as expected if it’s you, Lunois, I want you to look properly.”</p>



<p>Hearing Aine saying such a thing with upturned eyes, I could feel my heart pounding. From my perspective, Aine was a very cute girl. And such a girl was standing in front of me, exposing her naked body despite looking bashful—for some reason, I felt much more nervous than I would when doing the act with her due to the effect of ‘Sexualification Collar.’</p>



<p>When Aine’s gaze snatched a glance downwards, she quickly averted it.</p>



<p>“! F-for now… can you, wash my back?”</p>



<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>



<p>Prompted by Aine, her and I finally switched places. …It was somewhat embarrassing, having my penis, which had gotten big from seeing her figure, seen by her.</p>



<p>Aine didn’t expressly touch on this point and just sat down on the stool with her head down.</p>



<p>Gently, I touched her back.</p>



<p>“Nn.” Aine squirmed her body a little while letting out a moan.</p>



<p>Reflexively, I pulled away the towel in my hands from her body.</p>



<p>“Errr…?”</p>



<p>“It-it’s just ticklish. Umm, my back’s also, a bit sensitive…”</p>



<p>“I see… Can you, endure it?”</p>



<p>“Nn, I will.”</p>



<p>I felt conflicted with the words ‘my back’s also,’ but I’d just let it be.</p>



<p>Once more, I touched Aine’s back with a towel to wipe it—with a jolt, her body still shook a little.</p>



<p>Though, this time she didn’t leak a voice. She seemed to be trying to endure me finishing wiping her back quietly by holding her hands over her mouth.</p>



<p>“&#8230;!!”</p>



<p>Even though I was only supposed to be washing her back, the sight of Aine enduring it like that made her look somewhat sensual.</p>



<p>It was somehow unlike when she was in ‘heat’ because of the effect of the collar… She reacted so much it made me want to tease her somehow.</p>



<p>When I wiped the nape of her neck, she ducked her head while leaking out just a bit of voice.</p>



<p>“Nn.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’re weak here, too?”</p>



<p>“! N-not at all.”</p>



<p>She seemed to be honest when talking about it herself, but she seemed to be prone to act tough when I asked it.</p>



<p>From the back to the armpits—and when I wiped further down her sides, she made an obvious uncomfortable gesture and leaked a pant.</p>



<p>“Ah, kuh.”</p>



<p>“You can’t endure it? Just a bit more till done.”</p>



<p>“I-I’m fine. Fuh, it’s just, ticklish.”</p>



<p>Aine sent a glance towards me—the sight of Aine looking over here with tears in the corners of her eyes was terribly cute, also making me want to touch her a little more. …However, even continuing too much might become a real burden on her.</p>



<p>From there, I decided to wash her back in earnest. Still, it was enough to say that her reaction was sensitive, though.</p>



<p>By the time I finished washing her, I noticed that Aine was breathing raggedly as if she had just finished training.</p>



<p>“Hah, fuh, d-done…?”</p>



<p>“It’s done. You can wash the front yourself, right?”</p>



<p>“O-of course I can, you dummy!” Aine took the towel from me with an angry look on her face.</p>



<p>In the small bathroom, Aine and I were spending our bath time like this.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


			
<p>Night—Aine and I were lying on the same bed again. …With just a bit of an awkward mood, we both had our backs on each other, perhaps also because of the matter in the bathroom.</p>



<p>It’d been just washing each other’s backs, but… there hadn’t even been an opportunity of seeing each other naked even when we’d been kids. …She’d done it as a way of expressing her gratitude, so of course I felt grateful—I mustn’t do things to blow away the goodwill of hers.</p>



<p>It’d be a lie to say I hadn’t gotten aroused from seeing Aine’s naked body, seeing her bashful sight. However, if I were to lay my hands on such her, I had a feeling it’d look like that had been my aim from buying her who had fallen into slavery, which I somewhat didn’t want to.</p>



<p>I just, would love Aine to return to her old self, a cheerful and strong woman.</p>



<p>But, it didn’t feel like she’d been pushing herself. Of course, Aine had hung her head down in embarrassment when entering the bathroom, but when switching places with me—she’d said she wanted me to look properly.</p>



<p>I’d thought that whether it was about Aine’s body at that time, but thinking back on it, I wondered if it was about facing Aine properly.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Fuhh.” I let out a small sigh. Seeing Aine attached with a collar, I’d moved immediately to save her. Aine was a childhood friend; we’d always been together in the past, so saving her was natural.</p>



<p>At least, I thought so. Even Aine, she would come to my help if I were in a crisis…That was how close I thought we were.</p>



<p>But, I couldn’t understand how Aine really felt. It was no more than me, who’d become her master, unavoidably suppressing her, who was forced to go into heat from the effect of the collar—I thought we’d be building that kind of relationship.</p>



<p>And yet, last night she’d slept as if to touch me, and today we’d even washed each other’s backs. I could tell that Aine was actively trying to touch me.</p>



<p>I mustn&#8217;t remember it, but I even ended up remembering Aine masturbating. I also got no courage to strike up a conversation with Aine regarding that, and she surely would not want me to bring that up.</p>



<p>But, perhaps, Aine got a thing for me. I wondered if it meant that I was harboring a wicked feeling for her, having felt so only a short time after our reunion—I wondered if it was with that feeling that I’d thought of saving her.</p>



<p>…I just, thought of wanting to cherish Aine. Making sure she wouldn’t get hurt any further—and that should be enough.</p>



<p>“Lunois, still awake?” Aine suddenly called me as I was pondering.</p>



<p>I thought of immediately giving a reply, but there was also the thing I’d been thinking about until a short while ago, hence me keeping silent. I was pretending to sleep and didn’t answer Aine&#8217;s call.</p>



<p>“Lunois?” Aine turned over and called to me once more to make sure. Perhaps, she got something she wanted to say to me. After a bit of silence, as I decided to reply to Aine’s call, “&#8230;Nnh,” such a voice of Aine reached my ears, making me instantly stop moving.</p>



<p>I knew what she was doing even without me turning around. She started masturbating after confirming that I was asleep.</p>



<p>“Nn, fuh…!”</p>



<p>A small, suppressed voice of Aine reached my ears. Yesterday it had been when I hadn’t been in the room, but this time she was masturbating so close like this.</p>



<p>Now that it actually came to this, I got no choice but to continue pretending to be completely asleep. After all, Aine was doing this only after making sure that I was asleep.</p>



<p>“Lu, noiiis…” Aine said with a ragged breath, in a voice as if wishing for me. I could feel the small shaking of her body—I knew she was trying not to wake me up. However, contrary to that, both her movement and voice were becoming more intense little by little.</p>



<p>It was enough for me to hear the ‘schlop schlop’ liquid sound from Aine fingering her own secret place.</p>



<p>I wondered what she’d do if I woke up… As a test, I tried to make a deliberate voice. “N, nn…”</p>



<p>“!!” Aine responded greatly with a jolt, and her movement suddenly stopped.</p>



<p>But still with ragged breathing, “phew,” she let out a big sigh, checking on my state. And immediately, she resumed the masturbating.</p>



<p>It seemed releasing her welled up lust took priority over me catching her out.</p>



<p>Instead, perhaps that tension was making her more aroused… Only after some dozen seconds after I’d let out my voice, “nahh, cumm… uwh.” Aine’s body shook greatly once, and she let out a big sigh.</p>



<p>Seeing off Aine headed for the bathroom after lingering herself in the afterglow for a moment, I turned over for once.</p>



<p>…I hadn’t got the courage to call out to her when she’d been comforting herself. But, one vague thing inside me had changed into a conviction—this meant that Aine had a thing for me.</p>




<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊＊</p>




<p>Dill Soltiness was alone, walking down a dark main road outside of the royal capital. His arm was cut, and probably he wouldn’t be able to do anything as an adventurer for a while.</p>



<p><em>…That bastard.</em></p>



<p>Dill’s anger was, of course, directed at Lunois. But, he no longer had the energy to meddle with him. Although taken by surprise, Dill, who’d become even an A-rank adventurer, had almost had his arm taken away without even sensing it—until now, Dill had never seen Lunois openly showing his emotions.</p>



<p>For this reason, he was not pleased with Lunois, who had risen to become an S-rank adventurer. And yet, Dill was able to clearly see the difference in power between him and Lunois.</p>



<p>Though, by no means had he lost heart. Once time passed and his injury healed, he could work as an adventurer again.</p>



<p><em>There are lots of options</em>—<em>if I make money, I can even get back at Lunois eventually</em>, was what Dill was all thinking about. <em>The same goes for my companions who abandoned me in fear of Lunois—I’ll eventually get revenge on them all</em>… Dill smiled a broad, wicked smile.</p>



<p>“Not just Lunois. That blonde slave… Aine, was it? This originally because that ‘lil girl looked at me like trying to pick a fight. I also ain’t forgiving her…”</p>



<p>“—Excuse me, do you have a moment please?”</p>



<p>“Huuh?”</p>



<p>It was a single man suddenly calling out to Dill; with black hat and a suit—not an outfit fitting for walking down the main road at night.</p>



<p>With a gentle and sweet smile, the man asked Dill. “I’m just looking for someone, you see. And you’ve just come over from the royal capital, correct? You’re an adventurer by appearance… I’m just wondering if you’re well-versed in such information.”</p>



<p>“Huh? The hell are you?”</p>



<p>“Oh! No need to concern yourself about me. I just want some information.”</p>



<p>“Get lost, I’m in bad mood now.”</p>



<p>Dill got no interest whatsoever in the man’s talk. While rubbing his injured arm, DIll tried to go past the man. But then, “Gremarev, grab him.”</p>



<p>“!!?”</p>



<p>Simultaneously with the man’s words, a huge arm appeared from the ground. And, immediately after it grabbed the large body of Dill, a muffled, snapping sound echoed in the surrounding area.</p>



<p>“Gah, guh…!?”</p>



<p>“My, it’s no good… Gremarev. You have to grab him more gently. This gentleman is injured. Be gentle with the injured… Didn’t I teach you so?”</p>



<p>“Never been taught. Domiro, the talk too long.” And then, a man who looked like his whole body made of rocks crawled out of the ground; with red glowing eyes, and replying with a deep voice.</p>



<p>The man—Domiro—sighed at his words, “good grief, we have only talked for just a little bit, haven&#8217;t I? You’re really an impatient child.”</p>



<p>“The, hell, are you…!? Argh, damn it…!”</p>



<p>“Oops, my apologies. I am Domiro… We were kind of just traveling here.”</p>



<p>Unable to grasp the situation, Dill could do nothing but endure the pain.</p>



<p>The rocky arm was holding Dill completely, unable to move at all even after he tried to. If the arm were to be put in just a bit more strength, it might break his ribs, making it pierce his internal organs—he had such a feeling.</p>

<p>Domiro stood in front of the suffering Dill.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, this child… is the type who can’t hold back. If only I had my question answered from the beginning, none of this would have… Oops, I haven’t asked any question, haven’t I?”</p>



<p>With a smile on his face, Domiro, opening his mouth like a crescent moon, said, “blonde slave—Aine, you said that, didn’t you? Do you know where that girl is?”</p>



<p>“W-wha…?”</p>



<p>“Do you know?”</p>



<p>“Guh, argh… I-in the capital! S-she’s with, adventurer named, Lunois Styler…! T-they’re still in the capital, staying in an inn!”</p>



<p>“Oh, an adventurer’s… so she was already bought. Certainly, she’s a skilled one, and might be in demand.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Kh.”</p>



<p>“Ah, Gremarev. That’s already good enough.”</p>



<p>“Got it. Call me again, if you need me.”</p>



<p>Gremarev tossed Dill away—Dill, who had some of his bones broken, fell flat on the ground.</p>



<p>At least, it was clear that the man named Gremarev, who had been using his gigantic hand to grab Dill, had the capabilities easily surpassing an A-rank adventurer. And for some unknown reason, these people were aiming for Aine.</p>



<p><em>What worth does that slave have—!</em></p>



<p>Domiro was standing, looking down at Dill falling flat to the ground.</p>



<p>“Haah… guh!”</p>



<p>“Oh my, with those injuries, it might even take you a while to get back to being an adventurer, will it? Ah, of course I understand what you want to say. I’m most terribly sorry for my companion—that – is – why… I will give you this as a token for my apology.”</p>



<p>What Domiro had taken out from his pocket was a bottle with liquid inside. Having it placed in front of his eyes, Dill was staring at it with dubious expression.</p>



<p>“You can choose which you prefer. Drink it and be saved, or not drink it and die…after all, it’s all up to you.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>While only pain spreading through his body, Domiro’s voice reached Dill’s ears.</p>



<p>And Dill, despite his hesitation, grabbed that bottle with his shaking hand.</p>
