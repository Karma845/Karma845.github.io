<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Chivalry Spirit Injection</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
men of the beast race blocking the front and back were all wearing dirty
leather armor.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At a
glance, I could tell that their armor is old and worn out.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear beastman is speaking in a condescending tone.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
heard you were arguing in the guild a while ago. Definitely, you guys are too
suspicious. It would take us at least a day to reach the 2nd floor, but humans
like you went until the 3rd floor.... frankly speaking, isn't that impossible?
If you're not committing a crime, can you explain how you went to the third
level and returned? Come on, tell us a little bit!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
refuse. Adventurers can't reveal their secrets."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hey
kid, don't you understand this situation?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear and monkey beastmen are standing behind us. The raccoon, fox, and rat
beastmen are blocking the way in front of us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
were currently in a quiet back alley, barely wide enough for two adults to walk
through.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
sun was blocked by buildings, and it is dark, and the air is cool.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
place is a perfect location to commit a crime.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear beastman is trying to persuade me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"We've
been adventurers in this city for many years. In other words, we are your
seniors. No matter what business field you're in, you must respect your
seniors, right? Now, a senior asks you a question to confirm that you are not
committing any illegal acts or crimes, so answer quickly. Or do you wish to
feel some painful experience? Huh?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Chibi,
our boss is short-tempered. It's better for you to answer quickly!"</span>
<span class="calibre13">[Monkey]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear beastman lowered his voice and started cracking his fingers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
monkey beastman, who looks like a clown with a high-pitched voice, shouted.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
looked intimidating, but our difference in level is so great that I don't feel
any fear.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">And
the problem is...</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(I
thought they might have some information, but ...... it seems to be a miss.)</span>
<span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Suppose
they are a party like the "Race Union" with the mission of recruiting
and securing the "masters". In that case, there's no point
threatening us like this. Anyway, it doesn't look like they have any helpful
information.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu,
is there any sign of anyone other than them?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
there isn't. The people who were following us are all here now, and no one is
watching us."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"UR,
Level 5000 Assassin Blade Nemumu" affirms.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Not
many people can escape her detection skills.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
also seemed like no one would come and help us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(They're
not recruiters either. They're just a bunch of thug adventurers who want to
take advantage of us.)</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(It's
not like they're intentionally picking a fight with us to see our strength. My Lord,
this is entirely a miss.)</span> <span class="calibre13">[Gold]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(I
don't think their words and actions are just an act. I also believe this is a
miss.)</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Not
only me but also Gold and Nemumu agreed that they are not the people we are
looking for.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
had hoped that there was at least a slight chance that they might have some
kind of information, but it seems things won't go that easy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
sigh behind my mask and shrug my shoulders.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
bear beastmen mistook that we are going to surrender to them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What's
with all the whispering? Are you ready to give up and speak?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Boss,
how about we take that silver-haired woman to our inn and have her talk with us?
Until we get tired of her, of course."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Monkey]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That's
an interesting idea, <i class="calibre7">Saru</i>. You're
right, she's a little short on breasts, but she's got a better face than the
elves. I've never seen such a beautiful woman before. I'll teach you how to be
an adventurer at our inn while I'm listening to you!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Boss!
Let's take that golden armor as payment for the lesson!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Raccoon]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
raccoon beastman raised his voice.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fox and rat behind him were also shouting happily.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
heard rumors that that armor is fake Gold and won't be worth much, but maybe
it's still enough to buy drink...... You can leave it as a lesson fee,
including the money for the magic stones you just received. I'll even leave you
some money for your lodging today, so be grateful!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Their
words and actions made Nemumu standing beside me angry and blue veins on her
forehead appeared.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-sama,
please give me your order, and in less than three seconds, I'll turn these
disgusting creatures into a puff of blood and wipe them off from the earth's
surface."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
I know what you're feeling, but you shouldn't kill them. It would give us a lot
of trouble later on. Anyway, it would be foolish to deal with them any longer,
so just neutralize them."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Understood."</span></span>
<span><span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Hah?
Haa?! Is your head okay? It seems that you want to fight against me. Lowly
humans like you against me, a bear beastman. Do you have a deathwish or
something?"</span></span> <span><span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord, Nemumu, is this okay?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Gold]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
interrupted the bear man's speech and raised his hand to draw attention.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
looked over, and before I knew it, the raccoon, fox, and rat beastmen that had
been blocking our way had been knocked to the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Apparently,
he had knocked them down as soon as I gave the command.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
was wearing a full-face helmet, so I couldn't see his expression, but he sounds
happy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Would
you mind if I take care of them? I won't kill them, and I will make sure they
won't bother us again."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Gold]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Then
Gold will take care of them. Nemumu and I are going back to the inn first. Is
that's okay?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
as expected, my Lord! You know what I mean! Nemumu......, do you mind if I ask
you to return to the inn with our Lord? I mean, just the two of you."</span>
<span class="calibre13">[Gold]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
role is to accompany the Dark-sama. If you can take care of them, that's better.
Let's leave it to Gold."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
purposely emphasizing the words "just the two of you".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu,
who had been expressionless and had a blue vein appeared on her face, cleared
her throat, and replied with a soft voice.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
let out a slight chuckle at her change in attitude but didn't say anything.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I'm
happier when she looks happy than when she's angry.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Wahahahahaha!
Alright! Then I'll leave the rest to you, Nemumu! I'll teach them what the
"chivalry spirit" is!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Gold]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"</span>
<span class="calibre13">What,
what do you want? How dare you raise your hands against us, your seniors! Don't
underestimate me, you puny human!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
laughs and walks up to the bear beastman. He strolls casually without any
defense.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Suddenly,
the bear beastman is attacking Gold with his full strength. He is wary because
Gold has beaten 3 of his men.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
thug adventurer's fist hit the face of "UR, level 5000, Gold the golden
knight."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
moment later, he starts screaming with tears in his eyes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ouch!
Ouch! You! Don't mess with me! I am a bear beastman. This thing can't happen to
me. Ouch, ouch. I can't clench my fist. Ouch, ouch!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Are
you going to run away without your boss?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hiii!"
[Monkey]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The monkey
beastman gets scared when he saw the bear beastman screaming while holding his
broken fist, and he's trying to escape quietly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
of course, there is no way I would let him go, so I take out one of my "Infinity
Gacha" cards and release it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"R,
Fire Arrow, release." [Dark]</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"
Higghhh!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Monkey]</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
the fire arrow, I grazed the monkey beastman's leather armor to stop him from
escaping.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"
You're a human, but you're a magician!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Who
the hell are you people?" [Monkey]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Did
you think you could escape from my Lord's eyes? Not a single one of you will
escape! I love to teach punks like you what chivalry spirit is! I won't miss
this opportunity!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Gold]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"</span>
<span class="calibre13">Ouch!
St-st-st-stop! It hurts! Don't pull my right hand!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
walks up to the monkey beastman, dragging the nearly two and a half meter long
bear-beast by gripping his fist.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
seems that Gold will not let him escape.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
ignored the bear's screams and dragged him along by gripping the bear's broken
hand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
never know that Gold has that kinda hobby ......."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
kill them, just train these animals to never go against Dark-sama again. Either
way, staying here any longer is a waste of time. Let's go back to the inn and
get some rest.<span> </span><span>I didn't take a bath
last night, so I want to take a bath!"</span></span> <span><span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">&nbsp;</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As Nemumu
had pointed out, there was nothing more we could do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Leaving
them to Gold, Nemumu and I returned to the inn together.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">By
the way, since the bathroom size is only enough for one person, I have to take
a bath and changing clothes by myself.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
"Naraku", Mei and the fairy maids always help me take a bath and
change clothes, so it has been a while since I have to do it by myself.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
I got out of the bath, Nemumu tried her best to keep her expression, but the
atmosphere is very awkward.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was a little embarrassing for the two of us to be alone, though, so I smiled to
try to cover it up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
did not return that day but showed up for breakfast the following day.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
seemed to be very happy with the results and talked happily. </span></p></div>
