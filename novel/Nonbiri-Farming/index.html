<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1 &ndash; Desire to be Transferred in a Different World</h1>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My name is Machio Hiraku.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After graduating from college, I began overworking my body in a black company in my twenties and lived in the hospital in my thirties.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Male.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Age at the time of death: 39 years old.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And now, I’m meeting god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Reincarnate to a different world? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, it’s transition. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Transition? I thought that I died? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s right. Therefore, I’m going to revive you in another world.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Er, my body is …」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll be getting rid of your illness and regenerate your rotten organs. Otherwise, you’ll die soon. I’ll also make you younger after that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No need to thank me. I will benefit from sending you to another world. So to speak, you will be resurrected in another world for me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Indeed. So, do I have to do something there?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, just live there. Gently enjoy your second life.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…… Do you have any complaints?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How obedient. But… are you really fine with it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. I have lived on the hospital bed for nearly ten years. There is nothing to complain about being younger and having a healthy body.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?….Ah….that is… I have no excuse for pressing you on my own convenience so I will grant your wish.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My wish?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. For instance….I can give you special skills or a fate with only good encounter.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, please give me a body that does not get sick.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…… A body that doesn’t get sick?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. I suffered from my illness. If possible, I do not want to experience that kind of thing again.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「U-umu. I understand. Then, a body that does not get sick, I’ll give you “Healthy Body”.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll ask you for another one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? But…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Just say it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uh…Then, can you do something that would make me live in a place with not so many people if possible.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A place without people?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Uh… When my parents died, there are various people who introduce themselves as relatives…also, even in the company I entered…therefore…I distrust human a little…well, it’s kind of different. Perhaps, I think that communication with people is not so good. I think that I must go over it immediately but…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Therefore, a place without other people? I understand. I’ll consider the place I’ll transfer you to.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind if there is another one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Just say it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uh… Let’s see. Oh, that’s right. Please make sure that I’ll be able to speak the language of the world I’m going to.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The vicinity is safe. You’ll be able to speak with basic human beings. It’s a kind of beginner’s pack.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ye-yeah.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Come on, tell me your wish quickly.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Even if you say that… I’ve been on a hospital bed for a long time so I’m already happy to be able to move. The thing I wish for the most has come true…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, that’s it. Is there something you want to do? The destination is a world of swords and magic which is common in games you know. Do you want to become the world’s best adventurer? Do you want to become a magi with the rarest ability? Or do you want to be a king somewhere? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha, no. Those are all too heavy for me. …… I got it. There is something that I wanted to do if my body can move. That is!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really. Say it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Farming.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「When I was a child, I always remembered having a hoe on an on-site training. I am interested for some reason. That’s why I want to do farming.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Farming…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it useless?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s not useless. Although it’s not useless, your wish is outside my jurisdiction. Wait a minute.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was waiting, the God in front of me took out something like an old cell phone and started to speak with someone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can hear the words but I completely don’t know the meaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is the language different?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that the one he’s talking to is very excited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I kept you waiting. Let me give you this.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, he passed a hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The handle part is wood, only the blade part is made of iron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「”All Purpose Farming Tool”」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN:万能(bannō) &ndash; It means all purpose but it can also mean omnipotent</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Omnipotent? I think this hoe is surely excellent but an omnipotent farming tool is overkill.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It looks like a hoe but if its master imagines it, it can transform according to the application.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Transform?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. For example, think that it will be a sickle… It is likely to be a sickle. You can also use it as a saw, hammer, crowbar, and shovel.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ooh」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Furthermore, that is for your exclusive use. It will always be by your side. Even if you throw it, it will &nbsp;come back.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Highly Efficient!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way, you can store it in your body so you don’t have to worry about the storage location. You can put it in and out as you wish. Try it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was told, I put the all-purpose farming tool in my body, and try to get it out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Awesome!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Take good care of it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I’ll take care of it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…… Now it’s time to move on. Are you ready?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s okay. Thank you for everything.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu, then stay healthy.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">While I was listening to those words, I felt like my body is melting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And when I noticed, I was in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Body check.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My body…it moves freely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no pain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a healthy body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although there is no mirror, I know that I became younger from my hands and feet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Early twenties?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, late teens?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Clothes …… I am wearing clothes I’m not familiar with.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like a villager that appears in fantasy games with my rough coat and pants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Underwear is… a trunk bound by a string.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, it was nice not to be dead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if this is one of the beginner’s pack that God said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, I put out the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A hoe appears in the grasp of my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you, God.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of which, I have not heard of God ‘s name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know who to pray to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, the feeling of gratitude is what’s important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stand up and look around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I look at the front or back, all I see is a forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I look at the left or right, all I see is a forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m hoping to be transferred to a place with few people… but this place has no people at all.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-0"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 2 &ndash; Different World</h1><p class="calibre2">Mou.<span id="calibre_link-102"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I became healthy, in this situation, I’ll die.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, water, then food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Place to sleep after that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s the basic of survival.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, I’ll move to seek water…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to move but the trees are in the way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I can move but I can’t see far because there are too many trees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, the trees are thick.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their trunk diameters exceeds 1 meter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I feel that it’s the same everywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The place where I am now is open for some reason but it is still not enough to see a far place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll probably get lost if I move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I just can’t come back here even if I’m lost…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being troubled can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I don’t look for water, I’ll die.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for now…I’ll try to believe in my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there a sound of flowing water somewhere?</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can hear only the sound of eerie wind and cry of a beast which seems to be dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the cry of the beast felt like a scream.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That means … there are beasts attacking that beast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Deep breath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I need to move one step forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt an awful sense of incongruity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the feeling of taking a step on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The open ground earlier is not like the normal ground I know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How can the trees grow in this stiff ground?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not really stiff but hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Too hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ground is so hard that it seems to be a piece of rock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To think that great thick trees and tall grassess can grow roots in such a place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The vitality of plants are impressive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, this hard ground is bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know much about my now younger body but my feet will hurt if I walk all the way on this hard ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surprising hardness of this ground is unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And one more thing,</p>

<p class="calibre2">Can I farm in this hard land?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe this forest has the only hard one and other places are all right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I set up my All Purpose Farming Tool in the form of a hoe and tried it down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Success.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The blade of the hoe surprisingly entered deep into the ground without problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pull out and repeat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sakusakusakusaku(SFX)</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Sakusaku is a sound effect for something crispy.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">The ground is easily plowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ooohh</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is fun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sakusakusakusaku…Ah</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that it was dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A thick tree root was lying on the way and I have swung down to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was prepared for the shock to come in my arms but it did not come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, the response was still crispy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, the root was plowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The part that comes in contact with the hoe became sawdust.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, not sawdust, but soil?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, I feel like it would be a good fertilizer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s see……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I kept swinging the hoe as it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The root of the thick tree completely assimilated into the ground. The only thing that remained was the ground that was plowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ooohh</p>
<p class="calibre2">And surprisingly, I’m not even tired.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps I won’t get tired while using this All Purpose Farming Tool?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected the a tool God gave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something flash on my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I move while plowing, will I get tired?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">It tried doing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you, God.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since there are neither food nor water at the transition place, I thought that I was terribly neglected but it was thought of properly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I continued plowing while thanking him again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I have to find a place where I can secure some drinking water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I’m plowing while advancing, my movement speed is slow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, I thought about the width that I should plow. The place where I plowed will be flattened so I thought that the width should be around 5 meters for visibility besides, I can plow without minding trees, I mean tree roots.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I advanced around 50 meters in an hour.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Isn’t that dangerous?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know what time it is now, but what should I do when the sun goes down?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s good that I’m not tired but shouldn’t I be worried about my vision?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, vision is important because a beast may come out of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">God help me!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly relying on others is useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked at the All Purpose Farming Tool in my hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is in the form of a hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has an effect of turning the place it plowed to soil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of which, it is said that it has other forms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For instance…… Saw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My All purpose Farming Tool became a saw so I tried it to a nearby tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, saw is not the one that should be used to cut trees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed it into an ax and swing it to a nearby tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut the tree like tofu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ooohh</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, unlike with the hoe, the tree remains a tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought so while looking at the falling tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What I should do is not to look for water but to utilize this all purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For instance……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the all purpose farming tool into a drill and pressed it against the 10 meter wide trunk of a gigantic tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The drill punctures the trunk of of the gigantic tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Within five minutes, I created a four meters square, 2 meters high space inside which is 1 meter from the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Can’t imagine? Here is an image from the manga</em></strong></p>
<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000006.png" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the inside was rind, I transformed the All Purpose Farming Tool into a file.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rubbing the file once is enough to level and smoothen it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw away the the small pieces of woods outside while thinking that it looks like a huge squirrel nest. With This, I secured a place to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, water……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I turned the All-purpose farming tool to a shovel and dug the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather than searching for a river, I dig a well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you think about it, finding a river would be better because digging a well needs an overwhelming labor but in my case, I have the all purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can dig it fast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Digging digging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Straight down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">After digging about 5 meters, it become impossible to take out the dug soil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I wondered how I would get out of the hole.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I need to dig diagonally to get out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, wait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A vertical hole.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What about oxygen?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dangerous, I could die.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I panicked and dug up a hole diagonally to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Reflecting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, I dug while thinking about air passage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Basic, slanted digging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dig air holes from time to time to secure oxygen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The most important thing it that there should be air flow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is different from what I imagined of a well but there will be no problem if I keep digging like this to the bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The water came out in the estimated depth of about ten meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right on target.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, because the ground is hard, the water flows from the side of the hole like a springwater and begins to accumulate at the bottom of the hole.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can I drink it….</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no choice but to drink it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I won’t drink it immediately and leave it for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I’m using the All Purpose Farming Tool, I’m not thirsty yet even if it’s a truly hard ground. The water is dirty because I just dug it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With this, I have a place to sleep and although uncertain, have a water source.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, it’s food…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I aim from the source of the beast voice I heard from the forest?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ve never hunted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, the sun begins to set.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….what!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I forgot the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How do I make fire?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rubbing woods?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For an amateur like me, it won’t go well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All-purpose farming tool…… LAMP?</p>
<p class="calibre2">LIGHT, ELECTRIC LIGHT….it’s useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It doesn’t change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The all purpose farming tool, like what its name indicates, only transforms into farming tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it is questionable to call a file and a drill farming tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it transformed to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It also became scissors and spoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I imagined a chainsaw to cut trees but it was useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Motors and electric grass cutters etc were no good too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Machine related things are no good…with this, I assume that those having a few parts are okay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, a tool that creates fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Magnifying glass!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Success!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can make fire with this!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before it gets dark…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave up and crawl to the tree hole I made as a sleeping quarters and decide to transform the all purpose farming too into a knife to make accessories until the day rose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, glass, plate, and tray.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, knife, fork, and chopsticks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I used the tree I cut down with the ax earlier as the material.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was using the all purpose farming tool, I did not feel thirsty, I did not feel hungry and I did not feel sleepy either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, since there is no fire, I made those under the moonlight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is truly a different world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are two moons.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-20"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 3 &ndash; All-Purpose Farming Tool</h1><p class="calibre2">The All-Purpose Farming Tool is a tool that can transform.<span id="calibre_link-103"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">And I can freely put it in and out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While using it, my throat doesn’t get thirsty, my belly doesn’t feel hungry, and I don’t feel sleepy at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, is there a limit in using it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, if I transform the All-purpose farming tool into a hoe then swing it on the ground, what will happen if I don’t pull it out?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, it can be said that I should continuously swing the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the same with most tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, for example, I hit a post with a hammer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I’m striking the post, it can be said that I’m using it but if I move from that post to another, I’m not using it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I’m making small items with the All purpose farming tool knife form, it is exerting its effect while I’m working with it but it doesn’t exert its effect after I finished it and move to the next article.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if those are just a moment, it will be a considerable amount since it stacks up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, right now, I’m thirsty, hungry, and sleepy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After bathing in the morning sun, I went to the diagonal hole well I had dug yesterday. I took out the wood cup I made with the knife when I stand vigil until the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the depth was about 1 meter, I draw water from the clean upper stratum as much as possible…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can drink it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should be able to drink it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have no choice but to drink here because I am thirsty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A man should be courageous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tilted the cup a little and try putting some in my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am surprised that it doesn’t taste strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that it is an ordinary water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to think it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I’m thirsty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I resolved myself and drink it,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Later… If I won’t have a stomach ache, then there is no problem…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have no choice but to wait for the passage of time.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Next is food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before that, I need to confirm the current situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a place to sleep on the trunk of a large tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounding soil has become soft because I plowed it with the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dug a diagonal well in a place slightly away from my place to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, there is the five-meter wide road I plowed from the place I was transported to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t mean to do that but the road is visible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The distance might be about one hundred meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On my hand are the All purpose farming tool and the small items I created when I didn’t sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The small items I made are cups and plates that were created by shaving wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I made it overnight, a moderate amount was made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>

<p class="calibre2">For now, I need to move around while swinging the hoe and look for something to eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A nut tree is ideal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would be happy if I’ll find apples or grapes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I immediately thought, I should lit a fire first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will not repeat yesterday’s failure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I collect the wood chips which came from the time I was making the small room in the tree to sleep on. I transformed the all-purpose farming tool into a magnifying glass to ignite it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, stabilize the fire by adding dry woods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took more time than I expected but I managed to secure the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was able to do it but… I’m scared to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll be in trouble if it caused a wildfire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, food search is done in the range where I can see the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, I will plow the surroundings to expand my place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I continued using the hoe to expand the place with the tree I’ll sleep on as the center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked too hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I expanded my space around 200 meters from the tree I made a place to sleep in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, using hoe is fun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the way, I thought that I would have wood problems if I turn all the trees to fertilizer so I cut down the trees using all-purpose farming tool ax form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I discovered it that time. Something like a crowbar to hook the trees…It seems that I can transform the all-purpose farming tool with just image even without knowing the name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was possible for me to move the trees with the crowbar without feeling the weight of the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The all-purpose farming tool is convenient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the back of the tree where I’ll sleep in is a large tree of about 1 to 2 meters diameter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, I won’t be troubled with woods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to that, my searching for food completely went off my head…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good luck or bad luck? Something happened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was plowing the surroundings, an animal appeared to the place where I shook the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The animal looked like a rabbit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the size is about the size of a medium size dog. Its eyes are showing hostility and although a rabbit, it has two long fangs on the edge of its mouth like a saber tooth tiger….Isn’t this a rodent?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I was not able to stop the hoe from hitting the rabbit when I swung it down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was done in with a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hoe hit the neck of the rabbit that is bending forward. Then a crispy sound…</p>
<p class="calibre2">The part from the neck to the top became fertilizer but the body remained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was shocked from robbing the life of a living thing but my belly is honest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I got the food I wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pray.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the all-purpose farming tool to a knife and dismantle it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I say dismantle, I don’t know how to dismantle it. I cut the fur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I panicked when I notice the internal organs in the middle of it.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I don’t think that it’s good to throw the internal organs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apart from the heart and liver, the things that the rabbit ate are in its stomach and intestines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about how it shows hostility to me and thinking about its fangs, it doesn’t seem to be the type to eat grass. There is no way it eats grass.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, the intestines are not long as I thought so it’s carnivorous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked hard removing it while avoiding damaging it and throws it away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I took off the fur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was able to turn the all-purpose farming tool into a frying pan but I gave up using it since I don’t want to put it over the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After cutting the meat to small bite size cut, I skewer them into a wooden stick and hangs it to the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll barbeque it this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After this, I’ll process a stone and make it into a stone plate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can afford to do that because I was able to secure food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about it in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I’m currently eating the burnt meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it can only be said as natural because I grilled the meat with fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no seasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this is at least edible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only tasted hospital food for a long time because I was hospitalized for nearly ten years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The last one was an intravenous feeding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, this is a meat dish I cooked myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I became teary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no reason not to eat this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how much I revise it, the result is a burnt bloody meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t deceive myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must do something about the food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Renewing my desire, I ate it for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, there’s only a little food remains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To make it not rot, I need a cold place…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can only think of a well but I would like to use something as clean as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since there is no other method, I decided to grill them all to preserve it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that the meat will become hard you grill them but it is better than leaving them raw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I plow the internal organs and the fur with the hoe form of the all-purpose farming tool to turn them into fertilizer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My stomach is still not painful so I judged the water of the well to be safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, my belly has swollen.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-39"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4 &ndash; Toilet</h1><p class="calibre2">When people eat something, that something needs to go out.<span id="calibre_link-104"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if I should do it around here. I plowed around my tree crib so I’m troubled because my prospects are good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I think that doing it in a place I plowed will feel different but doing it in a place where I didn’t flow is troublesome if I consider plowing there in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Feces and urine will eventually become fertilizer but the thing right after secretion is not yet a fertilizer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It must be fermented first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, if I plow it with the hoe form of the all-purpose farming tool, it will definitely become a fertilizer but I’m somewhat reluctant to plow my excrement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, I have a place to sleep, water, fire, and food. The next thing I want to obtain is a toilet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Toilet…<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, with my tree crib on the center, I choose the opposite direction from where the well is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a little far away because it will be troublesome if the smell comes out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Think about the future, I dig the ground diagonally for about 2 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I learned that I can’t get out if I dug straight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dug out the inner part wider to secure space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This will be fine for several years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably.<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be troublesome if the stored filth contaminate the groundwater so the hit the floor and the wall with a hammer to harden it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I thought, the soil solidified like concrete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This will be fine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, the above-ground part.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, I block the hole which I dug diagonally with a wooden board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wooden board is a thing processed by the saw and chisel form of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t feel the difference with the things sold in a hardware store.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wood will crack later if it won’t be dried but it seems that there is no need to dry the wood after using the saw and chisel form of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The All-Purpose Farming Tool is convenient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This passage will be the doorway to retrieve the filth from the toilet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, I dug a hole straight to the estimated middle of the space I made underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the all-purpose farming tool like a huge corkscrew.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the length was around my height, I was worried whether it would reach the underground space. But as I turn the huge corkscrew, it safely reached the underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shouldn’t I have done this when I dug a well?</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, I arranged a wood board to block the hole and to act as a floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I made a hole on that floor. I made a toilet seat and adjusted it to the hole on the floor and on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The toilet seat was made by cutting a good size tree and making it into a cylindrical shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not a japanese style but a western style.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a small sit-down type.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In order for the toilet seat not to slip, I processed the wooden floor and the seat to lock them together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next….wall.<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the all-purpose farming tool to a hammer and hammered pillars surrounding it in all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt the lack of my height when hammering the pillar but since I made a wooden foothold, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The height of the pillars is about two meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the distance between pillars is about two meters, I think that I have made a space of a two-meter square.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Isn’t this too wide for a toilet?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it is better than being narrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Full open is embarrassing so I guess it’s a little wide.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Full Open is written in english</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes yes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I carved a groove into the wooden pillars and processed wooden board to make wall by putting them on the grooves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a wall on all sides and secured a doorway by removing a part of a wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not prepare a door so I arranged some woods side by side like a blind in a not far away place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, that seems sufficient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the ceiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no ceiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have a feeling of openness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s make that later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I drew water from the well using a large cup which is smaller than a bucket. I sit on the freshly made toilet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was able to fetch water for hand washing but where should I let it flow after using…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a blunder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not prepare leaves as toilet paper substitute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ran into the forest and looked for leaves that feel good that I can use to wipe my butt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not find any good leaves but I found a grass that feels good so I decide to use it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope that this is good enough…</p>
<p class="calibre2">My defecate was close to the extent that I could not afford to experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Good enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that is the creation of the ceiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I don’t have the technology to make a slanted roof, I put a normal flat one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A height of two meters is unexpectedly cramped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, making a two-meter sliding door is a little too high.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next time I build a building, I’ll consider the height a little more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was so dark and troubling when I built the ceiling so I made countless of small windows on top of the walls for lighting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For lighting at night, I processed a wood in form of a brazier and laid ash on the part of the hole.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the brazier is made of wood, I’m worried whether it will burn…I’ll make some improvement later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to prepare a tank-like thing for hand washing and toilet flushing… I don’t have the technology to create a water tank as a water reservoir so I cut a large tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to the all-purpose farming tool, I was more tired going back and forth to draw water to the tank-like thing than when I was making it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not being in a civilization is hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the toilet was completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m satisfied.<span class="calibre8"> </span></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-57"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 5 &ndash; Food Security</h1><p class="calibre2">After completing the toilet, I went back to bed and slept.<span id="calibre_link-105"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t think that it is a good idea to sleep in daytime but I’m really sleepy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think I fell asleep for about 3 hours, but the sun has not set yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Present condition assessment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bed, water, fire, toilet, and food is fine for today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if you think about tomorrow, food is a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right now, I only have the rabbit-like creature meat that I luckily obtained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I continuously use the all-purpose farming tool, I won’t get hungry. That will extend my food supply for about…5 days?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to search for new food till then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However….I should think about the night before that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is natural for someone to sleep at night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the forest is scary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The rabbit with massive fangs is hostile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the rabbit is already like that, what more if it’s a bear? Isn’t this dangerous?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have fire but… I never heard about wild animals being afraid of fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of what will come, I need to prepare…</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I need a door to block the entrance of the shelter that I made from a trunk of a tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut a tree with an appropriate size with the all-purpose farming tool and create something like a door with a knob.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is somewhat heavy…Won’t I have trouble using this?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I closed the door, the inside was pitch-black. It was troubling in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…If I use fire here, I will die of oxygen deficiency.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s challenge this in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, the fence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll build a fence that surrounds my shelter, the well, and the toilet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut down straight trees and removed their branches with the help of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I say fence, since there are no nails, it’s just some sort of enclosure. I surrounded the place with logs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I won’t be able to move these trees if there is no all-purpose farming tool. Even if the height is only about 1 meter, it will at least be a hindrance for the beasts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I insisted surrounding my domain with a fence, I had a good feeling when I was able to enclose a wide area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it is around 100 by 100 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did I overdo it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, because the log fence was completed, I decided to sleep because it was already dark.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I closed the door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s pitch black.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible to do any work so I guess it’s good?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">……………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Air holes!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dangerous, dangerous!</p>

<p class="calibre2">Because it’s dark, I panicked a little when I can’t find where the door is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to open the door, put some air holes in the door, and then go to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dig at the outer side of the log fence with the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am uneasy about the log fence alone and because of that, I woke up in the middle of the night several times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to dig hard with the hoe for a sound sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The width is about 1 meter and 50 centimeters and the depth is two meters.(Eye measurement)</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was making the log fence, I was able to not put log in a place that will be an entrance but I already surrounded the place with a moat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, I made a bridge with a board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This board is too heavy to move but because I have the all-purpose farming tool, I have no problem with the current condition since there is only me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Completing it made me feel good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, this place is safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…… &nbsp;It might be safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to think that it’s safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well…..The shelter security is secured so next is food….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Digging has taken quite a bit of time and the sun has inclined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it better not to overdo things?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This would be the last today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought so because this is not the time to joke around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I don’t use the all-purpose farming tool, my physical strength will decrease.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I decide to plow the place to make it a field using the hoe form of the all-purpose farming tool until sunset.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, what I wanted to do is farming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I set up the hoe and started plowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was there a standard size for a field?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I can’t take measurements even if there is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I decided to make ridges in a place that is about 50 meters square.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All job was done using the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s quite fun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The field was completed quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In order not to accidentally trample it, I raised the perimeter of the field slightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It feels good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I just have noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..There are neither seeds nor seedlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s no point in making a field!</p>

<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a field all through the night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stayed up all night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moonlight is bright so I was not worried about darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shook the hoe and built up a field.</p>
<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000012.png" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">Here are carrots, here are potatoes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cabbage is over there and I wonder what should be over there?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a complete escapism.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the use of the all-purpose farming tool, I don’t get thirsty, I don’t feel hungry, and I don’t feel sleepy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you keep using it, you can move infinitely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I noticed that it was morning and looked at the log fence and the moat that surrounds my shelter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahaha.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if there are vegetables that can be raised in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had no choice but to start plowing the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is convenient to move while using all-purpose farming tools. By doing so, I might be able to encounter vegetables that can be raised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, both grass and trees that are hit by the hoe form of the all-purpose farming tool become fertilizer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am not skillful enough to swing and observe the surrounding at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I was able to hunt rabbit with fangs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahaha.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have done it again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a rabbit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is this?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it a habit for the rabbits around here to jump up in front of me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, while showing hostility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the last time, the head becomes fertilizer and the body part remains because the hoe hits its neck like last time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..I decide to receive it gratefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I had plowed into the forest until night fall, I did not encounter any vegetation that can be planted but I obtained three rabbit bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have encountered four rabbits….I said four but, one only has its head remained as its body became fertilizer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With this, I confirmed again and again that the part in front of the hoe will become fertilizer when hit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put my hands together and prayed for the head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bodies of the rabbits was a lot of trouble to carry because they have the same size like a medium size dog so like what I did with the tree, I carried them with the hook form of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the various ways of using the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While expressing my gratitude in various ways, I ate a rabbit and decided to sleep well today.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-76"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 6 &ndash; Opportunity and Encounter</h1><p class="calibre2">I woke up.<span id="calibre_link-106"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I washed my face and eat the roasted rabbit for breakfast as usual. I’m all fired up today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The immediate objective is to obtain something that can be grown in the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took the all-purpose farming to start plowing in high spirits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, I was surprised to see the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were small sproutlings on the ridge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, in a regular interval.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did somebody sow seeds?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Who?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if someone sowed them, they’ve grown too early.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it God?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked at the all-purpose farming tool in my hand.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I ran into the forest, took a large wood, and carved the figure of the gods I met before I came here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, one looks young but feels old and the other one looks old but feels young.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is mysterious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not perfectly made but I feel that their images are similar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of which, the god who gave me the all-purpose farming tool is different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know how he looks so I carved him using my imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because he is the god of farming, is he plump?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since farming is tough, is he slender?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result of various thinking, I made a statue that resembles hanasaka jiisan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">***TN: Hanasaka jiisan is a japanese folklore of a man that can make withered tree blossom.<a href="http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/folk/hanasaka/hanasaka01.html" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> Here is the story with gif.</a> ***</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made an altar with the excess part of the tree I cut down and enshrined the wooden statue of the gods there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you, God!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a long prayer, my goal changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need to protect the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, let’s assess my present condition.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A big tree shelter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, fire, toilet, log fence and moat that surround them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One fifty by fifty farm fields around it in all directions, 12 in all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size of the residential space is about four of those.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: image last chapter was one chapter too early.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">There are sproutlings in every field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it is up to me to protect that field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, I need to prepare a fence around the current field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I won’t let anyone approach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beast?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll make a fertilizer out of them with this all-purpose farming tool.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Fufufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a fence with logs and enclosed the field in high tension.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also dug a moat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, I plowed and smashed the place that was close to the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though obtaining wood will be troublesome, it can’t be helped considering that one might invade from the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I prepared boards to act as bridges since I made an entrance from all directions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took five days to do those work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, as the sproutlings grew rapidly, six rabbits with fangs and one puppy size rat invaded the field. They became fertilizer of the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t even think about making them food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s because there is already a huge boar for food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its height is about two meters as seen from the front and its width is about the same. Its total length is about 4 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was pretty scared but as it approached the field, I resolved myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the all-purpose farming tool to a hoe and cut its neck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its meat is delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The present things I have are substantial.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m happy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, my anti beast measures are thorough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the enemy of the field is not only the beast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are birds and insects.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the rabbit, rat, and wild boar, I haven’t seen any birds or bugs but I’m sure they exist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not putting their hands on my field yet because they still don’t see its value.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But when they start to bear fruit, they’ll attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Somehow, I need to decide a measure…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of which, what kind of produce are they?</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are the same in one field but they are of different types for each field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is something you can eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want them to be something that can be eaten.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If those are ornamental plants, I’m confident that my knees will collapse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, should I support them with a splint?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is I who want to try farming but my knowledge is too insufficient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have studied more than I sleep when I was in the hospital….</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no meaning in regretting it now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll just do what I can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, as a measure against birds, a scarecrow?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was thinking, I heard sounds from a beast from the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It sounds like a dog.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It feels like the dog is trying its hardest to bark.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I approached the sound while holding the hoe form of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a big dog on the other side of the log fence and moat that surrounds the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a black dog.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its size is similar to a large breed dog.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fk1Ghm4/u39-c4439af0-e54f-4924-b407-c2a8605a01d2.jpg">

<p class="calibre2">I felt like my heart is as high as my head. If it manages to cross, it will surely get me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That big black dog is barking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why but I don’t feel any hostility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was another black dog of similar size behind that black dog.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at them closely, I noticed that the two of them are full of injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I opened the nearby entrance and put the board over the moat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The barking dog shuts up and stares at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am a little scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But as I’m holding the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My heart calms down naturally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I calmed down, I looked at the dogs again and noticed the dog behind is female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It even has a big stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is the dog in front a male?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That means they’re a couple.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s see……</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is no good to drive them away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The female dog walks unsteadily like it was dizzy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The male dog sometimes looks back anxiously while glaring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dogs are farmer’s ally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was a child, I wanted to have a dog but I never got one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the reasons to take in the dogs, I relaxed my posture put down the hoe form all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that the dog understood and stopped glaring at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know if they understand words so for the meantime, I invited them with the use of gesture.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-97"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 7 &ndash; Dogs</h1><p class="calibre2">Two dogs are accompanying me from behind as I walk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are quite obedient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They crossed the moat and the fence and went inside my place. I invited them near the bonfire as it is but they did not get near.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does it mean that beasts are scared of fire?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about such a thing but it seems that the reason is different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two of them approached the body of the wild boar that I knocked down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the wild boar was large, I only cut a necessary amount and left it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…… Are you hungry?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it’s decreasing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wait, wait.<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wild boar meat was more delicious compared to the rabbit meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not going to give it all to you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I quickly cut the wild boar meat with the knife form of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I secured the thigh part for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the sirloin afterward is the…..ribs…….it was easy because I felt no resistance when using the knife form of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wrapped the meat I secured with large leaves and carried it to my tree trunk crib.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These large leaves were discovered at the outer part of the field that I reclaimed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave the leftover meat and the bones to the dogs when I was done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two of them started eating wild boar with great momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about cutting it into smaller pieces so that it will be easier to eat but it didn’t seem necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway….I understood what I should work on next.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no table.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, I have been using the ground up to now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have noticed it sooner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took a moderate size log and split it into two vertically. I then scrape the top of the half circle a little flat so that it won’t move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The table of wild design is now complete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I also prepared log chairs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel that the cultural level has risen up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While working on those, the dogs were chewing wild boar meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They ate a considerable amount.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that they have eaten more than their body size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I guess its better for them to eat it than be wasted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I leave the eating dogs and thought about building a hut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once I harvest something on the field, I need a place to store it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a storehouse rather than a hut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had the feeling when I made the toilet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I had poor knowledge, I have the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, an above the ground house is too difficult for an amateur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, I only can build something like the toilet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only difference would be the size and the floor.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The size is around 8 tatami mats.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is going to be a storage place so I want it to be on a reasonable size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By using thick trees as pillars on four corners, there will be no problem in strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The floor is not made of woods but the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering that it is a crop storage, I thought that it would be better for it to be exposed to the cold ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After this, I’ll make shelves where I can place the crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, by the time I tried getting woods to make shelves, the dogs had finished eating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wild boar has become bones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What’s with her stomach?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about it when the female dog screamed in pain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did she eat too much?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to approach it in a hurry but the male dog howls and obstructs me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought it wouldn’t be the case but the female dog wandered around and screamed again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What’s this?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….By chance, is she going to give birth?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Outdoor?</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’ll give birth in such a place?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..No.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A place where she can give birth to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my tree trunk crib?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I kept the meat there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If that is the case……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I induced the two dogs to go to the just made storehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s better than an open field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess the female dog thought so too and obediently entered the storehouse. She came and fall in the corner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The male dog is looking at me anxiously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Childbirth ……Childbirth ……</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is useless.<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t have a single fragment of knowledge about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, the day draws to a close.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the sun goes down, the temperature goes down too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to lit a fire in the storehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I lightly dig the ground near the center of the room and make a simple fireplace shape. I spread ash over it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I put woods on top of it and lit it up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Smoke escapes from the lighting window.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no door too so they will not be fumigated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that is… &nbsp;drinking water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I instantly scrape a log to an improvised bucket and carried water there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that I didn’t make a mistake because the female dog gulps down water immediately.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Afterwards…is she gave birth here, the puppies will fall on the ground….Is it alright for them to be directly on the ground?</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I don’t have a blanket or anything similar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I knew that this would happen, I should have secured the rabbit fur or the wild boar hide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what I have seen on TV before, horses gave birth on straw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there is no such thing as straw in this area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be possible if I enter the forest and collects grass but it is already dark.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I keep on plowing, collecting grass in the dark forest is an arduous work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can’t I do anything?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking about it, the female dog takes action like digging the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I put out the all-purpose farming tool and transform it into a <em class="calibre5">shovel</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The difference between a <em class="calibre5">shovel</em> and a <em class="calibre5">scoop</em> is a part where you can put your foot on. For me, <em class="calibre5">scoop </em>is something that can be used with one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I imagine a shovel then hold it with both hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dug up a corner of the storehouse with a <em class="calibre5">shovel</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, this area is soft because it has been plowed by the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It softened more now that I’m using the <em class="calibre5">shovel </em>there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I softened an area about 1 tatami mat in the corner of the room with the shovel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The female dog understood what I had done and dug a hole in that soft place and hardened it using her paws and body to make it the birth place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only watch her afterward……</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are probably feeling vulnerable since they just met me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I left it to the male dog and left the storehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The day has fallen completely and it was already awfully dark outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope you give birth safely…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t go to sleep as it is and decided to make accessories near the bonfire near my crib.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the wild boar’s bones looked scary at night so I plowed it with the hoe and it had become fertilizer.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-13"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 8 &ndash; Life with Dogs</h1><p class="calibre2">Morning.<span id="calibre_link-107"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Four new lives were born in the storehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are four black puppies similar to the male dog and female dog.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A female dog might have had a hard time but I felt like it is a simple delivery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Am I too much influenced by TV?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I could only watch TV when I was confined in the hospital.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the female dog seems to be safe. That’s good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it’s breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, as a celebration for puppy birth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll give the good part of the wild boar meat which I secured yesterday to the dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I call the male dog and hand over the meat. He then took it to the female dog.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No way, is he dominated?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I think it is normal for a man to take care of her woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, it is just a proper act since the female has just given birth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I add woods on the bonfire and replenish the drinking water in the storehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if I should extinguish the fire but if they are troubled by it, I think the dogs will take some action.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they have done nothing this morning, I judged that there is no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if a newborn puppy will burn itself, I’ll feel sorry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should make a fence around the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will increase the fireplace impression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should also have breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Toilet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….Speaking of which, the body of the two of them were badly bruised, are they going to be okay?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I look at the male dog’s body, it’s certainly full of scars but it’s healing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing their state yesterday, do they have high healing ability?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, since they don’t mind it, I guess there is no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m going to look for food. I’ll leave this place to you. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I said that to the male dog and decided to head for the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I divided the wild boar meat into two so they’ll have food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is still rabbit meat but I preserved it by roasting it so it’s unreliable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can get over with it using the all-purpose farming tool but those two can’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, they have lived even before coming to my place so they might be able to do something about it…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those two….I’m planning to keep the six of them including their newborn puppies but what plan do they have?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did they just come to me give birth and plan to leave when the puppies grow up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If so, I feel somewhat lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want them to leave me at least one puppy cause it was cute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess it will not be possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, no, wait, wait.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It is not yet certain that they’ll leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, let’s have them think that my place is a good place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, if possible, I want them to help me protect my field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore….I need to secure food. I have to show them that I’m a resourceful master.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Ten days have passed since the puppies were born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two dogs and puppies were completely taken care by and were indebted to me to look for another place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope that they can assist me with my work.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Surprise number 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two parent dogs are able to lightly jump over the log fence and moat that I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They can jump at the height of about two to three meters and a distance of five to six meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then why did not jump over when they came here the first time? It is because of their injuries? Or is it because the female dog is pregnant?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, the parent dogs move around without permission and come into the forest and hunt rabbits etc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why they did not eat it as it is and brought it before me. Do they recognize me as their master?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or are they ordering me to remove the fur?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I’m saved because they secure food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, because I’m a bit uneasy, I expanded the width and the depth of the moat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, parent dogs are jumping over without minding it ……</p>

<p class="calibre2">Surprise number 2.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The growth rate of puppies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppies’ bodies are getting really big.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are small and cute in the early days but in just 7 days, they stopped drinking milk and start eating meat like their parents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you look closely, their teeth are beginning to grow and the fangs are also showing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they still have that cute atmosphere.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Surprise number three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dogs, both parents and puppies, are guarding my field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be precise, they were driving away the birds that are approaching the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, when they found suspicious bugs, they bark and call me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">reliable.<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, I was worried about the dog’s excretion for a while but I was thankful that they are doing it in a specified location.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These dogs might be highly intelligent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I focused on securing food and building a new storehouse these past ten days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason for those are more mouths to feed and the dogs are treating the previous storehouse as their house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not have a hard time securing food because of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I already have an experience in building one, the new storehouse is more steady.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it more comfortable living there?</p>

<p class="calibre2">My crib is built by making a hole in the tree trunk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it is in a tree, I can’t use fire in there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I make my crib the storehouse and make this my new shelter?</p>
<p class="calibre2">After considering it… I made a floor by arranging wooden boards on the ground of the new storehouse and decided to live there.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, while looking at the state of the field, I secured some lumbers and started making small items.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Specifically, plates and cups.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The plates and cups that I used until now will become the dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the time I first created one, I became able to make the new one’s remarkably well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that it is a level that I can sell them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I am not satisfied with that and now I am challenging uniting woods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Up to now, the only process I could do is cutting from a big wood and its disadvantage is being a little too heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">***TN: He is basically saying that he is going to try making tools made by a union of different wood parts. So far, all small furniture he made are solids, which are either carved or cut from a single trunk ***</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though plates and glasses are just fine, things like buckets that can store water are heavy and hard to use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have the all-purpose farming tool so I can pick them up using the hook but I don’t want to rely on it on everything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I can make something by uniting different wood parts, I can make something lighter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The end goal is a tub. I’ll try making a bucket for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How can I prevent water from leaking?</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’m also securing leaves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its main use is as wipes for the toilet.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Next is bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I found grass and collected it for the purpose of using it as toilet wipes but after using it, I understood that I shouldn’t have so I just keep it as it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you enter the forest, it is hard to look for something because it grows to some extent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, I started collecting them in order to use them as bed although I’m surprised that I gathered more than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not heavy but it is quite a labor to take the grass I mowed from that place just to make a bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the result of that hard work is wonderful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the puppies are the first to get a bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was scary to have a grass bed near an open bonfire so I cleaned up the doghouse first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put the grass bed because of the delivery but at least they won’t be cold now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder how long this grass bed will hold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a little depressing thinking that it is necessary to collect again when it withers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can’t I do anything about it?</p>

<p class="calibre2">It is really early but the growth of the bud on the field is good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I began anticipating what was growing up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Carrot, potato, cabbage, tomato, pumpkin, cucumber, eggplant, radish, spinach, corn, watermelon, strawberry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those are the crops I’m imagining when making the ridges.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So the crops you pray for when making the ridge will grow?</p>

<p class="calibre2">I want to experiment, but for the time being, I don’t want to do something again until the crops in front of eyes can be harvested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I haven’t raised a crop until now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t even know how much water is good or bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the crops that I know of do not bloom this quick.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, these might be plants unique to this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, I divide one side of the field. I plowed around the perimeter of the ridge using the hoe form of the all-purpose farming tool on one side, I put some fertilizer and water the other, and did not do anything on the next.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s predict how it will affect the harvest.</p>

<p class="calibre2">One thing that is common to all crops is insect extermination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it did not know how to make agricultural chemicals, I thought about using fire but thinking about how it will influence the crops, I didn’t do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, insects dislike water so I changed the form of the all-purpose farming tool to a watering can and sprinkled water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I discovered that the insects hate water when I was watering the crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, when I found a pest-like insect, I transform the all-purpose farming tool to a watering can and water it to eliminate it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the dogs did not try to eat insects at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that they’re good with the meat of beasts.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-31"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 9 &ndash; Dog’s Names</h1><p class="calibre2">I decided to give the dogs a name.<span id="calibre_link-108"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not good to call them male dog and mother dog forever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, I already name the four puppies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because they are black puppies, I named them Kuroichi, Kuroni, Kurosan, and Kuroyon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroichi is curious and active.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroni is cautious and is always near Kuroichi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurosan is the strongest of the four. She’s the only female among the four of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroyon has his own pace. He does things differently from the other three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was calling the four with such a feeling, I incidentally thought of the names of the parent dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought Kuropapa and Kuromama are acceptable…</p>
<p class="calibre2">But when I called them that, they had a very sad face so I decided to think firmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Choices:</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro</p>
<p class="calibre2">Black</p>
<p class="calibre2">Schwarz (TN: German)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Noir (TN: French name, can be read as No-wa)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nero</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hei</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurotaro</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuromaru</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was a little embarrassed by my lack of naming sense but I decided to write the name on the ground for the moment and let him choose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I intended to write japanese but it was converted into a strange character.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I can read it without problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it the influence of the beginner pack that God said?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, I have not talked to anyone and I did not realize that because I haven’t write any letters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I let him decide the name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once Kuropapa decided his name, I’ll think of a matching girl name for Kuromama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At this time, I reconfirmed the high intelligence of the dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they able to read the characters I wrote? Kuropapa chose “Schwarz” but Kuromama protested and pressed his head over Kuro.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did you lose the protest? Kuropapa touched the character “Kuro” unwillingly with his paw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are you okay with that? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">He heard it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he did not answer. Kuropapa’s eyes seemed to tell me “ I can’t disobey my bride.”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….I’ll let you eat something luxurious tonight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has been decided that Kuropapa’s name is now Kuro.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, how about Kuromama?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Choices:</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shiro</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuki</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tsurara</p>

<p class="calibre2">Mizore</p>
<p class="calibre2">After thinking for a while, Kuromama seems to have decided on Yuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He seems to wonder why I tried naming her Shiro. It’s because she’s Kuro’s bride although that would be like me disregarding her fur color.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Kuro = black, Shiro = white, Yuki = Snow</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro seems to be thinking that his naming sense if probably better than mine. I feel like he’s looking at me wanting to say that but I want to think that it’s just my imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, Kuromama’s name has been decided to Yuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro, Yuki, Kuroichi, Kuroni, Kurosan, and Kuroyon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The name Yuki seems out of place but let’s not mind it.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Kuro and the others are basically free.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They go to the woods and look around the fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, one of them stays near me for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they doing some guard duty system?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, my loneliness from working alone has decreased a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I had some free time, I made a flying disc with wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you have dogs, you should have this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried throwing it to play with the puppies but it appealed to them more than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only the puppies, Kuro and Yuki also compete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are quite serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppies don’t give up either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’d like it to be more harmonious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had no choice but to make one for each of them and throw them in turn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fight between dogs ceased but I want you to stop bringing me your flying disc when I’m free.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dogs’ physical abilities are so great that I have to give my best throw to satisfy them… My arms hurt.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-52"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 10 &ndash; Dog?</h1><p class="calibre2">Thirty days after the puppies were born.<span id="calibre_link-109"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppies grew considerably big and they looked like Kuro and Yuki now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And a new discovery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Horns started to grow from the puppy’s forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">When I look at Kuro and Yuki, I see that they have a broken horns on their foreheads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is probably the reason why Kuro and Yuki let me stroke their backs but not their heads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From around the time when the horns of the puppies began to emerge, they let me pat their head but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their broken horn is painful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it grow again?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they really dogs?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I don’t particularly care about the horns growing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a different world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t mind if they grow horns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe they are enduring pain with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahaha</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since you have horns that are shaped like a knife made of metal, I want you to stop rushing to me head on.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The crops in the field are growing up quickly and healthily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of them are fruits. The strawberries and tomatoes are already turning red and seems to be harvestable already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Carrots and potatoes are leafy which is something good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be able to harvest soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These are the fields that I took care of when I divide the fields…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Them growing up fast might be a result of me taking care of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, it will be better to give water and fertilizer to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next one would be the fields with crops that I gave fertilizer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then fields with crops that I water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And fields with crops that I did nothing at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there are still crops in the fields that I didn’t do anything with.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that how this world works? Or is it all thanks to the all-purpose farming tool?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, when I thought about harvesting, I thought of a troubling situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are too many to harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed to all-purpose farming tool to knife or scissors and harvest them. Even if I didn’t get tired harvesting them, just remembering it makes me feel dizzy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Kuros did not help me harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I harvested those all by myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t hate it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t dislike it ……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did my best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to finish it somehow but it took me six days to harvest 12 fields.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I intended the tree trunk to be the food storage place but since it didn’t fit, I began putting them to my own house.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Problem number 1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the tomatoes are already ripe, they should be eaten in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, the Kuros ate them happily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Problem number 2.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The strawberries are also ripe already so they should be eaten in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not all Kuros liked them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurosan and Yuki ate them with pleasure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The females like them but it seems that the males don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They ate them happily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Problem number 3.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We have to eat them soon before they get rotten.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Problem 1, 2, and 3 are the same.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Problem number 4.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no seasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Problem number 5.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no cooking utensil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu….</p>
<p class="calibre2">My life won’t get better with just farming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without salt, even boiled corn is tasteless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I want to make a rice paddy next.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, if its rice, I can eat it just by cooking it…cooking utensils…Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Problems are piling up.</p>

<p class="calibre2">After harvesting and eating the harvests, I started making cooking utensils.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the pumpkin, it’s hard when raw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a stone board for grilling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut a large rock with the all-purpose farming tool, hook it and carry it, then arranged it in a way that I can put fire below.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, it seems like a table made of stone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is possible for the all-purpose farming tool to cut the rock thinly but it will be difficult to ascertain the limit because the rock can crack by its own weight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was completed but I think it would be useless unless the stone board was heated for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This might be the limit for now.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Next, kitchen knife.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can cut crops with the all-purpose farming tool but I want to make a kitchen knife that can cut meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will also be made of stone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shaved a stone of moderate size into a kitchen knife and sharpen the blade part.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It cuts the rabbit meat with ease so it might be good enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about making spares so I made three of them.</p>

<p class="calibre2">And a pot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I begin making it by scrapping a big rock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will burn if it is made of wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I easily made one using the all-purpose farming tool but it’s heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I discovered clay someday, I’ll make a pot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, the pot was completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also made a matching lid made of stone but I imagined using it when it’s hot and abandoned it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to make the lid with wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It became a little troublesome because the Kuros got excited when they thought that it was a new flying disc.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-71"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 11 &ndash; Kuro’s Side</h1><p class="calibre2">I don’t have a name.<span id="calibre_link-110"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I am a creature that wanders through the forest and lives the days of my lives by hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have always lived like that and I thought that I will still live like that in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there was a fated encounter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A female with the same form as me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking how good of a female she is, we were attacked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know what it is but I counterattacked, but I can’t do anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was confident with my fighting power but I was not able to do anything with the enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was prepared for my death, female ordered me to cooperate with her and we were triumphant in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was not able to do anything about it alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have lived alone ever since but now, there are two of us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When a male and a female are together, the female’s stomach will grow because they have done something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m going to have a family.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I don’t feel bad about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While we are spending our daily lives in the forest, when she was about to give birth, we met the worst enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The inhabitants of the forest could only hide against it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Grappler bear.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the king of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its ridiculously big body match its power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if its movement as a whole is slow, the movement speed of its limbs is fast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Normally, if we meet it, we should escape immediately but female is pregnant and won’t be able to do that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible to run away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I used myself as a shield when the <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> was about to attack female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Scary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I found out that it is impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, we can’t escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to earn her time to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought so and stepped forward in a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">grappler bear’s</em> arms mowed down the nearby tree when it attacked me and female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The splinter hits female but she was able to protect her belly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can’t be helped so I shielded her with my body and was blown away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Overwhelming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My whole body was tattered with a single blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Female got wounded too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I faced it full of determination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> disregarded me like ridiculing my resolution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it a whim? I really don’t know but it must have already had a full stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Irritating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s irritating but I can’t do anything about it.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Rather than that, we should move before it changes its mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We left that place with me defending female.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Several days have passed since then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My injured body is so heavy that I can’t hunt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing our condition, it is hard to catch a prey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hit and kill it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I grow excited, I won’t get anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will only make me hungrier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I, at least, need to feed female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m concerned about the pup in her belly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking that I have to do something, we arrived at a strange place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Trees were lined up in front of a soil that was dug up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apart from the dug up part, the trees that are laid down are trees that even I can’t scratch. They are called unfalling large tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beside it is the same type of tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How many of it are lined up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I tried barking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Due to hunger, my voice was more miserable than I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it was not useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A human came out from the other side of the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a meager guy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A prey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment I thought so, bad feeling attacked my whole body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt fear much stronger than the time we faced the <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That feeling is coming from the guy in front.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, even if humans are meager, they are surrounding the outer part of the forest and do not go deep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be able to live alone in the depth of the forest, you need to be stronger than humans. This is such a place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yet, he’s here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must not judge him with his appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, I just thought that we’re in a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was convinced when that human took out a stick and took a stance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only barked but I have summoned such a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s too late to regret it now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that female, who’s behind me, had prepared. She lining up behind me now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When it comes to it, I’ll just do what I can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I wish he would at least spare female but such a convenient thing will never happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked at female’s face.</p>

<p class="calibre2">When I thought that this is the end, I got scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is not the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The human invited me and female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not feel like escaping for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we followed the human, we saw a <em class="calibre5">great boar</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a big boar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is one specie who competes with us for the hegemony of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even female and I can’t beat it together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it has become meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I realized the strength of this human.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After that, human gave us the <em class="calibre5">great boar</em> and gave us a place for female to give birth to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, he can easily hunt prey in the forest for us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should give him my thanks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my mind, whatever happens, I don’t want to go against him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, female and I recognized this human as our master.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though our pups don’t understand it yet because they were just born but I don’t want to oppose master if possible.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Yoshi yoshi yoshi! 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Master treats us like dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I, female, and pups are species called <em class="calibre5">Inferno Wolf</em>…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it be all right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m a little scared if he ever found out that we’re not dogs.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-90"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 12 &ndash; Reconfirmation</h1><p class="calibre2">There are too many insufficient things.<span id="calibre_link-111"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I already know it but I was conscious about these again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, I want at least a seasoning. Salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the crops are delicious the way they are, I want saltiness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, salt is necessary if you are thinking about cooking and preservation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there is no sea around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I plowed around the area of my residence but all I see at the distance are mountains in every direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the place where I am is similar to a basin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, finding a sea is hopeless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My only hope is finding rock salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But will I be able to find one?</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">It would be pointless if I don’t look for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But before that, I need to plow the field again after finishing harvesting and raised the next crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can produce my desired crop if I think about what crop do I want to grow in it while making ridges using the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because there is a limit of storing crops, I will not make much this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to do an experiment to understand what I can do and what I can’t do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I tried designating a part of the field for fruit crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is easier to preserve fruits and I don’t have to panic in harvesting too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, they will be apple, pears, tangerine, orange, persimmon, and peach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fruit crops came from trees so they don’t need ridges. I tried making assumption if I planted the seedlings here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I intended to plant them in one field, I got a bit uneasy so I put four on one field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I used two fields for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the fruits grow well, I’ll plant more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, the Kuro’s liked tomatoes so I planted them in two fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, I also tried planting rice on one side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that rice grows from seedling then plant them in a paddy field….I don’t know the details about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to try various experiments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I’m worried about whether I can make rice paddies using the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, if I try using the water from the well for it, my physical strength will be wasted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I want to eat rice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rice seedling is just phase one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s experiment on creating a paddy field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I want oil so I’ll also plant rapeseed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it goes well, I’ll need to devise a method to squeeze them…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can I transform the all-purpose farming tool into a squeezing tool?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does that kind of tool even exist?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will I be alright later?</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the squeezing idea, I planted sugarcane on one side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apart from salt, if this goes well, I can produce sugar.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In addition, I also tried plating soybean and wheat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Through this empty field, I think I’ll experiment rice paddy here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These cost me two days.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I feel rejuvenated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I head for the forest in search of new things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When going to the forest, at least one of the Kuro’s is accompanying me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In some cases, my escorts increases.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m delighted but I want them to guard the fields…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried advancing on various directions but nothing particularly happened in 10 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter where I go, nothing changed; it’s still forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We encountered the usual fanged rabbits, big rats, and big wild boars.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The encounter rate is 30:8:1.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that there are many fanged rabbits in this forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I saw a tall weasel-like animal but it ran away as soon as it sees us so I don’t know how exactly it looks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, the kuro’s are aggressive so animals don’t get near us.</p>


<p class="calibre2">However, it is a pity that I didn’t find anything new.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe it is not good that I advanced only to a degree where I could return to my residence by nightfall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the directions I plowed to can be considered as mapped, I don’t think the soil will be flat again soon…</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I keep doing this, the forest surrounding my residence will be done for and it will be harder to secure woods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if the day will come that I’ll need to secure woods somewhere else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about it while eating boiled spinach, radish, and carrot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want salt or other alternative seasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll look for 10 days more but if I can’t find anything, I’ll work hard for wood security.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, in the 10 days where I was exploring, the rice and wheat germinated and small seedlings show up from the fruit crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope that I’ll be able to harvest fruits without any problems.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Plowing while searching.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I really need to plow thinking that I need to secure woods?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, I should try using the all-purpose farming tool other than the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A tool that is easier to move with other than a hoe….wheelbarrow?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it possible?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, if there is a space where this wheelbarrow can advance to, I’ll go there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I only need to push this thing and doesn’t have to plow, my movement speed also increases.</p>

<p class="calibre2">However, I thought of something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never got lost in the forest because I’m moving while plowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I don’t plow, I’ll get lost.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I give up on the wheelbarrow idea?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I thought about that, Kuroyon, who’s accompanying me today, came into the wheelbarrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroyon is wagging his tail as if he got a new toy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s right, if I’m with the kuro’s, I will not get lost.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why? The kuro’s are always entering the forest alone and come back with hunted rabbits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ohh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s really a great idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s go with that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, since it can transform to a wheelbarrow, I tried transforming it to a bike or a mountain bike but it was not possible.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-6"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 13 &ndash; River</h1><p class="calibre2">Exploring using a wheelbarrow made me lose my way as I thought.<span id="calibre_link-112"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, thanks to the kuro’s, I was able to return to my resident so my explored area has expanded dramatically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the fifth day of my exploration, I saw a river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is river where there are rocks all over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think the width is about 5 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I walked upstream at the riverbank a little, I found a big rock wall with waterfall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I say that it’s a waterfall, it’s not really a waterfall. It looks like a cliff with 60 degrees slope.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it is quite high.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About 7 to 8 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a spectacular scenery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried catching the water flow with my hand and it is quite cold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the water is clean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This should be drinkable…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro, who’s accompanying me today, is gulping water so it seems to be alright.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After finishing drinking water, I asked Kuro about the whereabouts of my residence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro turned his head without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I changed the wheelbarrow form of the all-purpose farming tool to a hoe and began plowing towards that direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need to make a road that connects my residence to the waterfall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I used the hoe until it was about to get dark. I changed it to a wheelbarrow and went back to my residence for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next day, I asked Kuro the direction of the waterfall and plowed from my residence to that direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also made various thing so it took me 15 days to complete the path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The waterfall is located about 5 kilometers west of my residence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s pretty far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The river with waterfall is curved and it seems to be flowing from north to south-southwest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will I find something downstream?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, let’s think about it some other time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I made a road all the way to the waterfall in order to secure water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have been using water from the well for drinking and watering the field but it is difficult to carry it because it’s from underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the waterfall has a certain height.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, if I can make a waterway from the high waterfall I can secure a lot of water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be for watering fields and rice paddies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I thought of bath a while ago, it is difficult to carry the amount of water needed from the well so I kept on postponing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be difficult to make a waterway all the way to my residence.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Although the Kuro’s are here, there are a lot of dangerous animals in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I build a waterway using the moat before the log fence, there is a possibility of something crossing and invading us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Okay, let’s make a big reservoir outside the moat and log fence that is surrounding the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size would be 100×100 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be like an inverted pyramid where it will be deeper towards the center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The deepest portion would be about 5 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ve also done other things so it took me 10 days to complete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next is to dig drainage on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not so difficult since I just need to direct it to the downstream side of the river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I manage to inaugurate it a few days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, all I need to do is to make a waterway towards the reservoir….</p>
<p class="calibre2">How should I make it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I can’t take water from the upper part of the waterfall, water won’t flow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, I need to make it to a certain height.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Idea 1: Make it using wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Advantage: Easy to make, maybe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Disadvantage: Fragile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I can process woods using the all-purpose farming tool, I have to assemble it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I managed to complete the waterway made of wood, I don’t have nails or ropes to stabilize it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not feasible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Idea 2: Make it using rock.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Advantage: Hard to break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Disadvantage: Hard to make.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is harsh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need to arrange rocks in order to let the water to flow…</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not realistic to arrange rocks from the waterfall to the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ve already plowed everywhere before but I was not able to find big enough rocks for that purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The rocks I need to use for this must be at least 1 meter tall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, that height must be maintained for a distance of approximately 5 kilometers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Idea 3: ……….earth?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why don’t I make it with earth then solidify it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I hit the earth with the hammer form of the all-purpose farming tool, it solidifies like a concrete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s it!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Earth is everywhere and I just need to dig one like what I did with the drain too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s a really good idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll execute it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, let’s go back to business.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-25"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 14 &ndash; Waterway Making Begins</h1><p class="calibre2">Waterway making has only advanced a little.<span id="calibre_link-113"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I piled up soil from the waterfall to the reservoir and hardened it with a hammer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I’m not getting tired since I’m using the all-purpose farming tool, I’m the only one working on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, I also need to take care of the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I spent 10 days to advance 500 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only one-tenth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, I need to increase the amount of soil used as I go towards the waterfall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t think that it will be completed after 90 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I disregard night and day and work on it non-stop?</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if I do that, the kuro’s will be affected too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, my planted tomatoes, rapeseed, and sugarcane can now be harvested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, my waterway work was interrupted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I focused on harvesting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As usual, the kuro’s favorite is the tomatoes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They eat it happily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the rapeseed needs to be squeezed to take oil, I only harvested and stocked them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll take them out after for squeezing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the sugarcane, the odor and sweetness spread in my mouth as I chew it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tasting sweet after a long time, I’ve teared a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was chewing a sugar cane, the kuro’s looked at me as if they want one too so I gave it to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that among them, Yuki and Kurosan are the only ones who liked it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like with the strawberries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut and gather.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wheat and soybeans need to be threshed so I’m a little troubled because I never thought about threshing at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s nothing I can do as of now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I’ll just cut it all and think about something later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the rice….I intended to do something about the seedlings but I left it halfway because I prioritized looking for salt and making waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was not able to experiment on paddy fields too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made the reservoir for the rice paddy and I need the waterway for it….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that they would be useless but I was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The seedlings grew up and grains showed up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I did not plant them in a paddy field, is there a problem with the yield?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or is it some different variety?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only yearned for farming but I realized that I don’t know anything at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I also harvested all the rice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruit crops are now big trees but not enough to bore fruit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess it will take more time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the growth rate is quite different from normal.</p>

<p class="calibre2">And, thinking about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it possible for me to plant cedar?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Am I worried about securing woods?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should not panic. I need to do one thing at a time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After finishing harvesting, I planted tomatoes on two fields and let the other vacant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I can do a lot of things, there’s a limit to what I can do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, I need to complete the waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I resumed working on the waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m endlessly working on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it is depressing to do only that, I searched the forest for a change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I haven’t given up on searching for rock salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, rock salt is a crystallized salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I probably can’t find any of it near the river so I decided to look for it in the opposite direction of the river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s no result.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the 30th day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I noticed that the tomatoes I planted on two fields are almost ready for harvesting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The temperature is falling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Season?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s it!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought about the possibility of winter!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the rate of growth of the crops is fast, I’ve been careless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There seems to be season in this world too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps this is not that strange different world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How many days has it been since I got here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I harvested twice and it will be the third soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It takes 40 to 50 days from planting to harvesting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering 40 days, about 120 days?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has been four months since I started raising crops?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that it was spring when I arrived here……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I died on May.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If that is the case, then it is September now, or should I consider October?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If this place is the same as Earth, it will be cold for some time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I consider that the cold days will be for about at least 90 days?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I need to secure food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it snows, it will be impossible to go outside.</p>

<p class="calibre2">……………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not the time to make waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should farm in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Potatoes, sweet potatoes, radish, and carrots are storable for a longer period of time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, I need fire to protect myself from winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need firewoods to make fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, firewoods are dried woods but using the all-purpose farming tool, the trees it cuts can be used as firewoods immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m thankful for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stacked a large amount of firewoods on the back of the large tree where I used to live in.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-46"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 15 &ndash; Winter preparations and New Resident</h1><p class="calibre2">I completely forgot about the possibility of winter.<span id="calibre_link-114"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I said I want to be a farmer but I definitely made a blunder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crops should have notified me but because of the out of the norm crop growing speed, I never noticed what season it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The weather too. So far, there were only 2 to 3 days heavy rains where I won’t be able to do anything outside, the rest are just light rains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those totally made me careless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though there is only one human, I need to consider securing foods for the kuro’s too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In order to store meat, I made a basement that would act as a refrigerator.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will turn cold just by being in the underground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have made one sooner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And hunt rabbits with the kuro’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………..If you’re looking for something, you won’t encounter them easily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I was not able to hunt even one, the kuro’s hunted steadily because of that I was in charge of blood draining, internal organs, and meat processing instead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Blood draining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m working to remove the blood of the prey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bloody smell of the meat decreases as I drain the blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember the rabbit meat that I ate after I drained its blood was as delicious as the boar meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I tried draining blood as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the internal organs……….several parts are scary so I throw them away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuro’s are like “Eh? Why are you throwing them away?”. They look sad. Internal organs are easy to rot so they should be eaten immediately after processing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, depending on the part, feces, urine, gastric juices……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also saw melting big insects and frogs with mysterious colors. I don’t think I can bring myself eat something that contains those.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the previous world, the only meat I eat is herbivores….I better not eat internal organs of omnivores and carnivores.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah………..but, aren’t these valuable nutrition source for the kuro’s?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never heard any wild animals that avoid eating internal organs……Rather, they eat internal organs first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">My knowledge from my previous world is working so other than the digestive system, I gave everything else to the kuro’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What about this stone like thing near the heart?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this gallstone?</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this is not a rabbit exclusive thing since the boar also has one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this common for the animals of this world?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this thing can be eaten?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried giving it to the kuro’s and they gladly munched, crushed and ate it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….is that delicious?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the internal organs are exclusively for the kuro’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And they should eat it on the same day. There’s no way I’ll stock it until the next day.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, Kuroichi, Kuroni, Kurosan, and Kuroyon are still smaller compared to Kuro and Yuki but I think that they are already fine adult dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the center of their foreheads, there are red, knife-like horns growing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I left the kuro’s to be in charge of meat security and just concentrate on supporting them then, they manage to lure a big boar.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Did they want me to take care of it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they depending on me? Or, did they give it to me because I can’t hunt at all….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I can’t let that invade the field so I hit it in the neck using the hoe form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, drain the blood and take off the internal organs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I’m alone, this amount is more than enough for me for the winter but the kuro’s can eat more than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want a few more boars, I want it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I collected grass as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I obviously use them as wipes for buttocks but they are also important for bed making.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering that it will be cold because of winter, I want to keep a lot more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, the grass bed I made was tattered in 10 days….</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for wiping buttocks, I have to let them as fresh as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I even made a separate storage for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it’s easy to mow grass, it is hard to collect and carry them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried experimenting have the kuro’s carry it. I tied them to the kuro’s body then have all of us move together considering that the kuro’s can’t remove them alone. After that, I realized that I should do it alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like the kuro’s to continue hunting.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Now, clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the kuro’s have their own fur, they have no problem but my top and bottom are just ordinary villager’s outfit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I won’t last at winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took my eyes on the rabbit and wild boar furs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I peeled them off but what should I do next?</p>
<p class="calibre2">They should be tanned but how do I do that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the survival manga that I read a long time ago, it should be chewed to soften but….mou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I saw on TV, after washing thoroughly, the remaining fat on the fur should be melted, and stretched it…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I experimented on a rabbit fur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After spoiling four of them, I gave up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible for an amateur to tan fur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I intended to completely hibernate, and just stay in the house during the winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I went into the shed that I will turn into a house and made several measures against cold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For lighting, I made a dormer window…I made sure to make the window cover to surely fit the window.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I double plated the wall and put grass in between.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The door I made so far are lean type door so I tried my best to make an ordinary door.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Lean type door means the door rest against it, not a thin door</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">The difficult part is the hinge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I have no metallic parts or nails, I gave up. I just directly hinge the door to the pillar.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Though there might be a problem with durability, it will at least lasts this winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This shed looks like a house now that a door was installed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, civilization.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are these all the measures against cold for a house?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I ever need to move out, I’ll rely on the all-purpose farming tool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, what should I do to the toilet?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The toilet also needs protection against cold.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When I was doing variety of things, Kuroyon, who had gone out to hunt, came to call me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there another boar?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I run after Kuroyon thinking so, we move to the place near the under construction waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is the waterway broken?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I advanced while being a little anxious, I saw Kurosan waiting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Near Kurosan was a black, flat object.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A black cushion?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it closely, it’s a big spider.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its body is about two tatami mats in size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not a cushion but a futon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has eight legs to its left and right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it stretched out is legs its probably about six tatami mats.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m not knowledgeable about spiders, its legs are not so long.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its feature? It is covered with hair, not just the body but also the legs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spider beside Kurosan is acting gently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What does it mean?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It doesn’t look like they want me to hunt it like the wild boar….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroyon looks like he’s satisfied as if he performed a big task.</p>
<p class="calibre2">E-to…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was a little troubled, Kurosan barked at the spider as if saying something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if that was a signal, the spider spits threads from its buttocks and begin to skillfully fumbling it with its forelegs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">After about five minutes, the spider wove a sparkling cloth using its own thread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size of the cloth is about fifty centimeters square.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Handkerchief?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It folded it into four and put it in front of Kurosan. Kurosan grabbed it and brought it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gift?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I check the cloth brought by Kurosan, it feels better than my clothes.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Moreover, there is spider-like embroidery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurosan bit the hem of my trousers lightly so I looked back at the spider.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By chance….can spider make clothes?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroyon barks joyfully as if I said the correct answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I do not detest spiders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spiders are beneficial bugs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it is not a venomous spider, then there is no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not venomous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s what I want to think.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In society, it is <em class="calibre5">give &amp; take</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the same with animals and insects.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no unilateral exploitation or service.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is give-and-take.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spider will live with us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will live on the big tree which is my former crib.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can eat anything but it seems to prefer potato.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….it eats potato.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe because it’s a different world spider.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it makes clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, it can customize the form of the cloth and make it directly into clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took my sizes by looking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This spider is highly intelligent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I asked it, it made me curtains for my dormer-window and door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My measures against cold progresses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, there are more amazing things about the spider.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This spider managed to use and work on the fur I had given up on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s totally more dextrous and more knowledgeable than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, it combined the fur and its thread to make new clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In regards to that sense, it is absolutely better than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t part with it anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also gave it a name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From its <em class="calibre5">first impact,</em> Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Zabuton means cushion.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Our new resident.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-64"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 16 &ndash; Zabuton</h1><p class="calibre2">Spider not making sounds seems to be the same in this different world.<span id="calibre_link-115"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">However, spider in this different world seems to make sound using tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kan, kan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the sound of the tree being beaten by another tree. I turn back to the direction where the sound rang.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, it sounded trice in a fast rhythm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">South.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton lives on the big tree where I originally lived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the highest place around since I already plowed the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is twice as tall as the fruit trees growing in the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There, one can see the surroundings better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there is an incident, sound of beating wood will ring to let me know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, it tells the direction too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One beat is north, twice is east, thrice is south, and four times is west.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s really good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, in case of south-west, the tree will be beaten by three times first them four times after that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I proceed in the direction Zabuton pointed out, Kuroni is already driving a beast in my direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is something large and this is the first time I’ve seen it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…what is that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Big weasel?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it’s different from what I’ve seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tanuki?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Tanuki is a dog that looks like a raccoon. Wikipedia link with image is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> here</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">With claws like that, this is the most atrocious tanuki I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, it is being driven away by Kuroni so it is full of hostility.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It waved its fore claws to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it attacked me, I transformed the all-purpose farming tool to its hoe form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the all-purpose farming tool in my hand, I’m very calm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel that my physical abilities are also rising.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I avoided its fore claws.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, hit its neck with the hoe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It lost its head. Kuroni barked so I patted his head to praise him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not much as the wild boar but securing meat feels good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I used the all-purpose farming tool to carry it to my residence. Zabuton came down to help with the dismantling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Zabuton is hanging on a thread, it was quite easy to drain its blood, take the internal organs, and remove the fur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The way Zabuton peels the fur is definitely way better than me. After that, it returned to the tree with the fur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As of now, there should be a large amount of fur on the tree already.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It is getting terribly cold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps it would have been dangerous if Zabuton did not make new clothes.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I also asked Zabuton to make a big sack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I packed grass in it and it became my bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should request for a comforter in order to warm me up at night.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When I was about to harvest the potatoes, sweet potatoes, radish, and carrots I planted on the field, there is already snow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like this place is cooler than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hurriedly finished the harvesting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After storing the harvested produce in the basement, I thought that the fruit trees should have anti-cold measures…but I don’t know any measures for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll leave it this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m sorry.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It seems that the kuros understood that the winter came. They didn’t go to the forest so much to the point that they shut themselves on the former warehouse that became their doghouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I also installed several measures against cold on the doghouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they can’t use fire, I put some cloth that Zabuton made in it to prevent wind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros are snuggling while sleeping in order to keep warm. They are quite lovely.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I think that it is still possible to do something even if it’s winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I think I should make accessories by carving woods and stones on my hut his winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As of now, I still haven’t made anything that doesn’t leak water.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Remember, he can only make solid objects in order for water not to leak. He can’t make something like an assembled basin since water will leak.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">How can woods hold each other tight?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps I need things like adhesives?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should think about it a little more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I make it with wheat flour or corn flour? I should make mortars and stone mils.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, there are also other things I wanted so I guess I won’t be free this winter.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-83"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 17 &ndash; Winter is Coming</h1><p class="calibre2">The real winter came.<span id="calibre_link-116"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The snow has not piled up yet but the considerably cold wind is blowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton shut itself on the tree and rarely shows up. The kuros stayed in their dog house and just waited near the fire the I lit for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’re prepared so there is no particular problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if I need to say something, going to the <em class="calibre5">toilet </em>is troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em> is in a different place from my residence, I have to leave several times a day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is pretty cold outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shut myself to my residence for thirty days and snow started to pile up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m still fine now, if the snow accumulates more, I need to remove it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After 10 more days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if it snows hard, it will only pile up for about 1 to 2 centimeters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, it melts quickly then disappears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was relieved a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I’ll try making stone mill. I am unsure if I can actually create it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should not panic. Let’s do things little by little.</p>


<p class="calibre2">30 more days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The chilly wind has stopped blowing and I think the weather is already becoming spring-like.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Two days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised by the blizzard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Snow has piled considerably too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spring has yet to come.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Ten days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My body was able to sense the rise in temperature.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although there is still undissolved snow in the shade, I think spring is close.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Five days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, it got warmer and warmer, and the kuros came out to go to the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, they were not able to catch any prey so it can be said that spring has yet to come.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Three days later.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Zabuton, who didn’t show up, showed up for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has been so long so I tried to approach it but I was surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were a number of fist-size spiders surrounding Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Eh, to, are they her children?</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was female?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, where is the male?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t really get it but the spiderlings love potatoes like Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The number of my cohabitants increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….yup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spring has come.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 18 &ndash; Spring Has Come</h1><p class="calibre2">The horn of Kuroichi, Kuroni, and Kurosan suddenly fell off.<span id="calibre_link-117"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised to see the place where the horn has fallen from.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it will probably grow again like what happened to Kuro and Yuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro and Yuki’s horn were also like that last year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, they have horns again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I collected the horns of Kuroichi and the others and probably display them in the doghouse as commemoration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their horns look like knives and are quite beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if it will happen again in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, let’s resume my activity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all is the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the winter, the crops are considerably consumed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the winter, I thought of various things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no seasoning so the crops don’t taste that good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Garlic, onion, leek.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t plan on giving the kuro’s those. I just want to enrich my meal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, tea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have thought about it earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I planted two fields each for tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the fruit trees are already occupying two fields, there are only two vacant fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was troubled at first but I decided to plant cabbage and spinach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Greens are important too.</p>

<p class="calibre2">After taking care of the fields, I check the log fence and the moat enclosing the fields next.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was worried that something will happen to them during winter but it seems that there is no abnormality on the log fence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the moat, there is a fanged rabbit but it seems dead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did it plan to attack us?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about hygiene, I guess it’s impossible to eat it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, I decided to make it a fertilizer.</p>

<p class="calibre2">After that, I check the waterway and the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The waterway aside, I was surprised to see that there is some water in the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, is it because of the melted snow?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hammered the bottom of the reservoir with the hammer form of the all-purpose farming tool. It must be the reason why the water was not absorbed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it go bad?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to drain the water but the drainage is much higher than the current water level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t do anything about it so I just left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This probably won’t be a problem.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I decided to resume making the waterway to take water from the waterfall that was interrupted for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though working at it after a long time feels good, there’s still a long way to go.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The amount of soil I need to pile up increases as I approach the waterfall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m a bit worried about the angle since if there will be a problem, it will be hard to correct it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I noticed it, it felt like I’m building something similar to the great wall of China.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The waterway that connects the waterfall to my residence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It really looks like a wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Won’t this break if a wild animal tried crossing it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This will definitely inconvenient anyone who’ll try to go to the other side of the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just bore a hole once it’s completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, there is no need to rush things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought so but still bore several holes for traffic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A real man loves holes.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: A man of culture.</em></strong></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-21"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 19 &ndash; Kuroichi and the Gang’s Journey</h1><p class="calibre2">One day, the cold disappeared completely. It became warmer and it feels good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroichi, Kuroni, Kurosan, and Kuroyon are looking at me seriously while lining up in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What happened?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The snow completely melts and a certain part of the forest has grown more brilRiant than before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As if the representative, Kuroichi barks and they began running in certain directions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I’m getting upset, Kuro and Yuki rubbed their bodies against me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">E to…</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I looked at Kuro and Yuki, they got close to each other as if showing something to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….Ah.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I get it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroichi and the others went out to look for partners.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, ah, ah…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I give them my blessing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I feel lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Auuu.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The next day, Kuroichi and the others didn’t return so Kuro and Yuki cheer me up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they did not say anything, I’m thankful that they are tried to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My heart hurts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also want a bride.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Because Kuroichi and the others are not here, the custom of having one of them accompanying me did not continue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though Kuro and Yuki tried to stay by my side, I asked them to hunt instead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s children worked hard on the field watch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their ribbon-like thread hunts and scares birds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, I appreciate them eating the insects that are trying to infest the crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hard thing is, I have to pay attention to where I step to as I enter the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they are as big as a fist, it will be dangerous if I accidentally step on them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want them to walk on the ground. I want them to be in a place as high as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I thought so, I asked them to move about 5 meters above the field and if they need to do something below, they’ll just have to bungee jump.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amazing!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised seeing the large number of Zabuton’s children.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They seem to exceed 100.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave up the naming of children of Zabuton.</p>



<p class="calibre2">My activities are the following: taking care and harvesting the fields, processing the prey Kuro and Yuki hunted, and making waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to find rock salts but I don’t want to overdo it because Kuroichi and the others are gone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll build the waterway for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is for the paddy field and also for the bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially now that Zabuton was able to make a towel like cloth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was no fabric until Zabuton came so I used to use leaves to wipe my body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, thanks to Zabuton, I can now wipe my body with cloth so my desire for bathing became stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best to build the waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has been 60 days since Kuroichi and the others left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The waterway is halfway done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I’m doing it, Zabuton’s children shed their skin. They become bigger, about the size of a magazine. They helped me in building the waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They mainly carry soil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those are the soil I softened and scooped with a shovel. I put them on big leaves which they carry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The amount they carry are small but because of their numbers, it can’t be considered as a stupid idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, until now, I alone have always been the one softening, carrying, packing and solidifying soil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, thanks to Zabuton’s children I can now concentrate more on what I’m working at.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m grateful at Zabuton’s children and I’m sorry for not being able to name them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, these children of Zabuton does not resemble Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are somewhat similar since they also have hair covering their bodies and short arms but they look like a different species because their pattern is different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it because they are yet to mature?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if they will become bigger by repeated shedding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there a possibility that they have a father I don’t know of?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, since they are helping me a lot on the field works, I’ll have them eat potatoes.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Building waterway and field work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is hard to do both.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was thinking about it, Kuroni came back from the south.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Accompanying him is a black dog bigger than him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did you found your partner safely and return here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tears have fallen a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroni’s partner tried to intimidate me at first but when Kuroni, Kuro, Yuki, and Zabuton got in between, it became gentler.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if they persuaded her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, it is good that Kuroni is safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He doesn’t seem to be injured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also seems to get along with his partner too.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I wish his partner could get used to safety now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, how should I call her?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because she’s Kuroni’s bride, Kuroniyome?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Yome means a lady wedded to a household.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s terrible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Jaa, she’s a female so Yukini?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurosan is a female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Kurosan returned with her partner, what should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, Yuki is also pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it is not obvious if you look at her stomach, I’m pretty sure because Kuro is working harder than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am worried.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a few days of worrying, Kurosan came back from the west.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her partner is a black horned dog which is about her size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am surprised that Kurosan’s partner is full of wounds. Thankfully, Kurosan came back safely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s walking steadily on his feet so I guess he’s fine…</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I looked at Kurosan’s partner anxiously and tried to ask her what happened, she has the “I don’t know anything.” face so I thought of something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…could it be that Kurosan is the one who did it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I like you. Be my husband 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did Kurosan said that then attacked?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, no, Kurosan probably has a lot of suitors so he was injured because of that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, that’s it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurosan nodded as if agreeing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do your best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A few days later, Kuroichi returned with his partner and on the afternoon of that day, Kuroyon returned with his partner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone returned?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroichi looks dignified so his partner watched and followed him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like he’s boasting his partner so I pat his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuroyon is full of wounds and has the atmosphere similar to Kurosan’s partner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was he attacked by his partner?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, that’s not it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was challenged to a fight for his partner and won in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want you to make a happy family.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m glad that the returned but I’m troubled about the names.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I give up on that idea like what I did with Zabuton’s children?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, each of them will give birth after this.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Considering that one couple could birth three to five animals, this is troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about that food, should I need to expand the field?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s do our best in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I refreshed my heart.</p></div>

<p class="calibre2">When I’m playing with the Kuro’s, Kurosan bites Uno’s neck to drag him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During those times, Uno has an “I don’t care anymore” face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hang in there.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The newcomers have begun living like the Kuro’s after a few days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it seems like Kuroichi and the gang’s partners don’t want to enter the doghouse where Kuro and Yuki are residing. They prefer sleeping outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is why my first job was to build a shed for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of expanding the fields for future needs…</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the opposite side where the river is, I made a large <em class="calibre5">space</em> that can fit 16 fields, a four by four field, and enclosed it with log fence and moat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the future, the number of their children will increase so this <em class="calibre5">space</em> is necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I left the log fence between my place and the new one but I fill up the moat on that side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They might feel that they are isolated if the left the moat as it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I’m using the AFT, the supposed to be hard work became easy.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: It’s tiring to always type all-purpose farming tool so I’ll use AFT from now on.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll make sheds for each couple to live in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The place where the Kuro’s are currently living is supposed to be a warehouse. Considering Kuroichi and the others with their future pups, they won’t need such a large place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I say that, the <em class="calibre5">size</em> of the Kuro’s are large.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess they need a room of at least four and a half tatami mat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the entrance…I should consider the height too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll be troubled if they started fighting so building their sheds has been my priority.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…In the future, will the number of sheds increase?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll think about it when the time comes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also dug a well in that place considering Kuroichi and the other’s drinking water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although building the waterway is progressing, it is still a work in progress and it is difficult to bring water to this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dig in a downward direction with a gentle slope so that Kuroichi and the others can drink by themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Similar to the first well, water came out after digging for about 10 meters so I was relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for their<em class="calibre5"> toilet</em>, I dug shallowly in a certain place and prepare some partitioning screen.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Wolves want privacy too when doing their business.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">If it accumulates, I’ll just bury it and prepare another one in another place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have seen Kuro discharging a really big one by accident and the atmosphere between us became awkward for a while.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Besides during winter or at night, the Kuro’s usually go to the forest to do their business so this won’t accumulate easily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about the pups that will be born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This place will be for those new dogs so I decided to call this dog <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I asked Kuro and Yuki to move in the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em> but they refused.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’m glad since I’ll be lonely…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, no, I forgot about Zabuton.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The newcomers Aris, Iris, Uno, and Eris seemed to like tomatoes too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is probably a racial thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At some point, Eris got impatient and accidentally ate an onion but there seemed to be no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that onions are dangerous for dogs but is it different in this different world?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Onions contain an ingredient called thiosulphate which is toxic to cats and dogs. The ingestion of onions causes a condition called hemolytic anemia, which is characterized by damage to the red blood cells. Onion toxicity can cause the red blood cells circulating through your pet’s body to burst.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I shouldn’t be careless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s warn them no not eat it as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, it seems like Eris likes onions so she was troubled a little.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The newcomers also liked the frisbee. They are crazy for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My arm got tired.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I drink tea for a change of pace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The tea was growing too quick that it caught me off guard. I made tea bu picking up the buds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I forgot that I had to roast it first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My first tea taste like leaves on hot water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the buds, since they grow too fast, I was able to harvest buds on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In regard to roasting tea… because I don’t know anything about the roasting condition, I can only use <em class="calibre5">trial and error</em> method.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, the taste can’t be considered a tea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if you don’t compare it to the tea of my previous world, it is still drinkable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At least it’s better than hot water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem with the tea is the lack of tools such as tea strainers. I have to put the tea directly to the cup so I can’t drink to the last drop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s make a tea ceremony set next winter.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-58"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 21 &ndash; Field Expansion</h1><p class="calibre2">I have to expand the field because the number of mouths to feed increased.<span id="calibre_link-119"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The completion of the waterway is still far away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently, we can survive with what we presently have now but I have to plan various things especially when I thought about winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, when they gave birth, the amount of food consumption will increase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I first met Kuro and Yuki, they managed to eat a big boar with just the two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will not hurt to be prepared.</p>


<p class="calibre2">On the south of the current field, I made a four by four field which is similar to the size of the dog<em class="calibre5"> area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s call it new field <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m already used to field works. First step is to use hoe to make ridges on regular intervals then water them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton and her spiderlings play an active part in bird and pest extermination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Zabuton’s spiderlings and Kuroichi and the gang’s <em class="calibre5">partners</em> get along well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised when I saw Zabuton’s spiderlings getting on the back of Aris.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aris seems to be helping Zabuton’s spiderlings on moving around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought Aris is eating them at first so let’s keep that a secret.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’ll utilize this one as a whole field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I plan on using it mainly for experiments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I plow even if I don’t have a clear <em class="calibre5">image</em>, will anything grow there?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What will happen if I plant seeds and seedlings to the place I plowed?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those are some things I want to experiment on.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The crops have grown in the new field <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are fruit-bearing trees but they don’t have fruits yet although they now have flowers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible to expect anything this year but it will perhaps have something next year.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s spiderlings also helped with harvesting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They can’t harvest any root crops because they can’t pull them out. They help harvesting tomatoes, eggplants, and cucumbers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, they put it in a box that I prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I occasionally see them steal eating but I overlook it. I’m grateful for their help.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon seeing Zabuton’s spiderlings helping the harvest, the Kuro’s tried to help too….</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they can only use their mouth to harvest. Moreover, I feel like they are eating more than they harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They gave up after eating grandly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I got angry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I find the reflecting appearance of the kuro’s interesting when I yelled at them.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The waterway building has not advanced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it was because my time was taken by the dog <em class="calibre5">area </em>and the new field <em class="calibre5">area</em>. In addition to those, Yuki and the others are going to give birth soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Yuki and the other’s stomach became obvious, the female camp began to stop hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, the male camp works harder in hunting since the appetite of the females who are about to give birth is high.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They hunt and hunt until they can catch no more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The large amount of fur goes to Zabuton. With that amount, even a part of the floor of my residence has fur covering it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, it took some of my time to dismantle the prey they hunted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the kuros can eat it as it was, they asked me to dismantle them. I guess they got accustomed to the taste of processed meat without blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the big stomach females come to me with begging faces, it becomes impossible for me to refuse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was treated like a butcher of the prey the male camp has hunted.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">rush</em> delivery came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first one was Eris.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She gave birth to four pups then Aris began giving birth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, Kurosan, Yuki, and Iris also gave birth in a dash.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, we usually eat near my residence but aside from Yuki, the others gave birth to their sheds in the dog <em class="calibre5">area </em>so it becomes impossible for us to be together in a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I decided to set tables in two different places.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros prefer cooked meat rather than raw meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have an<em class="calibre5"> image</em> of them liking raw meat….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, when I first met them, they were fascinated by the meat of the wild boar.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It seems that Uno began to look manly when his pups are born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s what I thought because he hunted a huge wild boar alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He managed to hunt it but he came to call for me to carry it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I went fishing in the river for a change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because I wanted to eat fish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I discovered a certain fact there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The AFT can’t transform into a fishing rod.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps there are rules?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For fishing, an “All-purpose Fishing Tool” is needed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although this seems to be a wake-up call, I did not mind it and became apologetic to the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It had helped me sufficiently so far.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I don’t have any complaint about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, although I can’t transform it into a fishing rod, I can make traps using the hoe or shovel to catch fish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no problem at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Other than the thing that I was not able to catch any fish.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Feeling defeated, I assumed that fishing activity is beyond me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems I can’t catch different world fishes unless they are in a place without water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like I can’t use my common sense here with regards to fishes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, there were fishes with fangs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was scared a little.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Several days later, I improved my trap and caught several 30cm long fishes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ate them right away and it was bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They smell like mud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I caught a fish, the kuros did not show any interest at all so I thought that it was strange…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou, regrettable.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-77"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 22 &ndash; Winter Preparation and a Naked Girl?</h1><p class="calibre2">I have begun feeling the chilliness in my residence.<span id="calibre_link-120"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Kuro and the others pups, they are still cute but there is already a horn growing in their heads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I became a little melancholic since winter will arrive soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruit tree did not bear fruits yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I expect it next year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have stored a considerable amount of food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the point that I have to build more underground storage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can call it thorough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have raised and harvested more crops now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thought the waterway is still incomplete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I haven’t secured salt yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will I be alright?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I haven’t tasted any sort salinity ever since coming to this world…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have only eaten either produce or hunted animals and now, fish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can it be supplemented by animal meats?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not quite sure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I roast them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is not possible for me to eat them raw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though my physical condition might worsen in the future…I can’t do anything for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s make it my objective next year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll make it my top priority.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Why does it seem like he urgently needs salt? Salt plays a crucial role in maintaining human health. It is the main source of sodium and chloride ions in the human diet. Sodium is essential for nerve and muscle function and is involved in the regulation of fluids in the body.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next is waterway building.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah…I want a wife.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sleeping alone at night is lonesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially when I see the harmonious family of the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton suddenly consoles me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks.</p>


<p class="calibre2">My plan for winter….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to make various things with wood and stones this year so I collected materials.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, I managed to unite woods without water leaking on them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently using resins in order for that method to succeed but now I’m aiming for no water leak even if no resin is used.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Devising the angle by carving the wood where the parts joins, I managed to prevent water leak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It prevented water leak but when more load was put in it, it cannot take the water pressure so I devised the carving to strengthen the unification.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perfect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I utilized it presently at the water container in the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is one step closer to the bath.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Un.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruit trees are also giving me a good feeling so I’m thinking of planting cypress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the sake of the bath.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Kuroichi and the other’s children don’t have names except for one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because there are too many of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is also difficult to distinguish them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m thinking of asking Zabuton to make<em class="calibre5"> scarfs</em> with names.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I named Kuro’s four new pups.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurogo, Kuroroku, Kuronana, and Kurohachi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kurogo and Kuroroku are males while Kuronana and Kurohachi are females.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not discrimination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are living near my residence so there are a lot of chances for us to meet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A pure white puppy is born among the new pups and it is the pup of Eris and Kuroyon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I named it because it’s completely distinguishable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fubuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it suits her because she looks like snow.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Fubuki = Blizzard</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s female.</p>


<p class="calibre2">At the time when the horns can be clearly seen on the forehead of the puppies, Zabuton informed us that there was an incident on the north side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that the urgency is higher than usual so I have a bad feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To affirm my hunch, I was surprised to see the kuros running all together on the north side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The puppies also acted similarly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did a dangerous guy come?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took out the AFT and followed the kuros.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When I arrived at the place where the kuros surrounded, I saw a naked girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks like in her lower grade of elementary school. She has silver hair and an outstanding pretty face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the future, she’ll absolutely be a beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, her body was full of scratches made by the kuros. She’s currently being confronted by the kuros with a big tree behind her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros are attacking her one after another, on one place after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was blown in succession.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if the girl is an enemy, why are the kuros not holding her down even though their difference in physique is clear?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, wait wait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have to calm down.</p>

<p class="calibre2">However, even though I already clapped my hands, the kuros are still hostile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The surrounded girl noticed me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「H-help me 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can understand what she said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt something after hearing words after a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「All right 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I passed through the kuros and came in front of the girl.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-96"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 23 &ndash; Savage?</h1><p class="calibre2">When I came in front of the girl, I had the kuros fall back and take off my jacket to temporarily cover her body.<span id="calibre_link-121"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it gives the girl a breather so she approached me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t be scared. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I said that, the girl bit my neck and sucked my blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Wild waifu uses leech life + attract…</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl grows rapidly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until a while ago, she looks like a lower elementary schooler now she looks like in her upper grade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her body, which is full of injuries, recovers in a dash and becomes glossy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Eh? Eh? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised when the girl suddenly sucked my blood and it made me unable to move. Kuro made his move and took the girl away from me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, the dogs attack the girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Wait, it’s a misunderstanding. Stop attacking, please. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fubuki dashed, the girl was thrown in the air and was attacked by the dog again before she hits the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the girl fixes her posture in the air, another dog jumps high and slams her on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a body slam.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that, I regain my composure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah…wait wait. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I stopped the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros obediently followed me but they are still in their attack mode posture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the girl, the kuros badly bruised her again and she returned to being a lower grade elementary schooler.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, she’s smaller now compared to earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are you an enemy? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「N-no no, please tell these fellows to calm down!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You sucked my blood but you’re not an enemy?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl before me might be a vampire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t have any idea if there is anyone else can do that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I apologize for sucking your blood. I would have died if I stayed in that state any longer.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「When you suck blood, you recover?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s why the kuros attacked her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She immediately sucked my blood as soon as I let my guard down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Will there be any effect now that you sucked my blood?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that if a vampire sucks your blood, you will turn into a lower class vampire…</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…I-it should have had a charm effect but…it looks like it doesn’t work on you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: …It has no effect.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Will I also become a vampire…Will I become an <em class="calibre5">undead</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You won’t. If you dislike it, I won’t ask for your blood anymore.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…I see. In other words…I won’t be facing any problem with what had happened. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. I only drank your blood to recover. I apologize for the sin I committed unto you so please overlook it. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>

<p class="calibre2">………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let me think.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「For the time being, do you want to suck a little more of my blood?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the girl and the kuros were surprised with my proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-is it alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind. You’re not an enemy, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, ahhh….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl bit my neck while being modest.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Chuchu</em>, she’s sucking it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl’s body grows from a lower grade elementary schooler to an upper-grade elementary schooler and finally into a junior high schooler.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wounds on her body disappears beautifully too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A mysterious spectacle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fuu…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl shows a satisfied expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I checked my body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though my blood was sucked, there is no effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my previous world, I understand how bad you’ll feel if blood was extracted from your body…</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I don’t feel like my blood has decreased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about a little more?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked her to suck more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh?」<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s okay, it’s okay.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「O-okay…thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl sucks my blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From a junior high schooler, she grows into a high schooler.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, I don’t feel like losing blood at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can you drink a little more?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-I can….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl sucks my blood further.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From a high schooler, she became a university student.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fuu…any more than this…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girl says that as if hesitating.,.. no, she is not a girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beside me is a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She can suck that much blood without me being affected thanks to the gift god gave me when I came into this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4">Healthy body</strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">This might also be the reason why the charm has no effect on me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before me is a beautiful woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, she’s naked.</p>

<p class="calibre2">…….<span class="calibre8"> </span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I told the kuros to disperse and decided to invite her to my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, eh, eh? What? Wai…eh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did I act like a savage?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The number of residents increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: MC used snusnu… ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</em></strong></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-14"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 24 &ndash; Loo</h1><p class="calibre2">The name of the vampire is Lulushi = Loo.<span id="calibre_link-122"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I have tried calling her in a number of ways but it eventually becomes Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the way she addressed me changed from Savage, Erotic Beast, Bastard, Village Chief, and now Husband.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN:….it’s super effective.</em></strong></p>


<p class="calibre2">Because I accepted Loo, the kuros accepted her too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was careless so when she met Zabuton and her spiderlings, she fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although she’s a vampire, she’s still a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One would normally be surprised if she saw a giant spider with a lot of big spiders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After she recovered, she somehow accepted my explanation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, she was startled when Zabuton sneaked behind her.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Loo doesn’t necessarily need blood, she can also eat the foods that I eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She especially likes tomato.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though she fought with the kuros, they got along well as they have similar taste.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton requested me for potatoes so I cooked using tomatoes and potatoes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A shocking truth was found out because of that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It started when Loo ate what I cooked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You didn’t add salt? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There is no salt. I looked for it but can’t find it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…….Eh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would never forget Loo’s expression during that time for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I accompanied Loo to the well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the first well that I dug diagonally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that we’re going to the bottom but we stopped somewhere near the entrance. She knocked on the wall and tried to cut off a part of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ground around there is hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Really hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, she just shaved off the rock like wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and I returned and boiled it in a pot with water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you boil it like this, salt will come out.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Once the all the water boils, what will be left is salt.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I obtained the salt that I desire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A few days later, we finally made salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The food now has saltiness.</p>



<p class="calibre2">It seems that in this area, there is no rock salt but there is a layer of soil salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The depth is about 50 centimeters from the ground. Is the whole forest covered with that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, the plants in this forest seem to be special.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, thanks to the AFT, the crops are growing in the fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But because of it, we won’t be able to extract salt from the soil in the fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I offer my prayer to the shrine I made near the big tree.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Changing the topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I checked the surface of the reservoir if there is salt soil there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh…there is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The salt layer might dissolve into the water so I took some soil from another place to cover the layer of salt soil and beat it with a hammer. I beat it again and again to harden it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Loo seems to be able to make her own clothes using magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first time I met her, she was stark naked. It seems that she needs magical power to maintain the clothes. She was wounded that time so she was not able to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Magical powerrr.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was impressed when I saw Loo making fire with magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Going back to the topic, Loo can make clothes with magical power but now she’s wearing clothes made by Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the clothes Zabuton makes are better than the nobles have so Loo likes it a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Loo can freely change her body size, during the day she makes her body smaller similar to a junior high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the reason why she’s bigger at night and smaller at day…it seems like in order for me to be prudent.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: In short, MC won’t lay his hands on Loo when she looks like a loli.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">So she wants me to be prudent…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll be prudent, a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: It seems like erotic beast-san doesn’t have much self-control.</em></strong></p>


<p class="calibre2">Well, since the residents have increased, I need to prepare more for winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’ll be in trouble if I don’t…But since I already have planned various things since spring, it won’t change that much because the population only increased by one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Conversely speaking, I’m glad that the number of people who can harvest increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Zabuton’s spiderlings can’t harvest root crops…</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No way, that’s dirty…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo seemed to oppose doing farm work in the beginning but after 2 &ndash; 3 days, she no longer minds it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her adaptive power is over 9000.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Supposed to be “She has high adaptive power.”</em></strong></p>


<p class="calibre2">After eating, before sundown.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I asked Loo if she can teach me magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to understand the theory but I can’t use it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo said, I’m a person with no magical talent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regrettable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that people with no magical talent can learn magic in about 10 to 20 years, however, the magic they can learn is limited on litting a bonfire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well…it’s not worth the effort.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Loo can use variety of magics.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that she’s a famous mage before she comes here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, she can use variety of magic because she studied different type of magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among them is light magic that is useful in daily lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the darkness of the night, the place where she casted magic will be moderately bright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like if it is casted before the night, it will roughly last until dawn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the insects won’t go near the light magic compared to a bonfire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s really convenient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The downside is that it requires magical power to turn it off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I currently find it useful in lighting the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can use various powerful offensive magic…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When morning came, I also asked her to lit the fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, you don’t have to cast something at that level…」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Winter has come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked hard in various ways until spring.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: According to the trailer and LN’s illustration, the vampire’s name is Loo. After two chapter, I’ll also follow the trailer and will name the angel Tier.</em></strong></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-32"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 25 &ndash; Winter was Short and Spring has Come</h1><p class="calibre2">I feel that the winter this year was short.<span id="calibre_link-123"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it because Loo is here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, spring has come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This year’s goal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Completion of the waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s do our best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The first thing I’ll do this year is to plow the fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to make a new field on the north side for fruit trees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size of the new area is a 16 four by four square fields which are 50 meters each.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruit trees I’ve planted will not bear fruits yet but I know that they would as they grow up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, fruit trees don’t need much attention.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Zabuton’s spiderlings are working hard for pest prevention, my hardship is only at the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bodies of Zabuton’s spiderlings have become bigger so I think that the trees around here will become their new home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The trees I initially planted are apples, pears, tangerine, orange, persimmon, and peaches.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I also tried planting grapes, pineapple, banana, cherry, and chestnut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I planted a lot of tea trees too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and I consumed a lot of tea so the supply unexpectedly decreased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will struggle making tea later but that’s another story.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The kuros went to the forest and began hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first prey of this year is a huge wild boar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As usual, they call for me since they can’t take it home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’m sure they won’t have any problem consuming it in the wild.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, securing meat gives a good feeling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they continue like this, won’t the preys around here disappear?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Isn’t it better to adjust their hunting pace to some extent?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m a little troubled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While worrying about it, the horn on the kuros head began falling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will Kuroichi and the other’s pups go out and find partner too because of this?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll be happy if they could come back safely…</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking about it, I think the pace will increase and it will be bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I’ll think about it when the time comes.</p>


<p class="calibre2">At any rate, before the pups of Kuroichi and the others leave to find partners, Zabuton’s spiderlings had gathered in front of the hut where Loo and I lived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This atmosphere, perhaps …..</p>

<p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s spiderlings lifted one of their legs and waved at me then spit threads from their but and flew away one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they going out to look for partners as well?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">So sudden.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made the fruit area for you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike with the kuros, tears fell from my eyes as I felt that they would not come back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton came in front of the crying me and raised one of her legs as if trying to comfort me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Behind Zabuton, there are still many spiderlings who had not left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You guys …</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that so?</p>
<p class="calibre2">You’ll stay?</p>
<p class="calibre2">And…further behind were countess spiders as large as a fist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spring has come.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After the spiderlings left, Kuroichi and the other’s pups left to search for partners as expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is unexpected that some of the stayed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, it seems that the ones who stayed are couples.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of Kuro’s pups, Kurogo, Kuroroku, Kuronana, and Kurohachi, left. It seems that they understand and naturally avoided being partners with blood relatives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros are clever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fubuki, the only named pup of Eris, stayed with her partner which is Aris’ pup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aris’ son is tattered, well…that…Yeah, get along well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given that there are new couples, it has been my daily routine to construct a shed at the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering future expansion, it’s impossible to construct a detached house for each one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I made a long tenement type sheds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I’m making horse’s stable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I think that’s not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the number of pups who looked for partners, I made a lot of sheds.</p>


<p class="calibre2">As it gets warmer and warmer, I wear the new clothes that Zabuton made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As usual, her fashion sense is better than mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The clothes she made are results of trial and errors so as a way of thanking her, I made wooden <em class="calibre5">mannequins.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">mannequins</em> I made for her are of the same size of Loo and me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m looking forward to your future works.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I also made several pieces of wooden hangers that can be used to store clothes.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s spiderlings who stayed seemed to be able to make simple things like bags but it is impossible for them to make things with complicated shapes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put some grass into those bags to make something like a cushion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo seems to like the cushion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We usually sit on things made of woods and stones so she wanted something soft.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo has been trying hard to make an O-shape cushion for the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I suggested her to make a U shape instead of an O shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was pleased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, it seems like Zabuton’s spiderlings are looking at me with eyes full of admiration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is somewhat embarrassing because the idea came from my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I made some things like<em class="calibre5"> a sofa</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo said that I should have made a bed first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that a night invitation?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best.</p>
<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000026.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-50"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 26 &ndash; Tendon? A Woman with Wings</h1><p class="calibre2">Kuroichi’s pups are about to come back.<span id="calibre_link-124"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was informed by Zabuton about an abnormality in the north.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s the same when Loo came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros all ran to the north at once while me and Loo chased them hurriedly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No way, is there a naked girl again?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo is enough for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we arrived at the place where the kuros are, there was a trembling angel surrounded by the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Angel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She has blonde hair with a lovely face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks like a high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her chest is really noticeable and she really has an appeal of a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She has large wings on her back and is wearing a pure white dress.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the time with Loo, I don’t think she’ll suck my blood. She was bitten in her hands, feet, and wings and she was also knocked down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, I entered the scene to intervene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Wait wait wait 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s exactly like what happened with Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the kuros fall back, the judged that she was saved when she saw me and began crying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My desire to protect her stirred up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I already have Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to leave things to Loo but the angel got furious when she saw Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So this is where you have been! You rotten vampire! 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros respond to her rage and beat her up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the kuros, Loo is already a friend and a family.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While feeling glad for confirming their feelings, I intervened again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uu………Thank you very much. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, she’s bleeding all over that it’s dropping on the ground, she’s pitiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking of what I could do for her, the angel manages to do something with her own power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She heals herself with healing magic. She stops the bleeding and cleaned her body and clothes with magic that I don’t understand well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it cleaning magic?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I thought how convenient it is, Loo’s competitive spirit lits up and says that she can also do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, should I ask her to clean up the excrement that accumulated under the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I can take care of it myself, I don’t feel like doing it…..I’m still not motivated enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the <em class="calibre5">timing </em>is right, I’ll try asking her as a favor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As of now, I know that it will be of no use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Vampire. Why are you hiding here? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and the angel seem to know each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, it seems like they have a hostile relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Well, various things happened. Are you alright? That’s quite painful. 」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「I’m okay now….It is no longer painful. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand because I also almost got killed. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You too? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah. They’re merciless. Magic is also ineffective since they can evade it. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s alright. You are safe now.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it seems different now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like there’s a strange empathy born between them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I apologize for what happened that time. Therefore, let’s stop the dispute here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re apologizing………I understand. Let’s stop our dispute.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you. Then, let me introduce you to my husband.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo suddenly introduced me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? A, aahh….eh to…..I’m Hiraku.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Machio Hiraku.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has been a while since I introduced myself to someone so I somewhat stuttered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Nice to meet you. I am Tier. As you can see, I’m an angel.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Angel race.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is such a race here too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I came here in pursuit of Lulushi-san but…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Pursuit?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Lulushi-san acts violently in a town and she even has a bounty.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should look after Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha…I somewhat overdid it a little that time.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s not a little. Even though no one was injured, it crushed the face of the nobles.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo adds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I came here because I wanted to escape from her.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Escape?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have known Loo’s character to a certain extent…she’s not the type to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo answers my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She’s a little stronger than me because of affinity.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Lulushi, you’ve changed. If it’s you from before, you will absolutely not say that I’m stronger.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufu….I realized my powerlessness.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah…I see. I agree. Your self-conceit will really disappear.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier and Loo looked at the kuros at a distant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That number is foul.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yup.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, since they will no longer fight, let’s welcome her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Anyway, will you come to our house? It’s a poor shed….but it’s better than standing here….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. &nbsp;Come in by all means.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo unexpectedly invited her enthusiastically.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「…Is that so? Then please excuse me for intruding.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I disbanded the kuros and headed to the shed where Loo and I sleep with Tier and Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As we enter the shed, Loo incited the three of us for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-you swindled me! You vile vampire!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My body can’t take it alone. Please do it with me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No one is fool enough to go with that! Release me!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m already satisfied with Loo.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Didn’t I just say that my body won’t last! Hora, now!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The number of resident increased by one.</p>
<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-69"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 27 &ndash; The Number of Residents Increases</h1><p class="calibre2">This has been the tenth day since Tier started living with us.<span id="calibre_link-125"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">She experienced everything Loo experienced and everything was settled now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: I apologize but I can’t really find the “details” of that said experience no matter where I look.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">She also fainted upon seeing Zabuton. Is it normal for women to faint upon seeing Zabuton?</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s not that scary.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Your body certainly won’t last with that. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. I was saved when you came. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two of them, who got along rapidly, are eating cucumber and tomato savorily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier seems to like cucumber and she’s munching it crunchily…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier looks erotic while Loo doesn’t look suited for cucumber.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You can escape via lolification but I don’t have the ability to do that… we need to consider other methods….like increasing the number of partners.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You know husband’s character. We want to increase our numbers but he’ll definitely get mad if we kidnap someone.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. But don’t worry. We don’t need to kidnap someone.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What’s on your mind?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eeehh. I happened to see some before coming here. I’ll take a leave for a while.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「… If you run away, I will chase after you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will not run away because my husband is here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier, after calling me in various ways, like Loo, called me “husband”.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Several days after Tier went out for business, Kuroichi and the others’ pups started to return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some of them were tattered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uhn, do your best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dogs who got here for the first time shows vigilance against me and Loo but became friendly when the kuros mediated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no trouble at all.</p>


<p class="calibre2">One of the returning pups is a little special.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He brought back three <em class="calibre5">partners</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is one of the male pups of Iris.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three <em class="calibre5">partners </em>he brought home are all females.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looks weak but he doesn’t have any injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like he gets along well with the three he brought back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought they are strictly one man one wife…am I wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, as long as there will be no trouble I will not say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like Fubuki, I also named him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Masayuki.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It is the main character of a rom-com, battle manga from my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Reference? No idea.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">He never decided who his partner will be and in the end, he impregnated all the female characters. It made a big commotion in the <em class="calibre5">net</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The legendary man of harem, Masayuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t yearn to be like him because it will take too much vigor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Don’t I already like that with Loo and Tier…</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided not to think about it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When all of Kuroichi and the others’ pups returned safely, it feels like density rose up in a dash.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the tenement-style sheds I prepared was not that bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it is better than sleeping outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And breeding will probably start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They go out to the periphery of the forest to hunt together and come back with prey on their mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I became busy with taking out blood and dismantling internal organs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, they knocked down boars several times and called me to carry it back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I still need to take care of the fields, I’ve been working hard every day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier came back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Accompanying her were seven women.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-91"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 28 &ndash; High Elf</h1><p class="calibre2">「I’m Ria. 」<span id="calibre_link-126"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Ris. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Riri. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Rif. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Rikoto. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Rize. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Rita. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria, Ris, Riri, Rif, Rikoto, Rize, and Rita.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of these women, who introduced themselves, are all of the same race with long ears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Elf? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’re high elves….but we don’t mind if you call us elves. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t really know the difference.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Tier-san recommended us to come here. Please, let us live here. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「eh to… 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I looked at Tier, she placed her hands on my shoulders and looked straight at my face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will explain their tragic past. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elf women had lived in a village north of here. About 200 years ago, they got involved in a war involving humans and their village was destroyed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, their race scattered and began wandering to find a place they can reside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’ve been living while moving in the forest for a long time. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If we can’t find a place to settle down, we won’t be able to increase our population. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please, I beg of you. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The seven of them lower their head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the custom of lowering their heads is something they don’t know but Tier taught them in advance as a way of asking favor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have never experienced something like this before. Seven women lowering their head before me makes me feel a bit shy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They can also be considered as manpower so please. &nbsp;」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I also think that it’s a good idea. I heard that high elves are smart and they look good too. Also, you are still young, right? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier strongly pushes the idea and Loo approves it too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m the oldest. I am a little over 400.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m the youngest. I am around 300.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria is the oldest and Rita seems to be the youngest but I don’t understand their standard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every one of them looks like university students. Some might even think they’re high school students.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of these elves are beautiful. Or are their race is like that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway…they are looking for a place to settle down….</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, I’m glad with the increase in manpower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There are various races cohabitating here, I don’t mind as long as you don’t start a fight.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I gave my permission.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll do my best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please take care of me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Voices of joy came out from the seven women.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The seven of them fainted upon seeing Zabuton. Then, fainted again when they saw the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the first time I saw someone fainting after seeing the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if they are not good with dogs.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Afterward, a shed was built to secure the residence of the seven.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to make a big one where the seven of them could live in and not per individual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a big shed so I guess it’s a cottage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just call it a house.</p>


<p class="calibre2">As expected of a house that can accommodate 7 people, it can’t be completed in one day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll just have Ria’s group to sleep on tents for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cottage construction site is located in the south of the reservoir and west of the new field as requested by them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That will be southwest from my residence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have requested to construct it there but it’s a little far away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size southwest <em class="calibre5">area </em>is similar to a four by four field and they requested it to be built in the center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They might feel lonely because there is nothing in the surrounding….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, let’s just hope they won’t since they are the one who requested it. Let’s start the construction as planned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I also made log fence and dug moat surrounding the southwest <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a moat that is in contact with the new field….I’ll leave it for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Defenses for places where people live in should be firm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, we decided the location of the well and the<em class="calibre5"> toilet</em> and constructed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the future development, we also made a basement and a dump site.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can turn all garbage into fertilizers using the AFT but they can’t do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s why they need a dump site.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The digging and cutting of trees are my jobs and the seven of them are the ones processing the woods for construction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to me, they are more powerful and more skillful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I watch them processing the woods especially their method of uniting them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I’ll obstruct their job if I help them so I leave it to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I dug holes, compact the ground, and gather wood according to their instructions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After 10 days, a fine log house was completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, it is an above the ground floor type.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And two floors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m slightly jealous.</p>

<p class="calibre2">But I learned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The method of their construction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be a good idea for me to make a new house.</p>


<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000004.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">The log house is a horizontal rectangular type.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon entering, you’ll be in the large hall and dining area at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like a place where everyone can work or eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is an enclosure at the center of the room where one can lit fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this hearth on the ground?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are doors on the left and right side of the hall. If it were me I’ll make them into kitchen and bath but they made it into warehouses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are also stairs on the left and right side of the hall towards the second floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the second floor, the rooms are on top of the warehouses and there is only one corridor that connects the left and right part.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, the hall feels very open.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The doors on the second floor are lined up at a regular interval.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each one is a private room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each room is a slender type. Inside is a bed, a cabinet, and a small desk and chair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them are made by me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are more dexterous than me but they can’t be faster than me since I have the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, if they don’t like my works, they probably make one for themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are four rooms on each side so a total of eight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that one room is vacant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the futons, cushions, and curtains made by Zabuton and her spiderlings, I’m sure they won’t have a problem sleeping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Un, that’s good.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It seems that they have been accustomed to the life here by the time the log house was completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were especially impressed with the taste of the crops in the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their favorites are pumpkin, radish, eggplant and for some reason, garlic.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Visually,</em> I want them to stop eating garlics like snacks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also sometimes go hunting with the kuros with bows in their hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the kuros don’t seem to dislike their company, they are probably quite skilled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Zabuton and her spiderlings, they can be relieved regarding clothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please, tell me if there is any problem.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand, village chief.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, they call me “village chief”.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I resisted but it was futile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, they called me “King” then “feudal lord-sama” so I guess it’s a good improvement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It took me a hard time to remove the “sama” from “village chief-sama”.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The next night after the completion of the log house, Ria and the others flock to my bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Wh-what are you doing?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">To my question, they answered me as if everything was happening as it’s supposed to be.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Breeding」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「For the sake of our race, thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Tier-san said that if we settle here, we’ll receive good seeds…I’ll do my best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked Loo and Tier for help but it was in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So that’s the reason why the built the house in the middle of the southwest <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Propagating the future, the population will increase because of breeding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I resisted but it was in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Go on, abuse the weak me.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Afterwards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The female camp discussed the rotation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They didn’t ask me for anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Consoling me, who’s sitting in a triangular manner, is Kuroni and Iris pup, Masayuki.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-8"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 29 &ndash; Regarding the Elves</h1><p class="calibre2">Let’s rewind the time a little.<span id="calibre_link-127"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised when Ria’s group arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? You use fire to cook meat? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eehh? By chance, is it prohibited to use fire here? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, that’s not the case …… I thought elf is a race that lives one with nature and hates fire.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha. &nbsp;How are we going to live without using fire?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「With the power of nature….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can you give an example?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Eh to…You get up as the sun rises and sleep as the sun sets. Your food came from trees. You treasure the forest and don’t use iron in order to not damage the forest.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ehtto….Feudal lord-sama」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How many times do I have to tell you to not call me feudal lord-sama…so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please don’t underestimate nature. If we live like that in the forest, we’ll die soon. We might not even last a day.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-yes. That’s right.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I nodded to agree with Ria who answered wholeheartedly. I abandoned the image of elves I had in mind.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though I intended to abandon it….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You can do blacksmithing and mining work too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. We can do the blacksmithing work but the forge…we’ll rely on you for that. Please help us with that. Once you complete the forge, we can do various items made of iron.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That would be great…smithing….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is there any problem?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, it’s just….I didn’t expect that you can smith.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ehh. But if we can’t smith, we can’t make knives or hatchet especially arrowheads.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dwarves won’t have their turn huh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uhn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I followed Ria’s instruction and started making a forge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A good chance to learn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have been traveling for as many as 200 years so it seems like it is possible for them to do most things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only thing they were not able to do is to settle down and to breed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In order to settle down, food security is a must and they will only start breeding when they found a permanent settlement that is not dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that they found a settlement, the problems are that there are no men. Do they intend to recruit somewhere?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not ask for the details.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In reality, I’m in the position of the recruited man.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Ria’s group are also great in terms of harvesting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are especially good at processing wheat which I postponed sometime ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is your wheat?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Well….yes」</p>

<p class="calibre2">I thought that the ear of wheat I harvested before are already completely dry but it seems like that’s not the case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After drying them more, they were threshed then milled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the flow is similar to processing rice that I heard about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria’s group thresh the stored wheat and mill them into powder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only then we were able to bake bread in an open fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is necessary for making bread.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rif showed me the necessary thing that is inside a pot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Inside of it is something like a fermented fruit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to my memory from my previous world….I heard that it will not swell without yeast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Though you never settled down you know various things in details.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m already doing something like this before we became wanderers.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m glad that we can help you with your field. May I ask if we can also have fields of our own?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind….Do you have seeds you want to raise?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. The truth is, we collected them when we were wandering around.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Then, I will assign you to a place where it can’t be affected by other crops.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We will not raise anything that will affect other crops. We will start planting at our backyard first. If we will encounter any problem, we’ll let you know.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「All right.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The AFT is convenient and its only limit is imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about all the things I’ve done, my own strength will never be enough to be a self-sufficient farmer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, I want to work one step at a time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I know Ria’s group war potential and they also cooperated in my waterway making.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Together with Zabuton’s spiderlings, we became very efficient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If this continues, we will be able to complete it within this year….</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s that hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, the season is good and Ria’s group house was completed.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, the kuros gave birth this year too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t figure which is the parents of the pups.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, without being accompanied by their parents, I can’t distinguish which pup is it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would appreciate if they can stand out like Fubuki…they are all black.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can only individually distinguish them using their forehead, more specifically, the shape of their horn. You can identify them individually through the color of their horn, the shape, and how shiny it is…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, the newborn pups have no horns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m also having trouble identifying them when the season changed and their horn started molting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros are clever so they sulk when I make mistake with their names.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And those who don’t have name yet stir up in order to have one for their self.</p>

<p class="calibre2">No, as expected, there is a limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, the mouth needs to feed increase again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s work hard.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I extended the new field <em class="calibre5">area</em> further down south.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The new field<em class="calibre5"> area</em> became a four X eight field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One field is 50 X 50 so the new field<em class="calibre5"> area</em> is now 200 X 400 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That makes an area of 80,000 square meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since 1 hectare is 10,000 meters….it is 8 hectares.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not sure if this farm area can be considered as big or small.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And because I’m nurturing it with the AFT, I can harvest three to four times a year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Me, Loo, Tier, Ria, Ris, Riri, Rif, Rikoto, Rize, and Rita.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros….more than 100 heads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I use head to count kuro’s descendant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the puppy has yet to grow so I’m not sure how to count them in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless of spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….the population increased so it is doubtful if the harvest will be enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, I’m worried if we exhausted the surrounding animals in the forest because of hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the kuros find crops, other than tomatoes, they like, I’ll plant them in large quantities.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When I began to feel the coldness of autumn, the fruit trees I planted for experiment bears fruits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the amount can’t be considered as good harvest, there are still a moderate number of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apples, pears, mandarin orange,<em class="calibre5"> orange</em>, persimmon, peach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was thinking if they’ll take a liking to it, I was surprised that they are all popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros are eating peaches skillfully and left its hard seed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of eating the mandarin orange during the winter but Tier already ate them furiously turning her hands yellow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given her momentum, it will not last before winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria’s group loves apples and pears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I cut an apple into a rabbit shape, they were troubled whether to eat it or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo is competing with the kuros in eating peach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I want her to eat in her adult form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she was eating in her junior high school form, my desire to protect her stirs up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, a fraction of the harvested fruits is handed to Zabuton and her spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The result of my fruit experiment is thanks to Zabuton and her spiderlings.</p>


<p class="calibre2">All this time, I only planted trees as experiment but next year, I’ll do my best for the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It is popular after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I love persimmon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I like its texture and the kick of its flavor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel good about the persimmons I just harvested.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-26"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 30 &ndash; Engagement with Different World Objects, Reversi and Chess</h1><p class="calibre2">Tier’s wings are not just for show, she can use them to fly.<span id="calibre_link-128"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">So under her white dress is a pair of trousers.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: You didn’t expect that did you?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike manga and anime, there’s no one who flaunts their <strong class="calibre4">pantsu</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pata pata pata…..</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: SFX for flapping wings.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although traveling by flying is fast, she doesn’t fly frequently because it consumes too much stamina.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were also times where she was caught with the threads of Zabuton and her spiderling’s web when she tried flying in the field. She was caught and was exposed in an ungraceful appearance. That happened three times already.</p>


<p class="calibre2">She can freely hide the wings on her back. They can be withdrawn and retract as she wishes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t understand how she was able to do that so I decided to not think too much about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this different world, I can be considered as an ant in terms of magic knowledge.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Similarly, Loo can fly too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems one can fly even without wings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, she said that she’s not proud of her flying ability and I believe her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s practicing in some other place when I was not around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, like Tier, Zabuton’s thread also caused her trouble several times.</p>


<p class="calibre2">With regards to cooking, Loo, Tier, and Ria’s group are sisters in arms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Basically, all they know is roasting or boiling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that the crops here taste much better than any other place so they never complained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, they praise it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m happy but it is all because of the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I pray again at the shrine under the big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have no plan of forcing them to my belief but when Loo saw me, she also put her hands together and pray.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, what is the religion of this world?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier should be well informed with that, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s an angel after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’ll ask her in my spare time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I know steaming, deep frying, baking, and simmering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I can also stir-fry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also tried different methods of cooking I remember as an experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s only a few cooking utensils and seasoning, moreover, there are no milk or eggs so the thing I can do is limited…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, what I’m trying to say is….</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’m the one who’s frequently in cooking duty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t mind but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are a lot of women here, why aren’t they trying to learn from me?</p>


<p class="calibre2">That aside, I became aware of my own mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pepper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That plant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is possible to raise it using the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will not make it in time now but I have to get pepper next year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I also want, <em class="calibre5">lemon</em>, wasabi, sesame seeds, capsicum, olive, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, seasonings are crops too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shut myself in my house and carve woods and stones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Loo and Tier are living together with me, it feels crowded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made it thinking that I’m the only one who’ll live in it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s make a house that will become our new residence next spring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Tier are doing some sort of magical preparation that I don’t know of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, they’re doing something to the medicinal herbs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those herbs are gathered during summer and autumn. They seem to have preserved them in the basement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the two of them also feel crowded in our present situation. They asked me to prepare a laboratory in the new house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We are now discussing the layout.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Ria’s group also shut themselves in their new log house during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they already prepared food and firewoods before winter, there should be no problem. If there is any, they can report it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During winter, Ria’s group are making accessories made of grass and straw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They mass produce baskets and bags.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the trays and boxes I made are heavy, I’m thankful for what they did.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The kuros are relaxing on their sheds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t see Zabuton so she’s probably hibernating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, she made a lot of clothes and towels before hibernating so I’m saved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, is she encouraging us to be dirty?</p>


<p class="calibre2">Also, during winter…it’s boring doing only the side job.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Entertainment is also necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Tier are now here. Ria’s group also came so we can do a lot of things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A staple for an otherworlder like me, reversi. I felt good when I made one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria’s group took a liking to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also made chess and it was popular with Loo, Tier, and the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know how but the kuros understand the rules of chess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also seem to understand the rule of reversi but it is impossible for them to play it since they find it difficult to pick a piece with their mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, the chess becomes popular to them since they can move it with their mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, I made the kuros their own version of chess. One that they can easily bite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes, I found them surrounding it during a game. It seems that a moderate number of them are enjoying it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Watching the situation…..perhaps they are better than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe it’s better to not challenge them to maintain dignity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros are smart so they might beat me. If that happens, I think my mind will break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Loo and Tier are evenly match in chess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, hey, Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s probably not a good idea to challenge Kuro.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You will be beaten up mentally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was depressed for about three days.</p>


<p class="calibre2">During winter, when the weather is good, I go out for a change of pace to check the log fence and moat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Zabuton the lookout is not available in winter, it is better not to let my guard down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros themselves can jump over the log fence and moat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I make a higher wall surrounding the elves’ residence?</p>
<p class="calibre2">They can go to the forest to hunt in order to procure meat but they didn’t do so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Recreation activity really changes the pace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I collected the piled up snow and built a snowman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier looks at the snowman with shining eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, whenever there is a chance, Tier builds a snowman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I got worried that her hands will have frostbite so I made her gloves using the extra cloth.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-44"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 31 &ndash; The Spring When the Slime Came</h1><p class="calibre2">Spring.<span id="calibre_link-129"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Spring has come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This year’s goal is the completion of the waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">New house for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, cleaning the cesspool of the toilet. The place was the excretion is stored.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I know that if dust piles up, it will turn into a mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I consulted Loo and Tier if they could do anything about it using magic but it seems to be difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems to be possible to ferment it to decompose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, they casted magic to ferment it however, the smell became terrible that no one wants to go close to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The odor can already be smelled above so immediate measures are needed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the idea of slime was presented.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Since they can digest and absorb things like that, they are also used in urban areas. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So there’s such a living thing too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Slime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not uncommon in <em class="calibre5">fantasy</em> world but their ferocious characteristics depends on the title.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are those kind who are part of the initial training of the hero but slimes that pops up in dungeons should not be approached.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this world, it seems like slimes are convenient sewage cleaner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Where can we catch a slime? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I think there are some near a marsh or a pond… 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can you capture some? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please leave it to me. I’ll catch some in ten days. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to leave it to Tier because she seems to be confident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I ask of you. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, we abandoned the current <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I closed up the smelly hole and decided to build a<em class="calibre5"> toilet</em> in another place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is difficult to endure that smell for ten days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Building a <em class="calibre5">toilet </em>is just like drilling a hole, it’s easy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel relieved.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The slime that Tier brought back was small.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s about the size of a fist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is this the average size?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is the right size for those who are living in the wild.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to my <em class="calibre5">image</em>, it should be a bit bigger….</p>
<p class="calibre2">It feels like a soft baseball.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because they eat corpses and excrements, they are also called forest cleaner, plain cleaner, or <em class="calibre5">dungeon </em>cleaner.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">She brought back a dozen of slimes using a pot.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Is it okay to leave them be?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We, it’s basically okay…however」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier looks like she’s having a difficulty to say it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m afraid that the kuros or the spiders will eat them…I just thought of it when I was capturing them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she went out to capture some, the only thing on her mind is to reduce the smell of the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mou….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I call Kuro and Zabuton for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Will you eat this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro and Zabuton seem to say<em class="calibre5"> no </em>to my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the atmosphere and the food in this place is good, they seem to have no interest in eating slimes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do they think that the slimes are bad?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I mean, since the slimes are eating something they don’t want to eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Jaa, they are our new residents. I want you to get along with each other. Tell your children too.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro and Zabuton showed their acknowledgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unn, they’re smart.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Tier brought back a total of 17 slimes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Two in the new <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>, another two in the<em class="calibre5"> toilet</em> of the elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three were placed in the<em class="calibre5"> toilet</em> I made in the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ten remaining were thrown in the sealed old <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The smell was really strong when I opened the hole so I felt guilty….Especially because I think they’re cute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please take care of me from now on.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The bad effect of slimes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I needed to have courage using the <em class="calibre5">toilet </em>since I know they were down there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others seemed to be unaffected but for me, I’m having a bit of difficulty in getting used to it.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-65"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 32 &ndash; The Kuro’s Marriage Proposal and Mushrooms</h1><p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s spiderlings will again go on a journey this year.<span id="calibre_link-130"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there are also those who’ll stay and there are new hatchlings too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already prepared myself to some extent so I probably won’t cry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first batch of Zabuton’s spiderling who stayed has already reached the size of ¼ of Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s already a considerable size and I think it won’t be long before to catch up to Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, I thought that they would probably bear child of their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I consider expanding the north fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>?</p>


<p class="calibre2">The kuro’s horn has begun to molt. I had a hard time picking them up at every corner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want them as decorations but they are too space consuming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m reluctant, I stored them in the basement where I store food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When their horn grows, they’ll be leaving on a trip to find a partner so I’ll play with them a lot until that time comes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">flying disc</em>….as I throw it, it suddenly becomes a fierce battlefield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I prepared a wooden ball wrapped with beast’s skin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It became considerably popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I’m not there, they’re still playing with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll make about 30 pieces and pass it to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They leave the place in order to play but come back at night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They’re smart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, I also carved a big tree into a wild boar so that they can practice hunting. It didn’t even take a day before they tear it off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe I should have made it bigger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After making the boar, Kuro somewhat appeals in front of me. I’m thinking why then I finally found an answer to my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s telling me to carve him too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I carve him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I emphasized wildness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is possible for me to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro seems satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem is…where to place it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I placed it like a guardian dog of the shrine under the big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also tried to carve Yuki to make them a pair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I intended to carve her normally but it feels wilder than the Kuro’s sculpture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if my ability rose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the one who requested me for his sculpture is Kuro, I smiled a when I saw him being startled at Yuki’s sculpture.</p>



<p class="calibre2">While building the waterway, I’m thinking whether we can use fish for food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m still thinking of how to remove the smell of mud but it seems like Ria know of a solution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To remove the smell of mud, I need to put them on pure water for a few days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, they are similar to shellfish that were pulled out from the sand?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I tried it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I carved a big rock to make it a fish tank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And put river water there….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Won’t this method be useless unless since I’ll use the water from the river? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The water from the river is drinkable but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Using the water from the river is fine. The important thing is for them not to eat anything. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">White fish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has a delightful taste.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m glad that I obtained salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s catch fish regularly and throw them in the fish tank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a good thing to enrich the food we eat.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Kuro’s pups…Grandpups? Or great grandpups?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those who’ll search for their <em class="calibre5">partners </em>are going on a journey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A considerable number of them went on a journey but they are less than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About half of those who were born last year stayed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And before they left, I finally witness it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The method of females securing males.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First step is courtship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it didn’t work, they will fight each other and the defeated will follow the winner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When there are several females interested in one male, they’ll either discuss it between them or fight against each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the process of discussion or battle, the females are cooperating with each other in order for the male to not run away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, the female is dominant.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Males are basically the one waiting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But they also appeal to the females with either emphasizing their strength in bed or hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the male is courted by a female he likes, they’ll immediately be <em class="calibre5">partners</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they don’t like the other party, they’ll fight against each other and if the male wins, he’ll wait for someone else….however, the chances of males winning is relatively small.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are cases of males courting females. In that case, if the other party refused, it will not turn into a fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand now.</p>



<p class="calibre2">However, the way I see it….their fight will not reach to the level of inflicting injuries or death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their horns are just currently growing and don’t seem to be damaged either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then….where did Kuro and Yuki got their injuries when I first met them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuki is already pregnant that time so it’s not a battle of courtship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once they become <em class="calibre5">partners</em>, they will be working hard for each other….Are Kuro and Yuki attacked by something?</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what I have seen from Kuro and Yuki so far, they are considerably strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are probably strong lifeforms outside. To make this two retreat, what kind of living creature is it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m currently surrounded by Zabuton and Kuro’s descendant and is currently living a relaxing life, I have to be prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I better be careful.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Let’s talk about mushrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since I first stepped into this forest, I haven’t touched those.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those mushrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mushroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have two <em class="calibre5">images</em> of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Edible and poisonous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I found mushrooms I recognize, I have to be careful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have seen unknown mushrooms of different shapes and colors in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I usually plow them with the AFT since I can’t bring myself to eat them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, I have abandoned mushrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mushroom is something I can’t plant in fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, an idea flashed in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It came to me when I saw mushrooms from a lumber I cut down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using the hoe form of the AFT, I can plant any crops in fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, what will happen if I use the AFT on a fungal bed? Will I be able to plant mushrooms?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it be<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsutake" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> matsutake</a> mushroom?</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I want<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiitake" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> shiitake</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tested it with various lumbers while requesting shiitake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The result.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I wasted a lot of lumber, I succeeded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And tested it again for verification.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The most important thing for successfully utilizing the AFT is <em class="calibre5">image</em> and base.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have a very good and clear <em class="calibre5">image</em> and prepare a suitable base for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the base, they are fields and fungal bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I’m greedy, I tried planting<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimeji" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> shimeji</a> mushroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Success.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, I used the <em class="calibre5">image</em> of shimeji mushrooms I have seen in supermarkets in my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hon-shimeji seems to be a luxury good but I can’t imagine it since I’ve never seen one.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Next, I tried imagining delicious mushrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I planted buna-shimeji.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I failed at something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was when I tried planting matsutake mushroom…</p>
<p class="calibre2">With this, I noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Matsutake does not grow from woods but from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I imagine matsutake while plowing the ground but fail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess the condition has not met.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that matsutake should be planted near<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinus_densiflora" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> akamatsu</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the base for matsutake, I have to prepare akamatsu first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, although it will take a long time, I decided to plant several akamatsu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Matsutake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You’ll be mine later.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Too many kinds of mushroom here. Just click the hyperlink if you want to know more info or if you want to see what they look like. Those are Wikipedia links.</em></strong></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-84"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 33 &ndash; Completion of the Waterway and New Residents</h1><p class="calibre2">On a certain day, the number of residents increased.<span id="calibre_link-131"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because of the recommendation of Zabuton’s spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A big bee is being tied up with Zabuton’s spiderling’s web.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The big bee is about 30 cm in length.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps if I met it while it is not tied up, it might have escaped or attacked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing Zabuton’s spiderling’s gesture, it seems like it wants me to keep this bee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the tied up bee’s head, neck, and furry limbs, it has an air of majesty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bees might be helpful in raising crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「But, won’t it attack? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need to verify it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it causes trouble, it should be exterminated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the spiderling that catches the bee gestured that it’s going to be okay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it caught it, it probably really is safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….okay. Where should we keep it? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing the bee’s request, I made a shed at one corner of the north fruit<em class="calibre5"> area</em> where it can build its hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I called it a shed, it is similar to the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>. It is just something that prevents rain and wind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s spiderling brought strawberries for it to eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems to be breeding well….Wait, where did you get those strawberries?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’ll overlook it since it is sharing food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I saw some spiderlings taking care of it in turns.</p>


<p class="calibre2">10 days later, a big round hive was made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, I feel like it is an enlarge vespine hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is so big and since it is on the floor, it looks like an anthill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Worker bees keep coming out of that hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size of the worker bees is unexpectedly in the size of the bees that I know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After thinking that the queen bee is the only big one, I saw bees larger than worker bees, about 15 cm in length, protecting the hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are those soldier bees?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope they won’t fight against the spiderlings….</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I left the beehive to Zabuton’s spiderlings’ care.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If something happened, they’ll probably look for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Loo and Tier were pleased when the saw the beehive, they are now expecting honey. On the other hand, the elves cramped their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they bad with bees?</p>


<p class="calibre2">The waterway was completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At last.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it is made up of piled up hardened soil, the waterway is not too wide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it can still steadily pour water.</p>

<p class="calibre2">There is no water leaking all the way to the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing it that way, tears flow out my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">uu….great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is thanks to everyone’s cooperation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s have a feast today.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Now that the waterway was completed, there is a lot of things we can do with the water from the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first one is the bath that I’ve been hoping for all this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll have the elves cooperate with me in building a bathhouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s build a heating area, the place to wash, the bathtub, and the changing room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The heating area is the place for warming water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, I can’t build that place yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just make hot water somewhere and pour it into the bathtub.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, we made a special stone kiln outside the hut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hot water from the waterway is boiled in the stone kiln which is sent to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also made another waterway from the reservoir to the bath in order to draw water easier.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The bathtub was made in the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is 3 meters in length, width is 1.5 meters, and a height of 1 meter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is considerably big.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the bottom is a water stopper which is connected to a drain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The drained water does not cycle back to the reservoir. The drainage path is connected all the way to the spillway of the reservoir to the river, the one that I made several years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of Tia’s proposal, I put a slime to the drain. Its purpose is to clean the water before it makes it way to the river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taking care of the environment is important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having slimes is so convenient.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though I noticed that the bathtub is too large that it takes some effort to draw hot water for it, I kept it as it was because I like it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A suitable washing place and changing room are necessary for a big bathtub.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scenery is also important for a bath so I had large windows installed on the walls of the bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, this has become more luxurious than the house I’m living in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If that’s the case, I should build a new house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, let’s focus on the bath.</p>


<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000020.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Manga Chapter 15 page 4</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">When the bathhouse was completed, I made some rough preparations in order to teach the residents on how to use the bath.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Because none of them knew how to take a bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To clean their bodies, they only wipe themselves with damp cloth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, if you think about it, you need a large amount of wood and water for it so it might be too luxurious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I taught them how to use it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because they were not able to get it with words, I reluctantly show it to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s no point of being embarrassed in being naked in front of them now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Being gazed by women while washing my body is somewhat nerve wracking. After that, I soak in the bathtub.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….that hits the spot. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tears have fallen from my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Large bath, warm water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because after being admitted to the hospital in the previous world, taking a bath was marked as NG. I am now taking a bath after a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Aaahhhh 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I let out a moan unintentionally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The women around was no longer in my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently enjoying the bath.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Looking at me, it seems like the girls understood how good it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No one hesitates to undress before me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every one of them entered in a dash.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, ah, wait, this place is large, tha-that’s too much. There’s time for that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was only able to enjoy the bath for a short time.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-2"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 34 &ndash; Bath</h1><p class="calibre2">With the completion of the bathhouse and everyone’s understanding, the equipments were arranged quickly.<span id="calibre_link-132"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The location of the bathhouse is on the southwest side of the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to build it on the east side of the reservoir but considering the drainage, building it on the west side can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, considering the future(expansion) of the reservoir, it gave me no choice but to build it in the western part of the southwest <em class="calibre5">area </em>where the log house of the elves are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I expanded the southwest <em class="calibre5">area</em> to include the bathhouse in it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I somehow expanded it to a size of a four by four fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I say that, I will just dig a moat and add log fence so it will be complete in a few days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made sure that the log fence and the moat will not affect the drainage and waterway of the bathhouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bath is also totally exposed/unprotected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If something were to happen, I want it to at least buy time as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I like open-air baths, being too open is embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though we already have intimate relationships, I want to build fences as courtesy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it might be okay for now, seeing women bathing defenselessly in the open might cause some sense of immorality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I decided to fence it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried not to block the view from the bathtub as much as possible. My aim is to only prevent someone’s intrusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next thing I thought is about water drawing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I made a waterway to be able to draw water nearby, it still has to be poured on the kiln to make it hot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is quite laborious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I decided to make a device to drew water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a watermill equipped with a lot of wooden buckets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It may be easier to understand if you imagine a Ferris wheel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The buckets are the gondola of the Ferris wheel that draws water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Drawing water below and pouring them when it reached the top.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It should have been fully automatic but I’m only an amateur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Certain skills are needed to make it properly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, at least it’s an improvement compared to drawing water manually.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that is making bath equipments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bath chairs, pails, etc…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, and the elves are pleased with the bath and are using it non stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How can I use it if you’re there…? Thinking about it, it seems like I have to make the opportunity myself.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Kuro’s pups returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As they came back with partners, their number increase again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to make houses in the dog <em class="calibre5">area </em>again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They came back smoothly this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there is no eye-catching dog like Fubuki and Masayuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Masayuki did no leave. I don’t know who it is but his<em class="calibre5"> partner</em> is someone’s female pup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I noticed someone standing out.</p>

<p class="calibre2">They are completely…. different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros who just came back brought five female high elves with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the pups have driven them here for some reason. They were not allowed to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were protected by Ria’s group and explained everything while crying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, it was decided to have them live here with Ria’s group’s recommendation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I am Rafa. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rafa, Raasa, Raraasha, Raru, and Rami.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It felt like the time with Ria. Their names were similar and they also ran away from their village 200 years ago because they are family.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though this is the first time I heard it, it seems like Ria’s group of seven are also sisters and cousins.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: That moment he realized that he had an orgy with sisters and cousins.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Likewise, Rafa’s group are also sisters and cousins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I had the five of them live in Ria’s group’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We have to build a house for Rafa’s group as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We suddenly became busy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like I have to make my house next year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or so I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the increase in work speed due to the addition of five high elves that survived in the forest was more than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A log house similar to Ria’s has been completed in five days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given the momentum, we next build my new house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The location was the place where I made my first field.</p>
<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000024.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">There were suggestions to make it in the southwest <em class="calibre5">area </em>but I find it difficult to leave that tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton, Kuro, and Yuki are also living there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the new house, I’m mainly the one taking lumbers and processing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was not requested during the assembly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They used rope made by Zabuton to dexterously assemble it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This one also looks similar to Ria’s log house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the saying goes, “Leave mochi to mochi makers” so I leave the assembly to Ria’s group. I gather lumber and process them as requested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps it might not have been completely good to entrust everything to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of that when I realized how the house is.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-19"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 35 &ndash; My Home</h1><p class="calibre2">It was a big solid house.<span id="calibre_link-133"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems to be my new house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why this big?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because I want a room of my own. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I have thought that our previous house is small for a long time. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s the village chief house so it’s supposed to be like this.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has already been completed so I guess it can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it is big, it is similar to a log cabin since it was built without using nails.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess this is the size limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It also has the basic rectangular shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is a big house, it is light and the center square is empty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Houses during the middle ages are usually u-shaped or r-shaped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, my house is a long house where the long side extends to the east and west.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only the door part bulges a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bulging part is the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately after entering is a big hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The width is roughly 10 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The length of the room…. is about three times of that, about 30 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The height is about seven to eight meters since it goes all the way to the second floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are several pillars that are necessary as roof support but those also give a luxurious atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We could use this as a meeting place. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rafa sticks out her chest and says that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a big door in the depths of the hall and it is not a bedroom door but something like a courtyard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, it is the big tree where Zabuton lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you think about it, it feels like my new house is something like a gate protecting the tree.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Just like Ria’s log house, there are doors and stairs that go up to the second floor to the left and right of the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The end door on the left side of the first floor seems to be my private room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that I would like it on the right side to be closer to the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em> outside but it has its own private restroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There’s a slime below it so use it well. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are three <em class="calibre5">toilets</em> on the first floor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Two are placed beside the stairs and one is in my private room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My private room consists of a toilet, a bedroom, and a warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each of the rooms, except for the toilet, in my private room is much bigger than the shed we have been living before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The curtains and sheets are prepared by Zabuton.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">Looking out of the window of my bedroom, I saw Zabuton waving its leg so I waved back.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">kitchen</em> and the dining room is on the right side of the hall. Now we can easily cook indoor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is an exit door in the <em class="calibre5">kitchen</em> where the outdoor kitchen is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The outdoor <em class="calibre5">kitchen</em> has roof so we can still use it even if it’s raining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, there is a stair built in the <em class="calibre5">kitchen</em> for the underground food warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I get up using the stairs on the left side of the hall. Private rooms are lined up there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Tier and Loo have one each.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But why are they still empty?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other side of their rooms are room slightly larger than their own rooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they are going to use it either as workshop or warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All the rooms have the same size of window that gives sufficient light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a very good house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Spend this winter here and say anything you are discontent with that we can improve it later.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I was surprised with how big the house is and thinking that I requested something like a basement and big pillars made me feel guilty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not think about it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, the log fence between this new house and the previous one was removed and the moat was also filled up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros can jump over them effortlessly so I understand that they are not very useful but still, having them disappear makes me a lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Those have sentimental value. They are part of the first log fence and first moat he built.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, made the previous moat a flower bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides things to eat, this is like an experiment of what more can I raise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not sure what to raise so I planted garden rose for the time being.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The big house was completed but the elves were not the ones who actively worked on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one with the most contribution is probably Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier created a golem with magic that greatly contributed to the construction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That earth golem she created can divide itself into 30.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If strength is needed, she turns it into a fewer number. The fewer they are, the stronger and powerful they are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the work is simple, she divides them into a larger number.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, it seems like when she first come here, she used it against the kuros but it was destroyed before I came.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I discovered or you can say that I was not aware of one thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the strength of the trees around this forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are considerably hard.</p>

<p class="calibre2">They are very excellent building material but the disadvantage is the logging and processing is very difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, with the use of my AFT, I can cut and process them with ease.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that Ria had me do it for contribution purposes but I didn’t know that my existence is the reason why the house was completed early.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s good that I was useful.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The comfort of living in that house was not bad, so I moved at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My previous house was not dismantled. It will be used as a warehouse in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%B3%B4%E5%AD%90_(%E9%9F%B3%E5%85%B7)" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2">Naruko</a> was installed on the ceiling of the hall of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A thread was attached on the naruko extending to the top of the big tree where Zabuton lives in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This will be Zabuton’s signaling device.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From now on, instead of beating the tree, the signal will be the naruko.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m grateful for it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The puppies have increased a lot this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the point that it’s impossible to count them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Two of them are pure white puppies like Fubuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there a certain probability for a genetic divergence to be born?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since those two can be easily distinguished, I’ll give them a name.</p>


<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000008.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Difference of the illustration above from the description in this web novel; no door for MC’s bedroom, no door at the back of the hall for the courtyard, nothing is written here about the rooms above the kitchen.</em></strong></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-38"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 36 &ndash; Construction Rush and the Surrounding Circumstances?</h1><p class="calibre2">Construction continued even after my house’s completion.<span id="calibre_link-134"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Workshop, drying cabin, and food smoking cabin were made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the elves, those food processing places are necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially the food smoking cabin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By smoking meat, we will be able to preserve them for a long time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Regarding the crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition to the regular crops such as tomatoes and potatoes, I planted a lot of seasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was able to harvest pepper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m presently drying them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lemon tree has not bear fruit yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wasabi needs a paddy field so it is not possible to plant them yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sesames were harvested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Red peppers were harvested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gingers were harvested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The olive tree has not bear fruit yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next year, I will plant <em class="calibre5">cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, cumin, laurel</em>, etc. I want to cook curry in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I’m still in the testing phase of the seasoning so the production volume is still small. I’m still trying to plant different types of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All for delicious foods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the regular crops, the harvest was good as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The drying and processing of crops that require them such as wheat and rice are being developed by the elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m saved.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After the completion of the waterway and the bath, I’m thinking that I want bamboo as a material for fences but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since bamboo increased their numbers with the influence of the field, it will surely be affected if I raised them in a poor place so I raised them in a distant corner of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The place is about 10 by 10 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently experimenting on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I started a while ago just before Rafa’s group appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tried to look at it before the winter, the bamboo’s are already growing up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But only on the 10 by 10 meters of land that I plowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have not grown outside of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, why only at the place where I plowed?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, the growth rate in the places I plowed is amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that’s good enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I decided to take some bamboo home to make things that use bamboo material.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bamboo cup I just made by only cutting was light so it became popular.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The winter has come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The comfort of living in the new house was not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes, the kuros come to play because the place is huge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are enjoying playing chess around the brazier that was installed in the middle of the <em class="calibre5">hall</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are more elegant than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elves are making iron products during this winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not participate in any way in the making and processing of iron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I watched them and noticed that I, although painful, can’t help them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I tried hard on cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The power of seasoning is great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how busy they are, except to those elves who’s turn to use the furnace, we all got together during mealtime at the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also want dairy products and eggs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to think about a method to obtain them…..but there is only one way to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must buy it in some other place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, I have never been interested in the place outside but now that I thought of it, Loo, Tier, and the elves came from the outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Other people exist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There might even be towns and villages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a high possibility that there are cows and chickens there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be a good idea to buy cows and chickens from them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it some more……</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a farm here without permission…..Is this someone’s territory?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will they get angry at me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Loo 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Nani?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This place…Is this someone’s territory?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This place…you mean this land?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t think this is someone’s territory…but if we’re talking about the surrounding’s sphere of power, we are in the demon king’s sphere of influence.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yup」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「……………….demon king, as in the demon king?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s right….is there something wrong?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Etto…won’t the demon king complain that I selfishly created a farm here without permission?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re worrying about that? It is fine. This place is under his sphere of influence but he doesn’t own this land so he can’t collect tax. Also, they did not lend you a hand when husband is making this place, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, not at all.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, it’s definitely all right. Husband made this place alone so this is husband’s territory.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….Is that how it works?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「That’s how it works.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But still, the demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……he must be a frightening existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thought it makes me feel uneasy…I totally forgot about it when I was cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no point of fearing the demon king I never met.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’ll just deal with the problem in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The population increased with the addition of five elf females.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rafa’s group is similar to Ria’s group, they look like university students, or maybe high school students?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every one of them is beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it might be wrong to complain but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must protect my “chastity”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The things that are important….I placed them in my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have prepared my heart several steps ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do your best, me.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-59"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 37 &ndash; Spring When the Wyvern Attacked</h1><p class="calibre2">Spring has come.<span id="calibre_link-135"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">During the winter, the only thing I can remember is me cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a matter of fact, I think that my cooking skill has improved a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now I’m thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter what dish I cook, Loo’s reaction is the same. She’s saying it’s delicious….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want her to tell me if it tastes bad if it’s not delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I said it was delicious because it was really delicious.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please have confidence. They are really tasty.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, there’s an emergency.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never heard Zabuton’s alarm this loud. Something serious might have occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tried to run toward Zabuton ‘s direction, Loo stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Above」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo pointed out a large flying creature in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There, is a creature that looks like a fat lizard with bat wings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is hard to estimate the size since its too far but I think it’s about 20 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dragon?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, it’s a wyvern! Loo-san, barrier!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier corrected me then used magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo did the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next moment, the wyvern suddenly stop approaching and spewed a big fireball toward here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The big fireball was really big.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is probably about 10 meters in diameter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately after it spat, the surrounding temperature increases significantly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The target is the big tree where Zabuton lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I saw that, I shouted for Zabuton. The big fireball crashed into something then scattered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scattered fireball fell into the houses and fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Extinguish the fire!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elves rushed and ran around carrying water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">While Tier and Loo look impatient, I stare at the wyvern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems to be difficult to finish it off without taking damage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They had such expressions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m glad that they thought of this place as something important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, rage was born inside of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why did it attack this place?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it a whim?</p>

<p class="calibre2">Or is it an order from someone?</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my hand, the AFT transformed into a spear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw it at the wyvern with all my might.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it’s just my usual strength, it won’t reach such a distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the spear form of AFT that I threw off flew away in a straight line and torn one of the wyvern’s wings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The wyvern falls down while being puzzled on my attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I failed to kill it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spear form AFT that I threw earlier appeared on my hand again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw the spear form AFT once again to the falling wyvern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It pierced straight to its body this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A loud scream resounded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tenacious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it is already over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I notice it, I already instructed the kuros who are waiting behind me.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/gW1m7m1/u39-24f288ca-2d33-4eee-9786-befef108ade5.jpg">

<p class="calibre2">「Exterminate it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing my order, all the kuros ran at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Running to the place where the wyvern fell.</p>


<p class="calibre2">While watching the kuros runoff, I tried to cool down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Present condition assessment….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How is the fire?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s all right now. It has been extinguished.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The damage?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The houses are all right. Part of the tomato field is now useless. Also, Zabuton-san’s threads…..」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thread that Zabuton and her spiderlings built over the field was burnt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? ….Loo, Tier. We’re safe because you protected us from the first strike.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「U-un.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I did my best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">….They strangely look stiff. I’m probably making a scary face right now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This won’t do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Remembering the irrational attack, my anger swells up again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That…is it the work of the demon king?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Demon king? I don’t think he’s involved.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I think that it is a wild wyvern. If it is under someone’s control, I don’t think that it will attack alone.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. A wild one….is wyvern common?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In some areas, yes but in my opinion they are rare.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree. In addition, you can encounter a fire-spewing wyvern as much as you can encounter <em class="calibre5">dragons</em>.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「I see. Then, can we consider this encounter as a rare event?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I think so.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">So it’s just a mere misfortune.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Calm down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll just think that it’s a natural disaster.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, the kuros are back. They are calling for you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we went to the place where the wyvern fell, I was surprised again seeing its gigantic figure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it bigger than the sperm whale I saw on TV?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it was already dead when it fell so there is no need for the kuros to finish it off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, what are you doing sitting proudly on the wyvern’s body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, you’re guarding it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You prevented other monsters from approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this is really big.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if we can eat this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I heard that wyvern’s meat is delicious.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">So we decided to eat it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We had a hard time dismantling it but the tasting how delicious it is makes it worth it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It tasted better with the help of the seasoning I experimented with during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We ended up having a banquet.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I didn’t know about it but shooting down the wyvern seems to have had various aftereffect on various places.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In a familiar place: Loo and Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Tier, husband’s attack on the wyvern…can you defend against it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Impossible. How about Loo-san?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Of course I can’t.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I thought so too. It pierced through the triple barrier of the wyvern and instead of just stabbing, it cleanly pierced through it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…..Maybe we are lucky that we were attacked by the kuros when we first got here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Probably. If it was husband who attacks….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Just thinking about it frightens me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We must be thankful for that good luck.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「and for the kuros too.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Though it is frustrating.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Demon king’s castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The wyvern of the iron forest fell? Don’t joke around.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「It is true. A scout saw it. After the wyvern of iron forest spat a fire ball, it was hit by some sort of attack and fell.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「… Are you serious?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, I already reported it on the upper echelon and it became a big fuss.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Of course it will. If it comes near this place, we need to mobilize forces comparable to waging war. And a guy that shot it down is somewhere there….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Crap…If I’m going to resign, this is the right time.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t panic. We still have yet to determine if that person is an enemy or not.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-indeed.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There is a possibility that it was someone from the four heavenly kings. Let’s wait and see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「R-right.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">The dragon living on the mountain in the south.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….perhaps my eyes are deceiving me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t worry. They are still working normally.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Trully?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I saw it too.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What do you think will happen if that attack was pointed to me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It will probably penetrate you cleanly.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really?….Then, what should I do?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That should be decided by you, master.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t say that. Propose something. I ask of you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If I may….Before that attack is turned unto us, isn’t it best to tie that person with friendship? I think being hostile against him is a foolish idea.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mo…..mou」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though there was variously aftereffect, meeting those influences is still in the future.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-78"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 38 &ndash; I Want Sake</h1><p class="calibre2">I thought about the wyvern’s meat at the banquet.<span id="calibre_link-136"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I want sake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is the raw material for sake?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sake came from rice.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Wine</em> from grapes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But how do you make sake…? I read about it in a manga and watch something related to it on TV.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the problem is, I don’t have<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspergillus" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> aspergillus</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can I plant that using the AFT?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need to research about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe making<em class="calibre5"> wine</em> would be easier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Making<em class="calibre5"> wine</em> is simple.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You just have to mash grapes then ferment it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if the grapes are not suited for <em class="calibre5">wine</em> making, it will be useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently, the grapes we harvest are sweet and tasty like the one sold in supermarkets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But can I use it for wine making…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">There should be a variety of grape that is used for <em class="calibre5">wine </em>making.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I prayed to god that the grapes on the farm can be used for making <em class="calibre5">wine</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">That moment, I realized that I would not be able to get wine immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just give up on that.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: He’s giving up on drinking wine immediately not in making wine.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I made a vineyard for wine.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Hahaha.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is important to put my spirit to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I expanded the new field <em class="calibre5">area </em>to the east doubling its size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It became an eight by eight fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is a 32 field vineyard dedicated for wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m supposed to have been calmed down but I got irritated again remembering the wyvern’s attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Reflection.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I should have planted the grapes in the fruit area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why I planted them in the new farm area.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I return to my usual work.</p>

<p class="calibre2">First of all, I tried planting additional type of seasonings that I thought of in one of the first fields I made near my house since it is empty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I don’t think I need much of them, I only planted several pieces each.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I want a lot of <em class="calibre5">olives</em> so I’ll plant them in the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the fruit area has become crowded, I expanded it to the north side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruit area’s size is now four by eight fields.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Speaking of the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>, the bees that the spiderlings looking after…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are growing up well. Moreover, there have been several hives already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">New hives were built in four places. With the request of Zabuton’s spiderlings, I made them to be wind and rain proof.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I waw be able to secure some honey from the first hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The amount is about a can of <em class="calibre5">juice</em>, 350ml.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have put it in a stone jar that I carved but looking at it, I thought that I want a glass bottle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if I can make one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……it’s not good to be greedy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just do things we can do steadily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The honey was well received by everyone and it is now less than half in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is pretty popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s use what is left for cooking next time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The high elf Rarasha had excellent skill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She seems to be able to make a barrel for water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I follow her instructions in making the barrel parts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I mainly cut down and process woods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rarasha is the one who assembled and adjusted the parts I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She seems to have been making barrels for the last 200 years and the first barrel she made here doesn’t leak anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Water barrels are expected to be useful in many ways, so we made it in large quantities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The top priority is for making wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To ferment grapes, barrel is necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’ve done our best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, when I was cooking the dish she <em class="calibre5">requested</em>, the others started participating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not succeed in making one in their first try but after several failures, they became skillful in it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are more dexterous than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though none of them can compete against Rarasha, their barrel making skill progressed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll make one once I can make one.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, the dish she <em class="calibre5">requested</em> of me is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nabemono" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> nabe</a>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Because we don’t have<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katsuobushi" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> katsuboshi</a>, it is impossible to make<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashi" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> dashi</a>. I just boiled a small quantity of meat and throw a large quantity of vegetables as nabe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For me, this nabe is so disappointing but it was well-received by everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because we don’t have katsuboshi, I increased the amount of seasoning to make it tasty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I also haven’t raised a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrus_junos" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> yuzu</a> yet….</p>
<p class="calibre2">The previous world was blessed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m still on the research phase with regards to mushrooms so I was not able to put a shiitake on the dashi.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-95"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 39 &ndash; Expressing Gratitude to God and Reservoir Improvement</h1><p class="calibre2">As usual, when the spring came, Zabuton’s spiderlings will depart so I see them off. The kuros horn shedding also started.<span id="calibre_link-137"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, they will look for <em class="calibre5">partner</em>s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I finally got used to it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’ll try improving the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The water from the waterfall presently goes straight to the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, when garbage enters the waterway, it will go straight to the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I can simply pick up garbage, it will be troublesome if a living creature enters it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In order to prevent that from happening, I made another reservoir before the main reservoir as a cushion against infiltration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The main reservoir is an inverted pyramid with a depth of 5 meters in the center while the cushioning reservoir is only 50cm deep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With this, even if garbage or living things comes in, the possibility of them being blocked before the main reservoir increases.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, there should be a divider between the cushioning reservoir and the main reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A wire net would be perfect but I don’t have that kind of things so I made a filter made of bamboo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Garbage will surely be filtered by it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I should also similarly improve the waterway for drainage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a drainage<em class="calibre5"> pool</em> at the drainage of the bath and put slimes there to purify water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also connected it to the drainage from the main reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a measure to make sure that only clean water will fall into the river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also installed bamboo filters into the newly built drainage<em class="calibre5"> pool</em> similar to the cushioning reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not to prevent the reverse entry of garbage but to keep the slimes in the drainage <em class="calibre5">pool</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, the slimes had increased their numbers before I noticed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now I often see slimes moving freely around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I panicked the first time I saw them moving freely around, I let them be because they are harmless and are only moving towards places necessary for them to live in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I occasionally see a slime of different color but I don’t think there’s a problem with that.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When I was doing all of those things, the kuros’ <em class="calibre5">partner</em> searching time has come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But most of them did not go on a journey this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that couples have formed to those who are presently here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s probably a good thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, let’s assume it’s good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a substitute for that event, I dispatched to invite the wandering high elves in the forest, like Ria and the others, to migrate here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Along with 10 kuros, I had Rif and Raasa go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter what happens, they must return by winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, we’ll make new log houses for new residents in advance.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Things will gonna get busy.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The harvest time of the grapes for wine came in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that we harvested them, it’s time to challenge wine making.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember that the people from the past use to step on them to mash them but I am personally against stepping on food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I mashed them by using a mortar and pestle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After mashing, I kept them in a barrel and stored them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was easy but since it’s too easy, I’m somewhat uneasy if I would be able to make wine with that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is easy, because of the amount, it can be called a difficult job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was able to make 16 large barrels. Those barrels are large enough to store a person in it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I make them in the same method, I’ll be frustrated if I fail. Because of that, I tried changing the mashing method for each barrel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That way, at least one will probably be okay.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What will I do now to the vineyard?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it’s the usual, I’ll plow it again and plant the same thing….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I continue planting grapes even though I am uncertain if I’ll be able to make wine?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you think about the preservation time, wheat, soybean, rice, or corn might be better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I was troubled, I decided to consult everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are unified to let it stay as vineyard for wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ehto…</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m looking forward to the wine.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I want to drink it quickly.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please call me for wine tasting.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Wine</em>, that’s very nice.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufufu」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can drink a considerable amount of wine.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please leave the barrel making to me. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone seems to really want wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I don’t know what will become of it, I decided to keep it being a vineyard.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The vineyard is not the only field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We still need to harvest wheat, soybean, rice, corn, and other grains. We also have to harvest root crops like carrots, potatoes, radish, garlic, and onions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The distribution of harvesting work is based on whether the spiderlings can harvest them or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiderlings can harvest crops that need to be picked or cut but it is impossible for them to harvest things that need force.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I had the spiderlings harvest tomato, cabbage, pumpkin, cucumber, eggplants, and fruits.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Those that need to be picked by human hands like spinach, sugarcane, and tea were harvested by us. We also harvested rapeseed and process them secure oil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am truly grateful for the increase of helping hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the food consumption increased, with the AFT, crops grow faster and we don’t have to worry about starvation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My gratitude.</p>


<p class="calibre2">That said, I experimented with crops in a variety of ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if the crops I planted will grow elsewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tested it with onion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The result: they grow in the place I plowed but rotted in other places.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried cultivating the onion in water but it also did not go well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It rotted as soon as the bud comes out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that method bad or is the water bad…? Anyway, it is great to know that even without the AFT, crops can grow in the places I plowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the growth rate is slow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I say slow, its growth rate is the normal growth rate of that crop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words ……</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s all thanks to the AFT that crops growth rate is fast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I express my gratitude to god again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the fruit trees I planted with the AFT grows fast but after producing their first fruit, their growth rate slows down to normal.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-12"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 40 &ndash; Additional Elves</h1><p class="calibre2">This year’s number of kuros’ birth halves.<span id="calibre_link-138"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">There were some of them who did not get pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised because I was sure that everything will be like the previous years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can they control their pregnancy?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuki did not bear this year too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even then, I still need to increase their tenement type sheds along with the expansion of the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dog area is on the east of my residence and is currently at the size of four by four fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the kuros population is now quite big, it feels crowded since a while ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they don’t really mind because the dog <em class="calibre5">area </em>is just a place to sleep for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I expanded the dog <em class="calibre5">area </em>on the east side. The expanded area is the same size as the original area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With this, the dog area is now four by eight fields in size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be okay for a while.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When the kuros’ birthing period was over, at the time when the new pups began to grow horns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rif and Raasa, who went out together with some of the kuros to invite other high elves who are wandering in the forest, came back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The number they brought back were more than what I expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eight <em class="calibre5">groups</em>, a total of 42 high elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone of them seems to be of the same age as Ria’s group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is high elf a female only race?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「When the village was attacked, the males fought while the females evacuated.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, there should be boys at least….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Among those who evacuated, the elderly and children migrated to other tribes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hnn? If you have some place to go, why didn’t you go there?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Going to other tribes other than the tribe of your origin means you’ll be a servant. When that happens….there is no guarantee that females of our age will be treated nicely.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah….so that’s the reason why the wandering high elves are only young she-elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: I’m already having trouble translating male and female elves. I can’t call them man and woman because they are not human. She-elves are female elves but what do you call male elves? He-elf?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather than being servant to other tribes, they chose the vagrant life in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you for permitting us to settle here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No no, I just did what I had to do. Don’t be so modest. Also, although we already prepared additional houses….they are still insufficient. Help me build them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only expected about 10, 15 at most. Now the number of house is completely not enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We constructed houses in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if those 42 will visit my bedroom after settling down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ria, if you know any high elf male, please bring them here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah….village chief. If you’re talking about those high elf boys who emigrated to other tribes, it will be difficult…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hnn? What do you mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The villages they emigrated to were also destroyed by humans.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? ….I apologize for inquiring such a thing.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No. We met some members of those tribes and we heard that they also protected our tribe’s males. Males are valuable for them too. If we ask them to return them to us, there will be a dispute and a fight will break.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「……」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the atmosphere became heavy, I changed the topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Since your number has increased, please choose a representative for high elves.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That will be my job.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If it is Ria then I am relieved….by the way, did the newcomers consented?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t worry. The ranking has already ended.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ranking……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not ask in detail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-is that so? Anyway, please teach the newcomer to make them familiar to this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Affirmative.」</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-33"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 41 &ndash; Third Bowl of Tendon, Flora, Oni Maids, and Cow</h1><p class="calibre2">With the newly arrived residents, I thought that we’re already lively but the liveliness increases more.<span id="calibre_link-139"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason? By the end of the spring, just when the stomach of the kuros who got pregnant started to noticeably swell, one woman came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufufu. What an interesting place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, we noticed a woman who’s floating about 1 meter in the air and is being followed by bats.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks like she’s in her late twenties.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She is quite beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s wearing a kind of dress that perfectly fits her body. You’ll know her figure with one look.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her chest and butt seem to be small.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She has a neck long silver hair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how you look at her, she’s related to Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo’s oneesan?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or her okaasan?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, let’s call Loo to meet her….however, the kuros began beating her up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recall the first time I met Loo.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I wonder if they were aggressive because they are pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman became an elementary schooler from her late twenties in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s naked now. It became difficult for her to maintain the clothes she wore with magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, she’s also weeping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recall the first time I met Tier.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I got in between her and the kuros for the time being and maintain the status quo until Loo arrives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although she’s crying, I did not avert my gaze from her because I’m scared that she’ll bite my neck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I also want her to recover…but I did not give her blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will be in trouble if she’s Loo’s enemy.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When Loo arrived, diplomacy was finally established.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Flora?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Onee-sama!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">So she’s Loo’s imouto.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing the details, she seems to be her cousin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her name is Flora Sakutou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like she came here to search for Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because you never came back, I thought that you were done in by that evil angel. I went out to search for you to see what truly happened…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see」</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, when Loo introduced me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My husband」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「This human is onee-sama’s husband? He doesn’t look convincing.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「He’s the master of the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em> and the boss of this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I said a very impolite thing. Please forgive me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was stunned by her sudden change of attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there is something I’m more concerned about….I would never miss that line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Inferno wolf</em>…? Is it the kuros?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s right」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Inferno wolf.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s a stern name…they are <em class="calibre5">wolf</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Wolf.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Wolf?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Just a reminder, italicized words are written on engrish.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not dogs?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, they have horns….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umm….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it doesn’t matter whether they are wolves or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the pure white Fubuki seems to be a mutated species called <em class="calibre5">cocytus wolf</em>.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Since she’s Loo’s cousin, I gave her blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how many times I see something like this, seeing a girl grow older is a mysterious scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she saw me, Loo blocked my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She doesn’t mind Tier or the elves but she minds it when it comes to her younger cousin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When we took Flora to our house we met Tier and caused some commotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like everyone, she fainted upon seeing Zabuton and her spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was perplexed when she saw Loo harvesting in the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But she’s extremely happy when she ate the crops and the dishes using them as ingredients.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s very lively.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After that, Flora stayed in a vacant room of my house for about ten days before going back home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She did not get tired of this place and seemed to earnestly want to live here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there are various things she left in the place she was living in so she left to arrange them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks like she terribly doesn’t want to leave. I thought that she would come back as soon as possible but she unexpectedly returned before winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She also brought not just one but a number of people.</p>



<p class="calibre2">The vampire, Flora Sakutou came back along with 20 <em class="calibre5">maids</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they are those who were working for her in her previous residence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are all from the oni race. If you look at them closely, you’ll notice small horns on their head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are on their forehead….some have one, the others have two but they are all located before their hairlines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size is about as big as a thumb.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The head <em class="calibre5">maid</em>’s name is Ann.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My lord, I will now be in your care.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">She recognized me as the head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did Flora ask them so?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Flora and the <em class="calibre5">maids</em> will be staying at my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So that’s why I’m the head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The chain of command is somewhat confusing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like Loo, Flora, and Ann arrange it in that order.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although there are only two vampires, Loo and Flora, Loo will be their representative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the onis is Ann.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the <em class="calibre5">maids</em> will prioritize my needs first then Loo and Flora after me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked them why should I be the priority but they told me that ranking is important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, okay…</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em>, that is a serious matter and they will postpone whatever they are doing to do something for the one with higher rank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann’s group brought four cows with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Flora stayed here, I remember telling her things that this place lacks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them are female and three of them are pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She thought about milk too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oohhh.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I made a large cow <em class="calibre5">area</em>, about eight by eight fields, on the north side of the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em> and east of the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I plowed it in a dash.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried planting grass.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be winter soon so I asked Ria’s group to make a barn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em> also have a problem with their sleeping space, we prioritized building the barn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because I thought that the cow will be more vulnerable to winter than the onis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regarding the cow care, I’m relieved that Ann’s group knows about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Flora’s late return was due to the cows. She only came back when they properly learned the method of taking care of the cows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I appreciate it.</p>

<p class="calibre2">And, the most important thing was to tell the kuros and the spiders to absolutely not lay their hands on the cow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cows were frightened with the kuros and the spiders but they got used to them after a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With this, milk is secured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that you should not milk a cow for a certain period of time after giving birth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cows also need to breastfeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is for the sake of the calf.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s decide the distribution later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not be greedy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the number of residents increased a lot.</p>


<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000013.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Manga chapter 20 page 6.</em></strong></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-51"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 42 &ndash; Tier Goes Out and Winter Arrives</h1><p class="calibre2">The number of high elves increased by 42 so they are now 54.<span id="calibre_link-140"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Two vampires.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Twenty onis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuros….a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton….a lot</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bees…four hives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Slimes….increasing, unable to count.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cows, four.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And don’t forget the angel, one.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Tier was thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the vampire Flora and the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em>, her influence weakened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m alone here, should I also invite someone?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I was overjoyed with the cows the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em> presented me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now I’ve done it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will bring my subordinates too. Furthermore, I’ll bring chickens that husband wanted so please expect it by all means.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier said that and left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is almost winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s scheduled to come back around spring.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Winter arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We emphasized interaction with the newly arrived residents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had Ria’s group take care of the newly arrived high elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem is the onis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wouldn’t mind it that much if they are living in a separate house in the southwest <em class="calibre5">area</em> but their house hasn’t been built yet. All of them are living in my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I intended to improve considerably in this world, but I am not really that sociable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m thinking of working hard on that part but not too hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The onis are also very good at keeping distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our work related conversations compose of bare minimum words and there is only a little idle chat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, they don’t forget their standing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every one of them is like an excellent receptionist of a big company.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I learned from our conversations that they have been hired as maids by Loo and Flora’s family and has several hundreds of years of experience already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps them keeping distance from me is not really a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are perfectly good at cleaning and washing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only housework they are not good at is cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lack of knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the only cooking method they know of is throwing all the ingredients on the pot and boil them.</p>

<p class="calibre2">So I taught them all the cooking method I know during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps they’ll be better than me in spring.</p>


<p class="calibre2">With the onis around, the liveliness of my house increased a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, the lights at night were lit and extinguished by either Loo or Tier to the point that it became a matter of concern. However, now that the onis are here, they are now taking care of that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Them cleaning and washing every day became the norm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the bed sheet is clean every day.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: I guess you probably already know why the bed sheet needs to be clean every day.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah right, the grass I insert in bed was all thrown away after they no longer felt good but Ria’s group taught me about the most suitable grass for bed so we changed all of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to that, we will only need to change the grass inside every six months. We also add an additional sheet in order to prevent dirt on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cultured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In regards to the fire, we’re greatly managing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We spent time considerably warm this winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I’ve been irresponsible and negligent until now….let’s not think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, even with Loo and I, Tier had been the one doing most house related things but now we let the onis do all of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I concentrate on making small things while Loo and Flora are getting absorbed with their medicine research.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a little bit lonely without Tier.</p>


<p class="calibre2">That reminds me, the onis were surprised with the spiders and the kuros but they did not faint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Have they heard of them before?</p>
<p class="calibre2">But they panicked when they saw the bees in the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>, did they not hear about them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, all the newly arrived high elves fainted on the spot when they saw Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s not that much scary though.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-70"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 43 &ndash; Additional Three Angels with Chickens and Lizardmen</h1><p class="calibre2">Tier arrived the same time as spring.<span id="calibre_link-141"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">She came back with three angels and 15 lizard face humanoid beings whose bodies are covered with hard scales.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their upper bodies are naked and they cover their lower bodies with n apron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of them have big physique and are carrying big backpacks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Tier, they are called <em class="calibre5">lizardman race</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The angels that she brought seems to be her subordinates.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Gran Maria.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Kuudel.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Corone. Please take care of us from now on.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three angels are wearing armor and are equipped with <em class="calibre5">lance</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That moment, the word “Valkyrie” emerged in my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, they are Tier’s underlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Underlings? But looking at them together with Tier, they looked like a high school girl idol group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone of them has blond hair and wings on their back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that these girls wanted to live together with Tier in the same house but it seems like they want a house of their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">lizardmen </em>they brought along will also live there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, construction begins in the southwest <em class="calibre5">area </em>where the elve’s houses are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since we are already used to it, together with the high elves, we built it in about five days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like everyone is improving. It was a good house. Should we remodel Ria’s group’s house since it was the first one we built?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their <em class="calibre5">toilet</em> is outside so it is inconvenient in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Ria’s group declined, we just remodel it a little.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「I’m Daga. Please take care of me from now own.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the <em class="calibre5">lizardmen</em> is Daga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My apologies but I can distinguish the individuality of <em class="calibre5">lizardman</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone of them looks the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even after hearing that five out of 15 of them are females, I still can’t distinguish them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Tier and the others also can’t distinguish them so that can’t be considered as a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I want to at least know who is the representative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I intended Daga to wear clothes but it seems like<em class="calibre5"> lizardmen</em> are embarrassed when they are wearing clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I &nbsp;decided to wrap a <em class="calibre5">scarf </em>around his right arm.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Within the baggages that Daga’s group brought are the chickens that Tier promised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that we have hens, we can secure eggs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they even lay eggs on the way here so we can expect a steady supply in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there are only a few of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are only around 40 of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are 5 roosters and 35 hens.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I thought that chicken lays eggs everyday but Daga said they don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know if my knowledge is wrong or if its just the chickens of this world but healthy chickens lay eggs every other day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, we can expect 10 pieces per day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not sure if it is a lot or a few.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Personally, I think it’s a few.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because there are more than ten residents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s increase their number for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, how do you distinguish the fertile one to the infertile…? I’ll let the rooster decide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of making a chicken<em class="calibre5"> area</em> but collecting the eggs in the future will be troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll raise them near our house first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll place them on the north side of the big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We made a henhouse with nests. As for their feeds, I plowed the ground….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Chicken feeds are grains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I guess corn or wheat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I increase the number of fields?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I planted something like a grass on the ground. That will be the chicken feed for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also informed the kuros and Zabuton about them.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A new building, or should I say a new dormitory was built near our house. It is for the <em class="calibre5">maids.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition to me, Loo, Tier, and Flora, our house can’t accommodate Ann’s group of 20.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, they are using the warehouses as their bedrooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, Flora, and Ann will live in my house and the new house will be for the other <em class="calibre5">maids</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked the high elves to build it. They are quite fast and finished it in three days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the interior, it is not that great but the 19 of them have a room of their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The common facilities of their house are the t<em class="calibre5">oilet</em>, a simple <em class="calibre5">kitchen</em>, and a living room with a fireplace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each private room has one bed and one cabinet. It is their call if they want tables and chairs in their room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With just a bed and a cabinet, it is obviously only a place to sleep in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it seems like the <em class="calibre5">maids </em>have requested Zabuton and her spiderlings to create curtains and bedsheets on their own taste.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The three newly arrived angel came in front of me when they are already accustomed to the new life and new house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Your orders.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please leave the front line to me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will do my best in gathering information.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">No.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What’s with this atmosphere?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m just a villager who works hard in farming…no, I’m the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These three are obviously warriors.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Well, it is obvious since they are wearing almost and have weapons but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Tier?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to know Tier’s intention for bringing them here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I intended to have these girls patrol the forest in the sky as a mobile unit.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mobile unit?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. That time when the wyvern attacked, it managed to breathe fire because we reacted too late. On that basis, I called the three of them here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If it is the wyvern from that time, although they probably can’t beat it, they can lure it so it won’t be able to inflict damage this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three of them nods confidently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So they are guards.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, we are depending on Zabuton’s alarm and the kuros but if something similar to that wyvern comes out, it might be necessary to have security personnel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have wider range too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Please do so.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three of them replied strongly.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「I am consulting you about something.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro, Zabuton, Loo, Tier, Ria, Ann, and Daga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The slimes, bees, cows, and chickens can’t participate so they don’t have representatives here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gathered all the representative of various races in the hall of my house to talk about something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s decide the name of this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This place…?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「At first, there is only my house but after building various things, it has now become a village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, the high elves are calling me village chief already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because of that, I’m thinking of giving this village a name, do you have a good name in mind?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know the name of the villages here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I consulted them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about the village chief’s name?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think of what Ria said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My name is Machio Hiraku.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Machio village, Hiraku village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about naming it after this forest?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Name of this forest?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That reminds me, what is the name of this forest?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, it must be normal to name the village to where it is located.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is the name of this forest?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Forest of death.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought that this forest has such a frightening name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Err…how about something closer to that….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Land of death」</p>
<p class="calibre2">….</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the one living in that place is me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But despite being called forest of death, this place is pretty rich. Though I still don’t want this place to be called land of death….</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, if we really use it as reference, it will be called “Village of Death”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, I don’t want it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Naming it after me is better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, various opinions were voiced out and there are also heated discussions but we didn’t come up with a good name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When everyone ran out of idea, Zabuton called me and pointed out at the large tree from the window.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Big tree village」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It came out to me suddenly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, it was selected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From now on, this place will be called Big Tree Village.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-89"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 44 &ndash; Wine and Guest(Demon King’s Envoy)</h1><p class="calibre2">Wine was produced.<span id="calibre_link-142"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Tier suggested a taste test event but when it was announced, it became a drinking event and eventually became a party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I have made much wine, the amount of consumption of the residents is enormous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Four barrels were emptied in that party.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’ll just continue to make wine as much as I harvest but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">The evaluation was too good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is the first time I taste <em class="calibre5">wine</em> as good as this.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, delicious」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Was <em class="calibre5">wine</em> supposed to be this good?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「One more cup」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You drink too much. Show some modesty…I’ll drink my share though.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not bad and it really tastes like wine but….I don’t think it is enough to be praised that much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it has not fermented that much, it tastes sweet…</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Husband, let’s increase the vineyard.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My liege, I’m inexperienced but let me do what I can to help you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, leave the barrel making to me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the number of vineyards for wine increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s probably a good thing….</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the <em class="calibre5">wine</em> was popular with the kuros too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of the four barrels of wine, the kuros drank one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dogs…..this is the first time I saw one getting drunk and stagger while walking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, I noticed that the kuros concentrated on guarding the vineyards…..I want to think that it’s just my imagination.</p>


<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Wine</em> was not something to be consumed regularly, it was supposed to be served at an event or something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though there are some objections, they consented in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably because everyone thought that the supply won’t last if it is consumed regularly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t dislike <em class="calibre5">wine </em>and I’m not craving for it but something inside me considers <em class="calibre5">wine</em> as a luxury good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my previous world, <em class="calibre5">wine</em> was consumed in medieval time casually because drinkable water is hard to come by but we can draw clean water from the well here so we don’t need to rely on <em class="calibre5">wine</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, the requests of the citizens to bring out wine increases as they thought of several reasons to demand for it but that is another story.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Side Story: The Village’s Wine Rebellion</em></strong></p>


<p class="calibre2">Now that we’re breeding cows and chickens, milk and egg supply are now secured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, the number of dishes we can cook has increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need to increase the number of chickens so I did not use them all for cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only those eggs that are not laid in the hen house are to be consumed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried cooking using it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first dish I cook is a <em class="calibre5">plain omelet</em> seasoned with salt and pepper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Delicious.</p>

<p class="calibre2">A nostalgic taste.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly, I saw Kuro’s head lying on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave him some.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro ate it with satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next….<em class="calibre5">pudding</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ingredients are milk, eggs, and sugar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I extracted sugar from sugarcane, I have enough on hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cooked it and poured it into a wooden glass.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That felt good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, I’ll have to put it somewhere to cool it down…should I put it in the cellar?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While waiting for it to cool down, I experimented on making <em class="calibre5">caramel sauce</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Caramel sauce</em> is made by heating a mixture of sugar and water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it is not as simple as I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I burnt it many times before I succeeded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, everything I’ve done was in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The smell of burnt <em class="calibre5">caramel sauce</em> is very sweet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, Flora, and the onis who were supposed to be doing their respective job are unexpectedly standing by the door.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the low supply of eggs, I only managed to make five <em class="calibre5">puddings</em> thus, a battle has occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if the onis were up against Flora and Loo, they did not back out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that, I abandoned the thought of winning a <em class="calibre5">pudding </em>myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, the elves and the angels heard about the <em class="calibre5">pudding</em>. The result, the eggs are now exclusively for <em class="calibre5">pudding</em> making.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to hasten the increase of the number of chickens.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A guest came to the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This was the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing his fine clothes, he’s probably a noble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But he’s not flashy enough so he’s probably a bureaucrat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He came here alone while being guided by Gran Maria’s group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The guest is not human.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If my senses are correct, he might be someone from the demon race.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I met him with a moderate number of people who can fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, and Flora. The kuros are hiding behind the scene. The high elves and <em class="calibre5">lizardmen</em> are also there while holding their respective weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The onis are also in that place and are all behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria brought him alone. Kuudel and Corone are not here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because it is dangerous if all of us gather in one place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, Zabuton is not here too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I am the Demon King’s envoy. I would like to meet the representative of this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Demon King’s envoy.</p>

<p class="calibre2">He looks like a normal human being but he’s a demon after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, since he’s looking for me, I stepped forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That would be me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other party was stunned for a moment but managed to calm down after a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I probably am too far from what a legitimate village chief looks like.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How impolite of me. My name is Beezel. I am the demon king’s envoy.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Hiraku.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the other party did not say his last name, I did not say mine too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He probably only cares about first names.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The man who introduced himself as Beezel showed various things as proof that he really is the demon king’s envoy. After the confirmation, he gave me some presents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is a token of our acquaintanceship.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t really know what are the things he gave me but seeing Loo’s pleased expression, these are probably good things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Normally, I should have a few more exchanges of pleasantries but I want to move to the main subject.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So what does demon king-sama wants?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">For this occasion, I add “sama” to the demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want things to go bad and be in trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We want to discuss about our relationship with this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s the only message?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「N-no, I have a certain level of authority. I have enough power to decide our relationship with this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah…..I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">He wants to discuss their relationship with this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recalled the demon king’s sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, do they want us to pay tax?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or do they want us to leave?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I previously heard that I don’t need to worry anything about the demon king since he never helped us with anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I consult this matter with Loo and Tier?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I turned my gaze to them, they returned my gaze as if saying they leave everything to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They entrusted this to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This negotiation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The basics of negotiation. First, you need to be resolute with your proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you recognize us living here, I am willing to pay 10% of our harvested goods as tax.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">10%.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried presenting tax which is basically profit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is necessary to propose a cheap tax first since he will definitely propose a heavy tax later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And since we volunteered to pay tax, it’s a good point for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By paying taxes, we are basically saying that we recognize and has no plan to defy the demon king.</p>

<p class="calibre2">However, since I don’t know much about the economy of this world, I said a bullish percentage first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is, 10% of the harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? A-are you sure?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other party is totally surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That, does it mean that the tax I proposed is not too low…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since he’s surprised, let’s continue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please come and get it before winter every year.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you want our tax, get it yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Yeah, show him who’s the boss.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-I understand. We will follow that arrangement.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, we finalized the details.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The tax is 10 percent of the harvested goods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is limited to field crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Milk, eggs, honey, and wine are not included.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, crops with low yield are not included too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are crops that do not fill one large barrel per harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there are things that the demon king’s party wanted, we must agree first and they have to purchase it from us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After summarizing all of those things and writing it in a document, Beezel returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I gave him souvenirs, I reflected. As expected, I might have been too aggressive for him to agree to all those clauses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He gave me presents too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「…did I do just fine?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone looks troubled upon hearing me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, Loo says</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I think it was not bad at all. By paying tax, we will be under the other party’s protection.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree. Even so….fufu, 10%?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier laughs as if something is funny.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the normal tax rate for harvested goods is from 50% to 60%. Depending on the place, it might even rise up to 90%.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It was also nice to let him get it. It is indirectly saying that we don’t want them to take up residence here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann nods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t have such intention….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We can harvest many times a year. Since they will only come once before winter, they won’t be able to accurately measure our production volume. To gain the protection of the demon king’s army with less than 10% tax….as expected of the village chief.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria puts together her opinion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never plan such a thing. I plan to properly calculate our tax and pay our share with the right amount….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe this is the common sense of this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, case closed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s go back to work everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the souvenirs we gave Beezel are valuable medicinal herbs. They are all around medicine that can be made as a medicine or as an ointment.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Demon king’s castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Beezel, how was it? What was the other side’s demand?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They said that they will pay tax.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What? They are willing to be under us?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…But they have enough power to exterminate that wyvern.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re right but that was the other party’s proposal.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There might be something behind this.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I also thought so, but …. We have no choice but to accept it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The blood sucking princess and the angel of annihilation are there. Not only that. There were countless <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em> and high elves. <em class="calibre5">Lizardmen </em>and onis too….」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Blood Sucking Princess = Loo, Angel of Annihilation = Tier, Angels of Holocaust = Gran Maria, Kuudel , and Corone, Snipers of the forest of death = High elves. You probably have the idea of how powerful they are now.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「No way? That’s not possible.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It was one of the angels of holocaust that acted as my guide. That time, I thought my life will be over…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Unbelievable….but with that war potential, they can really exterminate that wyvern.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I know what you mean. With that war potential, how can I not adhere to their proposal? It is impossible to refuse. The moment I refuse, they will turn hostile.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mou, mou…..then, what did you….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agreed but we need to do something. Fortunately, their representative is someone easy to talk with.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, he even gave me souvenirs.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hou, what did you get?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I haven’t checked yet.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s check.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll show it to demon king-sama otherwise, it will look like I received some bribe.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It will be a problem if it is something dangerous, let me check.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mou….you’re right. Let’s check a little.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Oh, this this….this fabric? Inside are….fruits? It looks like appo but with better shape and color.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, ah, don’t eat it without permission.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m poison tasting it. Hnn, delicious. No, it’s pretty good. This is amazing!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really? You really are….areh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What happened?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This sack where you get that fruit….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Oh….what a beautiful fabric. Something wrong?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Th-this….this fabric is made from the thread of a <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em>. Moreover, judging from the size of this fabric, it is made by the <em class="calibre5">great demon spider</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Demon spider</em>, you mean the overseer of death?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「”<em class="calibre5">Great”</em>, the one that fought with the demon king 100 years ago and ended with a draw….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Considering the size of the fabric … there is no mistake.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did he intentionally gave something this important to you?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I want to think so but ….it was used as a fruit wrap?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then he did not give it as a gift. Then that means, the <em class="calibre5">great demon spider</em> is there…. I, I will resign today.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please wait. You are the<em class="calibre5"> top </em>of the four heavenly kings. The number one on the list. Are you really going to escape? It’s a….Wait! I’m still talking! Let me come with you!」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-7"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 45 &ndash; Dragon Guest</h1><p class="calibre2">When I thought that our usual everyday life has returned after the guest left, another guest arrived.<span id="calibre_link-143"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Similarly to what happened earlier, the citizens of my village has gathered at the entrance of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My name is Doraim. I am a noble <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The guest was a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s a western dragon that you usually see in <em class="calibre5">fantasy </em>manga and anime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s about 30 meters in length, far bigger than the wyvern before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looks very powerful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If he properly stands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon who introduced himself as Doraim is in a bowing posture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Here is our present. Please accept it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this Doraim’s follower? A man wearing a butler suit presented me a big box respectfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, when I was about to receive it…..Daga stepped forward and receive but he showed it to Ann instead of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, Ann checked the content and brought the box in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a beautifully decorated sword and its sheath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Wh-what a marvelous present.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No no」</p>
<p class="calibre2">This present, is it a token of friendship?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can only give him foodstuff in return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way, what is your business here?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right, my lord, Doraim-sama, has a nest on that mountain south of here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Though it is a bit distant…..you can consider us as your neighbor. We might have been slow but we want to greet our neighbors.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You are very polite….but what is the reason your lord looks like he’s apologizing?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, excuse me. Master, please raise your head.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-yeah.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they didn’t introduce themselves earlier, I would probably think that the butler is the master.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My master is not good at talking with people he met for the first time so I apologize on his behalf. If we have offended you in any way, I sincerely apologize.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, I don’t mind. Ah….since you have come, I would like to welcome you but….it is a bit troublesome with your size.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Master, please get smaller.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the<em class="calibre5"> dragon</em> replied, smoke popped out and a weak looking, tall, middle-aged man showed up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looks like a noble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please excuse us. Master, please introduce yourself again.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My name is Doraim. I am a noble <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..could he possibly practice that line to avoid making mistake?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, though he’s tall, he’s at a human<em class="calibre5"> size</em> now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I invited him to our house for a banquet.</p>



<p class="calibre2">「This wine is delicious. This food is also delicious. I will not go home. I’ll live here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s not good. If you don’t get back to the nest to protect it, I’ll get yelled at by various people.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It will be fine. I can intercept even if I’m here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, you can but you’ll be an inconvenience here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mou mou….inconvenience?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, inconvenience. If battle starts here, you basically can’t do anything.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How rude. I’m a noble <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I was impolite. I’ll rephrase. You can’t do anything productive here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mou」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s return while you are still being treated as a guest. They also wrapped various souvenirs for us.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Apple! Is apple included?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please be relieved. I received large quantity of it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Let’s return.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Ah, please go back to your original size.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the dragon left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they left with a large quantity of crops, I think it’s still insufficient compared to the value of the sword.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In any case, I reflected on many things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This village is not prepared to entertain guests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never considered welcoming guest before so it can’t be helped since I’m too unsociable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that’s not good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not really good, right?</p>


<p class="calibre2">First of all, even if we need some time to prepare to receive the guest, I can’t leave them standing on the ground outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I can’t invite them in the house immediately since they’ll exactly know what we’ve been doing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should make a fine waiting room for guests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Okay, let’s build a house for guests use.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Next, the welcoming ceremony.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not good for having almost everyone to gather every time there is a guest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is important to receive guests, each one has their own respective job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our current system: once Gran Maria, Kuudel, or Corone discovers a guest, she will guide that person around…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since she will directly guide them, we won’t receive any report of their initial contact.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, Zabuton will notice that someone unknown is approaching the village and will sound the alarm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of Zabuton’s alarm, everyone will gather.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I decided to have a new signaling system for Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Danger alarms will be the same as before.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The new signal for visitor is ringing a bell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That bell is personally crafted by the elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I thought that hitting an iron is already a good idea but that seems not to be the case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sound of hitting an iron is awful so the bell was made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That became the standard now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The role of greeting guests will be taken by only three people, me, Loo, and Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Ann, Ria, and Daga opposed my suggestion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, in addition to the three of us, several high elves, oni, and lizardmen will accompany us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora wanted to take part in it so I asked her to look out at the guests during the night if they will stay overnight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like Loo and Tier, Ria and Ann are also fine doing an all-night-vigil if there is a guest but I want them to sleep properly so I asked Flora to do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This arrangement is probably all right now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, we might fail in some things later but let’s take that an opportunity to learn and improve.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t think that we’ll have guests that often.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I just raised a <em class="calibre5">flag</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And a guest showed up.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-27"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 46 &ndash; Beastkin Guests</h1><p class="calibre2">After the envoy of the demon king and the dragon, the next guests are a group of beastmen wearing armor.<span id="calibre_link-144"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the terrain on the way here, it is impossible to use wagons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though not as much as Daga’s group when they arrived, the beastmen are carrying big baggage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are 10 of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at their ragged equipments, they are definitely experienced warriors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though their faces look like human, they have ears on their heads, and tails on their butts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hairiness of their arm varies individually.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are some who has animal-like arms but there are some who has human-like arms too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I am Gulf. We came from the <em class="calibre5">Howling</em> village which is located in the middle of the mountain in the east. We want to establish friendly relation with this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">A representative from the group stepped forward. By the way, Kuudel was the one who guides them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was about to step forward too, Loo appeared before me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Welcome. The Big Tree village welcome you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something’s wrong, Loo seems sarcastic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I would like to guide you to a place to rest but….is this all of you?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, is there a problem?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really? Then, we will consider the rest as enemies.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo said that forcefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What do you mean?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was thinking about it, two beastmen came out of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that they are wearing camouflage clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was thinking about what had happened, the kuros showed up behind the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….I’m sorry. It seems like they were separated from us.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s dangerous. You should have checked before entering the village. Also, refrain from doing anything unruly in the village. Any citizen of the village can take care of you if anything happens.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….I understand. We will not do anything unruly. We promise.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Loo on the lead, the beastmen entered the recently built guest house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That guest house, I proposed that it should be enough for it to house four individuals luxuriously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it was rejected because the others said that it was too small.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To come to this village, one needs to cross the mountain and pass through the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike the demon king envoy and the dragon, normal people will need to travel in a group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Depending on the circumstances, it is said that to travel here, a group of 30 is the minimum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, I was convinced so we built a big one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are 12 visitors this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is more than enough for them.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The guest house was built at the south side extension of the southwest <em class="calibre5">area </em>where the houses of Ria and Flora was built.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is only a one-story house, it is as large as my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it will be used by guests, we made the furnitures more showy and the facilities have good functionalities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, the decorations are far more elaborate than those in my house.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It might seem that this is only a slightly good inn but this is the best we can provide in our village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I decided to call it an inn rather than a guest house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That name fits it the best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The inn has a backyard and it is fully enclosed by a fence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is the purpose of the fence?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Purpose you ask?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You can’t cross this fence unless you have permission.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">What kind of purpose is that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it was actually used at a later time…..</p>


<p class="calibre2">The fence is not a simple log fence. It is a high-quality fence with elaborate design.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since we don’t have paint, it is of wooden color but if I managed to get paint, I’ll paint it white.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After building the inn, I looked around and noticed something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Crude.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see Ria’s group’s house from a distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is an open area I plowed without any obstacle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t necessarily need significant obstacle but I want to have some cover at least.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something like a tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I decided to plant a fruit tree near Ria’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to be a little practical so it’s a fruit tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I planted apples, pears, and persimmons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How many cherries should I plant?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it will be covered with trees after a while….</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I made a field like a home garden and planted strawberries and watermelon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made the same thing to the other houses too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the vicinity of the inn, I put importance on appearance. I thought of cherry blossom so I planted cherries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, I also planted fence-like-plants inside the fence that surrounds the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know the name of that plant but I imagined how they look like in my previous world. It will become another fence.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Probably similar to this.</em></strong></p>
<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000023.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">….How do I trim them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s think about it after they grow up.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After that, I also planted trees in each <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruits outside the fields are free for all moreover, I planted fruit trees they requested.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Everyone loves it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I expanded the southwest <em class="calibre5">area</em> for the construction of the inn, the name changed to residential <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t think much about it but since that name was recognized by the ones living there, everyone called it such.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the place where my house and the big tree are located is called big tree <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Are we really welcoming our guests? Or are we confining them….?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel doubtful of Loo’s action.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier answered my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Husband, usually, an ambassador who seeks friendship will prepare some present. Even that dragon brought one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…so their purpose is not friendship?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That might be the case so we should not do the usual procedure that we should have followed.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Indeed. That’s true.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Besides, they obviously hid two soldiers. Loo-san is already being courteous.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so….? Kuudel guide them here, she did not notice those who were hiding?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She noticed them but let them be because they are not a threat. I’ll scold her later.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Be gentle. They are certainly not a threat.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…right. I’ll keep that in mind.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">That night, we invited our beastmen guest to a welcome banquet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The venue is the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, and I participated in that banquet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though Ria and Ann came with us, they dedicated their time monitoring things behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dishes served were the thing we normally eat. We just made them look a little luxurious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruits are displayed as they are and are neither peeled nor cut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the banquet for Doraim, we had a big party and the fruits were all garnished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not realistic to make the same reception to everyone who comes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When a king comes, when a noble comes, when a merchant comes, when a friend comes, and when a stranger comes, it is natural for the reception to change.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I fully understand that but since this is our first meeting, I will serve them <em class="calibre5">wine</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m like the outcast of this group, I have to blend in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know their purpose for coming here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll be humble until the time it is clear whether they are an enemy or not.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「My apologies for this poor meal.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I brought the<em class="calibre5"> wine</em> out but only a limited amount.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About 2 glasses per person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After drinking all the <em class="calibre5">wine</em>, the drinks become water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is already a <em class="calibre5">plus α</em> that I served them wine and regular food.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Even so, Loo still looks dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the middle of the banquet, I already plan to hear what is their purpose by questioning them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That time, they probably already have their guards down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is my goal so when we began eating, I receive them hospitably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s begin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My apologies for my ignorance but, what kind of place is Howling village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already asked the citizen of my village but none of them know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Howling village is located at the mountain east from here. It is said to have been founded 1000 years ago but in reality, it is probably about 500 years ago. The elderly loves to boast in the strangest things.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gulf speaks nonchalantly. Could it be the effect of <em class="calibre5">wine</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The population of the Howling village is about 500 people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a gathering of five settlements that have 100 people each.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So it is basically a coalition of mountain settlements.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: A mountain settlement needs your help village chief, I’ll mark it on your map.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them are beastkins and most of them are dogkin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They make a living by hunting, mining, and trading with the human village on the other side of the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there has been trouble with the human village so their trade stopped. They took a hard hit because of it and has no choice but to look for another place to trade with.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They recently learned the existence of our village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it is because of the subordination notice from the demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Howling village and the human village they are trading with are both parts of the demon king’s territory so they are also subjects of the demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I roughly understood their purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, I listened to the hardship Gulf’s group faced to come here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others are making agreeable responses while eating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking around, it seems like the other beastkins are enjoying their food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If we kept hiding, I might have never had the chance of eating this. It’s a good thing we were found out.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way, why did you hide?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Well, it is the first time we come to this village. It is necessary to be vigilant and if something happens, they will go back to the village to report.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Tier seem to be focused on information gathering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How reliable.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-45"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 47 &ndash; Howling Village</h1><p class="calibre2">Gulf’s group has returned.<span id="calibre_link-145"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their said purpose of having a friendly relationship with us is no lie.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason why they didn’t bring any present is that there is no such custom in <em class="calibre5">Howling</em> village. I heard that it is because they are poor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I asked Loo and Tier, I groaned because there is certainly such custom but it is practiced by nobles and wealthy people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Different type of people has different values.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have thought so from the start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I acknowledged our friendship but I need to clarify several things first when it comes to trade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what I heard from Gulf, the form of trade is barter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like this village, <em class="calibre5">Howling</em> village doesn’t seem to have the circulated currency of this region.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, it seems like both villages have the things the other one wants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem now is the difficulty of conducting trade. Though both villages consider what the other village possesses is of great value, bringing the goods to the other village and bringing it back on their own is highly difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s what they thought but on our end, I think this place is relatively safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Either Loo or Tier can travel alone and the kuros can accompany them in carrying luggage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, we can discontinue trading with them anytime we want if there is anything we dislike.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This arrangement is not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next topic, what to trade.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village specialized in various ores and products that uses them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I heard various things from Gulf, the thing I am most interested in is the paint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it was made by crushed colored rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can finally paint the fence of the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are also silver products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they mainly make tablewares.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I yearn for it a little because all the tableware in this village is made of woods.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Glass </em>products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they don’t have the transparent type of glass, there are still various small and big products like bottles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Flora are interested in those.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like glass bottles are good for preserving medicine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will also be suitable for storing honey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Iron products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have things like pot and frying pan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before Ann and Daga’s group came, we’ve been using cooking utensils made of rocks compared to those…cooking utensils made of iron are easier to use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want them.</p>


<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village wants food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, our crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because they are located halfway up the mountain, food security is a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruits we served them are quite popular and they even lowered their head to ask for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the <em class="calibre5">wine</em> too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It wouldn’t be a problem if we trade some crops.</p>

<p class="calibre2">No, the population of the village is also increasing, because of that, we should stock more food. It will be good to expand the field extensively.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, the village to village barter will be held on autumn and aside from the <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village, several other villages will also participate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll consult everyone regarding this matter first.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The result of the consultation; large-scale expansion of the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is presently 8 by 8 fields. It increased four folds and the size now is 16 by 16.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, there is a limit to how much I could plow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though there is a limit, I’m the only one who can use the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to persevere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to break that limit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, I even feel that my plowing speed increases.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did I get used to it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do the plowing while the others take care of the crops and harvesting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elves, lizardmen, and spiderlings worked hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, out of the 256 fields, 64 are vineyards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">¼ of the field is dedicated for wine?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that alright?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, except from me, everyone agreed with that arrangement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, meeting of what to plant on the other fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I mainly planted grains like corn, rice, wheat, barley, and soybean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The amount of carrots, potatoes, cabbages, tomatoes, pumpkins, cucumbers, radishes, spinach, onions, and garlics are the same as before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sugar cane and rapeseed are surprisingly popular too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rapeseed for oil and sugar cane for sugar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those and several seasonings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it has been discussed that we can sell pepper and sesame seeds, it has been decided to plant more of them.</p>


<p class="calibre2">That reminds me, I <em class="calibre5">challenged </em>wasabi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it needs to be planted on a paddy field, I plowed near the reservoir using the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I succeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I acquired wasabi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I have wasabi now….there is no dish where I can use it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I handed the miso and soy sauce production to Flora.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora is way better than me on that aspect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told her the theory and process so it is up to her to know the right quantity by using<em class="calibre5"> trial and error</em> method.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh yeah, I discovered something about<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%BA%B9" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> koji</a>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I transformed the AFT to<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamoji" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> shamoji</a> and used it to mixed crops while wishing it to be koji. It fermented in a good way and became koji.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, I can make as much as koji as I want as long as I use the shamoji form of the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I built an exclusive hut for fermentation purposes and continue my experiment regarding it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of it to realize the hope of my tongue.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-63"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 48 &ndash; Reaffirming Roles</h1><p class="calibre2">Because the population increased, I reconfirmed everyone’s role.<span id="calibre_link-146"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves are the carpenters and are also helps with harvesting and hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During winter, they have more free time so they enter the forest and engage in mining work to collect iron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know how to build anything at first but with their help, there are a lot of buildings in our village now before I know it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The elves’ skills are wonderful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are reliable citizens.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The onis are <em class="calibre5">maids </em>of all the houses here. They greatly improved our living conditions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their main job is cooking and cleaning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are also taking care of the inn even if there is no guest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently, they are researching on how to process the crops we harvest and new dish to cook.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though there is a minimal result, the result of their research is quite popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They’re our savior.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The lizardmen are doing all the heavy labor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves and the onis are also powerful but they can’t match the lizardmen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are cooperating with the onis on various parts of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also volunteered to take care of the chickens and cows so I leave it to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am thankful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they are a race that is always in the reservoir, when it is time to sleep, they go to their residences.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The kuros secure meat by hunting and they also patrol the inside and outside of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are the oldest resident of this village but they cannot talk. We can communicate with them to a certain extent but they it is obvious that they still need to rely on others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was shocked when I found out that one high elf is able to identify the kuros individually.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Zabuton and her spiderlings are the seamstresses of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, they are the weaver spiders.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Seamstresses here refers to a person who sews, the weaver is obviously refering to spiders.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Not a single citizen has complaint about the fabric or the clothes made by Zabuton and her spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, because she’s living in the highest point of the village, she has the role of alarming us if there is trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t thank her enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll plant more potatoes for her.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The angels Gran Maria, Kuudel, and Corone.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The fly through the forest to check the surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are also excellent guide considering all of our previous guests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, there is at least one of them flying non-stop but I persuade them to calm down a little bit and even gave them a day off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because that is something that can’t be done by three people alone.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, and Flora.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are like my secretary and consultant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Basically, the three of them has their own individual researches and they are also directing the high elves, the onis and the lizardmen on some things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Flora are researching medicine-related things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier researches magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, because of my personal request, Flora is researching on how to make miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aside from the miso and soy sauce, because of their research, they are treated as the village doctors.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Now, the slims, bees, chickens, and cows….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just say they are working hard on their individual activities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bees produce honey this year too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a whole lot compared to last year so it is very helpful.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, the things I have to do has increased too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In regards to the night activities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, there are only Loo and Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, seven high elves then, another five high elves joined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are things that I want to say but I’m not sure if I really have to say it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just think that everything is alright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, the high elves suddenly increased by 42, 20 oni <em class="calibre5">maids </em>also joined, and there’s also Flora.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone of them is female.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is already too much so I rejected them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My inner limit was reached.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I’m the only one who can satisfy their desire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m also surprised by Ann.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She always kept some distance but who would have thought that she’s so aggressive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the spring came, I was delighted to meet Daga’s group that came together with Gran Maria, Kuudel, and Corone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Male.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to monopolize the females but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the responsibility scares me.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Currently, I’m the only target of all the females here so I want some comrades at arms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I received “healthy body” from god and my body can withstand them, my mind can’t keep up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, there’s hope!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga!</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there is no hope.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We lay eggs….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Male transfers semen to the female in a specific time to bear the egg.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that I won’t be able to make it out easily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Masayuki’s batch, Kuro’s grandpup, found their partners but no longer increase their numbers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I am never free at night.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A certain news has reached me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo is pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Who’s child is it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahahaha</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mine!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uwooohhhhh!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to calm down but I can’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it is natural considering all the things we’ve done but I still panic a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I am very pleased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone in the village is also in a festive mood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That evening, the number of who wants to do it increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I understand how you feel….however, if all of you became pregnant now, things will be troublesome….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did my best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">At that same time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A permission application to lay eggs at the reservoir was issued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that the lizardmen plan to lay eggs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t mind them laying eggs but they can’t directly use the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I made an egg-laying space at the side of the reservoir.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One individual only bears one egg. Five lizardwomen lay eggs this time so there are five eggs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They basically leave them alone in the water but they also need to watch them in turn until they hatch in case a foreign enemy shows up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the kuros and the spiders are there, the lizardmen were pleased since their eggs are much safer now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They will give birth to healthy children…wait, they gave birth already, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope healthy children hatch.</p>



<p class="calibre2">「Onee-sama, congratulations on your pregnancy.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufufu, thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s just….I have one question.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Nani?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We are vampires….don’t we increase our numbers with blood contract?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You are right but I’m already pregnant. I guess this method works too.」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-85"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 49 &ndash; Reputable Bartering Village</h1><p class="calibre2">This year, visitors continue to arrive since spring but the spiderlings are still leaving as usual.<span id="calibre_link-147"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The pups did not go out to find <em class="calibre5">partners</em> this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did they all find their rightful partners here? Or did they reached a certain population limit…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is breeding season, some of them did not get pregnant this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is good that they have some sort of birth control.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking about it, a group of kuros went out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About 30 of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know what they are planning to do but they are giving an atmosphere that they will not come back after a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope they won’t get hurt….</p>

<p class="calibre2">Summer passed and it is now autumn. The day to barter with the <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village has come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that it is only natural for me to go but I was stopped by everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They say that it is a sign of weakness and we might get underestimated if the village chief himself go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Never thought that there is something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, it is said that the chief should not easily move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, after an intense janken battle, Tier was the winner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">(I didn’t mean to bring the janken culture here since the hands of the other tribes are completely incapable of playing. However, they managed to play so by shouting. It became a new rule for the all race janken.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the other members, five lizardmen including Daga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I thought of sending all the lizardmen but it was reduced to that number since they need to watch the eggs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they will hatch soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">10 high elves will compensate for their reduced number.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was decided by draw lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, a total of 16 people will carry the baggage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will take 10 days for them to arrive there, two days to stay, and another 10 to return.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the supposed schedule but it was suddenly changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon Doraim came to play so I asked him to transport things with one barrel of wine as compensation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This Doraim every time he came to this village, he’ll eat so much food and drink wine while grumbling to the point of vomiting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the template, his butler will pick him up the next day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did he think that our village is a pub or something?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, it is hard to refuse him since he brings a present every time he came here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, I think him doing that seems profitable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not that familiar with jewels and armors but seeing Loo and Tier not saying anything, they must be very valuable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, though I’m not sure if that is an acceptable excuse for letting him drink, there is a banquet every time he came….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim obediently accepted my proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition to being the transport service, he’ll also stay they to keep them company.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that the reason he wanted <em class="calibre5">wine</em> was after bragging our <em class="calibre5">wine </em>to other dragons, he was threatened that his dark history will be exposed if he didn’t bring them some.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So there are those kind of dragons too.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In any case, since Doraim will give them a lift, travel time is almost negligible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Doraim can go to that place in an hour while carrying the baggage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, he told me that it will take time to load the baggage on his back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But how can loading time can be compared to 10 days traveling?</p>
<p class="calibre2">We prepared several same-sized wooden box as much as possible to lay in our goods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m glad that Doraim can carry a lot of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no change on the bartering team.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We talked several times in a meeting about what crops are necessary for the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What if there was left over? It will be troublesome if the value of the crops we’ll bring there would be too low there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, there are several things they talked about that I didn’t understand but since none of us has been there and we don’t know the demand of the village, we let Tier decide after seeing the place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have no problem with that arrangement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I want to avoid dispute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s hope nothing will go wrong.</p>


<p class="calibre2">They brought fruits like apple, pear, persimmon and orange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For grain, they brought wheat, barley, soybean, and corn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, hard crops that will be able to endure the transport like carrot and radish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Strawberries and tomatoes are not good for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is our first trade so we have as much as type as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apart from crops, they also brought 10 barrel of <em class="calibre5">wines</em> and some seasoning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">10 barrels of wine might be too much but since Doraim is with them, we’ll allow him to drink there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only hope that he doesn’t drink too much and met an accident while going back.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Howling village</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…Do you think the people of Big Tree village will really come?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t worry. We made sure they know when to arrive. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「But I haven’t seen anyone entering the vicinity of this mountain yet….hnn? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Something wrong? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is that?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Areh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hmm, that」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Which?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That one flying in the sky.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…..dragon? areh? It’s going here…..」</p>



<p class="calibre2">After sending off Tier, we returned to our daily activities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taking care of the fields, playing with the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, consulting the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I say consultation, it’s just asking what they want to add or change in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want this type of facility here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want another waterway there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s plant this kind of crops more next time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can I drink <em class="calibre5">wine</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I spent my time hearing those kinds of requests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I never forget to spend time with Loo whose tummy is getting bigger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, it seems like I don’t need to worry about childbirth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Several high elves and onis have witnessed and are knowledgeable about delivery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone told me that there is no need to worry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided not to listen to the voice inside me.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Tier’s group came back as scheduled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I immediately checked the luggage at Doraim’s back and checked for leftovers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Everything was bartered.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I left the unloading to Daga’s group and listen to Tier’s report.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「All the crops are well received. At first, they were cautious of me, the high elves, and the lizardmen, they’re scared to approach us. People started to gather with the free tasting husband suggested. People started to gather and everything was bartered.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Free tasting was something I suggested before Tier left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want them to know that we’re not deceiving them so I have them had the taste of our crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, the free taste is <em class="calibre5">mainly </em>the fruits since they are the only ones that can be readily eaten.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was glad that it was popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No <em class="calibre5">wine </em>left.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Doraims expression was getting darker and darker everytime <em class="calibre5">wine </em>was bartered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s still sulky even now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Tier, let’s hear the rest of your report while eating. Doraim, we’ll serve <em class="calibre5">wine</em> there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「As expected of the village chief. You know how to break other’s pain.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To think that you’ll turn that way after seeing 10 barrels of <em class="calibre5">wine</em> bartered….</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-3"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 50 &ndash; Meeting While Drinking Wine and New Residents</h1><p class="calibre2">A banquet happened in the name of a meeting.<span id="calibre_link-148"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Doraim is also here, we decided to do it at the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had Tier summarized their experience and report it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It starts at the time they arrive there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the village <em class="calibre5">panicked</em> when they saw Doraim in his dragon form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They managed to calm them down and unload the luggage on that day then spend the night there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Food on that village is really scarce so the emergency ration that Tier’s group brought are consumed by them earlier than they thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next day, as soon as the sun rises, they open shop for business but no one approached them for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, they tried attracting the customer by free tasting products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before they noticed it, all of the luggage they brought were traded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The most popular are the fruits and <em class="calibre5">wine</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though all the grain type products were traded, we’re not sure what among it they really want since the one who bought them are the village chief, the village heads, and those who have big houses that can stock them.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Remember, Howling village is five villages combined.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">The thing we obtained by bartering are, as expected, paints, iron products, silver products, and glass products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The barter trade continued until the sun was about to set. Because they were able to trade them all earlier than usual, they had thought of returning as soon as possible but they were stopped by the village chief and the village heads and asked them to stay until the next day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason, they want to continue our trade relations because they can’t trade grains unless they go to a city.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their dinner is the crops and <em class="calibre5">wine</em> the villagers bartered from them and no one seems to be dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next day, they reconfirmed what they have discussed during the night. They brought the luggage to Doraim’s back and came home during the afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s move on to the next topic.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Next is the state of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That village can neither be considered as poor nor rich.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thought village moves every time they changed their mining site, it is clean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The children hunt and forage while the adults mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, since the ore they obtained from the mine and the products they made from them can no longer be traded to the human village, they are in a quite perilous state.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like what Gulf previously said, even though this place is far, they came here to look for food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, even though Big Tree village has the food they need, they can’t go frequently because of the danger even though the things they can carry per trip is limited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, they will be saved if we can trade like this in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are even willing to trade even outside their village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also said that if there is anything that we want, we just need to say a word and they will prepare it as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That seems to be the state of their village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why do I feel like the last one is some sort of appeal?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the drunk Doraim is now sleeping happily, we end the meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thank the group who went to <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village then leave.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Husband, is it all right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is there anything you didn’t tell me during the meeting?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「No, I honestly forgot it during the meeting.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hnn?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The village chief there asked us if we could migrate some of their villagers here. I did not answer immediately and said that I still need to think about it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Migrate?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, it seems like the <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village is trying to decrease the mouth to feed.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">They want to hit two birds on one stone. They will be able to decrease the mouth to feed while increasing the food each of them can eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind increasing our population further but….I wonder why Tier did not immediately reply to them?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because all the immigration applicant are young beast-women.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….eh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They cannot let beastmen migrate since they are their labor force. They can’t also send the elderly since we can’t use any of their wisdom and it will worsen the image of their immigration plan.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">So the only choice are young beastwomen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How nice of Tier to not reply immediately…</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what they’re up to is really obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, the Big Tree village has room to spare.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The more helping hands, the happier I am.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will they do the same if we are the ones in trouble?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for me, if I can help, I would help.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However,</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How many will migrate?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Maximum of 22. However, if we are going to accept them, we need to dedicate 1 or 2 people to educate them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….Let’s accept all of them under one condition.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Condition?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, tell them to add a few young men.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">We don’t have a good relationship so I can’t accept one-sided help.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like them to help with my trouble too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Male shortage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s the condition?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. At least two young males but the more the better.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Also….if one whole family wants to migrate, tell them we’ll accept them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You want a whole family to migrate?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If they are to send their daughter to an unknown place, it is not strange for them to worry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m not sure if anyone will think of it that way but…I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not everyone will think that way?</p>
<p class="calibre2">So it is only a common sense of my previous world?</p>


<p class="calibre2">The next day, Tier alone went to <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village to finalize the migration.</p>

<p class="calibre2">10 days later, I asked Doraim to carry them here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One request to a dragon cost one barrel of wine, &nbsp;is it cheap? Or expensive?</p>
<p class="calibre2">New residents arrived at the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">25 beastkins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Twenty-two beastwomen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three males.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My long awaited males.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Male!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahahahaha!</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">The three males are kindergarten children.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「These are the young men.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Was it intentional?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t think so.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, they followed my condition but…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I won’t give up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if they are useless now, they will be break water in several years!</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, even if they are young, I can use them to avoid being a seed bag eventually!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not that bad!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, I just need to train them slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good luck being men raised by carnivorous women!</p>


<p class="calibre2">「I am Senna. I am grateful for accepting our migration.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Senna is the representative of the migrants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among those who came, she the eldest and she has dog ears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She seems to be a daughter of the village chief of <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We will endure anything you’ll do to us but please do not abandon us.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah….don’t be afraid. You’re a migrant now but you’ll be a citizen of Big Tree village in the future. You’ll be one of us.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「To treat us like that…. thank you very much. Honestly, I am prepared to be treated less than a slave.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I apologize for wasting your sorrowful resolution. For now, we’ve prepared a place for you. All of you will live there for a while.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「For a while?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, once you get accustomed to life here, I will listen to your request like where do you want to live or what kind of house do you want. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-I understand. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I called one of the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I am Ramurias. I was appointed to be your caretaker. Please take care of me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If there is something you don’t understand, just ask her.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, thank you very much.」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-22"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 51 &ndash; Trading with Beastkin’s Result</h1><p class="calibre2">Immediately after hearing about the migration from Tier, I began building a house in the residential <em class="calibre5">area</em> with the help of the high elves.<span id="calibre_link-149"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a big house where 30 individuals can live.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We made private rooms but most are large rooms that can accommodate two to four people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We did it like that in consideration that they might get lonely if they are alone in a room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will still take some time before they get used to this village.</p>


<p class="calibre2">25 individuals migrated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three of them are kindergarten children.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The oldest is as old as a high school girl, Senna, so she became their representative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are some migrants that look like junior high schooler but most of them are at elementary students age.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I’m a bit uneasy if those girls can live alone on their own, they volunteer on helping with housework and so far, there is no problem.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m just thinking, though the <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village population is about 500, is it really alright to send 25 individuals out?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Won’t it be dangerous for them since they sent out a whole generation of females?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I talked about it with Senna but it seems that the migrants are second daughter of crowded family so the village still has enough females.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, because the migrants are all too young, Senna, as the village chief’s daughter, was sent out too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To advertise that the migration is a great opportunity, the village chief sent his own daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, from an outsider’s point of view, they are sent out because they are good-for-nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Senna asked me to take care of her and all the other migrants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So that’s how it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I now understand why Senna was really sad when she first came here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Don’t worry, we won’t treat you like that here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You are not a good-for-nothing beastkin, Senna!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I know that from the bottom of my heart!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, Senna….</p>
<p class="calibre2">You don’t need to come to my bedroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t swing that way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Absolutely don’t come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already told you so, why are you still in my bedroom?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did the door just closed by itself?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why can’t I open it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t remember making it able to be locked outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is rude to not lay hand on a woman who already resolved herself.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「For the sake of <em class="calibre5">Howling</em> village, please accept me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t get that last line.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is completely different from my previous world, or at least really different from Japan.</p>



<p class="calibre2">「There are no noticeable problems with the migrants from <em class="calibre5">Howling</em> village. They are fully motivated to work and demand work if they are not doing anything.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I received that report from the person in charge of the migrants, Ramurias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did they experience any major problem?」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Ramurias talks about problems with the migrants while MC is asking about problems of the migrants.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「There is….since they are young children, they cried upon seeing Zabuton’s spiderlings.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「And peed upon seeing the kuros.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those are the major problems?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I might seem bad but I value the kuros and the spiderlings more than them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They should get used to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, since the beastboys are small, the beastgirls are taking care of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the future, I think that’s good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like you to become onee-san lover by all means.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The things we bartered from the <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Iron cooking utensils.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kitchen knife, <em class="calibre5">frying pan</em>, large pan, small pan, small pot, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cooking will be easier now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The onis and I are pleased.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Silverware.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Knife, fork, spoon</em>, flat plate, deep bowl, <em class="calibre5">cup, glass</em>, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of their luxurious appearance, we put them at the inn for guest use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A part of them is already dedicated to Doraim.</p>


<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Glass </em>bottle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They will play an active part in storing seasoning and medicines.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they brought back a number of it, the person who wanted them took most of it and run at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a good thing that I manage to take five to store seasonings.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hatchet, ax, candle, needle, yarn, leather, accessories, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hatchet and ax are given to the elves and onis since they are using carved stones made by me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Candle.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Though magic can be used to light things up…candles are important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially for me who can’t use magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I said that they are candles….I thought it is made of wax but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thing before me is different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the raw material is some sort of tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll be the one who’ll use this.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Zabuton took the needle, yarn, and leather.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She insisted on being in charge of weaving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am grateful.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Accessories are small boxes, bags, leather belts, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The person who likes one took one for themselves.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Currently, there are no currencies in the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though we can barter, the only personal things each of the villagers owned are the things they brought here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All crops are shared equally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the population increases more, should I review this issue?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I consulted others and this is what they all said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Everything here belongs to husband(village chief) so do what you want.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that the normal way of thinking?</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-41"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 52 &ndash; Tax Collection</h1><p class="calibre2">Before winter.<span id="calibre_link-150"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Beezel came to collect tax.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Somehow, he looks tired.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is he alright?</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I guide him towards the warehouse where the divided part of the crops for tax is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is this everything?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our agreement is 10 percent but since we harvest many times a year, I am unsure of the total volume of our harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I am willing to pay the exact amount, it is hard to calculate our harvest since we can’t even harvest everything in one day….that said, I paid no attention to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, I decided to hand over thirty percent of harvested crops of our latest harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The apples are in a different location. We don’t put them together here since the fruits might get ruined.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Apple? Is it the fruit I received before? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, that’s apple. Be careful on your way home. But….why are you alone? Can you carry all of these back?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it is only 30 percent of our latest harvest, because we increased the number of fields, it is a considerable amount.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can fill a warehouse of about 8 tatami mats.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That amount is not something one person can carry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t worry. I have a carpet. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Carpet? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Beezel clapped his hands, a huge carpet appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s a flying carpet. With this, I can carry them back home.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t let him load the tax on his carpet so I asked the lizardmen to do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Beezel and I had a light meal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier instructed me to do so to collect information.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Anything happened recently?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t have any intelligence gathering skill so I asked him a casual question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The war with humans is currently in a stalemate. But the most troublesome thing is the hero rampaging in various places.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I expected to hear some light information but why is it that I heard something heavy?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The humans and demons are at war?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Really?</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s a demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And there’s a hero.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Heh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? So that’s why you look tired…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha. A problem occurred just before I came here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it is better not to ask more about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s change the topic….I can’t think of anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Beezel saw through me and changed the topic himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way, though we already received your tax, I would like to buy some crops using money.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Money?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. The apple I got earlier is really popular and I’m sure the other crops are the same. Even this food that I’m eating is delicious.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it might only be a social etiquette, I’m still happy that the things from here are praised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like my face unintentionally gave out my emotion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Beezel-san, drink more wine.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Ah, no」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please don’t hold back. Hahahaha」</p>
<p class="calibre2">You could say that I’m easy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It became a banquet and Beezel was only able to go home the next day.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Demon king’s castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Beezel, you just returned? How was it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…Who are you again? Ah, I remember now. You are Randan of the four heavenly kings who supposed to go to that village last time but escaped.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, that is, some emergency work came up. The hero appeared on the west. It’s not a lie. Look, this is the report.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fuh.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t look at me like that. My bad. So, how was it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How what?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The village. Is the <em class="calibre5">great demon spider</em> there?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahahaha, I confirmed it. There is no <em class="calibre5">great demon spider</em> there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ohhh, is that so? I knew it. That guy is not something you can just find anywhere.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The <em class="calibre5">great demon spider</em> is a large spider whose total length exceeds 20 meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hnnn? I know that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you know what will happen if the <em class="calibre5">great demon spider</em> grows further?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…Eh? It’s not in its final form yet?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「When the <em class="calibre5">great demon spider</em> grows further, it becomes <em class="calibre5">illegal</em> demon spider.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Illegal</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: New OPness level. So strong that its power level is “illegal”. Read the race of Zabuton in the image below.</em></strong></p>
<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000011.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Upon becoming <em class="calibre5">illegal</em>, the large spider shrinks a lot.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「……」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It will be about two to three meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t say…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「……」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「And has a lot of spiderlings.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-you mean….it built a happy family there? Hahaha」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahahaha」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will resign after all. Thank you for all your help.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You will not escape! I will not let you escape no matter what!」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-60"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 53 &ndash; Disturbance in the Forest</h1><p class="calibre2">Upon learning about the beastboys, I was overwhelmed by the fact that I’m the only one who can’t use magic.<span id="calibre_link-151"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Seriously?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ehh」</p>
<p class="calibre2">To me, the beastboys are normal kindergartener.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Yeah, like everyone else in the village.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">They are at the learning age and still unable to cast magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastwomen are able to use magic so they will surely be able to use it too when they grow up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m the only one who can’t use it huh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are you going to study magic too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ugh…..」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo already told me that I have no talent in magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She said before that to be able to cast a small fire, I have to strive for a decade…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is is normal for someone to be able to use magic?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Sort of. All angels and vampires can use magic.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier answers my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Almost all high elves can cast magic too. If one can’t use it, living in the forest will be more troublesome.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I nod after hearing Ria’s answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, without magic, it will surely be hard to live in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Many of the onis are good with fire and water magic.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We <em class="calibre5">lizardmen</em> are good with water magic. On the contrary, we are envious with the onis who can master both fire and water magic.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No no, we are not your match in terms of water magic and I also think that specializing one art is better.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann and Daga praise each other’s magical capability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So it is normal for someone to be able to cast magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A-ano, I heard that there are only a few among the beastkins that are good at magic.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「But all of you who came here can use magic, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because of the environment of the village, it will be troublesome if we can’t since it will mean a lot if we can or can’t use the forge.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. You are similar to the high elves.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are you forced to learn it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I have the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is similar to magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not good to desire what you are not capable of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s just do our best in the things that we can do.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Later, I saw Kuro and Zabuton using magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bees too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>

<p class="calibre2">Slimes….you too?</p>
<p class="calibre2">My allies are the cows and the chickens.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You won’t betray me, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m begging you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ask of you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During my free time, I decided to study magic a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At a later date, I heard that among humans, only one out of one hundred can use magic. It made me feel relaxed a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have not look from above. It made me feel relieved looking from the bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best to study magic.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Just before winter, a big disaster occurred in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A big roar rose from a place a bit far away from the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it some sort of gas explosion?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like several continuous explosion occurs after.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The tremor can even be felt in our village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I saw someone panicking like me so I felt a little relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is this vibration?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Grappler bear</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Grappler bear</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">So it’s a monster that looks like a bear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first time I came here, I already thought that there would be bears but I have forgotten about it since I never encountered one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, we can feel the tremor here even though it’s just moving around?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It might be fighting against someone.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fighting? With whom?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The only one that has the ability to fight a <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> head on is a <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>. It is almost winter so they are probably fighting for food before hibernating.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Viper</em>, a snake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Both of them are seriously fighting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How big is a <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> and <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Grappler bear</em> is about five to six meters while the <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em> is about 1 meter in diameter and has an average length of 20 meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Ria is answering my questions, Gran Maria arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> and a <em class="calibre5">bloody viper </em>are fighting in the north. What should we do?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if you ask me that…</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> and <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>, are they delicious?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh?….I haven’t tasted any of them yet.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After Gran Maria answer my question, I looked at Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I haven’t tasted them either but….considering they are treating each other as food, I think they are edible.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing Ria, I nod.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Indeed. They are probably edible. Then, let’s hunt them. It will be a problem if they come to this village and damage something.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took out the AFT and looked at the direction where the battle was happening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Gran Maria, can you carry me to the place where those two are?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can but…are we going with just the two of us?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah…is there a problem?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「N-no. I understand. I will do my utmost for this endeavor.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ria, can you call some to follow us on foot?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Affirmative. I will do it right away.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You don’t have to hurry. They will only carry the carcass.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Only to carry the carcass?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, it is pointless to hunt them if we can’t carry them back. I can carry one myself but it will be troublesome to carry two.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Jaa, Gran Maria, let’s go.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria grabbed me from behind and lifted me up in the sky. We headed in the direction where the commotion is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it looks like a decisive battle of monsters, it immediately ended after I swung the AFT on their neck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">AFT is really useful.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「The forest here is destroyed.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It should remain a forest.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nature is important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I plowed the ground until Ria’s group arrive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if my plowing speed has increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m done even before Ria’s group arrive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Jaa, I’ll bring back the big bear first. Tell Ria and the rest to take the snake home.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-yes. I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked Gran Maria to guard the snake and decided to go ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, which is the way back…. good thing I saw the incoming kuros and Kuudel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had the kuros guide me and left Kuudel with Gran Maria.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Kuudel, the <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> and <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>, are they weak monsters?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「According to my memory, no.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Were they defeated easily?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In an instant.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….as expected of Tier-sama’s husband.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「If he’s not like that, Lulushi probably won’t even look at him.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">I turn the AFT into its hook form so I didn’t get tired even though the distance is quite far. It took me two days to return to the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I might have asked Ria’s group something inexcusable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After arriving at the village, I went back to help Ria’s group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, wouldn’t it have been better if I cut them finely then have the angels transport them?</p>


<p class="calibre2">Bear meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not bad….but smelly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is edible, it consumes a lot of spices.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Snake meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I need some courage first before tasting it but it is not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has a light taste.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you don’t know that it’s a snake, you probably mistook it for chicken.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it tastes like chicken, I tried cooking it to a karaage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The villagers fight over it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Next time, let’s take the snake alone.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t say that, Zabuton-dono was pleased with the <em class="calibre5">grappler bear’s</em> fur.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The meat is also popular with the kuros.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, I was urged to hunt bears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’ll hunt it if I meet it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">lizardmen</em>‘s egg hatched.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The newly hatched hatchlings are swimming energetically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do they really hatch before winter?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does it mean that <em class="calibre5">lizardmen</em> don’t hibernate?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the reason why they hatch before winter is because the strong monsters are hibernating during that period.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if food is difficult to obtain during that time, are they a race that lived in a dangerous environment that they choose to run away from the enemy?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I want them to grow up energetically because they are born in this village.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-79"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 54 &ndash; Studying Geography During Winter</h1><p class="calibre2">Winter has come.<span id="calibre_link-152"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">We have no food problem this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I’m focusing on either my side job or studying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My side job is making small things made of woods and stones.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for studying, it is mostly about magic or the geography of the surrounding area.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides magic, I’m really interested in this place’s geography.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After conversing with the demon king’s envoy Beezel and Gulf of the Howling village, I feel embarrassed that I know nothing about the surrounding places.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Presently, our village is like in the center of a huge basin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The forest that stretches through this entire basin is called the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The size of the forest of death….the others are not too sure too but the high elves say that it will take them one month to cross from one end to the other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If their goal is just to cross it and won’t carry anything, they said that they can cross it in half month.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, thinking about the Gulf’s group of beastkins, they took them one month to come to this village from the foot of the west mountain. What should I consider as the standard?</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, it seems like the angels can cross over it at the sky within half a day.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It seems like Doraim’s nest is in the mountain range on the south of the forest of death. It is called mountain of dragons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the dragons live there, it is a peaceful place so there are those who chose to use that place as a pass.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beyond the mountain of dragons is another forest called Iron forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beyond the iron forest, further down south, Doraim said that there was a sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that there is a human town near the sea so I would like to go there for some shopping.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It seems like the demon king’s castle and castle town is beyond the western mountain of the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Castle town is usually the capital city of a country/territory. It is also usually named after the country/territory.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems to be a lively place. Should I talk to Beezel about me visiting that place?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the demon king’s territory spread like a circle around the castle. The human town in the south and the human town in the east are part of the demon king’s territory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing how the demon king’s territory spreads up to the castle on the west to the town on the east, it is obvious that the forest of death is under the demon king’s sphere of influence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Had he left it unattended because nobody had lived in this place until now?</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are currently at war with the human kingdom on the west side of the demon king’s sphere of influence. They are fighting against the Kingdom of Full Heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they are located on the west side of the demon king’s castle, I think that the possibility of this village being involved in that war is low.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the demon king’s territory is the demon king’s kingdom. It is named after the present demon king so it is called Demon King Gullgald’s Country.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Below is the image of the demon king. I can’t find a higher resolution image so I don’t know if I spelled his name correctly.</em></strong></p>
<div class="calibre6"><img src="images/000017.jpg" alt="" class="calibre7" /></div><p class="calibre2"></p>


<p class="calibre2">From the village’s point of view, the Howling village is on the mountain in the east.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Across that mountain is a human village called Tarotte village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Both of those villages are part of the demon king’s territory;y but it seems like both villages doesn’t have demons.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It seems like there are also small villages around Howling and Tarotte village but nobody knows the details.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the beastkin Senna heard about those villages from the villagers of Howling village, they only trade with them so she doesn’t know any details.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There seem to be something conspicuous in the mountain in the north and the mountain beyond that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that nobody can travel to that place during winter and will be difficult to thread to even during summer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are rumors that something dangerous is sealed in that place since the ancient times but nobody knows the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please stay as a rumor.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, if one wants to go to the Howling village in the east from the demon king’s castle, they would have to head south, travel along the coast, then go north.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that that was one hell of a detour but it seems like nobody would like to pass through the forest of death, or the mountain of dragons, or even the iron forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What are they being cautious of?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, and Flora managed to come here alone. Even the the onis and the <em class="calibre5">lizardmen </em>successfully came here too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Where was Ria’s village located?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is located to a place beyond the mountain northwest from here. It is in the forest north of the demon king’s castle.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Where did Loo came from?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Galbart Kingdom. It is a country north of Full Heart Kingdom.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hee」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I was living there alone before until the human’s came.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….I will not ask for your age.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s very wise of you. Tier and the other angels came from further north of the Galbart Kingdom.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s right. However, angels are usually working independently. We are only using that place to communicate with each other.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Angels are famous and they are a mysterious race.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There was a time that they became a subject of worship.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Those people worship us by themselves. We did not ask them to do so.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I also heard that you are collecting donations.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s….we also need to have a proper life.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they have it hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Anyway, I now have a rough understanding. Of names of places…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. Please do your best to remember them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I studied continuously during winter.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Something special happened during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it is cold, a dwarf came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Un, I think that it is an exaggeration to call this place forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One can come and go as they please.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「I heard there is a good wine here. Will you let me drink some?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「As long as you pay for it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Ria who received him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is bad, I don’t have money. However, I have knowledge.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re a blacksmith?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, I’m a wine brewer.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….so the compensation of drinking wine is a method of making wine?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「From what I heard, the wine you make here is made of grapes. I know a method to make wine from something else other than grapes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarf grins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If the wine here is delicious, I’ll even consider settling here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good. I’ll accept your challenge. Give this person wine!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The number of residents increased by one.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Areh? I can’t find the right words to say.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it no good?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, that’s not it….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, there is no problem. Please stay in this inn this winter. There will be a welcome party tonight. The preparations are ongoing. Please greet the village chief immediately as soon as it starts.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….a-affirmative」</p>
<p class="calibre2">During winter, there are few events so the residents did not miss this opportunity to drink.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Things that started this winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is warm inside but cold outside the house so I don’t want to go out as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others think so too so everyone is doing something indoors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Silence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, it is difficult to continue playing just those all this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone is playing the thing I made before, chess and <em class="calibre5">reversi</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, everyone is participating in the new <em class="calibre5">mini bowling</em> I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s not easy to make it straight.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why can’t I hit that pin?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Kuh….there were three left.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I neither know the lane size nor the pin size. I made them smaller than what I remember since the indoor space for playing is limited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a wooden lane with 1 meter in width and 10 meters in length. The pins are made of wood too. I made them from tree branches.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What’s the point of knocking them down?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that simple question, I carved faces on the pins and made them look like an evil person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It won’t be good if all of them looks the same so I changed each and put some identity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ball is a curved stone sphere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it is difficult to make a hole that one can put their fingers to, I made it into the size of a softball to make it easier to roll.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though my goal is to have them do some light exercise, it is good that the villagers love it.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「I can’t knock down that murderer on the right no matter what I do!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I think hitting the pyromaniac on the left is more difficult.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, I almost hit them all if not for that fraudster. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was so popular that I made six lanes this winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We should make a dedicated building for this. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was decided that when the spring comes, a new building will be created in the pretext of recreation hall.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, the <em class="calibre5">mini bowling</em> is not the only thing I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first thing I made is <em class="calibre5">darts</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a target then I thought about the things that need to be thrown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After thinking about it, I made knives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather than <em class="calibre5">darts</em>, I think we should call it <em class="calibre5">knife </em>throw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried throwing it but it only scratches the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I got fired up and continued but it was useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I took some rest and during that time, the high elves said that they wanted to try. They hit it continuously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There’s no problem even if the distance is further. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, they were living in the forest so I guess they will not able to live that long if they can’t do that much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The onis also tried and they also hit it continuously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why not make the target a humanoid? It will be a good practice. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lizardmen also hit it continuously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’re better using spears compared to <em class="calibre5">knife</em>…. I almost didn’t hit the center. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">My heart broke down when I saw a drunk dwarf hit it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Because of that event, I made the <em class="calibre5">mini bowling</em> but I was not able to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My score in <em class="calibre5">mini bowling</em> is low.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, make more <em class="calibre5">ball.</em>」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Make a new bandit pin please.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, make a monster<em class="calibre5"> series</em> first.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, I am devoted to making tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps this is my escape.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-98"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 55 &ndash; Dwarf</h1><p class="calibre2">The name of the dwarf who came to the village is Donovan.<span id="calibre_link-153"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">He is not an ordinary dwarf but an elder dwarf. That said, I don’t know the difference.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He had a barrel-like body figure like in the story I heard. Bulky hand and feet and thick beards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His height is about the same as mine but because he has a big face, he looks small.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, this Donovan,</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is a male.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll say it again, he’s a male.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, he’s an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, this village’s long-awaited adult male!</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A female without beard is….I am not a <em class="calibre5">lolicon</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「……」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cultural barrier is thicker than expected.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「For the time being, let’s make wine using barley and corn from this place. The crops here are good so it will definitely be a good wine.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. Then, is it better to increase the production material volume?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, at least twice as many…no, twice then double.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked at how Ria consults Donovan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it really good to expand the field that much?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think they are only thinking of increasing the production of wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You guys are also the one who asked me to increase the vineyard for <em class="calibre5">wine </em>production.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Okay, I’ll expand it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You don’t need to pressure me.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「This is amazing.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uhn, delicious.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cooking research is done by the onis and I also work with them from time to time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I said that it is a cooking research, we’re just reproducing the food from my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, I recall something about <em class="calibre5">wine</em> simmering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, I don’t know anything about cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a trial and error research. I just boiled something with <em class="calibre5">wine</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While boiling meat with <em class="calibre5">wine</em>, I seasoned with onions and others to add some flavor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rough but I think the end product isn’t bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The review of the others is not bad either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But thinking that the consumption of <em class="calibre5">wine</em> will further increase, I became anxious and lost my appetite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh…..</p>

<p class="calibre2">I feel like the obsession with alcohol of the villagers is too strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I decided to make the <em class="calibre5">wine</em> simmering dish a luxurious dish that can only be served to guests.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The spring has come.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As usual, I plowed the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am requested to expand the field for barley, corn, and even the vineyard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I expanded the field size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am now accustomed to plowing so I plowed faster than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, it still took me 20 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the former 256 fields, 16 by 16, it is now 512, 16 by 32 fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I extended it to the south….moving to the edge has really become troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I mean, from edge to edge, it’s a whole 1,600 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll just think of it as a good exercise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The vineyard is now 128 fields compared to the previous 64.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Barley and cornfields for wine are 32 fields each.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The rest are various crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A notable point is that I greatly increased the sesame field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because I recalled that I can use sesame to make oil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently, our oils came from rapeseeds and olives but I think that it would be good if we have different kinds of oils.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Plowing the field is something only I can do since it needs the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others do the other job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros hunt in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m worried that the rabbits in the forest will be extinct.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiders and making clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A new design has come out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves are repairing buildings that are damaged during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are also building Donovan’s house and the recreational hall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, they are also building Doraim’s villa.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The woods used to construct all of those buildings are from the deforested area from the field expansion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The trees around here are difficult to cut down and process but it’s a good thing that I have the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The onis are cooking and cleaning the houses and the streets as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like dirt has accumulated during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lizardmen are taking care of the cows and chicken as well as maintaining the waterways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastkins are processing the crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Threshing, milling, oil extraction, sugar making, salt making, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarves are making wine….areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarf increased?</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Wilcox」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Cross, nice to meet you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ehto….</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what I heard, they followed Donovan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And are going to settle here too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was decided before I knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The crops here are good. It’s really surprising.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, they are delicious even if you eat them raw.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible for a bad person to praise my crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Welcome to the Big Tree village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is important for Loo to be taken care of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier and Flora are doing what they should do while helping Loo in her daily life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The angels are flying around cautiously as usual.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I am worried about the future of farming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, we can harvest several times a year but it is all thanks to the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I again express my gratitude to the god who gave it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, the village has no problem with food to eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I thought of something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What will happen if there is no AFT?</p>
<p class="calibre2">And what will happen to the village if something happens to me or if I can no longer use the AFT?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since my sense of crisis is tingling, I thought that we should try farming using ordinary tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crops on the field plowed by the AFT grows 4 times faster in a suitable environment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Planting crops that came from the crops planted using the AFT in another field makes the growth rate same as an ordinary crop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, the same as the normal crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, we need to pay attention to the season before raising it or it will not grow well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, they will not grow in a place that has never been plowed with the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because the soil of the forest is unsuitable for raising crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, if I can find a place where normal wheat can grow, I think that the wheat from our field can grow there too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These are the results of the experiments I tried until now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will take time and labor and the harvested amount will be reduced too but it is possible to farm even if there is no AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to try something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, I have prepared a small field where others can practice plowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The main participants are the high elves, the lizardmen, and the beastkins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told them that they are free to choose what they want to raise and whatever they raise is theirs alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crops they raised are mainly raw materials for making wine.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/HXzrGSm/u39-6ffac41f-f425-4673-ae09-92d12c62aa74.jpg">

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-15"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 56 &ndash; About the Food and Beverage</h1><p class="calibre2">There are two reasons why the dragon Doraim comes to this village: food and wine.<span id="calibre_link-154"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Those two. The villagers are also full of praises to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I, who retained my memory from my previous world, don’t think about them that much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The food is not delicious enough and the wine is sweet.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Regarding the food, there are a lot of things from my previous world that are can’t be found here so the quality is not that much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if we have the ingredients, seasonings, and cooking utensils, without the knowledge on how to make them, we are helpless on what should be done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a good thing that we can cook rice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, I told the onis about different kind of cooking methods and what will be the end result, method on how to season foods, etc. and have them research about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being praised as an accomplished cook is somewhat embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is mainly because I feel like my demand is unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I don’t want to compromise on food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am doing my best so I expect everyone to do the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, they were able to cook<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donburi" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> donburi</a> type dishes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is great when combined with rice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, since we have ceramic ware now, we can individually season our own food on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of seasoning, we manage to make <em class="calibre5">mayonnaise</em> thus, a cooking revolution occurred in the village.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The important raw material of <em class="calibre5">mayonnaise </em>is eggs and vinegar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you for the eggs, chickens!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am afraid of <em class="calibre5">salmonella</em> so I have to sterilize the eggs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But we don’t have any disinfectant to use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I’m troubled, I usually consult Loo. I confirmed the existence of some sort of drug that can be used on the eggs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora made it. Thanks for your hard work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo can make it too but she’s pregnant so I don’t want her to go near to such things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I don’t know what sort of ingredients they have in there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next is vinegar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I thought that when <em class="calibre5">wine</em> became older, it will turn to vinegar but I guess I was wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next plan, I heard that Japanese sake making can produce vinegar too so I tried that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The result was good and because of that, I challenged <em class="calibre5">mayonnaise</em> making and it went well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it will be mixed with vinegar, I think that it is not necessary to sterilize the eggs but I have to emphasize safety.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, does <em class="calibre5">salmonella</em> exist in this world?</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not mind about the details.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mayonnaise has become everyone’s favorite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it can be used with various dishes, I smiled because the flavor has expanded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next thing I want is seafood.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Regarding the wine, the main problem is that everyone drinks too much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They can’t appeal to sleep with me when they’re drunk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does this mean that they don’t have much endurance?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a good thing that we expanded the fields of crops that will be used for winemaking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now I can sleep in peace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope so.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In addition to wine, we also made juice, tea, and <em class="calibre5">coffee</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is the result of the research of something else to drink besides wine and water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The purpose is to reduce the consumption of wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the villagers did not consume them that much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The squeezed fruit juice is mainly consumed by beastkins since they are still too young to drink. There are high elves and onis that became tea and <em class="calibre5">coffee</em> lovers. However, their numbers are too low.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, the demon Beezel took a liking to the tea and brought a large amount of them that can last until winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like an annual spring event, the horns of the kuros fell, the bees made a new hive, and the spiderlings set off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That reminds me, what happened to the 30 kuros who went out last year?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope they are safe….</p>
<p class="calibre2">That moment, the 30 of them returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone is full of injuries and they looked like they have overcome a trial since they have this dignified countenance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know what they have done but since they are safe, I guess it’s okay. After staying for several days, they took several spiderlings on their back and leave again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What exactly are they doing?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope they’re not doing anything strange…</p>


<p class="calibre2">I made a building request for a bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, I used the bath made by me and the high elves and it is also used by every villager.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is basically a mixed-bath but since I’m the only adult male and the other male are kids, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as there are now male dwarves living in the village, I requested a separate bathhouse for males.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there are more females than males in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since that is the case, the newly constructed bathhouse will be for female use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s not a bad argument.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m anxious about mixed bathing so I can’t use it when I wanted to use it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hence, the current bath will be for males and the new bath will be for females.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it was countered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they build a female only bath, the time the females can appeal to me will be reduced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, you can have enough contact with me outside. Why does it have to be in the bath?</p>

<p class="calibre2">As a result, the current bath will be for my exclusive use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those who want to do something can bathe with me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">New male only and female only bath will be constructed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking that I can use the bath peacefully, I thought that it is a good thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think I can take care of that amount of water alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as the bath increases, I worry about the <em class="calibre5">fuel </em>consumption.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bath unexpectedly consumes a lot of firewoods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though we are in the middle of a forest, I’m hesitant to use a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll think of another alternative fuel for baths.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking about it, I thought of heating water using magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like those who can use fire magic are the ones who need to cooperate on heating the water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is the specialty of the beastkins and it will also serve as practice for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do your best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using magic is more convenient and faster than manually boiling water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How convenient is it if I can do that too?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll study magic har….No no, I don’t have talent in magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll leave it to those who can.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There was a plea about the trees planted in the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The petitioner is a bee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bee reported it to a spiderling and the spiderling conveyed it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t talk with the spiderling but we somehow able to communicate with gesture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it wants to plant a tree from the forest to the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the trees in the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em> are adequate for them, it seems like the queen bee is the one demanding for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it is not harmful, I have no problem with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I have no problem with it, it’s not like we can transfer that tree here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can plant any tree using the AFT but I need to know what kind of tree it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the tree in question can’t be found nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, they asked for my permission to enter the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They want to find the tree in question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiderlings seem to know the tree that the bees asked for.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With them looking for it in the forest, it will be found right away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiderlings went into the forest while riding at the back of the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They found it immediately and came back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They’ll guide me into that place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We returned right away because I asked Gran Maria to carry me.</p>



<p class="calibre2">And, I planted the new tree right away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also expanded the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, the cows are on the east side of the fruit area so I expanded it to the west.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I doubled the size of the fruit <em class="calibre5">area </em>so it is now 8 by 8 fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The tree the bees asked is a short flowery tree that I’ve seen for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it seems like it can bore fruit, I planted a lot of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, I also planted rubber trees, aloe, palms, and others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I expanded the size of the fruit <em class="calibre5">area</em>, I left enough space for other people in case they want to plant trees too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first stage is complete.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Before I noticed it, I became a father.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s fast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, I don’t even recall any memory mine during Loo’s labor until the time I was about to embrace my child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I might have panicked back then.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I am relieved that my child was born safely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s a healthy baby boy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it alright for me to become a father?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, it’s too late to ask that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to work hard for my newly born child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, there was a banquet in our village and it lasted for several days.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-34"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 57 &ndash; My Son’s Birth and Raid</h1><p class="calibre2">My son’s name is Alfred.<span id="calibre_link-155"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">He was named by Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She rejected the names I suggested.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m anxious if my son will be sick since he’s half otherworlder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I received “healthy body” from god but will my son also have such divine protection?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since there is no way for me to know, I had no choice but to pray.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want him to grow up healthily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, since he’s the child between me and the vampire Loo, what is his race?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there a race called <em class="calibre5">half vampire</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried asking Loo but she said that this is the first time she gave birth and she doesn’t know of any vampire who gave birth before so she doesn’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at my son, he’s no different from any other human.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the onis, it seems like racial characteristic will show up as one grows older.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To the onis, it is their horn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During their infancy, it is not noticeable but it will grow slowly as they grow old.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Certainly, it will be troublesome if they already have a horn when they are born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if my son is like that too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m worried, there’s nothing I can do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whether he is a human or a vampire, it won’t change the fact that he is Loo and my child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best to raise you.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After giving birth, Loo has no particular problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though as expected, her character changed after she gave birth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably because she’s a mother now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I am happy because both mother and child are healthy.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Regarding child care, the onis took the initiative so there is no lack in helping hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, you can even say that there are too many helping hands that Loo and I can’t get our turn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to do my job as a father too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m motivated to do something new.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason? We now know where the 30 kuros went.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The 30 kuros + 30 spiderlings were capturing a <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> southwest of the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a dangerous thing to do.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The entrance of the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> was discovered by Gran Maria by chance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though that place is distant from the village, if the<em class="calibre5"> dungeon</em> was left alone, rogue monsters will overflow. Because of that, we organized a group that will be led by the high elves to check the condition inside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also appeal to participate but all of the villagers rejected it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou, <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> exploration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My adventurous spirit is tingling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the <em class="calibre5">dungeon </em>capture group were checking their equipments at the<em class="calibre5"> dungeon</em> entrance, the kuros, with spiderlings riding on their back, came out of the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, they explored the<em class="calibre5"> dungeon</em> with the kuros. It turns out that the kuros are capturing the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> all these time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they are exploring the dungeon on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Never thought that the kuros has such a habit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the spiderlings are accompanying the kuros are in charge of places where the four-legged kuros can’t go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the high elves collected the bones of monsters in the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> which are probably beaten down by the kuros and put them in the warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m thinking why they would bring home bones but it seems like they can be used and are valuable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the high elves have returned, the kuros seems to continue exploring the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You should come home from time to time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A sudden incident happens.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is early in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s warning resounded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The direction is south.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is something flying in the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another wyvern?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I recalled the previous attack, my anger resurfaced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flying object is heading straight here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I instinctively know that its target is this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And judging from its speed, it is not a friendly visit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I turned the AFT into its spear form and took a throwing posture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll pierce you down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was about to release the AFT, I saw another flying object.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That other flying object is Doraim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no mistake since I have seen his dragon form many times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to Doraim, the flying object heading towards here is half his size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I realized now that it is not a wyvern but a dragon-like Doraim with a different color.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon hits Doraim’s body but it is a good thing that Doraim managed to stay in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it is battling with Doraim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For a moment, I thought of letting Doraim handle it but it seems like Doraim is losing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I help him?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was about to throw my spear, I suddenly felt a strong bloodlust behind them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s coming from that direction.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I turned a little and threw my spear to the source of the bloodlust.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In that direction, there was a pure white dragon that’s about slightly larger than Doraim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that my spear will pierce through the dragon but it managed to evade before I hit it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What kind of evasion is that? It lost is posture and almost fell on its own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A <em class="calibre5">chance</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I prepared to throw the second time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But when I was about to throw my spear, I was interrupted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「P-please wait a moment! She’s not an enemy!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Doraim’s servant, Gucci. He stands and spreads both of his hand in front of me.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, there are three man and women in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim, a beautiful blonde woman, and a beautiful blonde young lady which seems to be their daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are two splendid dragon horns on the daughter’s head and a big dragon tail underneath her skirt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is my wife Gurafaroon and my daughter Rasutisumoon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Doraim’s explanation, the first flying object that came towards here is his daughter Rasutisumoon and the dragon who came later is his wife Gurafaroon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I am unaware so let me apologize.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I really should.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I just threw a spear aiming at Doraim’s wife.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I, I’m really sorry. I have done something that leads to a misunderstanding….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The daughter Rasutisumoon bowed while hiding behind Doraim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her voice also sounds frightened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How cute of her?</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Doraim is full of injuries because of her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I have made an inadvertent approach too. I am sorry. It was simply because I wanted to protect my daughter and husband…please laugh at this stupid woman.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I did not laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s consider this matter as settled because both of us committed mistakes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m sorry for the <em class="calibre5">trouble</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Doraim, it all started when his daughter suspected that he’s cheating when she heard that he has a house in Big Tree village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, she thought that the birthday<em class="calibre5"> present</em> that Doraim prepared for Alfred was a gift for his cheating partner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim denied but his daughter did not believe his and went straight to the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like she wants to burn this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll <em class="calibre5">mark </em>her daughter as a dangerous person in my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I, I’m sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a good thing that she obediently apologized….it will be troublesome if she’s too aggressive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim chased her daughter who’s heading for this village and used his body to stop her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was supposed to end there but Doraim’s wife was informed about what’s had happened between Doraim and their daughter and came here at full speed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In that case, why did she came here with strong bloodlust….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s love.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’ll <em class="calibre5">mark</em> her as a dangerous person too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the wife’s killing intent, most of the kuros, spiderlings, high elves, lizardmen, and onis panicked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those who were able to endure it took a while before calming the others down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s no damage but the kuros are looking at Doraim’s wife with their tail down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiderlings don’t even dare to approach her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I forgot it because Doraim is friendly, dragons are really strong creatures.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it because of her strong mother?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alfred seems to be sleeping in peace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’ll surely grow into a great man.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Daughter, I want you to believe in me a bit more.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「But…..」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I already have Gurafaroon so I’ll definitely not cheat. If by any chance, I cheat…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you cheat…?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m too frightened to think. Daughter, remember this, your father doesn’t have guts to cheat!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「O-okay」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Also, didn’t I tell you a long time ago….did you get now why I said that we can’t be hostile with this village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, that attack breaks through all of mother’s barrier…and it was directed to me first, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…….that was dangerous.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really dangerous. I’m glad that you’re fine.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father」</p>


<p class="calibre2">「It’s good that you made up but you have not forgotten about me, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「U-umu. As expected of Gurafaroon. When you were attacked, I was really frightened.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A kind spider has just rescued me. I never thought that that attack can fierce my barrier, shield, and wall in a dash without any resistance. I was not thinking of evading that time.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A kind spider?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「An old friend of mine. She pulled my body when I was about to get hit. Otherwise, I will not be standing here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Gurafaroon…..」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Rasti, Doraim has a house in this village. You will live there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mother? Why?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That offensive ability, we can’t leave it alone. I won’t ask you to restrain him from using it but I want you to have him not point it to any dragon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「E-ehto…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Your answer?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-yes! I’ll do my best!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, the number of residents increased without me knowing.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-53"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 58 &ndash; Rasuti</h1><p class="calibre2">Doraim’s daughter, Rasutisumoon.<span id="calibre_link-156"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone calls her Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When in her dragon form, she’s about 15 meters but when in human form, she looks like a junior high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She has a long blonde hair and looks well refined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She gives the vibe of either a student council president or a disciplinary committee chairman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suspecting her father of cheating and acting immediately afterwards, she has a strong personality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During the first time I saw her, she’s wearing a dress that can be worn at a <em class="calibre5">party</em>. Now that she’s living in the village, she now looks like a village girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps she’s the type of person that changes her outward appearance according to the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, no matter what clothes she wears, her dragon horns and tail still stands out.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Rasuti has adapted here quickly.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is the effect of something worth their time like the foods and entertainments here. Dragons are basically free.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So that’s the reason why Doraim always comes here?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Rasuti eats all kinds of food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And she seems to like them a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she eats something for the first time, she’ll repeatedly say “Father, unfair.”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When it comes to fruits, she prefers sweet rather than sour.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She especially loves dried persimmon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Only this much remains….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">She said that while standing at the entrance of a warehouse with a face full of despair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s a few of them to begin with and a lot of dried persimmons are consumed during winter, however, I think it’s still enough for everyone.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Rasuti enjoys <em class="calibre5">reversi, mini bowling,</em> and chess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But she’s not that skillful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She always plays with the beastboys.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You’ll notice if she wins or loses with her expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she’s outside, she occasionally plays with the kuros with catching the <em class="calibre5">flying disc</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She can’t win against the four-legged kuros in her human form but when she’s on her dragon form, she’s always victorious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps she’s more childish than what she looks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros complained to me that it’s unfair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, even if you complain to me….</p>


<p class="calibre2">At first, I was planning to treat Rasuti as a guest but Doraim and his wife told me to give her something to do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know what kind of things she can do so I had her do some various things.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Even though she’s young, she’s still a dragon so had her hunt but she can’t catch anything because the prey won’t show up when she’s around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of mining so I had her dig but she can’t do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The chickens and cows are scared of her so she can’t take care of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had her do some housework but she has no experience at all so it only increased the workload of those around her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for farming….crops are important so I can’t let her approach them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Conclusion, she’s an ojousama that can’t do anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, she came from a combat oriented race.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had her guard the village like the angels since she has an astonishing war potential.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Rasuti’s job has been decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Diplomat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She was able to meet and negotiate with guests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The guest is the demon king’s envoy, Beezel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His purpose is not only buying crops but also to investigate the matter of Rasuti rampaging earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, if there’s no problem then it’s good. Ah, do you still have the yellow fruits before? We consumed it all during winter.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it the mandarin orange? Though we still have stock….we don’t have that much since the season has just started. Since it is spring, how about strawberries?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Strawberries?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. They are sweet and sour and if you dip them to sugar or milk, they’ll be tastier. Of course, they’re delicious enough as they are.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good. Then I’ll take 10 boxes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about sugar or milk too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re right. I’ll have both of them too.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much. As for the charge with discount….it is around this much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Since there’s a discount shouldn’t it be around this much….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then how about this much….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised that I can’t find the trace of the short-tempered dragon who came to this village to burn it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it something she got from her father?</p>


<p class="calibre2">In addition, she uses several small wyverns of about 1 meter in height as messengers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, we kept in touch with the demon king’s castle, the Howling village, and Doraim….</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lizardmen are taking care of the small wyverns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There are 20 of them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It doesn’t matter whether they are 1 or 20, leave it to us.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hardest part of raising the wyverns are making sure that they won’t attack the cows and chickens and making sure that they won’t be attacked by the kuros and spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are they bullied?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, they see them as prey.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Anyway, I’ll request them to not attack wyverns with collars.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">Do your best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Daughter, are you doing well? If you need anything, don’t hesitate to tell me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m doing great, why are you coming here frequently? You just came here 10 days ago.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s okay, I left Gucci there. Oi, give me the usual.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">In response to Doraim, the oni working at Rasuti’s house begins preparing food and wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Oh, have you tried the bath? Awesome, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, however, I find it hard to use since there are a lot of other users.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah…might be because it’s the female bath. The men’s bath is spacious. Even Gucci goes there every time he came here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father, unfair.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, you probably know now why I had a house build for me here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. By the way, when will you send me servants? Though I’m being taken care of by the onis, I’m only borrowing them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I already ordered Gucci to choose a suitable person. However, there has been trouble.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are they dissatisfied working under me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, it’s the opposite. Since everyone knows how good the food here, we are flooded with applicants. Even Gucci said he will go.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand how he feels but father will be troubled if Gucci left.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. In any case, I’ll send one as soon as possible.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Demon king’s castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Where’s Beezel? Didn’t he returned?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes but he immediately went to his house.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Not his chamber?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, he is in a hurry for some reason. Ah, the souvenirs are here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. Excellent. However, what is Beezel’s urgent business? It would be great if it’s not because of any problem…」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-72"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 59 &ndash; Fraurem</h1><p class="calibre2">My name is Fraurem Chrome.<span id="calibre_link-157"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Member of the Count Chrome’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My father is Beezel Climb Chrome, one of the demon king-sama’s executive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So far, I have been an active friend of the princess in Graizen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I’m not a self-proclaimed friend.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We are classmates in a school established by demon king-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, my school record is excellent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can put me anywhere and I’ll definitely standout. Even my military arts and actual combat ability are above average.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And if something were to threaten my life, the princess will surely protect me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the future, I am expected to be an active aide of the princess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, even if I don’t say it myself, my look is above average.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it might be better to say that I’m beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not self-conceit but an actual fact.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I’m such a wonderful person, being flooded with marriage proposal is a matter of fact.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They shouldn’t propose to me directly though. They should apply to our house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s how it should be.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am not the one who’ll decide who should I marry. Father will be the one to decide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not dreaming of marrying the man I desire too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am resolved to marry father’s choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I want father to decide my partner soon since there are a lot of candidates to choose from. However, father seems to be hesitating because of various things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m glad that he’s doing his best to find his daughter a good partner but if you don’t decide my partner soon, the eyes around will be really anxious.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, I am….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suddenly ordered by father to go to a certain village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked if my marriage partner will be at that place fearfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What should I do after arriving at that village?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can I even stop going to school?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does that mean that I will no longer have ties with the princess?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ano, father?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why are we flying at night?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Father also doesn’t laugh with my joke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, he looked at me with a serious face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’re flying tonight because there is no moon and I don’t want to alert anyone….this matter will greatly influence the fate of the demon king’s kingdom. Bear it in mind.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh-ehto….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Father looks tired.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, every time he comes home, he always complains to mother about work and colleagues endlessly. I’m sure I can’t measure his anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing a hint of insanity in father’s eyes, it seems like a good idea to not go against him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll accompany you for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is regrettable to leave both the school and the princess but that place was boring.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’m glad that I can showcase my talent there but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like our destination is a village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t expect much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I control it as I like?</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Nice to meet you. I am Rasutisumoon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to change clothes as soon as we arrived at the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it will affect my dignity, I can’t say the reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ehto….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why am I greeted by a dragon right away…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, it’s Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s the daughter of the gatekeeper dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The citizens of demon king territory all know that she’s a dragon to watch out for.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s like a mad dog that will attack anyone who’ll meet her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I met her, I have no choice but to change my clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was thinking about our meeting….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I saw high elves in the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The forest <em class="calibre5">guerilla</em>. They are a violent group of people that are also called <em class="calibre5">man-eater</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They live in the forest and kidnap men from nearby villages.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the high elves who live in the forest of death and iron forest are the fiercest one man army.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, I am meeting those who live in the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My knees began to crumble but I managed to persevere and greeted them with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to praise myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But wait, there’s more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A flock of <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I’m really going to die.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought that father would give me as a sacrifice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You’re cruel, father.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I changed my clothes again, Rasutisumoon told me that they won’t harm me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything here is under the rule of Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>, they are at the upper echelon of the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are atrocious wolves that are capable of destroying a town alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And here….there are countless of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also confirmed the existence of the special mutated species called <em class="calibre5">cocytus wolf</em>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I will just think that this is a valuable experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, no matter how much I think that way, my brain couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they really under control?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some inferno wolves are pulling Rasutisumoon’s skirt in a playful manner.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Yes, I saw another one to watch out for.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Demon spider</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I met its <em class="calibre5">stun bash</em> head on and fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“<em class="calibre5">Stun bash</em>” is a racial ability of <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em>. It is a mental attack that will affect those who see it for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I was not eaten when I fainted, the <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em> is harmless too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the third time I changed my clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if it’s better not to wear underwear already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To think that she has placed the apex of the forest of death, the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>, under her…Rasutisumoon is a frightening existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please, keep them under your control.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I beg you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is only one word capable of describing the <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em>, fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And there are a lot of spiderlings here.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Shadow spider, car spider, drow spider, trap spider, death spider</em>, neck hanging <em class="calibre5">spider</em>….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every one of them is larva of a <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em> but even if they are still larva, they are fearful existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are countless of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I thought about what would happen if they are released in the demon king’s country…. I froze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I should erase it from my memory.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Now, after seeing the <em class="calibre5">demon spider’s</em> family, I’m not surprised seeing a <em class="calibre5">Gnostic bee</em> hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am not surprised but I didn’t say that I am not scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Gnostic Bee.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">They are monsters that collects honey from flowers like ordinary bees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, their honey’s price is off the roof.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason? It is the best tasting honey of course but soldier bees are protecting the <em class="calibre5">gnostic bee’s</em> hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Soldier <em class="calibre5">gnostic bees</em> are ferocious and said that even inferno wolves don’t approach their hive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, in order to get <em class="calibre5">gnostic bee</em> honey, you should have the fighting power to annihilate all soldier bees first…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Aiming for Gnostic bee’s honey” is used as an idiomatic expression that refers to dreamer, delusionist, or a person drowned with greed that is willing to do dangerous things to get what they desire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One must not desire <em class="calibre5">gnostic bee’s</em> honey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if someone put it in a jar and place it in front of you….you still shouldn’t want it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I never expect seeing it at tomorrow’s breakfast.</p>



<p class="calibre2">I let my guard down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like I was overwhelmed by the <em class="calibre5">gnostic bee’s</em> honey.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shouldn’t have relaxed at this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before me are four angels.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every one of them are angels with titles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Angel of annihilation Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Angels of holocaust Gran Maria, Kuudel, and Corone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they are not as dangerous as Rasutisumoon, they are cunning angels that need to watch out for.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it seems like my luck is good, I don’t need to change my clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably because nothing seems to be that appealing anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From where I am, I can see that they are having a friendly conversation with Rasutisumoon so I judge that there is no danger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please, let it be like that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was wishing for that, someone came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bloodsucking princess Lulushi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that she’s the eternal rival of the angel of annihilation Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they are rival, she’s naturally as dangerous as Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was wary that a magical battle will suddenly begin but that didn’t happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are happily talking about what’s going to be their dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was them being rivals only a rumor?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it is these four angels and the bloodsucking princess, they might be a good match against Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That means….it is dangerous to obey only Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a troublesome higher ups composition.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I will survive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I saw the vampire Flora too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasutisumoon is probably on a lower seat because of the four angels and two vampires.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, since Rasutisumoon is here, the gatekeeper Doraim will surely meddle with her affair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That must be it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I continue to think.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….given the number of <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>, they can overwhelm the angels and vampires.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em> alone can fight against the angels and vampires too…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Rasutisumoon is the one controlling them, my best choice is with Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the depths of my heart is shouting that choosing her is dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After that, I met rare races like oni, lizardman, and elder dwarf but I’m not surprised anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not like I can do anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to the beastkin children, I’m healed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their tail is mofumofu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The slimes, cows, and chickens healed me too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My heart calms down.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After being guided around the village, I returned to the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will be living here until my house is ready.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not expect a good room given the scale of this village but I was surprised that it is really good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially the fabrics like the sheets. It is of the highest quality and is something rare even in our house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The foods are something I’ve never seen before and they are really delicious. The wine is good too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was dissatisfied having needed to use the bath with others but the experience of using it exceeds my dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything’s so good so far.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I don’t know the intention of my father by making me live here but I won’t collect information yet. I don’t want to make an enemy with anyone for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do what I can tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it has already grown dark, the village is still active. They are using oil generously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is Rasutisumoon still awake?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasutisumoon…should I add sama?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or should I call her Rasuti like everyone else?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll ask for her permission first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I want to meet Rasutisumoon and consult her regarding some things for tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Human over there. Guide me to the place where Rasutisumoon-san stays.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I failed.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I should have thought about things carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it makes sense that I talk that way since I am a noble’s daughter and my father has a high status on the demon king’s territory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are few people that can be said to be higher than me, like the leader of this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I was convinced that I would never be able to meet the leader of this village without permission.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s a mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To think that my first greeting with him is ordering him to do something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I haven’t realized that Rasutisumoon was doing her job for the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The apex of this village is not Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The apex of this village is the village chief as his title implies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A human village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After guiding me to where Rasutisumoon resides, Rasutisumoon told who that man is with a serious face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That human is the village chief. He took Loo and Tier as his wives. He is also the master of the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em> and <em class="calibre5">demon spiders</em> and the high elves and the others are his attendants. He is also my father’s friend and my mother wants to avoid any kind of hostility with him. I don’t know what you demons are trying to achieve but I ask you to not involve us dragons.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I, as a noble’s daughter, died that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am now reborn as a faithful servant of the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: If you are still thinking why she had to change clothes a number of times, I’ll give you a one letter clue “P”.</em></strong></p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-92"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 60 &ndash; Beezel’s Daughter and Slime</h1><p class="calibre2">Beezel’s daughter is going to live in the village from now on.<span id="calibre_link-158"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since she’s not someone we need to guard against, we treat her as an ordinary migrant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would have preferred if the one who migrated is a son and not a daughter….</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, it is his daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s a demon but looking at her, she’s no different from a human.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only heard that demons possess a higher quantity of magical power compared to humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was worried if she will be able to fit in with the citizens of our village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since she seems to be on the same generation as Rasuti, I left her to her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of greeting her that night so when I went to the inn and found out that she’s getting along with Rasuti, I’m relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My mind is now at peace.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Let’s talk about the slime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier brought 17 slimes here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They worked hard as the purifier of<em class="calibre5"> toilets</em> and sewage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know when their numbers started to increase but I saw them moving around the village one day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I even see them from time to time at the mouth of the kuros. It seems like they are forcing their way there even though that place is off limits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are selfishly moving to where dirty water is and they never left anything dirty untouched. So far, they never caused any troubles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The current number of slimes is unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But their number obviously exceeds 100.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, these slimes….</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Tier brought them here, all of them were blue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now there are different colors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are the green <em class="calibre5">green slime</em>, the yellow <em class="calibre5">yellow slime</em>, and the red <em class="calibre5">red slime</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their difference is not only their color but the magic they can use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though their numbers are few, we also have the black <em class="calibre5">black slime</em>, and the white <em class="calibre5">holy slime</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those two are very rare and the lizardmen cherish them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, since they are not doing anything wrong I guess there’s no problem.</p>


<p class="calibre2">That’s what &nbsp;I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A problem arose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A slime crawls in a barrel of wine and drank all the wines inside. It turned into a purple slime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it be right to call it wine slime?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its unique feature, it reeks of alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its special skill, wine breath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to leave it as it is but I can’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because majority of the villagers who love wine are furious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our village held our very first trial.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The result is a unanimous “guilty”.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Now its punishment is being discussed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it really stole and drank a barrel of wine so there is no way I can protect it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What will be its punishment…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Capital punishment, death penalty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone suggested cooking it since it might taste like wine. The eyes of the villagers sparkled when they heard that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for me, I have to decline.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Slimes also purify excrement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want to eat it no matter what.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if it will be obedient enough if we tried to dry it under the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we go with light punishment, we’ll only imprison it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We probably can imprison it in a jar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After an extremely violent discussion, Beezel’s daughter’s, Fraurem, words shook everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Assuming that we really punished it, do you think the slime will understand it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’re talking about a slime here, is it really normal to seriously consider punishing it? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those who participated in the trial blushed and the trial was dissolved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s make sure to keep the door of the warehouse where we store wine close.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After that, the wine slime remained as a wine slime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike other slimes, it no longer participates in the purification job. It only loiters around the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It participates in banquets or shows up whenever someone is drinking wine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it might be nice to have a slime like that around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it will be troublesome if slimes like that increase.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Beezel’s daughter, Fraurem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During her first day, she’s wearing a dress and looks out of place. I was worried that she won’t &nbsp;be able to fit in since she’s so fashionable, she even changed her clothes several times. However, on the second day, she’s wearing trousers and even tie her hair. I was surprised that she’s even willing to do farm work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it because she was influenced by Rasuti?</p>
<p class="calibre2">She waited for my instructions with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, I’m glad that she wants to do farm works rather than being a war potential like Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do your best from now on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After working with her for 10 days, I was able to get along with her so I can now call her Frau instead of Fraurem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If Rasuti is like the student council president and the chairman of the disciplinary committee. Frau is the ace of a sports club.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She learns quickly, moves steadily, and is energetic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She also became friends with the spiders, the kuros, and the high elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes, she mofumofu the tail of the beastgirls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Enviable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I say I want to touch their tails too, they will misunderstand it as an invitation for bed.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Because of my conversation with Rasuti and Frau, I learned a lot about the foods and drinks outside the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, about cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I already had an idea because of how the onis cook before, it is really lacking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All they do is to either boil or grill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the reason why those are the only cooking methods…probably because of culture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like majority of the people here are looking at food as mere energy supply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anything edible is okay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the government doesn’t think about providing variety of food and only recognize a single type of crop as their staple food. The will ask the farmers to only plant that specific crop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, since the crop to eat is fixed, the method of cooking is limited.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to my memory of my previous world, that eating habit is unhealthy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I like rice but I can’t eat only rice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If that happens, I will try to find something else that will complement rice…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, people of this world probably doesn’t have that kind of luxury.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like only the rich or the ruling class can afford to eat like that but there are only few among them are concerned about food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also can’t recklessly enter the forest to hunt or go to the sea to fish because of the existence of monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, that’s probably it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I finally understood why people from the outside complements the food in this village that much.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It seems like the circumstances of wine is similar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wine is mass produced in places where it can be made in order to supply places that lack drinking water. It can also be stored for a long time which makes it a good alternative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, it tastes the same anywhere you drink it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the amount is more important than the taste, it is even diluted with water in order to make it inexpensive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it is more favored than cook foods, the rich and powerful can brew good wine but such thing rarely appears in the market.</p>
<p class="calibre2">People who have them drink them so why would they sell it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the wine in this village tastes better than the good wine of the rich.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not because of brewing technique but the difference in quality of raw materials.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now I understand why the villagers wanted to drink.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is also the reason why Doraim always comes here and demand wine.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「If you are only planting a single type of crop, won’t it be a problem if an epidemic occurs? Won’t it be the cause of a downfall of a country?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You are right. That’s exactly what happened in a human country a few years ago….I heard that a great famine occurred around the kingdom of Full Heart.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Yes. That is the reason why they waged war against the neighboring country. They are searching for food….they also troubled the demon king’s country.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They waged war because of food?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though their purpose is probably plundering, they might also be reducing the mouths to feed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did the demon king’s country overcome the famine? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. The demon king’s country is an alliance of different races so there is a variety of staple foods. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. Although you didn’t know what caused the famine, the damage was not that much because you didn’t plant a single type of crop.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. However, it’s not like we didn’t take any damage. The demon king’s country also doesn’t have much left. Nevertheless, the kingdom of Full Heart thinks that the demon king’s country is rich….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「But, won’t you be able to easily beat a starving army? You can even completely destroy them if you want.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is possible but we can’t just conquer their territory.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will take a while to gain profit from a conquered exhausted territory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, they must invest in it that will only increase their debts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It makes me realize that this is not a game.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what can I do? I’m only a village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only thing I can do is to respond to the food demand of the demon king’s country in order to lower the price.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s do our best so we can produce more crops.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-9"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 61 &ndash; Wyvern Communication and Michael-san from the Port Town</h1><p class="calibre2">My child has become considerably big.<span id="calibre_link-159"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m looking after him every day but….umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’ll be able to stand up soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m really a doting parent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Recently, Tier and the high elves are really aggressive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand how they feel but a child is a gift from heaven.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is good to make an effort making them but they should not push themselves.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Also, given that Rasuti and Frau are living here, Doraim and Beezel often come here too. They are also indirectly asking for a grandchild.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I won’t do anything as long as the person in question doesn’t acknowledge it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The question is, will the person in question acknowledge it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, the two of them are really beautiful….eh? Wait, will Rasuti lay an egg?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, isn’t Frau-san a noble’s daughter?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t care…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t wanna think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not talk about it further than this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t think I can handle the strings attached.</p>


<p class="calibre2">We are communicating with others regularly using Rasuti’s wyverns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless whether we need to say or report anything, we send wyverns in a regular interval. The wyverns are also bringing message from the other side as they come back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The standard is one trip a day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we or the other party wants to report something urgent, it will increase to two or more in a day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I don’t forget about it or if there is really nothing to say, once a week or once a month is good too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Either way, I need the other party’s consent too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">We’re communicating with Howling village once a week.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The contents are mainly written letters from the beastkin immigrants to their parents.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Fantasy world has a literacy rate of 100%. Even remote rural village beast childrens can read and write.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">From the other side, they talk about bartering grains and minerals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the talk of our barter finally settles, Tier will directly go there to execute our agreement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In regards to the transport of grains and minerals, we formerly ask Doraim to do that for us but now it is Rasuti’s job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This<em class="calibre5"> dragon</em> girl was hesitant about being the means of transport first but I manage to bribe her with sweets.</p>


<p class="calibre2">According to Tier, it seems like their village wants an arrangement like they will be fully dependent on Big Tree village with regards to food and put all their manpower into mining and making ironwares.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the other side judge that it is a good trade, once ironwares spread in Big Tree village, we will no longer buy more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, covering all the food needs of Howling village will be really hard unless we further expand our field. And what are they planning with all the ironwares they are going to make?</p>

<p class="calibre2">Maa, the demon king’s country is at war so iron is needed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is not like it will be war forever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think the Howling village should continue to produce their own food.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In the south is the mountain where Doraim’s nest lies. Beyond that the iron forest and after crossing it, it will be the sea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was suggested to do business with humans in the port town.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one who proposed that is Frau.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The purpose is to acquire marine products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was probably because of what I said while eating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If we only have marine products, we can taste a variety of flavors. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Excluding me, everyone else in the village was unified.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The name of the port town is Shashaato.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is called the Shashaato City.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Frau knows a merchant with shop there so we decided to do our seafood dealings there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they deal with marine products, I’ll be delighted if they’ll cooperate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of our dealings with Howling village, we know that it is possible to trade by bartering so we are now choosing what to barter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I proposed wine at first but it was dismissed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「To trade our wine, what a cruel thing to say. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The wine is the treasure of our village. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We should keep the wine for ourselves. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarves and high elves are unified.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since there is no other choice, we decided to choose the crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We don’t know what the other party wants so let’s bring our surplus crops. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, leaving the regular business transaction aside, let’s think about how we’re going to obtain the necessary marine products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, we should gather information there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to go but I know it is impossible.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The member who’ll go to Shashaato City.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative, Frau.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one in charge of transport, Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ones in charge of lifting and guarding, five lizardmen including Daga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’ll get going then. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll do my best to transport it. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Leave the lifting to us.」</p>



<p class="calibre2">The Shashaato City is a bit distant from here and considering the load and the passenger’s safety, it will take Rasuti half a day to go there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told them to stay overnight in order to not overwork them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they are planning to stay at the nest of Doraim on the mountain in the south.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope we’re not bothering him…well, since Rasuti is with them, it is like returning to her parent’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They’ll go to the city the next day and return to Doraim’s nest again to stay for the night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their trip will be three-day long so they will return three days later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My only wish is their safe return.</p>


<p class="calibre2">They returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A lot of luggage were on Rasuti’s back and the number of people riding her increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, we brought the merchant Mr.Michael from Shashaato City.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Frau introduces a well dressed middle-aged man.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「He-hello, nice to meet you. I am the president of the Goroun Company, Michael Goroun.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m the village chief of Big Tree village, Hiraku.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I bowed in an obsequious manner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, how nostalgic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, these two will be my servant and they’ll stay at my house from now on. I hope you don’t mind.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti introduces the two in maid uniform while still on her <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Bulga.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Stifano.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">They look like humans but they are not….when I was looking at them, they spread their bat wings on their back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are probably devils.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they are relatives of that servant of Doraim, Gucci.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti seems to have chosen these two because they worked for her before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand why she brought these two here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But why did they bring the merchant Michael-san here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Michael-san answered my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I was surprised with the crops that came from this village so I decided to greet you as soon as possible and hope that we can continue our business dealings in the future.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you for stating your purpose.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha. It was a wonderful experience. To be able to ride a dragon and even stay a night at the dragon’s nest…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, his face is turning blue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like he’s really scared. He’s probably thinking of his return trip.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please, take a rest today. Let’s talk about the details tomorrow.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. I will do so. Ah, my baggage are…. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I showed Michael-san and send his baggage to the inn. I also arranged to have someone take care of him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until a little while ago, Frau was the one living in the inn but since her house was completed, she moved there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was her first time living alone so the onis helped her in variety of things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sooner or later, she might also bring servants like Rasuti.</p>



<p class="calibre2">「Thank you for your hard work. As for the result? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「As you requested, we bought a lot of marine products. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The luggage has already been unloaded from Rasuti’s back. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We iced them up to maintain freshness. Here is the list. We’ll carry them to the cellar. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga hand over a list to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Names of fish and shellfish I have never heard of are written there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I inspected the baggage and found fishes similar to tuna, bonito, saury, and mackerel. There are also shellfish that looks like scallops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they the same kind I know of with different names?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like this one, no matter how I look at it, this is a squid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, since there is a risk of poison and parasites if we talk about fish and shellfish, I’ll ask someone familiar with them for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was there a person like that here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe I should ask Michael-san tomorrow.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「This is a processed product in Shashaato City. It seems to be used as seasoning. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga brings a pot and says that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like this is the specialty product of Shashaato City.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, it looks like fish sauce…right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I’m glad there is a seasoning that I don’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flavor will broaden.</p>


<p class="calibre2">They also bought a variety of other small items and utensils so I distribute them to the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That night, there was a banquet in the pretext of showing appreciation to the group who bought marine products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of giving Michael-san a welcome party but it seems like his welcome party will be held the next day.</p></div>
