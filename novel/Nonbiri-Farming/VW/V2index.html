<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-28"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 62 &ndash; Business Talk?</h1><p class="calibre2">「The food yesterday was amazing. The food served at the gatekeeper dragon’s place was wonderful but it is nowhere near the food here. Furthermore, that <em class="calibre5">wine</em>. It is the most delicious wine I ever tasted.」<span id="calibre_link-160"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? However, please don’t drink too much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did what I can to not caught in Michael-san’s momentum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is before noon. Michael-san and I are in the large dining room of the inn. Loo, Tier, and Frau are with us too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought Rasuti will participate but she seems to have stayed late at the banquet last night and is still sleeping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though Rasuti is like both the student council president and disciplinary committee chairman, she’s unexpectedly bad at waking up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most dragons are like that and if you wake them up forcibly, you’ll be in trouble so it is good to leave them be.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then how about starting to discuss your business here….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. First of all, I want to tell you my purpose for coming here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Michael-san straightened his posture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The other day, Fraurem-ojousama came to my store to conduct business. All of the crops she brought are wonderful so my first goal is to continue your business with us in the future. My second purpose is to check if there are more crops I can trade with. My third purpose is to check if there is any business you want me to do for you. Lastly, if things go well, I want to obtain the position of purveyor of this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Michael-san stuck out his chest as if he has nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is good that you’re honest.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I have to. If I intentionally bend anything, it will complicate things.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Certainly. It is good to hear what you want from the start.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier and Loo replied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thus, first of all, the surplus crops of the village…..I would like to buy them all. I’ll buy them at a high price.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha. Maa, there’s no need to rush.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo winks at Tier. It seems like Loo is planning something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There are a lot of other parties that want to have dealings with our village. Transactions with other villages have already been carried out on a regular basis. We can’t have you as our only business partner.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Looking at the crops of the village, it is only natural. I was unreasonable. However, I would like to ask as much deal as you can give me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Presently, the crops we can wholesale for your company are these.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..and, they discussed about the business deal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’m only here to give the final approval.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No no, that is enough. I appreciate it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Then, let’s talk about the price.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree. Ah, I would like to ask something before anything else.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s about the transport of goods. Can I expect you to transport them via a dragon like what you did earlier?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Michael-san wants Rasuti and Frau to transport the goods. Well, it will be really hard to transport them on foot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, we will ask something in exchange for that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. You must have not heard it yet but Rasuti is here because of a promise with the chief so she’s not really part of the village. We can’t get her involved in this deal.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She can’t take part in the deal?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you think there is someone who can give instructions to a <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can’t you do anything about it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We can’t. The reason why Rasuti cooperated to transport the crops of the village before is out of her goodwill.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though she only needed to be bribed with sweets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see….ehto….then what is the relationship between the village and the <em class="calibre5">dragons</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Coexistence. Don’t think of anything strange.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….certainly.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">What a weird conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they planning something behind the scenes?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In any case, to be able to transport the goods….how about this much?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s a lot of zeros. But I did not intervene because I don’t know how much that worth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「With this, you won’t need to splurge much effort.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha. I don’t mind that amount. You don’t need to lessen it that much because it is our first business deal.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. Since you don’t have problem with this amount, let’s sign a contract.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By all means. Let’s use this paper. Also, this is the catalog of all items handled by our shop.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you. If there is any item we need, we’ll buy it from you. Ah, there are some things I want to buy….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The talk advances steadily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked him the things I wanted to know about the marine products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not poisonous but it seems like it is common for them to have parasites so they should never be eaten raw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess I won’t be making sushi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Could you wholesale <em class="calibre5">wine </em>too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….If it’s a small amount we can give it to you as a token of friendship but selling you a business level amount is out of the question. Our village’s wine has a lot of <em class="calibre5">fans</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Though it is regrettable, I guess I’ll enjoy it myself. I’m thankful for that small amount.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The business talk ended after lunch.</p>


<p class="calibre2">As a result, all the crops we had put in place for trading with Shashaato City were cashed. Honey, Zabuton’s fabric, salt, sugar, oil, etc were sold too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised that we even sold salt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shashaato City is a port town so I’m sure they have no shortage of salt but it seems like the taste is different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like salt from the forest of death has always been famous and valuable.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I have not bought anything from him this time but I requested some things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First are goat and horse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In general, the population of goats is greater than the population of cows since they are easier to obtain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted cow because I want milk but we can get milk from goats too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I requested goat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Horses are needed as mounts. Loo and Tier requested them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I haven’t ridden a horse before but…..maa, when it arrives here, I’ll try.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also asked for marine products that Frau’s group were not able to purchase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially the seaweed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing from Michael-san, it seems like seaweeds are treated as weeds of the sea that only interferes with fishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nobody bothers with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked him to dry them first then bring it here.</p>



<p class="calibre2">In addition, we also relayed the minerals of Howling village, and it was decided that the Goroun Company will buy them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Resale, that word floated inside my head. There was no discussion between the Howling village and Shashaato. In addition, given the distance between the two, the price will be outrageous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our village is special because we have Doraim and Rasuti as means of transport.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Traveling to the village will be one month travel on foot in the middle of the forest.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Michael-san stayed another night and as scheduled, there’s a welcome party for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">2 consecutive nights of banquet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it might not be too good for Michael-san, the dishes on the banquet are the marine products we purchased from Shashaato city.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fry them with oil?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Broiling? What kind of technique is that…?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made various dishes while teaching the high elves and the onis about how to cook them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I want them to be served to me after this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also boiled and seasoned them with vegetables.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We don’t have soy sauce so I used the seasoning they brought from Shashaato City as substitute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m not satisfied, it was popular with the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to get seaweeds soon.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-47"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 63 &ndash; Michael</h1><p class="calibre2">My name is Michael.<span id="calibre_link-161"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Michael Goroun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am one of the merchants of Shashaato City.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, my business is doing fine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because we have a lot of capital, there are a lot of people who want to trade with me. I’m even troubled who to choose from.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Recently, I only have few business talks, I just entertained all others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I like gold much more than alcohol and food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to make more money.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One day, while I’m thinking of such a thing, there was a sudden visitor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That countryman brought and wanted to sell appo. I thought it’s just another countryman who doesn’t even know how to make an appointment so I thought about pretending to be out but I had a bad feeling so I decided to meet that visitor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, its a country girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks nice but that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I already have my beloved wife.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Its color is different but I’ll still give it back to her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought so but I changed my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Prejudice means loss.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Who knows if this will be profitable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s hear her talk first before deciding.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I will not pass the initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to be aggressive at first…but I have a bad feeling so I politely receive her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made the right choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This country girl is Count Chrome’s daughter, Fraurem-ojousama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The influence of Count Chrome’s house is tremendous in this demon king’s country.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you want to be safe, you should not defy them at any cause.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And this girl is not a simple lass, she’s a close classmate of the princess and she excels in both literary and military arts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since she’s one of the close friends of the princess, she’s a candidate to be the next generation’s executive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even with her current standing, she has the power over my life and death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s good that I did not disregard my premonition.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We have met before, I wonder if you can still remember me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-yes. Of course. We met at her highness princess’ birthday party.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. That time, I remember you telling me if it’s about business, talk to you by all means. I’m wondering if I’m troubling you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Of course not. I would like to hear anything that Fraurem-ojousama wants to say.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Good. I want you to buy all of the things I brought immediately.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. So what are those things?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Crops.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Crops? I’m sorry to disappoint Fraurem-ojousama but all the crops harvested in the territory are so to their responding purveyor, I can’t buy them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">All big houses have their own purveyor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, every territory has one.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Even if the one who requested it is Fraurem-ojousama, I can’t disregard them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, no, the crops are not harvested in my parent’s territory so it’s okay. That place has no purveyor yet.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Can you take a look at them first? My apologies but I took my liberty to put them in front of your store.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I followed Fraulem-ojousama and went outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is noisy outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did something happen?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know why but everyone’s gazes are fixed in this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I’m puzzled of what is happening, I saw the luggage stacked like a mountain in front of my store.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, this is a complete obstruction to my business.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can’t you think of the place a little more?</p>
<p class="calibre2">And what if I refused to buy them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, what surprised me are the people guarding the luggage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lizardmen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even in the demon king’s territory, they are a rare race. One of them has the ability to match 10 humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And they are the guards?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu, as expected of Count Chrome’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And there is another one, a girl……</p>
<p class="calibre2">This village girl seems to be the serious type.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Village girl?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">On her head….there’s also a tail….areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I requested help from the people around, the turned their gaze away.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only that, they even took some distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They don’t want to get involved so they don’t want to approach?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I think so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I can’t run away so I need to check it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ano, Fraurem-ojousama?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, that girl is Rasuti. Don’t anger her because she’s a dragon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ye-yeee」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never heard of her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her name is similar to Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s the daughter of the gatekeeper dragon in the north. She’s a ferocious dragon that had already raged various places.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s a rumor that the ferocious wyvern that made the iron forest its territory has disappeared because Rasutisumoon killed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasutisumoon…..Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they sisters?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Relatives?</p>

<p class="calibre2">Or they only have similar names?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, she’s a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dealing with her poorly will directly result to death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the question is, why is a dragon here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t get anything. I’ll just inspect the luggage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">I knew it at first glance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These are the crops that recently became the headlines in the capital.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And they are piled up like a mountain in front of my store.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The overwhelming smell of gold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’d like to buy all of it but….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You can buy them at the market price.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was fast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t let this go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are there more?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「These are the only ones we brought this time…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This time?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-yes…there are still some in the village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「May I accompany you on your way home?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind but we still have to buy things here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please tell me what you need. I’ll take care of it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a business opportunity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must not let this chance escape!</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m currently on the back of a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……I probably should have let that business opportunity to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t have the time to look at the scenery because of fear.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m currently at the nest of the gatekeeper dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I really should have let that business opportunity to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I went to bed but how can I sleep?</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m currently flying over the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m already at the stage of resignation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since things have come to this, I’ll grab any business opportunity I can grab.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to prepare myself.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Blood-sucking princess, Angel of Annihilation, Angels of Holocaust, <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m all right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am not afraid of anything anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though he is not scary, why am I introduced to a human first?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Village chief?</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s the boss here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, he’s petting an <em class="calibre5">inferno wolf</em>….</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, he’s polite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, he even bowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, my mind can’t catch up with what’s happening because of insufficient sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He kindly guided me to the inn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is only a small village but this inn doesn’t seem to match it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This <em class="calibre5">bed sheet</em>, it’s made of <em class="calibre5">demon spider’s</em> thread….the <em class="calibre5">curtains</em> too?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll have to think about tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll work hard at tomorrow’s negotiation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I need to sleep first….guh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Refreshing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dinner?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I’ll eat.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The dishes are something I have never seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t imagine how they cook these.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it doesn’t matter, it’s delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if that word can really describe the taste.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can’t even taste something like this on noble’s <em class="calibre5">party</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did they specifically prepare them for me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to work hard at tomorrow’s negotiations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, what kind of meat did they cook?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Killer rabbit? Great boar?</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Those are luxury meat that are rarely available….</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">wine </em>was also delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I’m captivated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I absolutely want this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seconds, please.</p>


<p class="calibre2">That was a tough negotiation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I worked hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked hard even if the other party is the blood-sucking princess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If dragon transport was possible, my dream of being the top merchant of the country will come true.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, if only it’s possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to secure more crops but it was painful that I can only secure a small amount of<em class="calibre5"> wine</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That taste, I’m sure a lot of people will desire it…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that because of the way the villagers treated me last night, it will be mine for the taking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Huh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tonight’s banquet?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wine…will be served.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let me drink.</p>


<p class="calibre2">My name is Michael Goroun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m the president of the Goroun Company and one of the leading merchants of Shashaato City.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A man that is scheduled to become the leading merchant of the demon king’s country.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Son? I have two sons. They are old enough. My grandchildren are going to be born soon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing that my grandchildren will be born soon, he was disappointed for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-66"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 64 &ndash; Mushroom and Field Expansion</h1><p class="calibre2">Michael-san returned to prepare the things I asked for. Rasuti will go there to bring them here as soon as they’re ready.<span id="calibre_link-162"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you for your hard work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Rasuti came back, she’s already being accompanied by Doraim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like he wants fish dish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He really likes <em class="calibre5">fried</em> seafood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also showed interest in dried squid but it is not fully dried yet so he hasn’t tasted it yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the small fishes dried, I picked them up and make dashi….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s delicious.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, why is it that the sea fish tastes normal but the river fish tastes like mud?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is probably because the fishes in the river are eating food along with mud and stone at the bottom of the river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like there is a certain part of the river where fish is not muddy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But we can’t catch them near our place.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Sea fish is popular with the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they can eat it as it is, when I removed the internal organs, they no longer eat it until the internal organs were removed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They learned that food can taste better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Honey is bad for babies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know the reason but I saw something on TV saying that you should not let your babies have some.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should look for another alternative sweetener so he won’t be given some by mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I used sweet potatoes and chestnut as alternatives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I know how to roast sweet potatoes but I had a hard time roasting chestnut cause I don’t know how to properly roast it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cracked the chestnut before roasting it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want to use the fruits because the sweetness would be too high.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can still remember the pudding incident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even now, there are occasional disputes because the number of puddings we made can’t meet the demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess it is better not to make <em class="calibre5">ice cream</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I never made one yet, I was demanded to do so for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I made one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A conflict similar to the pudding incident occurred.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It’s really popular that it induced envy.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When I was harvesting mushroom, I was surprised with what I dug off the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Truffle gets.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">When raising mushroom with the AFT, I tried raising truffle at the root of a tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like I succeeded because I was able to harvest 10 black truffles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my previous world, this is a high-class ingredient but what about here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Personally, I don’t think of it as a delicious food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I like shiitake more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, maybe I just did not eat proper truffle in my previous world ……</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I showed it to everyone, they were all surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There seems to be truffle in this world too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is really rare and it is even called black jewel because only rich people can afford it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, would it be better if I stop the increase in production?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the villagers said that I should increase the production.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Won’t the market break because of us?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It should be safe if we don’t sell it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, let’s eat this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I leave it to the onis because they seem to know the method of processing <em class="calibre5">truffle</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They sprinkled to on the dish like a powder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They sliced it and eat it along with the dish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So that’s it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">And as I expected, I really don’t find it delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shiitake is really my favorite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it seems like I’m the only one that coldly receive it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, Tier, Rasuti, Frau and some others are eating them slowly and carefully as if afraid to waste a single bit of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastkins are even eating with tears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also wanted to give all the kuros but…we don’t have enough so only Kuro and Yuki can taste them….yeah, their tails are intensely wagging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The glances of the other kuros who were not able to taste it are scary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand, I’ll increase the production rate immediately.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A message came from Michael-san via a small wyvern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The goats, horses, and dried seaweeds are ready.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, he was able to gather a good quantity of shrimps and crabs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To my surprise, though shrimps are also eaten in this world, they don’t eat crabs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought the reason is a problem with the taste but it seems like nobody thought of it as food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But that’s not important.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Ah, no, I should not panic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything will be cleared as soon as I taste it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why nobody looks at it as food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, aside from that, everything are prepared so I’ll go get them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, everyone is against me going.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They probably don’t want me to abandon the field….</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, along with Rasuti, Frau will go since the people there are already familiar with her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised when they returned after several days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the fainted goats and horses are tied to Rasuti in her dragon form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They won’t behave so it leaves us no choice.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It would be stranger if they are calm before a dragon. Are they injured?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They are all right. If they are injured, we can just use healing magic.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, we have obtained goats and horses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are our new companions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of keeping them with the cows but would it be better if I separate them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I expanded the cow <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the former eight by eight fields, I expanded it to the northeast direction and turned it into a twelve by 12 fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, I changed the name into ranch <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The new goats are 2 males and 8 females.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are one male and one female horses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I wanted them to be energetic, the goat tried to escape a number of times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One time, a goat managed to slip from the kuros and boldly went into the forest. It was attacked by a rabbit with fangs and came back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From there on, none of them tried to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the horses, they are obedient from the start.</p>


<p class="calibre2">To <em class="calibre5">balance</em> it out, I also expanded the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em> by as much as I expanded the ranch <em class="calibre5">area</em> to the east.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also planted trees for shading and lawn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I change the name of the wolf <em class="calibre5">area</em> to kuro <em class="calibre5">area</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or maybe watchdog <em class="calibre5">area</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since none of them sounds good, it will continue to be called the dog <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>


<p class="calibre2">We have to enjoy these marine products.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put the dried seaweeds and mushrooms into the dashi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something surprised me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves and beastkins have never eaten shrimps yet but they ate them without question.</p>

<p class="calibre2">However, it is different when it’s the crab’s turn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the only ones who eat the crabs without problems are me, the onis, and Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised that Loo and Tier didn’t even try.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crabs here looks like the hairy crabs I know of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">This figure….it looks like a spiderling?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, it is not…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll ask Zabuton first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can I eat this?</p>
<p class="calibre2">She said <em class="calibre5">OK</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They seem unrelated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It tastes good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it’s pretty good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are only a few who tried eating it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The group who ate it looked at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no need for them to let others eat it too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boil it a little and it’s done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Later, Doraim came by and asked for crabs but there’s no crab left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only deficiency of crab is the smell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I washed my hands with water with lemon extract.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s ask Michael-san for crabs again.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-86"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 65 &ndash; Food Culture</h1><p class="calibre2">Medicinal herbs field.<span id="calibre_link-163"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I never noticed it because my God-given “healthy body”makes me unable to contract disease but the villagers are using medicinal herbs in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that Loo, Tier, and Flora are using them for the sake of research but it seems like medicinal herbs are hard to find especially when you need them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing that, I decided to make a medicinal herb field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ask the high elves to bring me every medicinal herb they can find.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There seem to be trees that can be used as medicine too but I have to look at them myself so I only have them look for herbs this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thirty kinds.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are more type of medicinal herbs than I expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess it is because each has a different effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I’ll look at the actual thing then think of them while plowing using the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The medicinal herb field is on the east side of the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a four by four field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it goes well, I’ll expand it further.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Loo, Michael-san might buy medicinal herbs because they are quite expensive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And because they are medicine, no one will mind their price.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recognize this herb.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Criminals in police <em class="calibre5">drama </em>posses this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ehto….is it ethically alright to raise it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It depends on how you use them. It’s a highly valuable herb.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">We raised it but under strict management.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The alcohol brewing of the dwarves is doing great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">New kinds of alcohols are now available.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are three types of alcohol now.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Wine, beer</em>, and distilled liquor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they are <em class="calibre5">challenging</em> it by trying various raw materials.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a time where I told them the method of brewing alcohol using rice with the help of my faint memory about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that they would only produce result after a few years but they were able to make something similar in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The taste is a bit lacking but I’m already expecting it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the number of dwarves increased again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they being attracted by alcohol?</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are currently 8 dwarves in the village.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I began making <em class="calibre5">cheese </em>and butter after I was able to secure milk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Butter making is relatively easy because you only need physical strength but <em class="calibre5">cheese</em> making requires an enzyme to solidify the milk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can get it off the calf’s stomach ……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will not do such a thing.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The calf is cute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I won’t kill it just because of <em class="calibre5">cheese</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the number of cattle and chickens is growing steadily, but I have not eaten any of them yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being a dairy farmer sure is tough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a good thing that I have the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wished for the enzyme that solidifies milk while stirring the milk using the AFT in shamoji form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That happened last year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right now, there are cheeses in front of my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you, AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I offered the newly made <em class="calibre5">cheese </em>and alcohol to the shrine under the big tree.</p>


<p class="calibre2">We soaked the soybean in water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For about a whole day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, we took the soybean out of the water and mashed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, boil the mashed soybean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, strain the boiled soybean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, simmer it one more time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We also add salt in that process.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After solidifying, we put it in a mold.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tofu!</p>
<p class="calibre2">We gently squeezed out the remaining liquid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The taste….it doesn’t have any?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is some sort of diet food. Let’s eat it with the seasoning we obtained from Shashaato.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t wait until we made soy sauce.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Grind fish meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, strain the ground meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Add salt and knead it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When it’s no longer sticky, shape it to whatever shape you want and leave it for about an hour.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boil it and let it cool.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamaboko" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> kamaboko</a> is complete!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The color looks awful but it tastes good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is straining?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It means filtering using a fine cloth. You do that to remove unnecessary things. This time, we used a cloth Zabuton made.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Red pepper, <em class="calibre5">cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, cardamom, cumin</em>, and <em class="calibre5">laurel, </em>I challenged making <em class="calibre5">curry </em>using those ingredients.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Though I don’t know how much of them should I use, I crushed them into fine flour and mix them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I adjusted the amount of each ingredients depending on the smell and color.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made <em class="calibre5">curry </em>powder just like that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m uneasy, it is a <em class="calibre5">challenge</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the result.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A <em class="calibre5">curry</em>-like <em class="calibre5">soup </em>was completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to try making again to make it more curry like but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">That <em class="calibre5">curry </em>is already popular with the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The spiciness is somewhat addicting.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The taste changes depending on how you mix it. I want to research it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The smell alone makes me hungry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was included in the menu and was served for about two to three times a month.</p>


<p class="calibre2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agar" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2">Agar-agar</a> is indispensable for making sweets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I obtained agar-agar from the seaweeds I asked Michael-san to find for us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Agar can be obtained by washing and drying seaweed a number of times, adding vinegar and boiling it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It takes time and effort but the procedure is simple.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I utilized the freshly made agar……I made a jelly by simply adding fruits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made various jelly using different kind of fruits.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The jelly was nicely received and continued to be served as dessert after meal. Because of that, our stock of agar immediately disappeared so I have to ask Michael-san again.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I cook various dishes but all the raw materials are my crops. The hunted preys are lined up on the table and they are either boiled or roasted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They can only boil and roast meat in the past but because of my guidance, the onis learned how to properly cook and the food they cook now are delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially the meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their <em class="calibre5">roast beef </em>is splendid….well, it’s not really<em class="calibre5"> beef</em> but <em class="calibre5">boar</em> so I guess it’s better to call it <em class="calibre5">roast boar</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also learned how to pair foods with the right <em class="calibre5">sauces</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are recently enthusiastic in making <em class="calibre5">sauce</em> from wasabi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim especially likes the <em class="calibre5">roast boar</em> of our village that he demanded to eat it every time he comes here.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I made a new oven for bread and started doing research to be able to mass produce and make new kinds of bread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not only the onis but even the high elves are enthusiastic about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, we manage to make bread we made undergo the second fermentation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I had completely forgotten about it, unlike the first fermentation, which is mainly making the dough, the second fermentation is the part where bread takes shape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the second fermentation, it became possible for us to make big bread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, dressing your bread before baking it became popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We made a variety of sweet roll.</p>

<p class="calibre2">We have a lot of sugar so there’s no problem.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Apart from that, I also baked pizza.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already made<em class="calibre5"> cheese</em> so I want to eat pizza.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of making it as my snack but it has been eaten immediately by the bystander.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pizza became popular after that.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It is a good thing that we can eat a variety of foods now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That being said, I have to work harder.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Tier is pregnant.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-4"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 66 &ndash; Governor and Entertainment</h1><p class="calibre2">Demon King’s Castle<span id="calibre_link-164"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon King-sama, did you call for me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re finally here Beezel, I just want to ask you something.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I heard that you made your daughter go to the Big Tree Village, is it true?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, it is.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is your intention?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She’ll be the governor.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Governor?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, everything related to that village is managed by me. Don’t you think it is normal for me to send a governor on my behalf?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re right but…can’t you find anyone else talented enough to handle it? To be honest, my daughter is lonely.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My apologies but if we mistreated that village in anyway, our country will be greatly affected. In addition, I chose my daughter since she can take responsibility if the worst case scenario happens.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…I understand. When your daughter returns, can you ask her to meet my daughter?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Certainly.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Big Tree Village</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because of that, you are now the governor of this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father, if you don’t stop joking around I’ll strangle you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Strangle me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You already joked around so can you stop calling me governor?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t be upset. I just need you to put up a face to the demon king’s government. You don’t necessarily have to act like the governor of this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…..In other words?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re only going to act. I don’t want to rule over this village. Even if I do, do you think that’s possible? You should know it better than me, right? I’ll go talk to the village chief. I don’t want him to misunderstand anything.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Frau as the governor of this village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. I must give the demon king country a reason for sending my promising daughter here…I don’t want them to think that I sent her here to play around. In any case, will you recognize Frau as the governor of this village? It is only an act for the demon king’s country’s side so you don’t need to worry about anything.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind but…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There is also a <em class="calibre5">merit</em> for this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Merit</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, the tax you’re paying us, you can pay it to your local governor. The governor will use those taxes for managing this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….that means?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How the governor will use the tax she collected is up to her.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, the governor is supposed to be on the demon king’s country’s side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Won’t you be losing taxes because of this…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it alright? I mean, the demon king’s country will lose taxes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If your territory is large, you have an obligation to pay taxes to the country but if it’s just one or two villages, you don’t have that obligation. Use what you obtain in this land to enrich it, that’s it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sounds good, really good.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I can accept what he says but….let’s think about it first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it a trap?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are there any holes?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Who has the power to appoint the governor of this village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That would be me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it possible to change the appointed governor later?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is…….Are you thinking that I’ll send another one as a governor once my daughter accumulates merit?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m only thinking about the possibility.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t worry. I want to guaranty that but….I don’t know who’ll take my position in the future. I understand that you’re uneasy because you’re thinking about the village. Alright, then, let’s hand the appointive power to the village chief.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s make the village chief the only one who has the right to appoint a governor. You can appoint and dismiss someone at your will.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it that simple?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s okay. Let’s make a contract. In the future, even if other people come, as long as the demon king’s country continue to exist, the contract will still be in effect. The village chief is in a higher position than the governor now.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">And we go with it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Frau, congratulations on being the governor.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Congrats」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You did it」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please stop. Are you bullying me? Village chief, please dismiss me. I am inadequate as a governor.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, it’s not like you fail in anything….do your best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Noooooooooooo」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it’s only in name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Beezel no longer has to collect taxes, it might be advantageous for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I thought of that, Beezel collected them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought Beezel came here only to purchase crops since he’s doing that every month. I never thought that it’s already tax collection time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The hatchlings have become quite big, they are now taller than the beastboys.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hatching from eggs, they could already move and swim. Looking at their growth rate, I was a little impatient since Alfred has yet to stand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that I shouldn’t be impatient since it hasn’t been a year since he was born….Is this what they call parental love?</p>


<p class="calibre2">I thought that the relationship between Tier and Loo will be awkward when Tier got pregnant but I can’t find a trace of that awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Loo has experienced childbirth, she’s taking care of her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the other angels are confused after seeing them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given their previous relationship, their present relationship might really look strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder how intense their previous battles were.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In any case, it is good that they are on good terms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want her to give birth safely too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I also feel that the offensive of those who want to bear child too is getting stronger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only have one body so please think of me a little.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The residents of the village basically don’t rest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the young beast boys are doing jobs they can do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They only take it easy when the sun sets, when it rains, or during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aren’t they working too much? It will affect their body if they don’t rest properly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are the epitome of the saying “He who does not work, neither shall he eat”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is probably the current mindset of the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each of the villagers is working on their assigned fields, it is impossible for anyone to selfishly take a break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also said….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How can we rest if the village chief is doing most things every day?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon hearing that, I reflected on my actions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So that’s it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I currently stand as the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t have them taking enough rest if I myself is not taking the initiative.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we were playing <em class="calibre5">bowling</em>, the reason why the others were able to enjoy it without reservation is because I’m playing with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll take a look at the state of the fields first then take it easy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t calm down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I decided to make things that can be used for entertainment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First for all, for the beastboys….balls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros are looking at it with eyes full of expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is not for them but seeing those eyes, I can only throw the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I enjoyed it with the kuros.</p>


<p class="calibre2">So I can’t give them balls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then….how about <em class="calibre5">boomerangs</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should make a prototype first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to transform the AFT into a <em class="calibre5">boomerang</em> so I’ll just copy it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s testing time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But before that, I practiced throwing the <em class="calibre5">boomerang </em>form of the AFT first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If this doesn’t work, then it means that I did not throw it properly or the boomerang is a failure.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Though it did return, I had to wait for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright, I should throw the prototype <em class="calibre5">boomerang </em>now before I forgot how to successfully throw a <em class="calibre5">boomerang</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup, it returned properly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The prototype<em class="calibre5"> boomerang</em> is a success.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, I wonder if this will appeal the beastboys…</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastboys are looking at me when I was testing it with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it was instantly popular, the popularity popped out like a bubble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why? Because you throw it yourself and catch it yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Flying disc</em> is more popular since you can play it with others.</p>


<p class="calibre2">What should I make next?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s the adult’s turn so it’s <em class="calibre5">golf</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a<em class="calibre5"> club</em> by carving wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using it doesn’t seem to have any problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only made one for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next is the <em class="calibre5">ball</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I carved wood again using the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The center of gravity of the <em class="calibre5">ball </em>is not at the center so it doesn’t go straight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s only natural because the density of the wood is not constant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that’s not a reason to not play it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This doesn’t curve in an extreme manner so using it is fine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next is the <em class="calibre5">course</em>….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s make a short <em class="calibre5">course</em> for the beastboys first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I started to make a <em class="calibre5">course</em> on the west side of the residential <em class="calibre5">area </em>since I thought it is the most suitable place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Complete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, this is the wild. Is it really alright to set it up on this place?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I plowed the <em class="calibre5">course</em> using the AFT to make it into an appropriate one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it will take time before it becomes a proper <em class="calibre5">course</em>, I mass produced <em class="calibre5">clubs </em>and <em class="calibre5">balls</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made two types, one for adult’s use and one for beastboy’s use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they are all made of wood, I prepared different kinds of <em class="calibre5">golf clubs</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The course is sort of desolate so I added a lot of things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I raised trees as obstacles and also bushes….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because it is difficult to find the position of the hole, I made sure that the flag stands out.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Confused? Read more about parts of<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> golf course</a>.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked hard on it while working on the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What would I do if no one plays this?</p>


<p class="calibre2">That caused me unnecessary anxiety.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because there were those who like <em class="calibre5">golf</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those people are mostly onis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s fun especially when it did not advance just as I wanted.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is relaxing and we can drink tea while playing it too.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufu. It’s my turn. I’ll go with the third.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ara, I think using a fifth of your power is enough.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I started seeing them <em class="calibre5">playing </em>after lunch.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The beastboys plays more by riding horses and goat rather than the thing I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are better at handling horses than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I practice riding too?</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-23"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 67 &ndash; Entertainment Culture and Lamia</h1><p class="calibre2">The outdoor toys I made were not well received so I made indoor type of entertainment tools.<span id="calibre_link-165"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">First is<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendama" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> kendama</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You don’t have to move around and you can play it alone so it is popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also tried making yoyo but I can’t balance the left and right part so I stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made a spinning top but I can’t teach others how to use it since I can’t make it spin myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why does it look so easy on TV?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, they were able to make it spin without me teaching them how to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they are pleased, let’s assume that it is good that I made it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’m only making toys for beast boys, I guess I should make toys for beast girls too….</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I can’t think of anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they are girls….<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otedama" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2">otedama</a>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had Zabuton make small bags and pack them with soybeans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, it should have been azuki bean.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like planting azuki beans now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can make thick red bean paste by using sugar and also rice cake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s get back to the story, I tied up the otedama completing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made ten for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So, what should we do?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I was asked so, I tried juggling three otedama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….I can’t so I tried it again using two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I was not able to do it, I at least conveyed that they should play it using three otedama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beast girls, onis, and high elves showed interest in it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were able to do it in no time, up to five otedama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, they are even juggling by passing it with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yep, I don’t need to teach them anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll just work hard in making more otedama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I can now see several villagers playing with my handmade toys after meal.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Aside from <em class="calibre5">chess</em>, I also made another <em class="calibre5">board game</em>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> shogi</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was received by the villagers as another version of <em class="calibre5">chess</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is not as popular as <em class="calibre5">chess</em> because the kuros are having problems moving its pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also made<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> go</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember the rules of go because of a popular manga series in my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it will be difficult to suddenly introduce a 19 grid board, the one I made only has 9 grids.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks appealing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I prepared 13 grid and 19 grid boards for future use.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Now, let’s return in making toys for the beastboys, so next one is….<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugoroku" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2">sugoroku</a>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can also be a practice for them to read characters so it may not be a bad idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I prepared a large board and draw a route.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since this is the first one, it should be simple and looks good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I made a dice and play it first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Throw.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastboys are only looking at the dice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a game where you don’t need to think. You just let the dice decide everything for you….how about teaching them chinchirorin?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Chinchirorin is a gamble in which two dice are thrown into a cup, turn it down, and then open to show the number combination.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">No, that’s gambling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, the villagers don’t have personal property so gambling is not established.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gambling huh. If gambling is established because of the entertainment tools I made, should I act as the banker?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m the only one who can give out a prize here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t mind things staying as it is but I probably should teach them a thing or two about currency just in case we’ll use it in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it might be useless because I’m don’t even know if currency will circulate in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, this is something I have to think about in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to induce the interest of the beastboys from the dice to sugoroku and have them play it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It seems like there is a thing similar to dice in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is not hexahedron but a slightly distorted polyhedron.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that symbols are written on the faces instead of numbers and they are mainly used for fortune telling and magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it is not something the general public know of.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I tried various things but it is difficult to make entertainment tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I found out that I am not looking things from their perspective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one that appealed the most to the beast boys was building blocks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, they are children.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, though all of them are of similar sizes, are these also building blocks?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, those are mah-jong tiles.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried making cards but paper here is valuable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them looks the same even if you turn them inside out. It is even hard to notice the different patterns carved on their faces.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I tried sticking clay on the back side but when it doesn’t stick on the wood anymore when the clay dries up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried my best to do something with the clay but since there’s no good result, i abandoned that idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After completing one set, I noticed that I’m the only one who knows the rules and calculate points. It has become a decoration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is the rule complicated?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, you just have to remember a lot of things.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I gathered those who seemed to be free and have them play with me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aside from me, everyone is an amateur.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They don’t even remember all the things regarding points calculation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But why do I feel that their tile throwing is too precise….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I enjoyed playing mah-jong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I won’t tell you the result.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Thirty kuros with spiderlings on their back came back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Five beast….five person-like monsters were with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those monsters have an upper body of a human and snake lower body, they are lamias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone of them is female….Looking at them, I feel like they are all intellectual beauty with long hair. I’m sure glasses suits them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m wondering if they could do something about their jiggling breasts, they don’t have any cover on their upper body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know where to look.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, their long hair covers the pointy part of their chests that makes them look more erotic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I’m sorry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m trying to make an effort not to look because the gazes of the villagers are painful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Don’t be unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked the spiderlings to make a tube-type bra so that can cover their chest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thought it is already too late for that now, it still needs to be done.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Are you the master of these wolves?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as I answer, the representative of the lamia bowed and the others followed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We surrender to the wolves. Please spare our lives.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though you said that, I don’t have any intention of killing you in the first place….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lamia.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lamia I know of are evil monsters that temps humans then strangles them with their snake lower body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are you monsters that predate humans?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「W-we don’t eat humans.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They are not monsters. They are demi-humans.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">The lamia representative answered my doubtful question in a panic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried inquiring more about them to Frau who was near me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Even though they look like that, Lamia is a demi-human race. They are not monsters. Moreover, I never heard of them having a habit of eating humans.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that monsters can’t talk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I agree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I said something rude. Please forgive me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I apologize.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I apologize for saying that they predate humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should think more before I speak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ve reflected on my action.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, let’s return to the topic….you are surrendering, did you fight with the kuros?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They were the ones who attacked us.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I tried asking more, it seems like the lamias are living in the depths of the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or, it can be said that they are the ruler of that <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the kuros attacked them, they resisted for a long time….and since they no longer have the power to, they surrendered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uuhh, they are strong and tough, and they can also evade magic. Even if we climb up to a place where they can’t follow, the spiders will come at us, what the hell was that?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m very sorry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the kuros are looking at me with faces saying “We won against the prey, praise us”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiderlings are probably feeling the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">I praise the 30 kuros and the spiderlings on their back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good, good, good, you did it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After praising them one by one, I asked questions to the lamias again in order to determine what I should do with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is the inner part of the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> safe? Is it possible for you to continue living there?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? It’s safe. Though our war potential decreased, there’s not much damage since they waited for us to surrender.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked a few more question to be able to grasp their current state. It seems like their village was not destroyed but all their livestock are killed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it were me, if someone killed my chickens, cows, goats, and horses, I’ll go berserk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you have any hostile intention with this village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We have none. We completely surrender.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, of course they won’t. They surrendered to merely 30 kuros and spiderlings and now they can see how many of them are here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if they have hostile intention, they’ll probably just keep it in their heart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Then, you may go.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, you may go home.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, could it be that you want to live here?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「N-no, it will be more convenient for us to live in a cave.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, you may return.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, because I don’t want them to bear another grudge for going here for nothing, I plan on giving them souvenirs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Souvenirs….is crops acceptable?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put crops in a barrel and tried to give them as much as they can carry but I never thought that they’ll use their snake part to hold three times a normal bipedal person can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can they still move?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like there’s no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that we just formed a friendly relationship with the lamias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are bringing something from the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> here from time to time to barter with our crops.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-42"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 68 &ndash; Trouble Dragon</h1><p class="calibre2">Gatekeeper dragon Doraim.<span id="calibre_link-166"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Gatekeeper dragon?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s because he built his nest on a mountain between the forest of death and iron forest.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Frau answered my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Loo, Tier, Ria, Ann, and Rasuti are all well informed, Frau is the person to ask for in terms of general knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Since he has prevented monsters from the forest of death go south, he has been long called as the gatekeeper dragon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Heeh, then, is there any other gatekeeper beside him?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can imagine the other gatekeepers to be <em class="calibre5">chimera</em> or titan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, only the south has one. The other directions can’t be used to go in or out of here because the mountains are too steep. In general, people only viewed the south as the entrance to this forest.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, well, there is rarely anyone who dares to enter this forest」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like this place is <em class="calibre5">harder </em>than I thought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, it seems like it is possible to go here from the east side where the Howling village is but it is not recognized as an entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because going to the Howling village itself is already a considerable challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it’s a mountain.</p>


<p class="calibre2">As usual, <em class="calibre5">trouble </em>suddenly comes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a<em class="calibre5"> dragon</em> raid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After flying over the village, it hovers over the forest while provoking us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of negotiating with it first but it suddenly set the forest on fire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright, it’s an enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The angels were thrown out in one hit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Don’t be like that, I don’t want to make a move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If Rasuti is here, she can take care of it but she went out for a homecoming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon is quite large and looking at its color, I know that it is not related to Doraim, his wife, or Rasuti. Because of that, I threw the AFT in its spear form to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was evaded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike Doraim’s wife, it knows that it needs to evade my attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It laughs while looking at us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw the spear the second time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was evaded again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I narrowed my eyes and threw it the third time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it doesn’t hit, I’ll it throw again and again until I hit it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will not get tired by throwing the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, the AFT will return to my hand at my will.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll never run out of spear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before it becomes a battle of stamina, I want to try something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw the spear again and before the dragon evades it, I call it back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then throw it again.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It is a simple <em class="calibre5">feint</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it fall for it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was a bit uneasy but it went well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The thrown spear pierced the wing of the <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did it!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the joy I felt, I forgot to call back the spear. The spear reached the mountain behind the dragon and cloud of dust went up there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ooops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I call back the spear again, I no longer see the <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that it fell in the forest and hidden itself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I won’t let you escape.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria, Kuudel, and Corone were injured earlier so I had Loo to fly me there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since we are now flying in a high altitude, I can now see where the dragon fell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s completely exposed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw my spear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon can evade it but since there are trees that obstructed its view, it sews its other undamaged wing on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll have to end it now. I called back my spear immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I threw the spear aiming at its big body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And hit it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m sure that I hit it but it seems like my spear only passed through it as it shrank.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spear hits the ground while breaking all of the trees in its path.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did I hallucinate?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I recognize what’s happening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the same phenomenon happening every time Doraim and Rasuti turn into human.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Surrender, I surrender. I’m sorry. Please forgive me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I heard a woman’s voice.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Ehehe. I’m sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sitting in seiza at the entrance of the village, the woman lightly apologize. She’s the dragon earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s a big chested woman who seems to have a jolly personality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised that she was introduced as Doraim’s oneesan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beside Haruken are Doraim, Doraim’s wife, Rasuti, and seven people I don’t know(given what has happened, probably dragons too) who are also in seiza.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Allow me to introduce them. Starting from the right is My grandfather, grandmother, father’s second older sister, her husband, their daughter, father’s little sister, and father’s little brother-. 」</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hyrmMPr/u39-3e1760b8-33a5-4c9c-95cb-f78012b2b9ac.jpg">

<p class="calibre2">Rasuti introduces the 7 people I don’t know while lowering her head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A dandy middle-aged man, a gentle middle-aged woman, a woman with determined eyes, a <em class="calibre5">macho </em>looking man who looks like a certain general, a girl with horns and tail like Rasuti, a <em class="calibre5">gorgeous </em>curly haired woman, and an ikemen young man.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard their names but I can’t remember them since they are kind of confusing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll have them tell me again later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In other words….Doraim’s father and mother, second sister and her husband, niece, imouto and otouto. Does that mean that Hakuren is his eldest sister?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">All of them are in seiza. They came here as soon as the forest fire Hakuren set was extinguished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand that they are not hostile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So, what is happening?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing my question, all of them turned their face sideways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the girl who looks younger than Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s a <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> so even though she looks like that, she’s probably older than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because none of them wants to talk, I decided to choose the one who I think can speak up from them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mrs. Doraim, can you please explain?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at Doraim, he definitely can’t say something against his older sister.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have known this type of younger brother from my previous world, they are the type that can’t go against their older sister.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The woman introduced as the second sister is somewhat similar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The eldest sister is Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The second sister is either the type that obeys her older sister or the type that opposes her. (My subjective view)</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if she’s the type who opposes, she should have talked already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She did not talk so it means that she’s the type who obeys.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for her husband, he’s a <em class="calibre5">macho</em> but I can feel that he’s been trying hard to become air since earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I removed him as a candidate because of sympathy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cannot involve their daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim’s little sister is probably the youngest daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The youngest daughters are experts in living easy. (My subjective view)</p>
<p class="calibre2">They won’t do anything that can be considered as opposing their older sister.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though she might talk if I urge her, I don’t know her personality yet so I can’t do something that dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village will definitely be damaged if these sisters quarrel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Doraim’s little brother….he’s an ikemen young man but he smells like a younger brother who can’t defy his older sister like Doraim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t choose him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no younger brother that can go against his older sister. (My subjective view)</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, the only ones left are Doraim’s parents, wife, and Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if the parents really have the plan of talking about their daughter, they should have done it already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, there is a high chance that they’ll cover their daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Judging the remaining two, Doraim’s wife might find it easier to talk compared to Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim’s wife is Hakuren’s sister in law….looking at Doraim’s wife’s attitude, she seems to be fine with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s the <em class="calibre5">type </em>that could say a few words to her sister in law.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will explain the circumstances of this incident.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">My guess is correct, Doraim’s wife explained what happened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It all began during Rasuti’s homecoming.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that she only returned to Doraim’s nest but she went to her grandparents on the mountain in the north.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of them are gathering there for a status report.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Let’s get off topic for a bit. Let’s talk about my recent nightlife.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Loo gave birth and Tier is pregnant so the villager’s desire to be pregnant(?) increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to that I never spent my night alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is pointless even if I say I want to be alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I argue, the number of applicants continue to increase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I knew it, they already slipped on my bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no chance to resist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I noticed it, I’ve already done it with all the elves, all the onis, Gran Maria, Kuudel, Corone, and even Flora.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, if we talk about the beastkins, I only did it with Senna.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other beastgirls tried to but I refused them since they are still too young.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are beastboys here so they shouldn’t rush things and be patient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, my heart feels at ease when talking with dwarves and lizardmen…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti and Frau did their best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They persevered but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">It all went to the drain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were swept by the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others also cooperated to hook them up with me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My last stronghold is Rasuti’s servants, Bulga and Stiffano.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hang in there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are looking at me with strange eyes sometimes but do your best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Off topic talk ends.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「In other words, you raided this village because your niece found a partner earlier than you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re wrong. I only tried to ascertain the power of my niece’s partner.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren puffs her cheeks and protests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What kind of excessively worthless reason is that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I realized why she said that and why the others did not say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, how can they say that their daughter was jealous of their grandchild or their older sister was jealous of their niece?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah….if you’re not going to rampage anymore, let’s forget about it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, it must have been hard to be in seiza. I’ll have someone prepare chairs and food for you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti’s relatives are all <em class="calibre5">dragons</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, considering Rasuti, I can’t just tell them to go home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hooray! The alcohol here is delicious, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren was the first to stand up and tried to head for the village immediately but I grip her face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren, you can’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How’s your wings?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, ah, yeah, I can’t fly for a while…ano, why are you gripping my face?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t mind it. When you play, you should also clean up.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-it hurts…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">You must do something for the part of the forest you burnt first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can deal with it using the AFT but my heart can’t accept Hakuren participating in a banquet until after she has done something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do your best to tidy it up.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was three days later before Hakuren was able to participate in the banquet.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-61"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 69 &ndash; Dragon Family</h1><p class="calibre2">Doraim’s father, Dors.<span id="calibre_link-167"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim’s mother, Raimeiren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked Rasuti about them again to remember their names.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim’s older sister, Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Remembering her is unpleasant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another older sister, Suiren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She resembles Hakuren but it is impossible for one to mistook her for Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim’s little sister’s name is Sekiren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren, Suiren, Sekiren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their names are similar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The little brother’s name is Domaim.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think this is some sort of test for my memory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best to remember them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Suiren’s macho husband’s name is Maxbergawk.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: マークスベルガーク &ndash; Makusuberugaku, open for suggestions.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">I was told that he preferred to be called Mack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike his appearance, he’s having a hard time in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like we can become friends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mack and Suiren’s daughter is Herzernark.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She permitted me to call her with her nickname Herze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best to remember them all.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Ano Rasuti-san. Dors….sama is the dragon king of the northern continent, am I right? I even heard that he forced a former demon king-sama into retirement.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t know about that former demon king but grandfather indeed lives in the northern continent. So, who proclaimed him as the dragon king?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「He was called like that only in the demon king’s country….also, Raimeiren-sama, did she hail from the southern continent…?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She’s usually there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Th-they’re a married couple huh. Also, I didn’t know that Rasuti-san and Herzernark-sama were relatives.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha, we quarrel from time to time….By the way, why are you address me as “san” while you address Herze as “sama”?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m sorry, Rasuti-sama.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s the opposite, address her as you address me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Rasuti-san and Herze-san?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good good. Now, come with me and I’ll introduce you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please, you don’t have to.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">The welcoming banquet for Doraim’s clan lasted for about 5 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the longest banquet ever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I only participated starting the 3rd day which means everything started on again that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During this banquet, the ones who shone the most are the dwarves.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Even if the other parties’ are dragons, they were able to serve them using their vast knowledge of alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This certainly taste great.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s a little stronger than the previous one….oh yes, how about this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Putting fruit change the taste? Umu, it’s easier to drink. It seems like I can drink as much as I want.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Distilled liquor is the most popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The second most popular is <em class="calibre5">cocktails</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It all started when I added fruits to the alcohol made by the dwarves since it’s too strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anything related to alcohol was studied to the earnest by the dwarves. Soon enough, they were able to become expert <em class="calibre5">bartender</em> that can make all kinds of <em class="calibre5">cocktails</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Recently, they even began researching for foods that are compatible with alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at the dragons, it seems like their alcohol research paid off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Among the villagers, if the ones who shine the most are the dwarves, the busiest are the onis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragons can really eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Foods disappear one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They not only have to cook for the dragons but the villagers too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the babysitter group help in the kitchen while the high elves serve as the waitresses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they still can’t keep up with the demand so apples, <em class="calibre5">oranges, bananas, pineapples</em>, watermelon, and strawberries are served in between.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Herze seems to like them more than alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks like a small girl but she eats more than her body size.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Of course, those five days are not five days of eating. There are also entertainments and games.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With regards to entertainment, there are songs, dances, and other performances. It is at a <em class="calibre5">level </em>of entertainment similar to the ones performed during weddings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are even <em class="calibre5">performances</em> using otedama and kendama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I only have seen the second half, I think the best performance is the slapstick comedy of Rasuti’s servants, Bulga and Stiffano.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it seems like the dragons are already used to it. Well, they are originally serving dragons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Kuh, you should have performed a new one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unwillingly, I also appeared on the battlefield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was sent to the stage-like place but what should I do? I had experience in working as a society member until I fell down because of a disease in my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I had a strong weapon called experience.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I perform those things that are performed during drinking parties, they will surely laugh their lungs out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do mimicry!</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mimicry?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No!</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they don’t know the <em class="calibre5">original</em>, they won’t get it!</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a different world.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Away</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, it’s like a foreign country.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Foreign country.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu, I also attended parties with foreigners.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Take this!</p>
<p class="calibre2">A childish magic trick!</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the dragons are already used to see that kind of trick.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Magic tricks don’t seem to be rare because there are a lot of people who can use magic here.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In regards to gaming, they played <em class="calibre5">golf, chess</em>, and go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When they want to leisurely play, they go with<em class="calibre5"> golf</em> and if they want to have a battle of wits, they go with <em class="calibre5">chess</em> and go.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When playing, I refrained from giving them alcohol and offer them tea, black tea, <em class="calibre5">coffee</em>, and<em class="calibre5"> juice</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because they don’t have a bottom line when consuming alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we let them, I’m sure they’ll continue to drink alcohol and stop only when they sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Luckily, they evaluated the drinks other than alcohol high so I’m relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although there are no troubles, when they are playing go or chess, it becomes a heated battle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I reminded them the meaning of entertainment and have the most skillful villagers to teach them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the kuros are not unreasonable enough to suddenly beat up their opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had them remember and follow the <em class="calibre5">rules</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter if it is victory or defeat, I began conveying the fun the <em class="calibre5">game </em>brought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem is the matches between dragons who doesn’t know the meaning of the word “entertainment”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially when it comes to the matches between Doraim’s parents or between his sisters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though their matches are battles between amateur, it feels like a championship match between masters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the aftermath, several cows and goats fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since go and chess are one on one battle, I tried taking out sugoroku since it can be played by a number of people but their eyes ended up on the mah-jong table.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I say “as expected of dragons”?</p>
<p class="calibre2">They perfectly remembered the rules and picked up the tiles skillfully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I expected a happy family mah-jong play but I guess I’m wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will the dragons die if they don’t fight?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The winner is the high elf Rize.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She persevered and managed to continue playing even if her dragon opponents are not holding their bloodlust back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, as the aftermath, the chickens did not lay eggs for a couple of days because of the bloodlust.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was worried about Tier because she’s pregnant but she got angry at me because I put her on the same level as the chickens.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Alfred remained as calm as usual, his doting parents, me and Loo, talked about how great he will become in the future.</p>


<p class="calibre2">That’s how the days passed and the dragons are now going to leave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you for taking care of us.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dors, as their representative, bowed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No no」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Half of our food stocks disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it won’t trouble us this winter, it’s still an expensive expense.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Maa, it’s probably alright since everyone had fun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather than that, the problem now is that they indirectly demanded souvenirs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I prepared various alcohols and crops, I never thought that the things they want are the entertainment equipments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially chess, go, and mah-jong tiles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A great man does not make things himself, I remember this saying when they asked me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I cannot pass them worn out equipments, I promise to send them newly made ones.</p>


<p class="calibre2">And, they left with me, Rasuti, and Hakuren waving at them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hakuren?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They already left so, why are you still here?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, you really want me to say it….please stop gripping my face, it hurts.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why are you still here?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father asked me to stay to serve you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I look at Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti nods. It doesn’t seem like a lie.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Rasuti, are you alright with your aunt staying here? If that bothers you I’ll send her away.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha. It’s alright. Hakuren(my father’s)aneesama and I are on good terms.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufufu, I’m the one who raise Rasuti-chan…. ouch ouch ouch」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, if Rasuti says that she won’t be a bother then it’s okay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Serve huh. I understand. Prepare to work to death.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ano, village chief? I have been thinking about it, why are you treating me differently compared to others? More specifically, you are treating me badly…. ouch ouch ouch」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, we gained one more resident.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Laboratory, somewhere inside the demon king’s castle</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You have obtained the family tree of dragons? We received information other than the parent-daughter relationship of the gatekeeper dragon and Rasutisumoon?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. According to the report, the dragon king Dors and southern <em class="calibre5">typhoon</em> dragon Raimeiren are a couple and the gatekeeper dragon Doraim is one of their offsprings. The gatekeeper dragon’s wife is the northern white dragon princess Grafaroon, and their daughter is the famous crazy dragon Rasutisumoon. Also, the western human territory evil dragon Maxbergak is the husband of the elder sister of the gatekeeper dragon, the magic dragon Suiren and their daughter is none other than the violent dragon Herzenark. Also, the true dragon Hakuren who raged the west a hundred years ago, the flame dragon Sekiren who raged the south 30 years ago, are also offsprings of the dragon king and <em class="calibre5">typhoon</em> dragon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: I’m also wondering why there’s no info about Domaim.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Those famous dragons are related by blood? Also, each of them has a title of their own, right? This is a historic discovery. However, is that information reliable? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The informant heard it personally from “the dragons in question” so it’s reliable. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dragons…in question? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, she asked them herself. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: This is supposed to be gender neutral. I only made it feminine because we all know that it’s Frau.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Was there someone from the demon king’s army that is talented enough to ask a dragon? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did it not come from demon king-sama himself? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, it is a report submitted to demon king-sama. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So it is a different demon. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s right….secure the talent who sent that report by hook or by crook. If that person is good enough, that person might even get a dragon scale. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, even with one scale, we can make exceptional protective gears and weapons. I’ll find out who reported it no matter what. 」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Big Tree Village</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, what do you have there? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It was left by the dragons…. scales.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">One piece is about the size of one tatami mat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It looks a bit different from Rasuti’s. If not for its thickness, I’ll say that this is a flat rock. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, but its pretty light. Want to try lifting it? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Sure…..Ah, it’s really light. Heh. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That is from Dors-san, that one over there is from Raimeiren-san. On that side is…is that from Suiren-san? No, it is probably from Sekiren-san. They said that I can sold them from money but…How much are they worth?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ehto…Those scales over there are probably from Herzenark-san. She’s the only one who’ll have a scale as small as that…but one small scale from her is enough to build a luxurious mansion in the demon king’s kingdom’s capital. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They are that valuable? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「And there’s a moderate number of them in front of me? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I gather them, they can fill a small house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. That’s why I feel like something inside me broke. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Do you think I should sell them to either Michael-san or Beezel? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That would cause trouble. You should throw them in a basement and seal….no, I mean save them. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Save as in saving money or something valuable.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Indeed, I don’t want trouble too. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t have money problem so I guess I’ll save them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Alright, let’s put the scales in a house and make it into a special designated place. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, that’s bothersome ouch ouch ouch」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Please leave it to me.」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-80"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 70 &ndash; Dragon’s Gratitude and Hakuren</h1><p class="calibre2">When I sent the entertainment equipments ordered by Doraim’s relatives, they sent back various things in return.<span id="calibre_link-168"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they sent it for me, I’ll check if there is something I might like. There are some unusual trees, plants, crops, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are also a lot of precious metals and personal accessories.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess these are their payment for the banquet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like they gave too much but it will be hard to send them back since I already receive it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does it include reward for pressing Hakuren?</p>


<p class="calibre2">The things they sent also includes paper. It is hard so I’ll use them to make cards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The end product is quite good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I make a traditional japanese playing card too…no, I can’t remember all the images so let’s forget about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I obediently made cards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After making it, I realized something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wooden tag cards are good enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Paper cards will surely be damaged immediately due to intense battles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I continued making cards but I’m now using wooden tags.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I especially made wooden tag cards for matches that will probably damage cards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The disadvantage of the wooden cards is <em class="calibre5">shuffling</em>. I gave up trying to shuffle it and put them in a box to <em class="calibre5">shuffle</em> by mixing method.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The cards are popular with the beastkins, high elves, onis, and dwarves</p>


<p class="calibre2">Next is making a picture story for the beastboys.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My true intention is to make simple reading practicing material for Alfred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The story are… Momotaro, Urashima Taro, Kintaro, Hanasaki ka Jii-san, Kobu Tori Jii-san, Warashibe Chouja, Kaguya-hime…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it be alright?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I change them a little to fit this world?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I picked one from various candidates via lottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the winner is,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachi-kachi_Yama" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> Kachi-kachi Yama</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: It will only take you less than five minutes to read the summary in wikipedia so click the hyperlink. It will make the next lines funny so I recommend you to do so.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, the obaasan was killed and the tanuki died in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I changed Kachi-kachi Yama a little. I made the rabbit’s avenger move milder since I don’t want it to be villainous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I presented the story to Loo, Tier, and the high elves first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were heavy opinions about the rabbit rather than the tanuki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The tanuki believed the rabbit only to be betrayed.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How did the humans make friends with a rabbit?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kachi-Kachi Yama was scrapped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the second work.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crab_and_the_Monkey" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2">Monkey-Crab Battle</a>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I feel malice in the lottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: This is also a story of revenge just like the Kachi-kachi yama.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">And as expected, there are questions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Chestnut and excrement, the mortar also has personality but, why is it that the persimmon tree or its fruits don’t have personality?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The monkey was able to trade its persimmon seed for the onigiri using its own intelligence, can it really be considered as swindling? Also, the monkey threw the persimmon as requested, isn’t it the crab’s fault for not being able to properly catch it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The one that did not take the persimmon itself is the wrong one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「And what’s with cooperating with revenge just because someone said it so? It looks like the bees and chestnuts planned to kill the monkeys for a long time, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In the first place, the parent crab threatened the persimmon tree, why did they ignore that?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And so, the children story I told them became a serious university-level discussion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I tell them the story of Momotaro, they will obviously talk about unfair labor because of a life-threatening battle for one kibi dango….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Monkey-crab battle scrapped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I decided to obediently make up a picture-story book for this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I like the story that the village chief thought of.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like I made some fans however, I’m a bit troubled because they are not my original idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I used the generic fairy tale opening sentence and used it as a draft.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I got the gist of it, I slipped in the story of a famous manga. I was even demanded about the continuation of the story.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t remember the details of the famous manga perfectly so I supplemented various things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sensei, I’m sorry.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Hakuren did various work in the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s older than Rasuti and is more powerful than her so she can do anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her head is also not bad and she bears etiquette in mind. She’s also unlike Frau who only knows common sense of the nobles and not of a villager. She has no problem with her common sense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem with her is she does not do anything unless told to and complains about everything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After complaining, she’ll do what she was asked to seriously but I want her to move and start doing something on her own will.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She has a lack of independence….Maa, is she really a dragon?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, I feel like she resembles Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are strong and lack aggressiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aggressive dragons are annoying so I’m good with them being like that…</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, unless I gave her instructions, she will <em class="calibre5">job change</em> into a NEET and will only eat and sleep in her room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She complains a lot everytime I gave her an order so I don’t ask her to do some menial jobs….</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this the correct way to deal with Hakuren?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be troublesome if I always give her instructions….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to ask her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ouch ouch ouch, suddenly barging in my room to grip my face, ouch ouch ouch.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told her why I’m there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, the instructing her to do something is not an effective method.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I have to do something to motivate her for a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to motivate her. What I’m presently doing is like digging a hole to throw her in, then filling it up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I reflected.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">She <em class="calibre5">gives up</em> in one day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, how can I motivate her for a long time?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I have no motivation. You should stop on making me do meaningless things. It’s making me crazy.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are you fine with just eating and sleeping in your room?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eating and sleeping in my room is a million times better.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see, I understand. Refrain from complaining in the future.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t say that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I gained something, more or less.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….eeehh」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Nothing.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Hakuren first lived in Rasuti’s house, but now she’s living in a vacant room at my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, that’s it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">As a result, I had Hakuren try various things and she settled into the position of teacher of the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For now, here students are the beastkins, hatchlings, kuro’s pups, and the spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are working hard to be able to read, write, and calculate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If the people of the village become smarter, I will be at ease.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speculation aside, it’s not a bad thing.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-99"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 71 &ndash; Distribution and Flora</h1><p class="calibre2">I consulted the villagers about the thank-you items I received from Dors but they unanimously said that they are all mine.<span id="calibre_link-169"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I decided to divide them and distribute them to the villagers on the pretext of those items being their share.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was troublesome. I still have a lot of things to do so I had Loo, Tier, Frau, and Rasuti to do it for me.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I am thankful for the paper but I also want my village to be able to make it at some point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next year, let’s raise plants that can be easily processed to be papers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I also received rare trees, plants, and crops, I’ll raise them too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Loo, Tier, and Flora went crazy when they saw them.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though I’m thankful to Dors, most of the items he sent were not helpful to this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That is a “Labyrinth Augite”. It is an <em class="calibre5">item</em> that is used for <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> management.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti answered my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Dungeon</em> management?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. When we dragons build our nest, we will not live in it unless we can remodel the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see, then up to what<em class="calibre5"> size</em> can it control?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, are they living in their nest in their dragon form?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, so that’s how it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I almost always only see them in their human form so I thought they live in their nest with their human form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wait, aren’t they living in their nest in their human form?</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Frau and Michael-san stayed in Doraim’s nest before, I heard that there are proper rooms there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We can only transform when we became adult….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked at Rasuti’s horn and tail and somewhat sympathize with her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apart from Rasuti and Herze, all other dragons look completely human in their human form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s stop talking about this topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to talk about something else, so what is a <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> is a naturally occurring magical power pool. A place concentrated with magical power is a place where monsters gather. I hear that monsters find it easy to live in those kind of places.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In addition, when magical power increases, the dungeon will get bigger. Labyrinth Augite is like a control stone that makes you able to force the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> to get bigger.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it a valuable stone?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is. But grandfather can afford to give one to you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It seems so.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">If not, I don’t think he’ll include it to his thank-you items.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I’m a bit worried after receiving an <em class="calibre5">item</em> for<em class="calibre5"> dungeon</em> management.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I mean, I don’t have business with<em class="calibre5"> dungeons</em>.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Can anyone use this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「As long as someone can use magic, that person can use it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I can’t use magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Somehow, its unnecessariness has increased drastically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The lamias are living in a <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>, do you think they can use this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The lamias are skillful in magic so I’m sure they can.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Then, I’ll lend it to the lamias.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Lamia tribe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are the ruler of the<em class="calibre5"> dungeon</em> on the south of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, there are about 50 of them living in the depths of the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> and they seem to be putting various monsters under their control.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> is pretty big and a part of it even extends to the mountain in the south where Doraim’s nest is located.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is also the reason why it took the kuros over a year to capture it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently negotiating with the lamias. I’m planning to have them transport goods to Doraim’s place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ever since I saw them being able to carry so much luggage before, I had my eyes on them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So far, I always ask Doraim and Rasuti and there’s also Hakuren who I can ask to transport goods but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that dragons are not very suitable for transporting goods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though neither Michael-san nor Beezel said anything about it, I can feel it somehow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, aside from Doraim and Rasuti, Hakuren doesn’t want want to transform in her dragon form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was worried because I thought that her wings are still injured but it seems like she only wants me to see her in her human form.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How cute of her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, I got derailed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we utilize the “labyrinth augite”, we can make a direct route to Doraim’s nest to the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, even if we use the “labyrinth augite”, the dungeon will not immediately change.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, it will change but it will be slow….the change you requested is also very substantial so I think it will take a hundred years to materialize.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Dragons</em> are really patient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked the lamias to transport the goods to Doraim’s nest and their <em class="calibre5">route </em>will be going through the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lamias undertook my request and will have the monsters they placed under their control to carry the goods.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like it is faster that way than carrying it themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given the current condition, it will take them five to seven days to carry the goods from the village to Doraim’s nest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The inconsistent number of days is due to changing weather.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still, I’m grateful to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The remuneration for the lamias is my village’s crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told them to give the monsters under them too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I might need to expand the field again.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Because of the lamia transport service, the transactions with Michael-san became easier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From Doraim’s nest to Shashaato City, it will take Doraim half a day flight but it will take 20 days on foot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The biggest factor for that is the iron forest in between them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it is not the forest of death, there are still many strong monsters. It seems like only <em class="calibre5">top </em>adventurers can get through the forest and reach Doraim’s nest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">20 days on foot of <em class="calibre5">top</em> adventurers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible for ordinary merchants to go there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wait, isn’t that forest more dangerous than the forest of death?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m beginning to question the reputations of the forest here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the iron forest is the biggest factor since traveling there consumes the most time. If the one who’ll transport the goods are Doraim’s servants, the travel time will shorten from 20 to 5 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, with the use of the lamias and Doraim’s servants, the transport time will be 10 to 12 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it’s still too slow compared to the two-day travel time for dragons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the new transport system, marine products from Shashaato City are delivered to the village and the village’s crops are delivered to Shashaato City regularly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Life has become a bit more convenient.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Flora finally made miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ohhh」</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the news that made me the happiest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the taste is still lacking, those are definitely miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In order to spread my joy, I cooked miso and soy sauce flavored dishes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pickled miso, grilled meat miso.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meat with soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Baked corn with soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Miso soup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cucumber miso.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Miso flavored nabe and soy sauce flavored nabe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the villager’s consensus, it was decided to have a consistent production of miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next year, let’s expand the soybean field.</p>


<p class="calibre2">My name is Flora.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora Sakutou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I may not be a match for my aneesama but I’m a famous vampire.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s why I’m basically staying to the place where I am.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I rarely go outside since there is no point in going out anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, it doesn’t mean that I only eat and sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Boredom is my enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s why I have a hobby.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Which is medicine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Researching about medicine is fun.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Because I feel like I’m peeking at the mystery of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are even people from far away places seeking for the medicine I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no such thing as medicine that can revive the dead but I think that illnesses can be cured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I’m currently addicted in making miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since miso and soy sauce can be made using similar process, the village chief asked to make them simultaneously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief is amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He has a lot of knowledge I never heard about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He also taught me about the concept of bacteria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This can also be used for medicine research.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How to make miso and soy sauce …to put it simply, the village chief told me to culture bacteria on soybeans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I don’t know how, it seems like the process of cheese making is similar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I took over the miso and soy sauce making from the village chief and worked hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He even made an exclusive building for me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, there are no results.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It takes time culturing it so I simultaneously started another one before seeing the result.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t even remember how much soybean and wheat had rotted until now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was worth it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, at last, I’ve managed to make miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief was pleased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The villagers are pleased too after they taste the dishes that uses miso and soy sauce.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They’re really delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was delicious enough that everyone was impressed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the reward for my hardship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tears even came out of my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the village chief said these words to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Your next step is improving the taste.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t get what he said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Taste?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it was delicious enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I fearfully asked the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The miso and soy sauce today, how many points are you going to give them?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Flora worked hard.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, it got a lot of points, right? I’ll be delighted if you let me hear it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Ehto…If it is out of 10, I’ll give it five points.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Say it honestly.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….out of 10, about 2 points. It is still at the entrance of being miso and soy sauce.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">My feeling right now, it is similar to climbing the top of a mountain only to know that it is the false summit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though this might be a good thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It means that the village chief is expecting something from me so I will respond to him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please, look forward to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will make the miso and soy sauce that will satisfy you!</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I also reflected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll be a little nice to the oni <em class="calibre5">maids </em>from now on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I apologize for saying absurd things to them until now.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In the distant future, Flora will be called the “Queen of Fermented Food”.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-16"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 72 &ndash; Fraurem’s Smile</h1><p class="calibre2">「Father? For you to suddenly meet with me, did something happen?」<span id="calibre_link-170"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「A problem occurred.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Problem?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, the princess is gathering soldiers.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The princess is gathering soldiers? Why? Is she planning to invade some place?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This place」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This place….this village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The princess….I don’t think she’s that stupid.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「When you were there, you are the type of person who controls others. Your replacement used the fact that you’re the princess’ favourite to stir things up.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My replacement?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The second daughter of Count Glitch and the fourth daughter of Count Pugyar.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are they too stupid to understand the word power! How can they get near the princess with that IQ!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「While I was on the west, I learned that most of the people we’ve sent here were removed. The two of them together with their allies are making their move. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…so, why do they want to attack the village? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Those who remained on the side of the princess requested for your return and the princess agreed. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You mean, they are planning to invade this village because of me? What are you thinking, princess?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She probably thought that if this village is crushed, you will return. After crushing the village where you serve as the governor, those two are planning to frame you with sedition in order to eliminate you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Haa…..idiots.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, the prerequisite of their plan is “crushing this village” which is a mistake in the first place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「But honestly speaking, how do they plan on crossing the mountain at the east of the capital? Or are they planning to reach the forest on a normal route? And even if they arrive here, how are they planning to break the defensive patrol of this village which are the angels and the kuros? They can only possibly set their foot here if they use teleportation….did you find their plan on how they’ll deal with these questions of mine? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I didn’t hear anything about those but….I was told that the princess is fully cooperating with them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ehto….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「For now, demon king-sama is holding them down but the situation is doubtful.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king-sama really spoils the princess but doesn’t he know the things about this village? He should stop the invasion at all cost.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Many people do not understand the threat of this village. Even if demon king-sama knows how dangerous this village is, he can’t say it in public.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Certainly, my governing ability will surely be doubted if the public knows about it. So, what does father want me to do?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Those who don’t know the threat of this village, I want you to teach them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can you be more specific?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I want you to gather the strength of this village and kick off the gathered army of the princess before they depart.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You want Rasuti-san to go on a rampage in the capital?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dragons will really cause trouble. Angels and vampires too. I want you to knock them off but don’t annihilate them. I also want you to minimize the damage to the capital. But first, do you think they will follow your instructions?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Well, I’m living in this village too. Also, I think that if we pay them neatly, they’ll consider it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, in any case, Zabuton-san and Kuro-san’s group are excluded since it is impossible for me to control how much damage they’ll make…..the beastkins are still young so it will be the high elves, the onis, the lizardmen, and elder dwarves. Father, can I ask you a question?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This matter, is it alright for me to inform the village chief?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This matter is strictly confidential so I’ll go talk to the village chief.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Explaining the circumstances to the village chief…. I think Hakuren-san will hear it too and if that happens, it won’t be strange if the capital disappears.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The capital will disappear? Who is Hakuren? 」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「She’s the older sister of the gatekeeper dragon. She’s currently living in this village…have you not read my report? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No….I stayed in the west for a long time and as soon as I returned, I heard about the circumstances with the princess. I’m sorry. And that’s a problem. Can you do something about it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Even if you ask me that…. We can’t extract war potential from this village without the village chief knowing.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two troubled people suddenly heard a voice of a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufu. You seem to be in trouble.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Loo-san」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I heard what you are talking about. I have a good idea, do you want to hear it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So obedient. If you gather war potential from outside this village, you don’t have to tell the village chief.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Outside the village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The lamias. Though I don’t know how much war potential they gathered, 10 lamias can surely scare them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What do you think father?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The main force is gathered by Count Glitch and Count Pugyar.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is their quality and number?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They are demon soldiers who are on defense duty and there are about 300 of them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then three lamias are enough.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I think one lamia alone is already excessive….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Safety measures. Frau will lead them as she returns home. Ah, I’ll be the one who’ll inform the village chief. Don’t forget souvenirs, my best regards.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. I’ll negotiate with the lamias.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t forget to bribe them in secrecy. After this….I think they will understand more about this village and anyone hostile against it will not be forgiven.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Of course. Then, let’s go right away. Father, the lamias are staying in the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> south of here, can you send me there?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand….you, what’s with that scary smile?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really? You must be imagining things… However, even though I have experienced hardship in this village, the people of the capital are doing stupid things….I’m a little envious of them.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">「That….are those girls alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Behind Frau are 10 ladies. They have gorgeous hairstyles, beautiful skins, but are wearing suffocating, one-piece tunic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are demons like Frau but they look like humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「These girls want to migrate to this village. They are even “dying” to be here so can you accept them?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind but….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I call Frau to the side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Their eyes are dead, are they okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">My first impression to these girls, given the clothes they are wearing, are noble ladies who fell into slavery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They’re alright. All of them are my acquaintances and will work as my subordinate for a while. Ah, if they do anything against the village, please don’t hesitate to dispose of them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dispose them? That’s scary. Well, they will probably fail in various ways at first but that wouldn’t matter if we consider the long-term effect.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So, what about that girl?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was one lady who was receiving special treatment.</p>

<p class="calibre2">She’s about the same age as Frau or probably a little younger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That girl has a pure white long hair and is wearing expensive looking clothes. She’s also sitting on a chair and seems to have a high status.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She’s a guest. She’s like a guest governor…. She’d like to see the everyday life of this village so treat her like she doesn’t exist.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can’t believe that someone will go to this village with such reason. Ehto…I’m Hiraku the village chief. Welcome to Big Tree Village. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hih 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s frightened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By chance, is she scared of men?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I never heard anything about that. Yuri-sama, greetings.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-I’m sorry. I’m Yuri. Please take care of me for a while. Nice to meet you too.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Of course, if there is something you need, please let me know. Then…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gathered the kuros and the spiderlings to introduce them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I don’t properly introduce them, the kuros will chase them and the spiderlings will bind them with threads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Areh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The newly arrived ladies, including Yuri, collapsed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Maa, it can’t be helped. I made them wear those clothes because I already forecasted this. Please be relieved.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After seeing the wonderful smiling face of Frau, I head out to gather people who’ll take care of them.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Frau-san, I had a good time last time. Please invite me again.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Aren’t you going to attack the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> on the north next? There seems to be a giant residing there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Oh, I never heard about that. Also, there’s a <em class="calibre5">dungeon </em>in the north? Do you know the specific location?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Later, I saw Frau and the lamias getting along pretty well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it’s a good thing….</p>
<p class="calibre2">What are they talking about?</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-35"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 73 &ndash; Gran Maria</h1><p class="calibre2">My name is Gran Maria.<span id="calibre_link-171"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m a little famous angel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the result of me following various orders of Tier-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I realized it, together with my colleague, Kuudel and Corone, we are already called “angels of holocaust”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Angels of Holocaust”</p>
<p class="calibre2">We never committed holocaust so I don’t know why we are called that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Could it be because of our battle with the ogre race about a hundred years ago?</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, we exterminated several hundreds of ogres but we missed some of them so we basically did not erase their race from existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No way, their kingdom no longer exist?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What an unfortunate incident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When attacking enemies, we always go with full power and destroy them all head on….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, it is truly an unfortunate incident.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However…..I think that’s still insufficient to be considered as holocaust.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are enemy and they only half collapsed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, Tier-sama and I were the only ones who attacked since Kuudel and Corone have different assignments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is strange that the three of us were called “angels of holocaust”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s leave that matter aside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The most important thing is that I’m Tier-sama’s faithful servant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Whatever what has become my title, it wouldn’t matter.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, right now, Tier-sama is acting independently while chasing her mortal enemy Lulushi.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know why but every time Tier-sama and Lulushi met, they would start fighting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are always fighting but there has never been a conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason is because they’ll leave things unsettled once they’re satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps they are on good terms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I asked Tier-sama about it, I got scolded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like behind Lulushi is a mighty vampire clan so killing her would only bring trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, since we are angels, even if we are killed, nobody will take revenge for us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have never thought of such a thing before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria, you have become clever.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Nice girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I, who have become clever, should only be fought others but should not be killed by them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I said that to myself and smile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I think she’s pursuing Lulushi now because she now has a prize on her head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, me, Kuudel, and Corone will exterminate the bandits living in a certain mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Normally, I wouldn’t even bother with it but it can’t be helped since we already accepted the request.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Without money, we angels will find it hard to live.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those bandits are former mercenaries but with the three of us, it will be finished in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This gave me a good feeling and I can’t stop laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only hope that bandits like this group will increase more. We are troubled because not one group will show up in several years after we crush one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, they are not a match for me, Kuudel, and Corone. Now, let’s get the reward and take it easy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, although I said that I’ll take it easy, I still have to train.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must be battle ready all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, I’ll die unexpectedly once a powerful enemy suddenly appears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want to die so I will spare no effort to win and survive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier-sama returned after a few years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did she have fun with Lulushi?</p>
<p class="calibre2">….eh? Prepare for a trip?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hurry up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, yes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ehto…so where are we going?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Forest of death?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Isn’t that a pretty dangerous place?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will wear my best equipment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’ll bring the lizardmen with us?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That doesn’t matter but….why are we buying chickens on the way?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What are you trying to…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I do not have complaints.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will do my best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The forest of death is a very dangerous place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not a place anyone wants to go especially if you’re alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is because it is not easy to escape there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is necessary to have guards even if it is time to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because camping in the forest of death is like seeking death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, the elusive elves living in this forest and the beastkins living on the nearby village know where the safe zones are but none of us do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, when we entered the forest of death, I flew around at a high altitude without going to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the best method to deal with our present situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I fly halfway lower that I’m currently doing, I’ll be caught by the webs of the <em class="calibre5">demon spiders</em> living in the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Demon spider.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">They are troublesome enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that if you saw one, it is the time of your death. It is a monster of terror.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To us angels, you can say that they are our natural enemy due to affinity.</p>

<p class="calibre2">There are also other troublesome monsters in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A beast monster that is quick and can use magic, <em class="calibre5">inferno wolf</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A group can probably manage if they met one alone but if they met more than one, they should prepare for their death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, seeing them in groups is rare though.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An enormous snake, <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a monster that nullifies most magic and uses its own huge body as a weapon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their most troublesome ability is their regenerative power and vitality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how much you damage it, it will just recover and that will break the heart of any opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It uses its regenerative power in order to hunt other ferocious monsters…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that I think about it, this forest is really fearsome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our movement as a big group can be considered a quite risky move in this forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier-sama, me, Kuudel, Corone, and 15 lizardmen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lizardmen also have the ability to fight but it is impossible for them to do that now since they have a lot of luggage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We have no choice but to persevere.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I plan on not sleeping because of the dangers I have thought of, but Tier-sama told us to sleep in turns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I don’t know where our destination is, it’s still probably a long way ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Nani?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I would like to sleep now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, I’m really exhausted and pressured after we enter the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuudel and Corone, you too, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Well, I don’t!</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, we’ll take our turn in order of our age but….it was decided by lottery in the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering our current state, it is necessary for us to sleep in turns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our advancement will slow down but at least we are not letting our guard down.</p>


<p class="calibre2">On the way, I saw a <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> at a distance. Tier-sama decided to take a detour but it will take a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Grappler bear</em> is a huge bear that can kill <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it is very difficult to kill a <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>, it can be confirmed that its offensive capability is high.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be possible for the four of us to go on without taking a detour but what will happen to the lizardmen? Thus, it was decided that we’ll take a detour.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Tier-sama’s destination is a residence in the center of the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>

<p class="calibre2">Though I am dubious whether there is such a place in this forest, I was surprised when we arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a field in the middle of the forest of death.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Astonishing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But that’s not the only thing that surprised me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lulushi was there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I thought that she will start fighting Tier-sama, they both looked pleased with their reunion for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What’s happening?</p>


<p class="calibre2">Afterwards, there were still various surprises.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The most surprising thing is neither the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em> nor the <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em> living in the village but Tier-sama’s husband.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her partner is the head of this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be impolite of me to be surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, but, however….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Leaving all the questions on my head to the side, congratulations.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, Kuudel and Corone also congratulated her without freezing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I listened to what they are talking about, it seems like Lulushi is crying while saying something about the husband.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a fierce person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, a fierce man.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not oppose him in any way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although this place is too small to be called a village, we decided to call that person village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others are also calling him like that and he doesn’t seem to mind.</p>


<p class="calibre2">With Tier-sama’s order, it was decided that we’ll also live here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The lizardmen who came with us too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My, Kuudel, and Corone’s role in this dwelling and field….no, this village is to protect it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Repulse what we can repulse and if it is impossible for us, call for backup.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although it will hurt my pride, there is no choice to do so considering the risk of death and the war potential of this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want to die yet so I’ll do that.</p>


<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">I underestimated this village’s defense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The defense of this village is already taken care by the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>, headed by Kuro-san, and the <em class="calibre5">demon spiders</em> headed by Zabuton-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, we’re going to patrol outside the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s no problem since we can fly but if we fly too high, we won’t be able to properly see the surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that in mind, we patrol over the forest at a reasonable altitude…</p>
<p class="calibre2">We were attacked more than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially by <em class="calibre5">desert rats</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though one of them attacking us is negligible, a bunch of them jumping at us and trying to bring us down to the ground is trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ve experienced that several times in different places.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em> come to protect me whenever they see me struggle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I felt shameful, I am thankful for them helping me against <em class="calibre5">desert rats</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, I’m playing with them using the <em class="calibre5">flying disc</em> whenever I’m on break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought that the day where I’ll play with inferno wolves, who I thought were scary, will come.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The day has gone by peacefully. The only unusual things are us guiding visitors several times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is peaceful but not boring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being a patrol here is life-threatening but with the help of the inferno wolves, we have killed various monsters that threatened the village a number of times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I realized that I have become stronger than before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that feeling was destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> and a <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em> are fighting and the vibration of their match is even reaching the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they are far from here, I can feel the intensity of their battle just by looking at the height of the dust cloud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, I feel like they are approaching the village as they fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a disaster at a level of considering relocating the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to tell the village chief but he gave a strange reply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Grappler bear</em> and <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>, are they delicious?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did the village chief said that due to excessive <em class="calibre5">panic</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know since I haven’t eaten one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief changed his gaze from me to the high elf Ria that told him that they are edible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. So, we can eat them. Then, shall we hunt them? It will be a problem if they come and hurt someone from this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ehto….hunt them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, we can do that if all the villagers cooperate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves, demon spiders</em>, Tier-sama, us angels, high elves, and the lizardmen help each other, we can do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufu</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Gran Maria, can you carry me to where they are fighting?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can but….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something is wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s resolve my doubt first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….are we doing it with just the two of us?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s the plan….is there a problem?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">「N-no. I understand. I will do it with every bit of my effort.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like my resolution is insufficient.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At times like this, I should have been prepared to give up my life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I forgot about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the village chief is still saying something but none of them entered my ear.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">grappler bear</em> and <em class="calibre5">bloody viper </em>were killed by the village chief in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Am I dreaming?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I’m not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief is amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of Tier-sama and Lulushi’s husband.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I would like to be linked with him too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, no no no, I have escaped from reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s do our best to guard the corpse of the prey.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The trouble continues.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, it’s a <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> raid.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My entire body stiffens and I tremble with fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not conceited enough to think that I can win against a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I have not forgotten my role.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must do something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was thinking of how to fight against that dragon, another dragon came from another direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I <em class="calibre5">panicked</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was not able to move and became flustered until everything was resolved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasutisumoon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s a ferocious dragon whose name is well known even to us angels.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No way, I never thought that she the daughter of the gentle Doraim-san who always comes to this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I heard the story in detail, it seems like Doraim-san is the gatekeeper dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Isn’t he a super famous dragon?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing that, my knee gave up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m sorry. I thought you were a third-rate dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll reflect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, Doraim-san only knows how to eat food and drink wine so how …. No, I must not say it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m still not convinced.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Somehow, Rasutisumoon is now living in this village and with that, the village’s ferocity…. I mean, the village’s defensive capability has increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to do my best to play my part.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Loo-san(we began calling her that) gave birth and Tier-sama became pregnant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s something to celebrate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, because doing it has become popular, we did it too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My body also received the village chief’s favor so someday I’ll probably bear one too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My dream has expanded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was thinking about such a thing, a <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> came again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This dragon is bigger than Rasuti-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That time, Rasuti-san was not in the village because she came home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon swirled around the village then burnt the nearby forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s definitely an enemy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Together with Kuudel and Corone, I charged at the <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The me from that time was not calm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I was only calm, I would have noticed that the <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>’s hostility was strange.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why did it burn the forest near the village and not the village itself?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief noticed it but he wasn’t able to stop us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In order to forgive ourselves when we p<em class="calibre5">anicked</em> during Rasuti-san’s raid, we thought that attacking was our only option.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Trinity attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we use this attack, we can even beat Tier-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We put all of our power to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And we fell like <em class="calibre5">pest</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like <em class="calibre5">pest</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We were lightly whipped by its tail.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Shock</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The difference in power is too great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt extreme regret again for not being able to protect the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While crashing down, I’m thinking of a miserable future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I stopped crashing down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was Rasuti-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti-san in her human form caught me before I hit the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuudel and Corone were also caught by someone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Who are they?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim-san is here too, are they his acquaintances?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I’m being overwhelmed with doubt, the battle between the <em class="calibre5">dragon </em>and the village chief has begun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The place where we are is dangerous so we moved in a hurry.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The battle between the <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>, who whipped us down, and the village chief ended with the village chief’s victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it seems like the <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> was not serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it was serious, even if the village chief wins in the end, it could have killed the villagers and destroy the village first but it did not do so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what I heard, she seems like testing the strength of the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So that’s why it burnt the forest and not the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the village chief has been recognized by the <em class="calibre5">dragons</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel offended with how the <em class="calibre5">dragons</em> look at us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it might not be a good idea to be hostile against them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are several <em class="calibre5">dragons</em> who came with Doraim-san and Rasuti-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is probably correct to not be hostile.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief seems to judge it like that too and receive them hospitably.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I wanted to retaliate because we were injured but I did not do so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is an unacceptable behavior for someone lacking power like us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is shameful to demand something since our injuries are already healed with magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s the final coat of shame…</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I want to receive a piece of scale to forge new equipment…</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I will not make a demand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you could show a good performance at the banquet, that will be enough.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The dragon who whipped us down(who seems to be Hakuren) performed and I’m holding my side laughing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just remembering it makes me laugh so I won’t talk about it anymore.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After the <em class="calibre5">dragons</em> left, our everyday life returned to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only thing different is that I slightly increased the amount of my training.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am still weak.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will continue to work hard in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, I also pray that strong characters that threaten our significance in this village will not settle down in this village any further than this.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-54"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 74 &ndash; Yuri’s Reflection</h1><p class="calibre2">It seems there is a dungeon in the north of the forest.<span id="calibre_link-172"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves are chattering.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they planning on diving in that<em class="calibre5"> dungeon</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What are the merits of entering a dungeon?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You can get furs, meat, and bones from monsters living in the dungeon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Won’t there be treasures there?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If the monsters living there has a habit of collecting gold and silver, there is a possibility…but that rarely happens.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There is no big merit in diving inside a <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>, but it has meaning. If a dungeon was not controlled, monsters will come out and rampage. Once that happens, the devastation will not be small.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think I heard you said that before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if there is a race that manages the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> like the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> in the south, it is unlikely for monsters to come out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Even in a controlled <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>, there is a possibility of monsters coming out depending on the quality of the race controlling it so it is necessary to dive and investigate it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the race managing the dungeon is belligerent and ambitious, there is a possibility of monsters going outside frequently. Either way, it seems like we can’t leave it unattended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon receiving my permission, not only the high elves but the lizardmen and onis’ <em class="calibre5">tension </em>rose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros who are asking to be selected also appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The air they are emitting makes me want to go with them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, a lot of things will stall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it is like the previous <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>, it will take more than a year and it will be impossible for me to come back regularly.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The newly arrived demon girls seemed to be puzzled at first but now, they are doing various works seriously.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Again, I thought of the race called demons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Demon race.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There seem to be two types of demons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first one are those who look like humans and the other one are those who don’t look like humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other one is also called demi-humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other kind that I already met are vampires, angels, high elves, onis, lizardmen, beastkins, elder dwarves, and lamias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand that vampires, onis, lizardmen, and lamias are demons but I feel strange in classifying angels, high elves, beastkins, and elder dwarves as demons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll just continue to classify them as demi-humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: By the way, 魔族(mazoku) is translated in the illustration as “magic human” and not demons. 魔(ma) means magic/evil/devil/demon and 族(zoku) means race/tribe/family. Whether the author is breaking the trend by giving mazoku a different meaning or something more deeper, I’ll leave that to your imagination. For now, I’ll continue to translate mazoku as demon. Below are Fraurem’s name and race in the LN illustration.</em></strong></p>

<p class="calibre2">The other type looks like humans but possesses magical power that exceeds humans.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Frau and the newly arrived girls are of this type.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of the large amount of magical power they possess, I thought that they are similar to mages but that doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are using that large amount of magical power to give own body an ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, their body can become as hard as a rock, their limbs can stretch, they can see far away, improving their hearing ability at an abnormal level….</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing the explanation, I suddenly remember a TV show from my previous world that shows those who have freakish ability. I apologize for thinking something rude.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In short, that is their only difference with humans. I’m thinking of a possibility that humans originated from demons with deteriorated ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s probably it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though Frau and the girls who came here possesses a large amount of magical power, I don’t feel anything different from them. They are like ordinary humans to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Changes will occur in their body if they can’t control their own magical power. If changes occur, all they have to do is to control their magical power properly and the change will be minimize or even return back to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In that sense, the girls who came to this village might be excellent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, they are really excellent girls. I heard that they came from the great households of the demon king’s country.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is normal for them to be excellent since they are forged to be excellent by their household.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why would girls from great households come here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you want to return, I can arrange it so that you can come home.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told them to tell Frau anytime but it seems like the girls are not hopeful for that to happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they are currently residing at the inn, a house is already being built for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be hard for daughters of great households to live in this village but I want you to persevere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The food here is delicious.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah….the bath is the best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「And, there is no gigantic court struggle so I can relax.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Yuri is looking around the village with Frau as her guide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you now understand what you tried to do?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, trying to invade this place is….dangerous even for me…..No, I will surely die.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can’t even defend you since you gathered soldiers. Please think carefully first before taking action.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. However, I have been taught to gather soldiers as soon as possible. Is that wrong?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s not wrong. However, showing hostility to an opponent you can’t win against is wrong.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「And since I gathered soldiers, I showed hostility.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you point your weapon to a <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>, you can’t complain if it attacks you with a <em class="calibre5">breath</em>. This village has <em class="calibre5">dragons</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I never thought that there are really <em class="calibre5">dragons</em> here. I’m sure that it was some sort of deception.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I won’t blame you for that since I’m the same before coming to this village…. From what I heard, demon king-sama told you not to get involved with this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I was wrong to ignore father’s warning. But it’s Fraurem’s fault. To suddenly leave me….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I apologize with what happened.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand the reason now so there is no need for you to apologize. By the way, are you really sure this is safe?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Please throw it with all your might.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">As she’s urged by Frau, Yuri threw the<em class="calibre5"> ball</em> she had.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And several kuros run after the ball.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one who got the <em class="calibre5">ball </em>came to Yuri with a “praise me” expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-you brought it back. Good job.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuri was able to praise it but she was not able to pat the head of the kuro so Frau does it on her stead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Even one <em class="calibre5">inferno wolf</em> entering a city will cause a catastrophe but here, they are acting cute like this.」</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1ZB6yN4/u39-677fb33f-59b8-4b29-9f1f-e8250ba1193f.jpg">

<p class="calibre2">「Right. It seems like you are good with them.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Do I? It also took me some time before I was able to pat them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How are you able to get along with them?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I wonder….probably as a result of being beaten in a <em class="calibre5">chess</em> match.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Chess</em>? The board game you taught us in the inn? The <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em> can play it too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The <em class="calibre5">chess champion</em> of this village is Kuroyon-san….He’s the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolf</em> lying under that tree. He’s strong. I never won against him.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….that’s a surprise.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. Ah, it’s almost time for lunch. Shall we go back?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I’m looking forward to it since the food here is delicious.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「They are the best tasting food however….one you get used to it, I don’t think you would want to go home.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…… Do I have to go home?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t ask nonsense.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about taking back a chef? I’m an imperial princess. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: By the way, the princess is called 王姫(ouhi) which is different and definitely not a shortened term of the usually used お姫(ohime).</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you think your title will affect anyone from this village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ugh….」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Digression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Frau, can I ask you something?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ria-san? What is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why are you calling the demon king’s daughter ouhime? Isn’t she an oujou?」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Oujou(王女) means princess. Explanation before is due to this digression.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is because the demon king’s title is not hereditary but an appointment type of title. It was a custom to call the daughter of the current demon king as ouhime and once he retired, his daughter will then be called oujou. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Heh. Then, is the ouji like that too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Ouji means prince.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ouji is ouji. Once the demon king retires, his son will no longer be called ouji.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Well, even if I say that it is an appointment system, it is basically similar to hereditary system since the demon king will be chosen from a certain group.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Though it is clear that only the one with superior ability will be chosen as the demon king….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Won’t it be a problem if a certain family forces their way and do some troublesome things?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is, especially that there are a few ambitious houses…By the way, when did you know that Yuri-sama is an ouhime?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「From the start. It is really obvious.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ugh….then, the village chief?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t think he noticed it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please, keep it a secret.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No problem but if you really want to conceal it, it would be better for you to pay attention to the person in question. She sometimes brags about her father.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Chuh, I’ll keep that in mind.」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-73"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 75 &ndash; Yuri Returns</h1><p class="calibre2">「It is similar to a tradition that happens every year.」<span id="calibre_link-173"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Tradition? Ah? You mean demon king-sama’s greetings?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Not really but it is some sort of event that always happens every now and then.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, like how a low-status girl tries to gain the favor of a person from the upper echelon to establish her position.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, that’s it. That’s how others see it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You mean, I need to know my place?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s right. So, I will say it once more. I have the lowest status here and you are a subordinate of that someone on the bottom. The village chief is the top of this village. Do you understand what I’m trying to say?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Sort of, are you talking about last night’s incident? When I sneaked into the village chief’s room?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes! What you’ve done is similar to a commoner barging into the king’s <em class="calibre5">bed</em>. It won’t be strange if you were decapitated on the spot.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s an exaggeration.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You think I’m exaggerating? Do you really think so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh-ehto….I-I’m sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s a good thing that you said that you mistakenly entered his room….however, the only one who believed that was the village chief.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Isn’t it good as long as the village chief was deceived?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….Regarding the stories about the tradition, did you ever heard a man of the upper echelon got angry to a woman of low status?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t get what you’re trying to say.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The upper echelon man will not get angry. It would have been good if that’s all there is but, the upper echelon woman will definitely be angered with what the low-status woman did.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You mean….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t care if you die but at least testify that I’m not involved.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Wai, Fraurem-san! I’m just joking around. Please, help me!」</p>


<p class="calibre2">I saw how the girls Frau work and understood their specialties.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are civil servants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we are a company, they would be the office workers, secretaries, and receptionists.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They got nothing to do with the business but they are the ones supporting the organization.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And there are 10 of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think their number is too much for this village…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I let them handle business?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their etiquette is solid and they can also negotiate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, I’ll have them do their best helping Frau for now.</p>


<p class="calibre2">However, even though they’re reliable, they can also be absent-minded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To mistakenly took my room as the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m glad that the others took her out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But, why is she stark-naked if she’s just going to the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably a practice in this world.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Toilet</em> as a makeup<em class="calibre5"> space</em>….no, I think it is better to say that it is a change room <em class="calibre5">space</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s ask them next time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though I’m practicing horseback riding, I’m not getting any better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t fall because there’s a saddle but rather than riding, my problem is turning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The horse never does what I tell it to and I’m already halfway on giving up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, I came up with a solution.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Go straight ahead.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had the kuros follow me and have them guide the horse according to my instruction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hooray!</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s finally running according to my order!</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">No.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is different from the horse-riding I imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel sorry for scaring this poor horse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maybe I should build a mutual trust relationship with this horse….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s patiently bait it with friendship.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A survey team was organized and left for the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> in the north.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I called them survey team instead of capture team because they might overdo it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The members are 10 high elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three lizardmen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Two onis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thirty <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One to three spiderlings riding on each <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves’</em> back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the south <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>, three lamias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About 20 lamia follower big snake monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want you to return safely.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I talked about standard in the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially about the amount of liquor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that outside the village, there seems to be no unified standard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I decided for this village to make its own standard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I transform the AFT into a ruler, I can measure my previous worlds’ millimeter, centimeter, and even meter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of the chance of measurement deviating so I tried transforming it several times but it gave the same length measurement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Likewise, I can also transform the AFT to a measuring cup to measure liter.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In regards to weight, what should I do…well, the weight of one liter of water should be one kilogram.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I remember that it changes with respect to water temperature, I don’t remember how much it will be affected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think there is a noticeable change in about 4 degrees but how can I measure temperature?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, there’s no need for me to match the standard of my former world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only require a standard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, the standard unit for length, volume, and weight were established.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Digression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Amazing. Each of village chief’s field is always 50 meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I really did it. I’m really amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「From Big Tree to the river, we measured 52 times of 100 meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if we remove the 200 meters, it is safe to say that it is “about” 5 kilometers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….It should be fine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I felt like its fine since I’m amazing.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When the autumn harvest was about to begin, Yuri, Frau’s guest, will go home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s here for about 3 months.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She already got accustomed to the life in this village. She sometimes helps the beastkins in squeezing sugar and extracting oil so the beastkins said that they will miss her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The girls who came with Yuri also said that they’ll miss her but none of them said anything about wanting to go home with her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m sorry. The blunder I made in the capital, I’m going to compensate for it by working and starting all over here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I cannot repay the kindness this village showed to me by training the immature me. I will train my resolve until then!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I still can’t return since there’s still a field I need to take care of…I have no excuse.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">All of the girls who came together with her decided to stay in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You girls….can you please put down the plate full of food and cup full of wine on your hands first and say that again?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is what everyone and also their independent desire so I guess there’s no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recently learned that Yuri is the demon king’s daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I always thought that she’s a lady with high status but I never thought that she’s a princess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it alright for her to stay in this village?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beezel has come here several times already, why is he not picking her up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t really get why.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, I don’t have a bad impression on her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the banquet in the pretext of farewell party, she returned with Beezel together with some souvenirs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At a later date, Yuri demanded Beezel to increase the number of messages we are sending on each other via the small wyvern.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Demon King’s castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Beezel, when my daughter returned from the village, she became strangely dignified…I feel like she has become more reliable.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree but I don’t know the reason….why are you telling me this?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Recently, you and my daughter are getting along well, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I am just mediating with the message your daughter wants to send.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so?…. By the way, has my daughter said anything about me in those messages?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What do you mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Recently, my daughter has been cold to me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….can you think of a reason?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, I’m not sure. Yesterday, she only greeted me in the morning and at night.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it not because demon king-sama is busy?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, that can’t be. Even if I appeal to her during my free time several times, she’s still like that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah….I also have a daughter so I might know the reason….I think because she’s at her pubescence age.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The case of my daughter is different.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….demon king-sama. It might be cruel of me to say but there is a possibility that a daughter has become an adult without her parents knowing.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Adult? A man! Indeed, if it is a man! Who! I’ll kill him!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king-sama, demon king-sama. You’ll just hurt your stomach if you continue acting that way.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「HHAAAAAHHHHH! DAMN DAMN DAMN DAMN! DDDAAAAAAMMMMNNNNNN IIIIIITTTTTT!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’re still not sure. Please calm down. Also, it is almost time for the meeting. Did you look at the data from the west battlefield?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is not the time to have a meeting!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you don’t prioritize the meeting, you’ll be disliked by the princess.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s not the probleemmmmmmm!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes yes. I will tell the princess what demon king-sama wants to convey so please do your best at the meeting.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really? Are you telling the truth? Please. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please leave it to me. Then, let’s head towards the conference room. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-yes! Oh, wait a second. I will just transform for a bit….okay. Fuhahahahaha! Let’s decide the fate of the fools who dare to attack the demon king’s kingdom!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beezel is good with his words.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-93"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 76 &ndash; Autumn Harvest, Mountain Elf, and Pottery</h1><p class="calibre2">Autumn harvest has come.<span id="calibre_link-174"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, though we have already harvested the fields several times before autumn, the time to harvest is still autumn harvest after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Autumn is the season of harvest. In normal farming, what you plant on spring will be harvested during autumn.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">We’re working silently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The main harvesters are the high elves, lizardmen, and beastkins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently managing a harvesting work center.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruits are being harvested by the spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the kuros are not helpful with harvesting crops, they are doing their best to hunt even though their hunting partners, the high elves, are all busy harvesting.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Frau’s subordinates, although they all have improved, making them help with harvesting will be a little troublesome. By the way, since we can’t call them demon girls due to most of the villagers are demons, after various consultations, we decided to call them civil servant girls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The civil servant girls are helping with harvesting by measuring the yield of our harvest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They measure all of the harvests before they are taken to the warehouse. With this, we finally got a grip of inventory control of our crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The person in charge of that is Frau.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Tier is going to give birth soon so I had her rest and make sure she doesn’t overdo things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo, who already experienced giving birth, is staying beside her.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The angels are patrolling as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarves are brewing alcohol as usual….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「From this part up to this part of the warehouse will be for brewing alcohol.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I participated in harvesting work in order to secure the raw materials for alcohol brewing.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Rasuti and Hakuren also tried to help with the harvesting work but unfortunately, they are inadequate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can’t even be considered as help.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, they are now assigned as the transporter of the harvested crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given the volume of our harvest, I judged that it would be better if they are transported immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti will transport goods to Michael-san of Shashaato City via Doraim’s nest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although we can always ask the lamias, their speed is incomparable to the speed of a flying <em class="calibre5">dragon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren will transport things to Dors and Raimeiren’s place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The season’s greeting is included.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The place of my mother and father are in the opposite direction.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, is it alright to only send things to one of them?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You just scared me with those words.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, will you transport them? Please.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll do my best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren head to the southern continent where Raimeiren lives first then go back to the village and head to the northern continent where Dors is this time.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Though her flight speed is overwhelmingly faster compared to Rasuti, it still took her two weeks to transport goods on both continents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti came back a week after she left because she only traveled in a short distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Both of them brought some things back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti brought marine products from Shashaato City.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Rasuti arrived in the city, a huge sea monster that looks like a whale approached the city.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Michael-san requested Rasuti to exterminate it with marine products as compensation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The huge monster that looks like a whale is being dismantled by the people of the city.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After they secure its meat, it will be sent to us via Lamia transport.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren’s souvenir is a bit troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dark elf?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">20 brown skinned elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are lined up and fully armed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Our race is called mountain elf.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? My apologies. You resemble the race I know so I nonchalantly said that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, perhaps our race is also called that….We don’t mind whatever you call us so please feel free to call us whatever you like.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha. I’ll think about it later. So, can I consider every one of you present as everyone?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">These 20 mountain elves are all females.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, we are already “everyone”.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that so?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every one already?</p>


<p class="calibre2">Originally they lived in a certain mountain but the food situation seems to have deteriorated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were forced to move to another place and met a guardian beast who is protecting the place where they moved. That guardian beast is Raimeiren’s subordinate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like their story passed through Raimeiren and she decided to have them go to this village for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though she planned to have them move here after several years, since Hakuren came, she had her pick them up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why did Raimeiren does that?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「She recommended us to this place because this is pretty new and we can work hard here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps they don’t have veto rights.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even I don’t have one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Because you are introduced by Raimeiren, I’ll accept you to this village. By the way, there are high elves in this village, you don’t have problems with that, right? You don’t have a conflict with them, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. There’s no problem.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good reply but I still have to hear the representative of the high elves, Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ria, are you high elves okay with them living in this village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’re fine with it. You can easily identify mountain elves with their ears. Though we are of similar race, our ability is different so we really don’t have a hierarchical relationship.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s good.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a relief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I want you to get used to the way of life in this village but I won’t be unreasonable and force you to work. If you notice anything unacceptable, let me know.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I had the mountain elves stay at the inn.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I was worried about who’ll take care of them so I decided to have two high elves to take care of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s build a house for them to settle in once the spring comes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the race called mountain elf.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps it will be easier for them to live in Howling village than here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s discuss it with them later.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Tier’s delivery began.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike Loo, her delivery is long.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Long but I can’t do anything about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves and onis are doing their best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I can’t do anything and I can’t calm my mind, I knead clay outside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is for pottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are clay on a certain part of the lamia’s dungeon so I asked them to bring some here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m kneading clay in order to make a container for alcohol because it has always been a problem of the dwarves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are usually stored in barrels but the content will be volatilized in wooden barrels.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Wine </em>and distilled liquor are fine being stored in barrels since they taste better as they age but there are some alcoholic beverages that are not suitable to be stored in barrels.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Especially alcohols brewed from rice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though we can store them in <em class="calibre5">glass </em>bottles, <em class="calibre5">glass</em> bottles here are valuable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have gained a reasonable number of them from Howling Village but recently, all of them are now filled with alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried buying <em class="calibre5">glass </em>bottle from Michael-san but I gave up after hearing the price.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, thinking of a replacement for <em class="calibre5">glass</em> bottle, I recalled pottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m making a pot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I made the clay into a string shape and make a pot-like shape by coiling that string but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is quite difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I practice first by making a bowl?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was doing my best to shape it, my child was born without me noticing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An energetic girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier is also safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I immediately went to where they are to see them, the others saw my muddy body so they sent me to the bath.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-10"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 77 &ndash; The Return of the Survey Team and Arrival of Winter</h1><p class="calibre2">My child was named by Tier, Tiselle.<span id="calibre_link-175"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s a girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want her to grow healthy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Tier was finally okay, a banquet for her childbirth begins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I drunk a little too much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alfred now has a little sister…but it seems like he doesn’t understand it yet.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The representative of the mountain elves is Ya.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s somewhat confused when she was shown of the life in this village but there were no major incidents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She finally gets accustomed after 10 days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, their group tried hunting. They are good at making traps and that’s how they usually hunt but it seems like they were unable to get any result since they are unfamiliar with the beasts in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also tried mining work and other processing jobs. They are also seem to be capable fighters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I never expected them to be good at pottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When they saw me fingering and groping clay, they somehow got interested but they are overwhelmingly more skillful than me.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Lewd thoughts begone.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Though we’re still in the trial and error phase on firing earthenware, we’re doing great since the kiln was still fine.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: The kiln has a possibility to explode or to burn when mispracticing earthenware firing.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">We decided to concentrate on pottery this winter.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When it is almost winter, the survey team who headed for the dungeon in the north came back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They brought a large amount of materials taken from monsters they have faced and they are proud of their achievements.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There are friendly titans living in the dungeon. They cooperated with our investigation. The dungeon spreads to the north but we weren’t able to check everything since it is considerably large.」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Survey team meeting titans, sounds familiar.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it dangerous inside the dungeon?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, we confirmed the existence of several <em class="calibre5">bloody vipers</em>. Exterminating them will be extremely dangerous so we ran away but if we really want to capture the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>, we have to defeat them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Bloody viper</em>….ah, the big snake.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the one that acted violently together with a big bear before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Shall I go?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I proposed that, Rasuti and Hakuren stepped forward and talk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The village chief may not leave.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right right. We will handle it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you’re going then it will be great however, I find it strange for you to suddenly move voluntarily.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, y-you don’t have to think too much about it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, it’s not that unusual.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I interrogated them, they confessed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eating <em class="calibre5">bloody viper’s</em> meat seems to have an energetic effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ehto….energetic, you mean it has an aphrodisiac effect?</p>

<p class="calibre2">It seems like its meat is useful for those who wish to make a child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we obtained one before, I cooked it and ate it but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I looked around, everyone averted their gaze which means they knew. I shook my head since it seems like I’m the only one who doesn’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Because there are only a few opportunities to eat <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what I remember, it seems really effective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it’s not like I’m anxious about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Maa, I get it now and I don’t mind it at all…Let’s wait for the spring first.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After saying that, everyone around dispersed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The survey team sorted the things they brought and put them on the warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Energetic….when the spring comes….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, let’s not think about the future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At least it was not in winter where I have no place to escape.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It is now winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s cold.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「I want to talk about male shortage and introduction of money.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I proposed a meeting and gathered every major personality of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand the shortage of male but what about the money?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I think it is necessary if we think about the future.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? I think everything is fine as it is.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m expecting things to be troublesome if we continue with our present style.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Was there something that inconvenience the village chief?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently, all of the things in this village is the village chief’s, mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the prey they hunted are presented to me first and I’ll be the one responsible to distribute them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When someone wants something, they have to ask for my permission first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was alright during our early days but there are a lot of people now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My work is delayed if I have to listen to every single little request. The village work is also delayed since I have to be contacted first.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, they can decide on small things on their own as long as it will be reported to me eventually but I can’t imagine them doing that immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for me, I just want to focus on my farm work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m already starting to think of throwing the village management to either Frau or Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that won’t work so I’ll have to move it in a direction where everyone will feel at ease.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you already have a plan for introducing money?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, by attaching price to things, I thought that we can have everyone voluntarily make some small exchanges. However, I expect that not everyone will be familiar with money immediately and it will just violently swung the price of things.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Economy is a monster.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not something an amateur like me can suddenly control.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Then?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’ll take small steps. This will be the first stage.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put out a stone carved to the shape slightly larger than a coin in front of everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I carved a picture of a big tree on one side of the coin and carved the shrine of the god of agriculture on the other side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The first stage we’ll use before money…a reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What’s the use of this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll distribute some of it once a year.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, I see. If we can exchange things for this reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>, we can probably really do something.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is more of a voucher than money.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll give this to those who contributed to the village and also to the winners of competitions and games.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ooohhh」</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, I’ll have everyone get accustomed to this then we’ll gradually shift to money.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it’s a long-term plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How are you planning to do it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s try this out for a year.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">And now it’s decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way….if you’re really going to distribute this reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> to the villagers, you need a certain amount but…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that there is no bad person in this village but counterfeiting is troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s why I elaborate things to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, only me can process stones since I have the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’ll only use this at the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s right, only at the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m persuading myself while silently making reward <em class="calibre5">medals</em> in silence this winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eehhh</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you really want to forge one yourself, you can always try.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I added another one on the side after putting some hidden symbols.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The troublesomeness in making one has improved.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「There was no discussion regarding the male shortage….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-29"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 78 &ndash; Spring and Reward Medal</h1><p class="calibre2">The spring has come.<span id="calibre_link-176"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">We received various messages on different places via the small-wyverns.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From Howling Village, their usual request for grains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From Michal-san of Shashaato City, crops that can be bought.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From Beezel from the demon king’s castle, along with new year’s greetings, an order sheet from Princess Yuri.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After consulting Frau’s civil servant girls, we sell a certain amount of crops.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though there are things that I wanted to ask Michael-san for, the money accumulated in the village has already been used up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, I’ll consult everyone about the usage of money.</p>


<p class="calibre2">New fields were made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since there are many demands this year, expansion has been decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all is the soybean field for soy sauce and miso.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next are fields for the rare trees and plants I got from Dors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Another reason is for trading. We have to increase our crop production for Michael-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although I have the AFT, there is a limit of what one man can do alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I expanded the field from the current 16 by 32 fields to the east so it is now 24 by 32 fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also expanded the medicinal herb field from four by four to four by eight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The fruit area has been expanded to the north, from the current eight by eight, it is now eight by 12 fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the time when I was starting building a farm, it is now quite big.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to raise more variety of crops.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I distributed reward medals to the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three pieces per person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also gave the kuros 30 pieces but it is still impossible for me to give each one of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also gave Zabuton 30 pieces since I can’t give each one of the spiders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since they are the representatives, I gave 10 each to the leaders of each race.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the <em class="calibre5">inferno wolves</em>, Kuro.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the <em class="calibre5">demon spiders</em>, Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the vampires, Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the angels, Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the high elves, Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the onis, Ann.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the lizardmen, Daga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the beastkins, Senna.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the dwarves, Donovan.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Yeah, it’s really written as dwarf and not elder dwarf.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the civil servant girls, Frau.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the <em class="calibre5">dragons</em>, Rasuti.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The representative of the mountain elves, Ya.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, there are still Rasuti’s servants, the devils, bees, and slimes. By the way, the bees already declined and their message was passed to me via Zabuton.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I failed to communicate with the slime.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti’s servants said that the three they received like every inhabitant of this village are already enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, 100 for the village chief, me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I won’t use this 100 pieces since I plan on giving them as a reward or prize.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I can make and give it out anytime I want, I don’t have a way of securing or maintaining its value so I did not make a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, let’s see what will happen to this 100 pieces on me this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t even know if the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> will work.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The villagers are free to trade reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>with each other but if they lose it, they will not be compensated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Theft, blackmail, exploitation using position will be severely punished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, even if it is not related to the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>, those who’ll commit those crimes will be severely punished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is the severe punishment?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about banishment from the village?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Th-that’s severe indeed. I don’t think anyone will do it but I will thoroughly inform them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">We announced a list of things that can be traded with the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ratio will be one item, one medal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One furniture of your choice</p>
<p class="calibre2">One gaming equipment of your choice</p>
<p class="calibre2">One tool of your choice</p>
<p class="calibre2">One available weapon in the warehouse</p>
<p class="calibre2">One available armor in the warehouse</p>
<p class="calibre2">One available jewelry in the warehouse</p>
<p class="calibre2">One equipment of your choice</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alcoholic beverage(medium barrel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Honey(small bottle)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Increase of fields of the crop of your choice(will start after the medal was paid)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Residential area improvement of your choice(will start after the medal was paid)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Others(anything you desire)</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: One night with village chief?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">I wrote various things on the list but most of them wanted the alcoholic beverage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What kind of alcoholic beverage can be exchanged for the medal?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it any alcohol of your choice?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The amount is already guaranteed, one medium barrel, so it doesn’t matter what kind it is.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">As the result, the villagers are drinking the alcoholic beverage of their choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, that barrel size is about four liters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they wanted to drink it during a meal, 8 people will probably be able to enjoy it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I still don’t know it that is a lot or too few.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, when there is a banquet in the village, it is drink all you can.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The next most popular things are furnitures and gaming equipments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, since everyone is cohabitating with everyone, everyone is equal in both good and bad sense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, even if they want to sleep on a straw futon <em class="calibre5">bed</em>, they can’t since we can only prepare hard <em class="calibre5">bed</em> for everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, by using the reward medal, it is now possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Never thought it will be this big.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furnitures such as shelves, <em class="calibre5">beds, tables</em>, and chairs, and gaming equipments such as chess and reversi were requested.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A problem brought by it came out immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First is that most villagers exchanged the reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>for alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They did not drink it immediately but hoard them on their own rooms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I know that they love to drink but I never thought that they would exchange all three reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>for alcohol immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After learning about it, I thought that it would be much better to give away alcohol instead of <em class="calibre5">medals</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it my idea was rejected because they are troublesome to carry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, it is probably because they don’t trust the value of the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This will only be solved by seeing the result in the future.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Next problem is, betting has begun with <em class="calibre5">chess,</em> shogi, go, <em class="calibre5">mini bowling, golf</em>, mah-jong, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not prohibit betting but I banned debts(lending and borrowing reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>).</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want the villagers to become degenerates because of debts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, I would prefer them betting in smaller units.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, they would be able to enjoy playing for a long time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There are also a lot of trade request for furnitures and gaming equipments than expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem with that is I’m involved in production.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For furnitures, I only need to process wood but for gaming equipments, I’m involved in every detail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will take too much time to make them if I leave it to others because they don’t have the AFT like me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will also have to let several villagers to help me full time on making gaming equipments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’ll do our best to make them but now I don’t think that the introductory reward <em class="calibre5">medal </em>price of the gaming equipments is correct.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll prepare gaming equipments for reward <em class="calibre5">medal </em>trade next time.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Taking orders then making them is a bad idea.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There are also various other problems that came out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What surprised me the most was that a beastgirl chose “Others(anything you desire)” and said that she wanted to have a child with me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately after, a lot of villagers followed her lead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, I rejected them all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it is a bad idea to trade a reward <em class="calibre5">medal </em>for a child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, I don’t want to lay my hands on the beastgirls other than Senna.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please forgive me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I somehow managed to persuade her to downgrade her request to one whole day date plus eating my personally cooked food.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Escort service confirmed.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">My busy time has increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An amusing way to use the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It is still difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not running in the way I expect it to be.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, let’s continue this for a year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I’m planning an event with reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>as prize.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first one should be….an athletic meet?</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-48"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 79 &ndash; A Certain High Elf</h1><p class="calibre2">Reward<em class="calibre5"> medal</em>.<span id="calibre_link-177"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">It was carved by the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was made so it can be traded for various things but this should be kept without trading it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To trade it for something is blasphemy!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll display it in my room!</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I should pray at it!</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, the village chief has given us a place where we can live in peace!</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s a human but he’s not really human!</p>
<p class="calibre2">He is a god!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only a god will be served by <em class="calibre5">the inferno wolves, demon spiders</em>, vampires, and angels!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, forgive me for my sin of not knowing how to worship you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The least I can do is giving my body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to give birth to his child if possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I can’t I can’t I can’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Haughty thoughts, begone!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should already be satisfied with god’s mercy!</p>
<p class="calibre2">….kuh, I have a lot of rivals today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I won’t hit someone with the same faith, I can intimidate them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sha!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Shaaa!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was intimidated so I left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Scary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I will not give up.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Now you know how they take turns.</em></strong></p>


<p class="calibre2">The next day, I was called by Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She said that the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> must be used for trade and I should not keep it for myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is she saying?</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is she thinking?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone who has similar way of thinking as me asked Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Ria, it seems like it is what they talked about in a meeting before with the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A meeting before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is probably a strictly confidential meeting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the meeting was called upon by the village chief with the attendees doing their ugly arguments in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to participate but in order to do that, I have to defeat Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be tough with my current ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will not give it up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will use my very effort.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Ah, the story wandered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria says that the village chief will feel bad if we don’t utilize the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was that really the case?</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I really want to keep it so I decided to keep one and use the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s trade these two pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t really have something in mind to trade for so I’m having a hard time thinking of what to trade for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What about a futon?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, I want the same as the village chief is using.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, if I suddenly cheerfully trade, it might look like I don’t really value the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>. Let’s check the situation first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarves traded all three pieces for alcohol at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My mouth is even wide open.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have some kind of respect for the dwarves because of their passion for alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, to suddenly trade them all for it….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m probably making a really weird face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the dwarves secretly told me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The representative of the dwarves, Donovan, will hand one reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> to each dwarf so he told them to use the three they have in hand to their liking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief also knows the thirsty souls of the dwarves so he only took two of their reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>in consideration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wonderful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria, to give each of us one….is impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Each representative was given 10 each and with the numbers of high elves, it is impossible for her to distribute it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s frustrating but I gave up since there’s no point in thinking about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I refresh my feeling and trade the two pieces I have.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to the dwarves, I now feel that they are easy to replace.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, this is my chance!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked at the list and examined it closely….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Now then, I’ll have a futon….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to say those words but somehow, I swallowed them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because of the words that I heard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What do you want the village chief to make for you, chess or go?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What furniture would you like to request the village chief?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, change of plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m regretful of not getting a futon, exchanging the reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>for handcrafted items made by the village chief is not a bad trade at all.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There are now three treasures in my room.</p>

<p class="calibre2">One reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One<em class="calibre5"> chess</em> board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One big shelf.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the last one is an ordinary shelf, it is something the village chief and I made together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reward medal will only be used this year and it is undecided if it will continue next year but I would like it to circulate next year too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There is an awesome beastgirl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She asked the village chief for a child using the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>…..I never thought of using it that way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, she did not succeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s take a note of this for future reference.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, today is my turn to go to the village chief’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-87"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 81 &ndash; Villager Gathering Plan and Sports Festival Planning</h1><p class="calibre2">A demand for new gaming toy appeared and I suddenly remember the existence of tic-tac-toe.<span id="calibre_link-178"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I carved three vertical and horizontal lines into a 3 by 3 board and drill a hole in the middle of each space where you can stick the symbols I made.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried it and found out that it is overwhelmingly advantageous if one were to mark the central space so I made a four by four board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is quite profound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if one already lined up a row, both parties sometimes don’t notice it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, it is a rule failure if both parties didn’t declare who won first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is unexpectedly overlooked most times which results to come-from-behind defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: It’s like Nikola Tesla. He found it out first but someone claimed it for him so he became the loser in the end.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">I also made a five by five board but it’s a failure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It takes too much time and really hard to play.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>? You started something strange.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim is having a conversation with Rasuti while enjoying the regular 3 by 3 tic tac toe board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim’s visit to the village has decreased. It is probably related to Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or is it the result of the lamia transport? He can obtain things he wanted even without going here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren joined their conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Doraim-chan, by chance, do you not want to meet your oneechan?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, you’re joking aneki.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Then, are you going to my house to play too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Ah, o, of course. However, I heard you’re doing a lot of things. It is a good thing that you came here since I can hear your voice now.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m only joking. You don’t have to panic that much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, ahahaha….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way Rasuti-chan, may I also use the reward medal you receive as our race’s representative in something?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, I can’t think of what to use it for. Do you have anything in mind?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Could it be possibly used to gather some humans and demons?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Aneki? If you’re thinking of a sacrificial ritual please stop.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Now Doraim-chan, do you really think your oneechan will do such a thing? I’ll get angry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「To tell you the truth, the village chief….」</p>


<p class="calibre2">「You want to gather humans and demons?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was proposed during a meeting with the race’s representatives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was proposed using the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The intention was to solve the problem I had said before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Males in this village are too few.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If we don’t bring up people who can do farm work beside me, the village will collapse if something happens to me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The proposal to solve those two problems was to gather humans and demons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I don’t think it is bad but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How many are you planning to gather?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I think the more, the better.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That might be so but if the population suddenly increase, will we be okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Up to now, we can still adapt and support everyone even if the population increase.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, we’re talking about gathering a number of people to formally form a village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rapid population growth will have many problems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Honestly speaking, when the 10 civil servant girls came, we have expected problems to arise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Frau flawlessly handles them well so there were no problems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I will be too naive if I think that the same will happen now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know how they plan on bringing them here or what connection they plan to use but problems will definitely arise if a lot of new people migrates in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Therefore, it is proposed that we’ll make a new village in another place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What do you mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It means as it sounds. We’ll make a new village in a different location and gather humans and demons to farm there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">There will be problems if they suddenly came here so you’ll separate them from the start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I think it’s a good idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a proposal meeting so no decision yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one with the final say will be the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, it means that it is my responsibility to decide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want to escape from responsibility but I want to be more of a farmer than a village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So when I proposed a majority decision, it was denied by the majority.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The majority agreed that only I have the right to decide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, under a harsh environment, I have been persuaded to be a strong leader that can decide when necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Frau was also on the side that persuading me so it is useless for me to hand over the power to decide to the governor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s gather villagers and make a new village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I returned the submitted reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not a personal appeal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is something that can be proposed directly without using it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though I decided to gather villagers and make a new village, I’m not doing anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is nothing to do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no need for me to do anything at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves and the kuros are surveying several places to select for the new village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that it is good to select a place beside a river but if the river overflowed, it will be a big problem. They also have to keep in mind that the place should not irritate the monsters living in the forest.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’ll leave it to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In regards to gathering villagers, Frau, Rasuti, and Hakuren are talking with Doraim, Beezel, and Michael-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they can gather them easily, there are various troublesome procedures they need to go through. They also need to talk to various people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My apologies but I’ll leave it all to you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I left it to them….I’m a little lonely since I’m not involved in anything.</p>


<p class="calibre2">It can’t be helped. I’ll just work hard for the sports festival with reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>as prizes <em class="calibre5">event</em> that I have thought of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The members of the sports festival executive committee are me and the civil servant girls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Loo, Tier, and the onis are busy raising my children, they’ll take the role <em class="calibre5">advisers</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is also Flora but she’s already busy with the taste improvement of the miso and soy sauce so I don’t want to bother her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sports festival is important but soy sauce and miso are also important.</p>


<p class="calibre2">To decide the events of the sports festival, I investigated various things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I said I investigated….the race’s differences are obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For example, when running on a level ground, the onis are overwhelming fast while the dwarves are really slow that you’ll doubt if they are really running.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When it comes to obstacle race, the high elves are agile but the mountain elves and beastkins will not fall behind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarves will definitely be pulverized in the obstacles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though there are naturally individual differences, I judged that the race difference is too great to be able to compete fairly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I originally intended to divide each team according to race but that would be pointless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are events where the kuros and spiders can’t participate and Rasuti and Hakuren are too OP.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastkins are also at a disadvantage because they are all young.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Reviewing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I divide them into two groups, red and white?</p>
<p class="calibre2">But how will I divide them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should we take half of each race and have them join each team?</p>


<p class="calibre2">There are no competitions called sports festival but there seem to be similar events.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To me who came from another world, sports festival is a common event.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Three-legged race, obstacle race, ball-throwing game, ball-rolling game,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bo-taoshi" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> bo-taoishi</a>, mock cavalry, I played them all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I told that to the civil servant girls, they told me similar <em class="calibre5">events</em>……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Martial arts competition, spell casting competition, hunting competition, ultra long-distance relay race, and war simulation are the games they told me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Martial arts competition is true to its name.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If it is an armed battle, the participants are free to choose their weapon. It is really popular.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spell casting competition, I feel like competing with magic is safer than martial arts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Simple magic is really effective against any target so it is always used in that event.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hunting competition is set in a suitable forest. The participants compete for the type and size of the hunted prey….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is not really a serious competition, it is more on socializing. Well, there are some people who don’t get it.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">Ultra long-distance relay is a competition where a team carries luggage from a city to a distant town.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can use whatever transportation means you can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first team who carried the luggage to the designated place wins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is done quite frequently in order to establish a means of transportation.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「However, although obstructing other competitors is not allowed, you should never let your guard down since it is impossible to oversee the competition the whole time.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">War simulation is a war simulation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is a practice for war. There are quite a number of people who are injured during that event.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dying is not unusual either.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing them, I decided to temporarily freeze the sports festival and consider another plan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The civil servant girls showed interest in the events that I proposed but the racial difference is too troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if some argue about individuality, the obvious superiority or inferiority can’t be overlooked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The purpose of sports festival is recreation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words …</p>
<p class="calibre2">I recalled an<em class="calibre5"> idol</em> program I was watching in the hospital when I was in my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, what I recalled is the show next to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a program that travels all over the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And in the <em class="calibre5">corners </em>of the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are various festivals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What I should conduct is not a school-wide sports festival but a world-class festival.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-5"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 82 &ndash; Festival Executive Committee and Musical Instrument</h1><p class="calibre2">The sports festival executive committee was dissolved and a festival executive committee was established.<span id="calibre_link-179"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The members are still me and the civil servant girls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Lifting decorations while walking around? What about the destination?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Throwing tomatoes? That’s wasting food….don’t you think so too, village chief?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Running after a cow? What’s the point….」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Last two are from Spain, right?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Chasing after a rolling food down the slope? Ehto….」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Cheese rolling fest in UK?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I explain those festivals using words, it seems like they don’t get it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, that’s right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, that’s right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those festivals are native to each country so if a person from another place saw them, they’ll think that they are doing some strange things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But if they’re not like that, I don’t think they’ll be televised.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, I explained to them what a festival is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They must see it like a normal type of celebration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the usual Bon Festival Dance in my previous world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, that’s according to my common sense but how should I explain it to these civil servant girls who don’t have any idea about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Festival….there are festivals to celebrate New Year and harvest.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is something needs to be done during festivals?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right, I made a mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I explain about festival using words, they won’t be able to understand it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They understand the part of eating and drinking but they don’t understand the actions that need to be done during the celebration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is the standard of this world. I thought I can completely entrust it to the civil service girls but apparently, it doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Starting from this point is the origin story of a countryside festival.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「In my place, Pyoppyo goes to the heart of the city and attacks a rich man’s house.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Pyoppyo dug a hole then attack Mumu.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, isn’t Mumu some sort of food? How did Pyoppyo attack?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ambush in the dark.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like festival in the countryside here is really different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How did it originate from assassination?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, more than that, the problem is….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can you integrate it with my plan?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That will be difficult.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The future of the festival executive committee is dark.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s stop at once.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There are a lot of people who can sing in the village.</p>

<p class="calibre2">They are quite lively whether they are eating, working, or between work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, they are good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pretty good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I don’t have a single fragment of confidence in my singing ability, I’m a bit jealous.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even though there are singers in the village, there are only a few instruments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because musical instruments are owned only by those who can afford.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, there are only a few instruments in the village. And they are practically bells.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no way you can enjoy music using that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ve already known about it when I thought about the BGM of the sports festival.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, I started making musical instruments.</p>


<p class="calibre2">First, a flute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">It didn’t produce a sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So it is useless if I just put a hole.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, how many holes should I bore?</p>


<p class="calibre2">Harp.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">How many strings should it have?</p>
<p class="calibre2">&ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&ndash;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Xylophone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">It made a hitting-a-wood sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I imagined it to at least to make a “pon” sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I adjust the length of each bar and the type of wood?</p>


<p class="calibre2">I boldly made a guitar!</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..however, it is impossible to make an instrument that I have never touched before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I asked the civil servant girls about it by describing the shape and one of them said that it was a lute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, a lute is a musical instrument that is similar to a guitar that usually appears in fantasy story, to think that it will appear here too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Either way, the sound it produced was not that appealing.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the time being, I thought of an instrument that I can possibly reproduce with the right sound, a drum.</p>

<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut down a log and hollowed it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, put cloth on both end….no, cloth is not good enough so I put leather.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The leather was given by Zabuton. It came from her collection that she saved up on the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, it produced a good sound.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Fufufu</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, I was able to make a musical instrument that can produce a decent sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good good</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will continue in this direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gripped the AFT and looked at the wood next to me intensely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, I made a<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_fish" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> mokugyo</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was mortified but it made the best sound I heard up to now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahaha</p>
<p class="calibre2">The limit of one’s ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s request the villager’s cooperation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A person who knows something about musical instrument…..I have never heard of such a villager.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I was making musical instruments, the high elves, mountain elves, and civil servant girls are wandering around from time to time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I strive for making musical instruments while listening to their opinions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I followed their instructions to be exact.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Various flutes, big and small.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flute was preferred over transverse flute.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Harp, lute, guitar like instrument,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamisen" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> shamisen</a> like instrument,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guqin" class="pcalibre3 pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2"> guqin</a> like instrument.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t remember their name but I know that the name changes as the number of strings of the musical instrument changes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maracas, xylophone, musical chimes, drum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know about the details but I made each part as instructed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others assemble and tune them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, you can make a drum with different sound just by simply placing leather on one side.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I thought of xylophone, I forgot about musical chimes….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Darn.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I was a bit annoyed by it, I made similar instruments like tambourine, castanets, and triangle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, they already assembled musical instruments similar to them but no one complained about the things I made.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Although it seems like there is a piano-like thing here, we did not make one because it is too difficult to make.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Should I consult Michael-san in order to obtain one?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I cannot play, someone else can play it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, that’s another story. For now, we were able to make several musical instruments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since there are musical instruments, the next thing to do is about the performance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one who cooperated in making the instruments, the high elves, mountain elves, and civil servant girls, can play well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">High elves are good with wind instruments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mountain elves are good with percussion instruments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The civil servant girls are good with string instruments. It is good that they are properly divided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They even taught those who never touched musical instruments before to be able to play them without problems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about distributing musical instrument to the villagers but it became something like a village-owned objects where they can be lent to anyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they are lent out, they properly return it and there is no need to collect them so there was no problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The villagers were touched by the musical instruments and given that they can be guided on how to play them. Music was continued to be heard nonstop at the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until the third day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about stop playing music at night?」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Only that time that it was decided to have a fixed time to play musical instruments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is now prohibited to play music after sunset.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, it is not prohibited to play at dinner and during banquet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want them to enjoy everything moderately.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, Alfred and Tiselle’s room is soundproofed by magic so it is quiet there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is also the reason for my late action.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-24"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 83 &ndash; Dwarves’ Mode of Life and New Visitor</h1><p class="calibre2">Dwarves, upon hearing that race name, you’ll probably think that they are always drunk but they are not.<span id="calibre_link-180"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">They are hard workers, but only on things related to alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If alcohol is involved, they even farm without complaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, they are noisier than anyone, especially during harvest time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s a good thing.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When brewing alcoholic beverages, one might think that they will be drinking what they brew as taste test habitually but they have never done anything like that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I asked them, they said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If we got drunk, how are we going to make good alcohol?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There are times when they are using fire when brewing liquor, they take turns all day and all night to make sure that the liquor is being constantly heated in the right temperature.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A fire watchman who drinks is damnable.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think that’s true.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fire is scary after all.</p>


<p class="calibre2">They drink alcohol as they eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu, today’s liquor is a failure.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, the scent is all over. It is only a liquor for burning throat.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Speaking of scent, I found a tree that smells good. Why don’t we make barrels using that?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Instead on barrels, why don’t we use the method that the village chief said?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is it about using dried crops to add scent?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’ll only need to smoke the liquor before drinking it. It won’t be difficult.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. However, I feel a bit regretful that we have not thought of such a method before.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although they drink alcohol during every meal, the products they made have good reviews and their research results are good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I have to regulate the heavy drinking culture of the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, villagers can only drink alcohols during banquet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I know that it is bad to ban it for a long time so after they learn to drink in moderation, I’ll lift the ban….I hope this continues as I visioned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, they can always drink if they exchange reward <em class="calibre5">medals</em> for alcohol so I don’t think they’ll rebel.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In any case, unlike their <em class="calibre5">image</em>, dwarves are not drunkards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In regards to brewing alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Ah, Donovan」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is it, village chief?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did your number increase again?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. Someone arrived this morning. I thought of letting village chief know as soon as possible but I want to prioritize brewing alcohol.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Currently, there are now 15 dwarves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you have troubles in sleeping space? Do you want another one to be constructed?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I would like for a dry cabin to be constructed first. After that, we want a new distiller. We’ll set that up in the new cabin.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I could have that build if necessary but how about your sleeping space?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, please make the cabin first. The floor is enough for all of us to sleep in.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are enthusiastic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In regards to brewing alcohol.</p>


<p class="calibre2">A visitor came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a strange person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Strange point number one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He managed to enter the village without being detected by Zabuton, the angels, and the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, that happened with the new dwarves too….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Strange point number two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton and the kuros did not attack him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He gives the vibes that even if you start a fight with him, you won’t be able to touch him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Strange point number three.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was discovered when he was prostrating in front of the statues of gods at the shrine I made under the big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And when we discovered and surrounds him, he did not stand up and kept all five on the ground.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Why is he on all five?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is the highest form of prostrating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Given that he’s showing his utmost respect, we only watch him until he’s satisfied.</p>


<p class="calibre2">And the visitor’s identity was uncovered in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ancestor-sama?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo’s grandfather.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「I heard that Lulushi gave birth to a child. I thought it was some kind of mistake but….it is true.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I also never thought that I can bear a child.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right, however, having a child is a rare occurrence so he’s a treasure. Cherish him.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, thank you very much.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">Although he’s her ancestor-san, he looks like her oniichan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s wearing a cliche like high noble clothes with torn part.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although there is a torn part, it doesn’t look sluggish. On the contrary, it looks fashionable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s not giving off an aristocratic air but it’s opposite, he seems friendly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it is probably because his clothes are dirty as he prostrated on all five.</p>


<p class="calibre2">According to Lulushi’s introduction, ancestor-san has been living since 4,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">4,000 years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cannot detect a single trace of it in this everyday neighborhood oniisan.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha. The trick to living long is occasionally resetting one’s memory.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that I’m doubtful, ancestor-san explains it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t forget about important things like names and blood relationship, all others are to be forgotten. You’ll be uneasy at first but you’ll get accustomed to it after doing it a few more times. The last time I reset was about 200 years ago so I feel young again.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So, vampires have that ability?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is not a vampire’s ability, it’s magic. I think some dragons are doing it too. Living long is also tough. Ah, haven’t you heard anything from Dors?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You know Dors?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I heard about you from Dors. Ah, right right, I’m sorry for entering the village without greeting you. I was planning on going home silently after I verify the situation but the smell of interest caught me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Smell?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This. This statue. The god of creation.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「God of creation? Which one?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I caved two gods under the big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One is the god I met when I came to this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other one is the god of agriculture who bestowed me the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ancestor-san did not hesitate and pointed the god I met when I came to this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That one. It’s amazing. It is the exact embodiment of the god of creation. I instinctively prostrated.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….you met him?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Once, when I was born. My constitution is a bit different but he told me to persevere.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Your unusual constitution is being a vampire? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Looks like it. Because of my constitution, I had a lot of hardship and was saved various times. However, even though I seem to have done a lot, I have no memories of them. hahaha 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ancestor-san laughs but looking at his face, I can see that he’s serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No matter what I happens, I will never forget the god of creation. However, I don’t really remember how he truly looks like. Is he a young person? Or an old one? What is the color of his eyes? What is the color of his hair? What about the length? Though I also tried making an image of him, I couldn’t make something that can embody him like this one. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing the eyes of ancestor-san, I feel warm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「As expected, it is impossible to make things that embody him. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is regrettable but you are right. Therefore, I want you to carve a new one for me. I will pay you properly. I wonder if you can do it for me. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah…. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was a little worried so I looked around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Few villagers have gathered….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Flora are looking at me as if willing to worship me just to accept the request.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier and the angels are looking at me helplessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti and Hakuren look like they are waiting for me to answer.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Frau and the civil servant girls seem to have decided not to look at ancestor-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are escaping reality.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The others are on their all fours.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most of them have helpless faces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll carve it….however, I don’t know if you’ll like it. I’m not a sculptor. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Actually, even though I’m the one carving, all the credits should be on the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, I don’t mind it at all. Thank you very much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「All right. Please give me some time and I’ll give it to you. Ah…..what <em class="calibre5">size</em> do you want? Do you want life <em class="calibre5">size</em>?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I would love that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Affirmative. I’ll carve it right away.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I went to the forest and chose a good tree and cut it down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the AFT into a chisel and carved while giving off my feelings of gratitude.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Carve carve carve</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the AFT into a graver for fine-tuning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I feel that it became 20% more handsome than the statue under the big tree…..I think the atmosphere it gives off matches it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How’s this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t hear ancestor-san’s answer since he’s already on all five before the newly carved statue.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After that, we held a welcome banquet for ancestor-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the midst of it, ancestor-san embraced Alfred with a fully smiling face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This person is probably doing what a grandfather is expected to do but looking at his young face, they look like father and son.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I thought that they are picturesque, I’m a little jealous because it is my son.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo came to me and soothed me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Un, this is a family.</p>


<p class="calibre2">During the banquet, Loo talked a lot about ancestor-san and only then I understood how awesome he is.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-43"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 84 &ndash; Church and Piano</h1><p class="calibre2">A certain country, central temple.<span id="calibre_link-181"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ohh, Founder-sama, welcome back.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Long time no see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, last time we’ve met was 50 years ago.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Are you the temple head now?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I was elected 30 years ago.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You are a faithful one. It is proper for you to be chosen.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did anything happen?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There’s none. Things are as usual.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really? But I brought a joyous change today.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What kind of change?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I want you to enshrine the statue I brought in the main temple.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…a new statue?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I want you to enshrine it in the best place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The best place? You mean we’ll have to put it where the statue of the creation god is enshrined?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, there….fufufu. Why do you look dissatisfied?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My apologies.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand your dissatisfaction but one you see the statue I brought, you’ll change your mind.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….Is that so?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Otherwise, do you think I’ll even come here?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Certainly, I will arrange the installation.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">A few days later, a grand festival was held in the oldest authoritative temple on the continent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason for the festival is unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is the largest festival in the temple’s history.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is also rumored that all those who had entered the main temple are overflowing with tears.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Let’s entitle the sculptor as a saint.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t, that’s something that can’t be done. The person in question dislikes standing out. He might even hate us if we designate him as a saint.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mou, such a pity.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「However, there will be no problem if we assist him secretly.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Truly. As expected of founder-sama.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, tell all branches, never be hostile against him.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Haha」</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, what a grandous sneeze, are you alright?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Ah yeah, I’m even surprised myself.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After being bestowed by god with “healthy body”, this is the first time I sneeze.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I have a healthy body, does it means that it is not because of a physiological phenomenon?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way village chief, are we going to install the piano now?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The piano was sent by ancestor-san after he left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He tried to pay me for the sculpture when I gave it to him but I declined since I feel like I’m selling god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He wants to pay but I don’t want to receive anything. We talk and talk until the topic reaches Tiselle’s birthday celebration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The piano was his birthday present for her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was really pleased but Frau and the civil servant girls mouths were wide open.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that a piano is a really high-end item, is that the reason?</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, since I already received it, I’ll use it without reservation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, after various debates on where should it be installed, it was decided that it will be placed in the dining room.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「That piano, it is a Grazuole piano. It is said that there are only three of them in the world….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, I confirmed the emblem. It is genuine.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I heard that the only ones who have them are the biggest church and temple.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, and they only use it during big ceremonies.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…..I-I shouldn’t have checked the emblem. Are we even qualified to play it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「T-that’s right but this is a rare chance…..no, normally, we’ll never have an opportunity to touch it in our entire life.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, what should we do?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fraurem-san will have the final say. After that….do you think Loo-san, Tier-san and the others know about it? It looks like they don’t care. How about Rasuti-san and Hakuren-san? By chance, do you think the mountain elves or the elder dwarves know about it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There’s a possibility.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. Then….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Allow me to play it while it’s still possible.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The newly arrived piano was popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Various people wanted to play it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, some of them are good but most of them just want to play with it…..</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Another one?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I really want to practice. It doesn’t matter even if it is a ragged one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is for the stability of our spirit, so please. Practicing using that piano is kind of….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were some people who volunteered to offer their reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> but I returned them since it is unnecessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not easy to get reward<em class="calibre5"> medal</em> and I don’t think that what they want actually needs reward <em class="calibre5">medals</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I asked Michael-san to purchase another piano.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is already a used item, it is still expensive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Entertainment items sure are expensive.</p>



<p class="calibre2">By the way, the one who transported the piano that ancestor-san sent was Maxbergak, Suiren’s husband.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like he was indebted to ancestor-san in various things ever since he was born so he cannot refuse his request.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave him crops as souvenir.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Rasuti and Hakuren headed for the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> in the north.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their objectives are exterminating the big snakes, <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>, living in the dungeon and obtaining their meat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Accompanying them are the same survey team.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be safe if Rasuti and Hakuren are on their own but upon considering the titans who’ll cooperate with them, I felt a little anxious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wish there will be no internal disputes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What if, for some reason, Rasuti and Hakuren went berserk?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wanted to send someone who can stop the two but gave up because there’s no villager that can stop them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave the high elves that accompany them a secret order of reporting to me if those two cause trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There was no problem.” that’s the report I want to hear.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-62"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 85 &ndash; Building a New Village</h1><p class="calibre2">The place where the new village will be built has been decided.<span id="calibre_link-182"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The place is a little south across the river in the west of Big Tree Village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we talk about its straight line distance from here…..about 10 kilometers?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The river flows from north to south-southwest and the new village location is a little closer to the river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why is that location selected?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「First of all, considering its hierarchical relationship with this village, it is necessary to be located downstream.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m a little perplexed with Ria’s answer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hierarchical relationship?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ehto….is that necessary?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is necessary.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">She told me that with eyes that have no trace of impurity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Really? So it’s necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ma-maa, okay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So that’s why it’s downstream….but why on the other side of the river?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If the new village ever tries to revolt, they will be stopped by the river.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Revolt?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, it is necessary to think that possibility.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Isn’t it a useless thinking?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I-is that so?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s not useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not think about it deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Another reason for that place being chosen is that there are no big monsters or demon beasts nearby. The spiderlings and the kuros are enough to defend it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I-I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">That reminds me, the kuros, who have coordinated and voluntarily control their birth, are working hard this year.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps they are thinking of the security needs of the new village so they are trying to increase their number again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or, are they anticipating the increase in harvest because of the establishment of the new village?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps both.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at them, Masayuki, that one who has a lot of <em class="calibre5">partners</em>, has tired eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My sympathy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I really know how you feel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s return to new village building.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I now know about the location of the new village. Then, I have to go there and clear up the forest first.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right but there is something we’d like to work in before that.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Hnn?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Bridge.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Bridge? Ah, ahhh, a bridge to cross the river.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, thinking about the transport of materials, it would really help if there’s a bridge.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Correct…..so, have you been avoiding the river until now?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, there’s a place where one can cross. The kuros are jumping over that place to cross the river.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The waterway was being used similar to a road so I think that we should build a bridge near the waterway.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Please do so.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first construction team of the new village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Representative: Me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Construction workers: Eight high elves including Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Heavy laborer: Five lizardmen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Guards: ten kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Liaison Officer: Kuudel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">The river’s width is about 5 meters.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The depth of water is around 1 to 3 meters depending on the location.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The riverside is not sandy but a rocky place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is about 1 meter above river level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">North of where we are is a place similar to a waterfall which is about 7 meters in height.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The waterway is getting water from this high waterfall.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’ll build a bridge a little downstream from where we are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bridge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought we’re going to make a suspension bridge but the elves seem to have a different idea.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We’ll make a bridge made from one fat tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We just need to make sure that both ends are fixed so it won’t move.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I plane the top surface of the bridge so it can be walked on easily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The distance between the ground and the surface of the bridge is about 1 meter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the help of the AFT, we completed it in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is this all right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, let’s build some more please.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Affirmative.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">We built five bridges.</p>

<p class="calibre2">They were built with the distance where you can see all of them in one look.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Won’t it be better to build one wide bridge?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If we build a wide bridge, big monsters and demon beasts will cross it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, so that’s why.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess I should pay attention to the state of the surrounding too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can you clear up the places both sides of each bridge? That will make any approaching monsters or demon beasts easier to be spotted.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Affirmative.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using the AFT, I cut the trees and plow the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be visually better if I turn it into a lawn than plain soil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, our bridge building ended.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that we’re going to the location of the new village immediately but I guess I’m wrong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, village chief, the place is in this direction.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I started making a road on our way to the new village construction site.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, a road is certainly necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut down the trees and plow the stumps using the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The road is about 5 meters wide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We’ll hunt around this place.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Sure, just let me know if I got off course.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Affirmative.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I quietly made the road until the sun sets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like I’m already accustomed on the proper use of the AFT. Compared before, my road making did not take several days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is the planned construction site?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not sure if this place is good or bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m not sure, it probably is. I trust Ria’s judgment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, this tree.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hnn?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria guided me to one big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is like the tree in the middle of Big Tree village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I would like to make this tree the center of a new village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. I get it now.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I plow the area around the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I prepared the place as Ria suggested and clear everything around it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, I took it in my heart that I should not think of unnecessary things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because crops will sprout if I think about them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has become a field and it is heartbreaking to destroy budding crops.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I have no excuse for Ria and the others who are already planning various things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m innocent. It can’t be helped since I have the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After working for a few days, the vast land around the big tree was cleared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, digging a well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until now, we’re drinking water from the flask we carried. We’ll have it easier now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next is <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, <em class="calibre5">toilet </em>is important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We secured the grass for wiping purposes and installed a hand washing tub.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next time, let’s bring a <em class="calibre5">slime</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Big tree, well, and <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We secured a large amount of timber when we cleared up the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the construction has not started yet so I build a shrine beside the big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to enshrine the god who sent me to this world and the god who bestowed me the AFT in this place too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves help me so we finished it in a very short time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I carved the statue of the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup, they are both ikemen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like in Big Tree village, I also carved Kuro and Yuki’s statues and arrange them like guardian dogs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I added some playfulness and also carved a life-size Zabuton statue….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I find it troublesome where to put it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like it will be disrespectful to the gods if I put her statue with them so I decided to put it on the tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had the spiderlings came here and carry the statue on the big tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How are they going to put it there?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t mind if you fixed it in place in order for it not to drop.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I just noticed now but there are dozens of spiderlings on the big tree.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-81"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 86 &ndash; New Village Building and the Return of the Survey Team</h1><p class="calibre2">The new village’s facilities, well, toilet, and shrine, were completed.<span id="calibre_link-183"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next one would be a big building that can be used as an assembly house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being protected from rain is enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of helping them build it but there is another thing that needs to be built.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though there is a well, waterway is essential if you think about the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The waterway and its drain should be built parallel to the road.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess I’ll make the drain waterway first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a few days, I reached the river.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compared to the past, I realized that I’m faster now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is this a good place for the reservoir?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, please dig it there.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the order seems to be reversed, I dug a reservoir at the end of the drain waterway.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I didn’t forget to make a slime pool for drainage purification.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I now have to build the drawing water waterway but I thought that I shouldn’t build it anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think the new villagers should build it on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I prepare everything for them, who knows if they’ll take it for granted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, they shouldn’t monopolize all the benefits for all the things we made here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, it seems like my work here is done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Anything else?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, thank you very much. We can take care of everything else.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The eight high elves and five lizardmen were already replaced several times during the building process.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ten kuros are guarding them and there’s also the dozens of spiderlings that unexpectedly came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They’re going to be okay, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. Continue your hard work.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was held by Kuudel, the Riaison officer, and she carried me back to the Big Tree Village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, when I was working over there, she always carries me back before sunset so I’m used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have the AFT so I can work all night non-stop but according to the villagers, I need to return and get back on my bed to take a good rest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they really think so, please let me sleep more at night.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When we got back to the village, everything is the same as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Crops that can be harvested are harvested. After that, the field will be plowed again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the new village, they’ll need to prepare seeds and seedlings so it will be harder than usual.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The survey team who headed north returned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti and Hakuren are both in their dragon form. They are carrying their <em class="calibre5">bloody vipers</em> prey.</p>

<p class="calibre2">「How many are those?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">They brought 17 <em class="calibre5">bloody vipers</em> to the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They take up too much space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did they not rot?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Considering that time has already passed when they subjugated them, they should be dead for several days already.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, their meat looks fresh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「<em class="calibre5">Bloody viper’s</em> meat is famous for its long preservation time.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Their vitality is so strong that they don’t rot easily. Even if you cut their head, their body will grow if you don’t kill them properly.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if they said so, I was surprised that I can only reply “haa”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did you annihilate them?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We did not annihilate them, we left the small ones. Because of that, every year….no, that’s not possible, how many years will it take before we can hunt them again?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ehto….that aside, are the friendly titans alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「We left some for them or else, the titans will not have anything to eat. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….You mean, they eat <em class="calibre5">bloody vipers</em>? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「To be specific, they eat <em class="calibre5">bloody viper’s</em> snakelets. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, it’s like their leftover food grew big and now acting violently?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not think about it deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「At any rate…..is the investigation of the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> in the north complete?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ask one of the high elves of the survey team.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, we also got a detailed inside map of the dungeon from the friendly titans. All dangerous creatures inside are suppressed. That includes all the grown <em class="calibre5">bloody vipers</em>…..」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that it? Don’t you have anything else to report?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hearing my question, the high elf’s face cramped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s the high elf that I gave secret order to before leaving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Rasuti and Hakuren, did they caused trouble?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A, a part of the <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> collapsed……they are the cause…..the titans said that it’s alright. They even said it in polite manner. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you think they mean it? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Even though they said that there’s no problem, I think it has a huge impact on the titans. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….Let’s send some crops to the titans later. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti and Hakuren can’t really hold back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s leave it as it is for now….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I gave each villager member of the survey team a reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope they’ll use it well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of giving the lamia members crops but it seems like they are interested with the reward<em class="calibre5"> medal</em> for some reason. I explained to them how to use it and pass them five reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please take note that it has no value outside the village.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The return of the survey team is celebrated with a banquet.</p>

<p class="calibre2">A large amount of <em class="calibre5">bloody viper </em>meat was cooked and served. That night was pretty intense.</p>


<p class="calibre2">On the next day, Rasuti brought bloody viper’s meat to Doraim’s nest while Hakuren brought some to Suiren and Sekiren’s nests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at dragons carrying big snakes….they look pretty mighty.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Thought it already decreased a lot, why is it that there are still a huge amount of <em class="calibre5">bloody vipers</em> here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll give one to the kuros….though they’ve already eaten at the banquet, it seems like they still want to eat it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will you be alright?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, should I roast it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, let’s roast it first.</p>


<p class="calibre2">One for Zabuton and the spiderlings….are you fine eating it raw?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton and the spiderlings clustered to the <em class="calibre5">bloody viper</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Their number is a whole lot more than I imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">It became bone in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a large, beautiful gem in its skull.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems to be the magic stone that monsters and demon beasts have.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Speaking of that, the big wild boar also has magic core but the kuros has been eating it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it edible?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was thinking about it, Zabuton ate the magic stone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems edible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it looks painful to eat so I guess I won’t eat it anytime soon.</p>


<p class="calibre2">In any case, all the <em class="calibre5">bloody vipers</em> were eaten after a few days.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for their bones…..I intended to plow them but they were kept in the warehouse.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-100"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 87 &ndash; Rebellion of a Certain Mountain Elf</h1><p class="calibre2">We are a race called mountain elves.<span id="calibre_link-184"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Nobody can match us in the mountains.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only ones who can be considered as a match is another mountain elf.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unfortunately, my family fought against another mountain elf family. We lost our home and were forced to wander.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lucky enough, we immediately found another place we can settle down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, it is a much better place compared to our previous home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ya-sama, the leader of our group, greeted the chief with respect and courtesy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of Ya-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Being courteous is important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think I should also show my courtesy too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And so, I greeted him with respect.</p>


<p class="calibre2">However, at any rate, but!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently dissatisfied with our everyday lives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because of the attitude of the village chief, the lord of our new home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He doesn’t know how to treat a woman who fell in love for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He really doesn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, he’s not someone to fall in love with.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ya-sama is already at the right age.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I feel like she already passed that age, no, she’s just a very late bloomer….. no, damn it!</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, that man knows nothing about love!</p>
<p class="calibre2">A heartless man!</p>
<p class="calibre2">He doesn’t know the word “fidelity” and is in a relationship with countless females!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it’s true that I thought he’s really amazing when I heard that he made this village in this area alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He deserves to be respected for it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s also really awesome to have a famous vampire and a famous angel as his subordinates.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His habit of making females his past time is the worst!</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t intend to go against him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I even recognize him as the lord of this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I will never accept him as Ya-sama’s partner!</p>
<p class="calibre2">NEVER!</p>


<p class="calibre2">However, looking at the present situation, I doubt Ya-sama will listen to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Similarly, it is a waste of time to talk to the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t think he’ll stop changing partners every now and then just because I told him so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>

<p class="calibre2">What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">How can I prevent Ya-sama from the evil grasp of the village chief?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should speak with someone with more wisdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is embarrassing to say but, we always relied on Ya-sama regarding that matter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But how can I consult Ya-sama about this….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All the person of wisdom residing in this village is entirely hanging on the village chief’s tooth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The demon ladies who are called here as the civil servant girls seem to be alright….however, I stopped because I can feel the pain in their eyes. How could I rely on them?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Intuition is important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Using that, we managed to defend ourselves from various things on the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, the remaining ones I can rely on are Zabuton-san and Kuro-san….</p>
<p class="calibre2">But communicating with them is difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They’re also a little scary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it has come to this, there’s no choice but to rely on my own effort.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I squeezed my brain a few times but nothing came out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now is the time for you to be active, brain of mine!</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently, Ya-sama feels something for the village chief. (My speculation)</p>
<p class="calibre2">But the village chief feels nothing for Ya-sama. (Might be so but I’m not really sure.)</p>
<p class="calibre2">…………</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, if Ya-sama gives up on the village chief, everything will be <em class="calibre5">OK</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">How can I make her give up?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I say something about the age limit….no, I shouldn’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ya-sama is a wonderful woman.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can certainly found a good partner for her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And so, I gave up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I gave up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s think for another method….</p>
<p class="calibre2">If she saw the village chief’s bad side, will Ya-sama give up on him?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, that might be so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, this will be easy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s investigate the bad side of the village chief!</p>


<p class="calibre2">That’s what I thought five days ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief, who I thought was full of faults, is a very ordinary farmer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it might be better to say that he’s a serious farmer.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His only bad point is his night life….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, I still believe that a polygamous family is bad.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Mou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Could it be that Ya-sama’s eyes are reliable?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, I should not give up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I’m trying to look for the village chief’s bad side, I can only observe him during my free time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, I can only observe the village chief for a limited time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a possibility that his bad points can be seen during the times my eyes are off him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll put off my work tomorrow.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Today, the village chief is doing a precision job for something at his house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did someone ask him to do so?</p>
<p class="calibre2">He cut a small tree and get some threads of Zabuton-san from the warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is he trying to do?</p>
<p class="calibre2">By chance, could this be connected to the village chief’s bad points?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I shouldn’t get excited yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I observe what the village chief is doing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t get it at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There were times where I don’t understand the village chief’s action but not this much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I totally don’t, wait….</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I somewhat have an idea…..it is something that I’m knowledgeable at….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Trap?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I unintentionally spoke.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, it’s not a trap.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief has become aware of my presence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m ashamed of my failure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it seems like the village chief didn’t know that I’m secretly observing him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, what’s that?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah….this will be here…..and it will be completed with this.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is complete now?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief said so and put down a wooden board along with several more wooden boards arranged in a certain manner……then, the ball begins to roll.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ball hits a board which is tied to a certain mechanism which is tied to another mechanism and is connected to some more mechanisms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Oooohhhhhh! Amazing! A chain of traps!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, it’s not a trap…. Well, it gives that feeling. But it stops here.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">With the village chief’s explanation, the ball seemed to have to come and go at the cup but it seems like something went wrong there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What will happen if it goes well?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It will move here, then if you move this….it will be like this.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Ooohhh!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mountain elves are good at hunting using traps.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I just want to say that….</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, I really love this!</p>


<p class="calibre2">That day, I forgot about the time and just played with the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it hasn’t reached the end, I’m satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t want to leave that masterpiece for eternity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the heartless oni <em class="calibre5">maid</em> told us to tidy things up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She doesn’t know the true meaning of art.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She should have looked at it carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since it has come to this I just need to….ah, yes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll clean this up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks really scary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s just like an oni!</p>
<p class="calibre2">……areh?</p>


<p class="calibre2">At a later date.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I know that it’s pointless, I tried to gently speak with the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please don’t lay your hands on Ya-sama.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「As you wish! But for that to happen, your cooperation is essential! Make sure that there won’t be any situation where there’s only she and I! Stay beside Ya as much as possible!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, ah, yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief made a face like a soldier who received reinforcement after being surrounded and isolated by enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If the atmosphere becomes good, trample it in any way you can! I beg of you! Absolutely do it! Please!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t feel any lie in any of his words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did I misunderstand something?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, the village chief probably thinks that he doesn’t deserve Ya-sama either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, that must be it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, under the permission of the village chief, I interfered with the relationship development between Ya-sama and the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why is Ya-sama looking at me with eyes full of grudge?</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-17"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 88 &ndash; The Village Chief’s Day, Morning till Noon</h1><p class="calibre2">My morning is late.<span id="calibre_link-185"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I only get up after the sun has completely risen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After light exercising which is similar to radio gymnastics, I first look around the house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the job of the head of the family. I always do it every morning and evening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it is impossible for me to do it, the one ranked next to me will do it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, the hierarchical ranking of this house is Loo, Tier, Flora, Ann, and Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alfred and Tiselle are still young so they are not included but I don’t really care about ranks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never knew about it and they only informed me regarding that matter recently.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think of the reason.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Patrolling the house in the morning is more on greetings those who work in this house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The oni <em class="calibre5">maids </em>are already doing the things they should do. They are already cleaning up and preparing breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are also preparing food for the kuros. They are working hard without complaining even though that is considerably hard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, because they should get up and work earlier than me, I should not get up too early.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I told them that I don’t mind so they shouldn’t worry about it but they still try to get up earlier than me. As the result, I gave up getting up early.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They said that as <em class="calibre5">maids</em>, they should never wake up later than their master. I think it is called <em class="calibre5">maid</em> spirit but I don’t really get it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, even if I wake up early, I will not get out of the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must not go out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wake up late because of them and not because I’m lazy.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Let’s get back to the topic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They talk with others first in case something happened and report it to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Last night, the wine slime invaded the food warehouse. One barrel of wine for cooking was torn down.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Did you manage to divide the amount of wine in that barrel first as anti-wine slime measures?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. It went according to plan however, I’m worried whether we should permit it to intrude like that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ve already half given up with the intrusion prevention measures. Let’s just go with this plan. Anything else?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Nothing in particular. The <em class="calibre5">main</em> dish for today’s breakfast is roasted <em class="calibre5">killer rabbit</em> in radish, spinach, and cabbage soup.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Alright. Bring it here now.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After my eating my breakfast, I looked around the house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking around excludes checking private rooms and warehouses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In short, there are not many places to check.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Greeting the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em> is the main point and after talking to them, it’s over.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are three breakfast times at my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first is for me, Loo, Tier, Flora, and Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alfred and Tiselle are not included since their meal and time of their meal are different.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, if we don’t eat, others can’t eat so I finish eating in a hurry.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Loo and Tier are having meals with Alfred and Tiselle.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The second serving is for the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I told them that they can eat together but they have to divide into several groups because of the size of the dining room, the amount of food that can be served at once, and there are those who still have to take care of Alfred and Tiselle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have to look for them when Loo and Tier are eating.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The third serving will be for those who did not make it during the first and second or for visitors who came to my house early in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora and Hakuren usually wake up later than me so they are often late for the first breakfast serving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are also Gran Maria, Kuudel, and Corone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, they are living with the lizardmen when they first came here but they are living in a different house now due to difference of daily life schedule.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, the angels don’t have any housekeeping ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cleaning and washing can be taken care of by the lizardmen but the problem is the food. Their eating schedule and what they eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also came here in the pretext of giving yesterday’s patrol report.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Was there a problem?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes. Three <em class="calibre5">killer rabbits</em> tried to approach the village last night but the kuros took care of them. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. However, the <em class="calibre5">killer rabbits</em> population doesn’t seem to decrease. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree. Well, their delicious so I don’t have any complaint. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Instead of decreasing, it seems like they are increasing.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After finishing breakfast, I’m now outside the house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro, Yuki, and Zabuton will come with me as I visit the shrine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, I’ll go around to check the fields.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m usually accompanied by Kuro and Yuki or the spiderlings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll plow the field that needs to be plowed and water fields that need water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also check the condition of the crops while exterminating harmful insects.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regarding harmful insects, the spiderlings eat them and there’s no significant damage because the kuros tell them if they found any.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I found harmful insects, I remove them using the watering can form of the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With regards to the condition of the crops….so far, no problem has occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it because they are planted using the AFT?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s always on my mind when I think about farming in the new village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if there are some magics that can be used for that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s talk about it with Loo and Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I should also ask Frau, Rasuti, and Hakuren.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The field has widened so much that it is hard to see everything in one glance.</p>

<p class="calibre2">However, seeing that the crops are growing fine, I feel relieved.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ate well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lunch is not the usual get together type. After the oni maids cook, I’m free to eat when I want.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The place where I eat is also not fixed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it is not fixed, I usually eat in the dining room in my house or on the courtyard.</p>


<p class="calibre2">By the way, about lunch, according to my memory from the previous world, eating lunch is normal but it is different in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Tier were surprised about the existence of lunch but they got used to it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros also don’t eat lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if I try feeding the kuros, they don’t eat anything. Well, there were times that they don’t eat for 10 days but it seems to be normal for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">10 days is the limit of my worry but it looks like they can still go on longer than that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aside from lunch, the high elves were puzzled with breakfast too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they only eat once a day so they are doubtful about it when they first came to this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Remembering those times, tears suddenly came out of my eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eat as much as you want, ladies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder why the dwarves didn’t get confused with lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, they are probably too focused on brewing alcohol to think about anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim and Beezel are frequent visitors of this village. They were also confused at the beginning but they are used to it now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, Yuri stayed here for a while, is she alright when she returned home?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I shouldn’t bother with everything that’s happening elsewhere…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, she’s the princess.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s in the position where she’s definitely alright, is she not?</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, lunch was accepted and is now a custom in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, my lunch has become a consultation and report time for the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is the reason why I’m having lunch near or at my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, we have completed majority of the buildings to be built in the new village. It only lacks interior details but I think we should leave those to the new residents. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The stomach of the female goats has swollen. I think they are pregnant. I would like to give them better food, is it alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I heard some say that they want to clear the forest at the southwest part of the village. It is near the residential area and it will be good if we think about the future expansion. I want to inquire your opinion.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「From what we expect from the autumn harvest, constructing a new warehouse is necessary. Or do you plan to immediately sell them to Mr. Michael?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m having lunch together with a high elf, a lizardman, an oni <em class="calibre5">maid,</em> and civil servant girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already heard the issues each of them wanted to report but I still haven’t replied.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By introducing the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em>, I think that this place has become easier to manage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Until a little while ago, Loo and Tier were with us but they have to take care of Alfred and Tiselle so they left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I might be a little distracted with things regarding Alfred and Tiselle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to reflect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, like the goats, the pregnant inferno wolves are also grumpy. Please don’t let Alfred-sama and Tiselle-sama approach them.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「I understand, I’ll take a note of it. Well, I think they’ll be alright since Loo and Tier are with them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah….Though I think mother’s care is the best for raising children, won’t you leave them to the onis who are accustomed on taking care of someone?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is there a problem with Loo and Tier?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, that’s not it… it’s just that, I saw something dangerous…..」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t say that. It is probably your first time seeing something like that. When Alfred was born, I was even scared to hold him.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m sorry. To be honest, I saw her flying while holding him.」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Don’t speculate, it is not clear if she only saw Loo or Tier or both of them. The baby’s gender is also unclear.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">「….Flying while holding him?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, flying. They are also pretty high. I’m worried after seeing them because she might drop him.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand. I’ll take a note of that.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please do.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lunch today was somewhat lively.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-36"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 89 &ndash; The Village Chief’s Day, Noon till Night</h1><p class="calibre2">After lunch, there are mainly 3 things on my “to do list”.<span id="calibre_link-186"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">First one is inspecting around the fields like what I’ve done in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not checking the state of the crops like what I did during the morning. It is more on checking the village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….No, it’s more like a stroll.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m checking the inside and outside of the village along with the kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While at it, I’m doing some road maintenance, weed extermination, plowing rough ground into a lawn, and trimming tree branches that are getting in the way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Miscellaneous job?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should act more like a manager?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, I’m not dissatisfied with what I’m doing.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Second one is making something that the villagers requested.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is mainly making building materials and creating small articles.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sometimes, cooking research too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And even if no one requested it, I’m making new things to play with.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to the AFT, the amateur me….no, I’ve been doing this for several years already so can I still be considered as an amateur?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I express my gratitude towards god again.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The last one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Battle training.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is battle training necessary for farming?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put my reluctance aside and do it as recommended by the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I’m not doing it alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria, the lizarmen, the onis, the high elves, and the civil servant girls are also participating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, it is not like all the member of their races are participating. The only ones who participate are those villagers with free time but there are still a number of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it only my imagination that everyone lives anxiously?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or do they like fighting?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or perhaps they are concerned about their weight?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oh, I thought of some unnecessary things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I learned to properly hold a weapon, the right posture, and how to use it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, how to properly put on an armor, the defensive stances, and how to properly use armors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, I’m learning all those things I’ve said alone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next is sparring with someone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, group battle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To avoid injury, weapons are covered with cloth but getting hit by it still hurts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have experienced pain many times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I can do anything I want using the AFT, during times like this, it is better to use regular weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as the village chief, I think I should do something first on whatever the situation will be before taking up weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Weapons are not for me after all.</p>

<p class="calibre2">By the way, the AFT can transform into a spear, an ax, and a sickle but it can’t transform into a sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it can transform into a knife, it can’t transform into an ordinary sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But how come that it can transform into a spear?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I transformed the AFT into a spear again and check it out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how I look at it, it’s an ordinary spear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is no single trace of decoration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like an ordinary spearhead fixed at the end of a long wood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like something a poor warrior would use.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It doesn’t look like it can exterminate a wyvern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it really exterminated a wyvern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….I hope I don’t need to use this anymore.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When the sun begins to set, it means that my work is done and I need to return home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are no street lamps in the village so when the sun sets, it is completely dark.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the starry sky with two moons is beautiful, the ground only has lights from some buildings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When one needs to go out at night, he needs to carry something that can light things around but, would it be better to make street lamps?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Street lamp…. a torch fixed at one place?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The problem is the fuel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if the consumption per day is small, it will pile up when used every day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unless we depend on magic, it is not feasible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is something I need to thoroughly consider.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I eat supper at the dining room in my house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are more members during this time compared to breakfast and lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora and Hakuren will surely be present. Frau and Rasuti join us too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, there are times where Ria, Daga, and Ya eat with us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before eating, we are already sitting on the dining table while Frau and Rasuti will say their daily report.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the time where the governor of the village and the diplomat of the village report to the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, putting Frau aside, Rasuti rarely reports something so she’s normally coming here to eat dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Ria, Daga, and Ya have something to report too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would love to hear good reports but if it is something bad, I don’t want to hear it since I’ll lose my appetite.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, but if they are here and decided to report things to be after meal, it means there’s an impending crisis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s think that they’re here for good news.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There are several dishes lined up at the table for dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is something normal to me but it seems like it is luxurious and a lot compared to the usual meal of a village chief from other village.</p>

<p class="calibre2">What kind of dietary life do the village chiefs from other villages enjoy?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a little scary so I should not think about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regarding food, we divide them fairly as much as possible so other houses in the village can enjoy food as much as we do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is all thanks to the AFT.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never forget to appreciate it everytime I eat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a dish I’ve never seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ann, what is this dish?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is the latest work of the one in cooking duty today.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Confidence?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「About 20 percent.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「And you still served it to me. Is it possible for you to only let me try when you’re at least 50 percent confident?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Foods should never be wasted.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….of course.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I persevere to enjoy my supper.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After eating, it is now my leisure time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s time for me to see Alfred and Tiselle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is something I truly enjoy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alfred is still smattering but he can now speak a few words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Everyday, effort.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eveweedhay, ecort?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">My son is a genius.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, my daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You will surely grow into a beautiful woman too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This doting parent time is truly relaxing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After being with them for a while, I leave Alfred and Tiselle to the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em> and head for the bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My exclusive bath is outside the house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I planned to build a bath in my house but I refrained to do so for the time being since I have my own exclusive bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because I usually take a bath after eating, the others matched my schedule.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like them to enter a bath without minding it but it seems like there are a lot of people during this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">My private bath is not that wide….</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it is quite lively in it now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is one of the reasons why others are against me building a bath at my house.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Bathing time is a time to relax.</p>
<p class="calibre2">All the tension of the day starts to drift apart during this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To put it simply, it is like washing all the bad things away.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’m the one who started all the things in this place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And because I’m the one who started it all, I’ll take responsibility until the end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it’s not bad at all, I’m enjoying it actually.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahahaha.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m free for a brief period of time from the bath until I return home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m trying to not think what’s up ahead.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is my way of protecting my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t need to prepare my body since god bestow me “healthy body”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m glad I have it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I wake up in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Yeah, no sexy time.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">After I got home, I don’t remember going to bed and sleeping.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I slept unnoticed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I checked the time using the height of the sun and recognized that I should not get up yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I know that’s what should I do, I get out of bed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And perhaps the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em> noticed something, they have prepared and left hot water and towel here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The water is still warm and seemed to have just been placed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thank them while washing my body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I put on the clothes they prepared for me and do some light radio exercise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I noticed that it is now a good time to get out of my room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And so, another day of mine begins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s do our best today too.」</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-55"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 90 &ndash; A Certain Oni’s Day, Early Morning</h1><p class="calibre2">I wake up every morning before the sun rises.<span id="calibre_link-187"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">It is already my habit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter what time I sleep, I wake up at the same time, is it normal?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not being yelled at because of waking up late so I think it’s a good thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After washing my face and wearing proper clothes, I check today’s duty schedule.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That duty schedule was only introduced to us when we arrived at this village. It is very useful especially to someone like me who has a bad memory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are eight things written on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">House, cleaning, cooking, village, village chief, Alfred-sama, Tiselle-sama, and rest day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“House”<br class="calibre6" />
During this turn, you’ll be the person in charge of everything on the village chief’s house besides cleaning and cooking.<br class="calibre6" />
Anything that needs to be done will be taken care of by the person on duty.<br class="calibre6" />
The busiest and the hardest part of this is when visitors came.<br class="calibre6" />
In addition, the person on duty must nominate two individuals to do night watch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Cleaning”<br class="calibre6" />
You’ll be in charge in cleaning the village chief’s house.<br class="calibre6" />
This means you’re scheduled to just clean.<br class="calibre6" />
Since laundry is included, it is not popular during winter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Cooking”<br class="calibre6" />
You’ll be in charge of cooking in the village chief’s house.<br class="calibre6" />
Though there is already a suggestion to have those good in cooking to permanently take this post, it is still under review.<br class="calibre6" />
When I’m on cooking duty, even I don’t want to hear that my dish loses to others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Village”<br class="calibre6" />
You’ll be in charge of teaching cooking and cleaning to houses in the village other than the village chief’s.<br class="calibre6" />
It is easy to teach the high elves and lizardmen but it is hard to teach the dwarves.<br class="calibre6" />
It can even be said that they don’t even bother to remember it.<br class="calibre6" />
They even don’t bother cleaning the workshop for alcohol brewing.<br class="calibre6" />
If I’m allowed, I would like to beat the dwarves at least once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Village Chief”<br class="calibre6" />
You’ll be in charge of taking care of the village chief.<br class="calibre6" />
It is both the easiest and the harshest job.<br class="calibre6" />
The village chief will do anything by himself in order to advance technology and things sometimes get out of hand.<br class="calibre6" />
The person on duty must work hard in order to not let the village chief do unnecessary things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Alfred-sama”<br class="calibre6" />
It’s your turn to take care of Alfred-sama.<br class="calibre6" />
It is a very taxing but very important duty.<br class="calibre6" />
However, because there is a chance that Alfred-sama will remember the name of the person on duty, it is really popular job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Tiselle-sama”<br class="calibre6" />
It’s your turn to take care of Tiselle-sama.<br class="calibre6" />
This is also a very taxing but very important duty.<br class="calibre6" />
The person on duty will have her physical condition checked first and if there is a trace of uneasiness, she will be replaced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Rest Day”<br class="calibre6" />
A normal rest day.<br class="calibre6" />
It is a duty that the village chief suggested but since we’re unable to calm down unless we are doing something, it can be called a torture time.<br class="calibre6" />
People on rest day are always seen helping someone else quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There the two individuals whose names were not included in the schedule.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are Ann-sama, who’s our representative and<em class="calibre5"> maid</em> chief, and Ramurias, who’s taking care of the beastkins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ramurias, who has a full-time job, is a bit enviable.</p>


<p class="calibre2">My duty for today, village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must not get discouraged.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently alone with the village chief duty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, this is a job for two people but Alfred-sama and Tiselle-sama took some manpower.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is something that can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I even looked at it from Ann-sama’s point of view.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, that does not mean that we should disregard the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But this also means that there’s only the two of us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will do my best to meet your every need.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m enthusiastic but….there is a problem now that there is only one person on village chief’s duty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since I cannot take my eyes off the village chief, I can’t go to the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it is possible for me to go if I go to the <em class="calibre5">toilet</em> the same time the village chief goes into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the worst case scenario, I even seriously consider using diaper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pride surpasses diapers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I prepared several bamboo containers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Don’t even think about how I use it.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After checking the schedule, I looked at the message board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If there is an urgent message, it will be written there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There seems to be nothing today.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I want to go straight to work but there is no need to hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We need to gather in the entrance hall first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a morning assembly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We lined up before the <em class="calibre5">maid</em> chief Ann-sama appears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we don’t line up, we’ll be disciplined later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Plus, it’s not like it will take too much time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann-sama arrives and greets us lightly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good morning」</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, we bow as greetings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We did not say anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We might wake up the residents who are still sleeping if we do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although we are all females, if all of us oni will return her greeting, we’ll surely be loud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the past, each room is completely soundproof with magic ever since the musical instrument crisis but now, soundproofing has become loose.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, they might hear our voices.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We don’t dare to greet back ever since.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has become a <em class="calibre5">rule</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It seems like the wine slime had invaded the food warehouse last night. Person in cooking duty, though it was caught up by the dividing in small amount trap, the cooking wine still took some damage so you better asses it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Person on house duty, I have said it many times but staying up all night is prohibited. Please make sure to decide who can stand vigil on night in turn beforehand so everyone can properly sleep. If you can’t do it, I will personally be the one who’ll find those who can guard at night.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, the person in vigil last night fell asleep that caused the wine slime to invade.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand how she feels but only those in rest days can be allowed to be on night vigil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is some sort of guard job.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it is still a job and if you miss to sleep because you’re doing that too, you won’t be able to perform your work properly in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps it might be a good time to establish a night vigil duty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Alfred-sama doesn’t seem to have any problem. Tiselle-sama caught a fever last night. The one in Tiselle-sama’s duty today, take a note of it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing Ann-sama’s words, the person on Tiselle-sama’s duty tensed up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I also have a job that I had to pay attention to, I’m a bit jealous that her job needs her to seriously pay attention to.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: For her, watching Hiraku doing something is inferior to taking care of the sick Tiselle though both jobs need full attention.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">Really enviable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann-sama’s report ends there and lowers her head without saying anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We responded by lowering our heads too and the morning assembly was over.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I stand in fixed position as the person in village chief duty.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’m standing next to the door of the village chief’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The five people on cleaning duty were standing behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is a sign of the village chief moving in his room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And he has approached.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The door opened and we bowed as we saw his face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good morning」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the privilege of the person in village chief duty to be the first one to greet him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good morning」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief greets me and the people in cleaning duty behind me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An excellent lord.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The village chief left the room and looked around the house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He is acting as expected of a family head and I’m chasing after him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, the people in cleaning duty entered the room of the village chief altogether and started cleaning it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We cannot let our lord see how we clean it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a<em class="calibre5"> maid’s</em> pride to make everything looks naturally clean and beautiful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, the room cleaning must be finished by the end of the village chief’s breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After eating his breakfast, who knows if the village chief decided to return to his room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While cheering at them in my mind, I’m carefully following the village chief so I won’t lose him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today is the beginning of an unexpected day.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-74"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 91 &ndash; A Certain Oni’s Day, Morning to Noon to Night</h1><p class="calibre2">The village chief walks around the house and those he meets along the way greet him and gives his their report.<span id="calibre_link-188"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though I don’t need to do anything until breakfast, I did not relax.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cannot let my guard down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also look around the house as the village chief inspects it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to report about it to Ann-sama later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I might not remember or overlook something but Ann-sama will probably understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is tough for me who have a bad memory so I have to work hard to compensate for it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">When the village chief enters the dining room, his breakfast should be arranged immediately.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is the result of constantly reminding him of how a village chief should act.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I’m satisfied with the result, I entered the kitchen next to the dining room and immediately sat on a small table.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief will be taken care of by the one on cooking duty and during that time, I must eat my breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When there are still two people on village chief duty, we were able to eat by turns so it is a little disappointing that I couldn’t take care of him during his meals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thought it is disappointing, if I don’t eat, I won’t last and collapse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Un, today’s breakfast is delicious too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After the village chief finishes eating breakfast, he’ll go around to check the field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After seeing the village chive leave the house, I tracked him in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We tried accompanying him before but we were told by the village chief not to so we are stalking him while making sure he doesn’t notice us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s safe because Kuro-san and Yuki-san are beside him but I want to stand by his side too.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Since I’m stalking the village chief while hiding, it is hard to keep him at a certain distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is not because I would be noticed by the village chief but because of others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are two, no three other kuros.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Spiderlings…a good number of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And one high elf.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are hiding around the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They have the same purpose as me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Village chief’s guards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are only this number now, there were a lot of us before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the number was reduced after a secret meeting about the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is good that Kuro-san and Zabuto-san cooperated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In any case, all of us thinks that the village chief is really important.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We are watching the village chief in order to make sure that he doesn’t wear out.</p>


<p class="calibre2">One of the kuros sent a signal to us.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Looking at it, one of the spiderlings is pointing its leg in a certain direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like a big monster or demon beast is coming from that direction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a precaution, I move near the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, how’s the field?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">This goes without saying but, during emergency, I have to risk my life for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, but even before the village chief sees that thing, the kuros or the high elves would have taken care of it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, that doesn’t mean that I should let my guard down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「There are few insects. It’s not that bad but will you help me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, please leave it to me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I worked in the field together with the village chief until lunch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The big monster or demon beast approaching the village was a big wild boar called <em class="calibre5">great boar</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuro-san’s pup in law, Uno-san, beat it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Lunch, I eat together with the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A <em class="calibre5">maid</em> should avoid eating with her lord but if you were invited by the village chief, you should not refuse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can’t be helped because he invite me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I don’t think that this is one of the privilege of being the person in village chief duty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m evidently only doing what I’m supposed to do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I heard some say that they want to clear the forest at the southwest part of the village. It is near the residential area and it will be good if we think about the future expansion. I want to inquire your opinion.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if my memory is bad, I’m sure that there is no mistake with the content of what I’ve said.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is something I heard from the one in village duty. It seems like a lot of insects are coming from the nearby forest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though the spiderlings have captured insects and reduced the damage, they have to reduce the number of webs especially when a beastgirl was caught on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I saw it myself, I’m sure it was traumatic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to do something about it as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The spiderlings are doing a great job but their webs are useless against some insects.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today’s lunch was delicious too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After lunch is the village chief’s battle training.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When it comes to manufacturing, we can only help him a little so I’m thankful that he participated in this training.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An oni like me can really fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My weapon of choice is a sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also have a shield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A common <em class="calibre5">swordsman attire</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Train with me!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though that was what I’m thinking, there are a lot of obstructive people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Battle training is one of the few chances to get in touch with the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He’s really popular.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, Ann-sama ordered the onis at the immediate vicinity of the village chief to withdraw.</p>

<p class="calibre2">It is a useful technique in order to be able to live freely in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: If they monopolize Hiraku, they will be hated for sure.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand that this is a technique but I feel really regretful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uuu, I also wanted to join the village chief in a war simulation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will keep one of the civil servant girl company.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I dislike the other party or is it just my imagination?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, let’s <em class="calibre5">fight</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please take care of me」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You can’t win against an oni! You caaaannnnnn’ttttt!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">At least she did her best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The sun has started to set so we’re going home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a long, short day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, I still have to do something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dinner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like breakfast, I ate at the small table in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Bufu!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">An indescribable taste hit my tongue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to praise myself for not throwing up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What’s this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, that’s a new dish….that didn’t work out well.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In short, it is a failure.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If no one admits it, it’s not a failure.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Then, are you saying that no one will complain about this food?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My stomach is even full because of tasting it while cooking.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I let my guard down. I didn’t know that the one on cooking duty is a poor cook.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Was it only an accident that the food this morning and noon are okay?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or perhaps, Ann-sama is watching her this morning and noon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Please rest assured that everything other than that dish is okay.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If you can do that, please make everything okay.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief is in the dining room, is he okay?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it’s the village chief, he’ll surely eat it all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….</p>
<p class="calibre2">But for me, it’s impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything was delicious except for this dish.</p>



<p class="calibre2">After dinner is nonbiri <em class="calibre5">time</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief is enjoying the company of Alfred-sama and Tiselle-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a good scene.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By chance, if I’ll have a child….</p>
<p class="calibre2">My delusion rose but I shook it off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am still working.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must not be distracted.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I left the village chief’s house and went to the village chief’s bath to prepare it for his use and toiletries too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I prepared my toiletries too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though my spirit is already overflowing, I did my best to suppress it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief was satisfied with his little get together with his children and head for the bath. I immediately give his toiletries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, the <em class="calibre5">maid</em> is the one who’s supposed to carry it but the village chief stubbornly said that he has to be the one to carry it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, this is still within an acceptable level.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already can see the bath as I walk behind the village chief.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not looking at the female bath but the village chief’s exclusive bath.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to wash the village chief’s back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is one of the privileges of the person on village chief duty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are many rivals in the bathroom but every one of them recognizes that privilege.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I scrub the village chief’s back and washes it with hot water.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, he did not let me scrub his front as expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the old days, we are even prohibited to wash his back but we can now as a result of the petition of us oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our every day of hard work has bore fruit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The village chief’s back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An ordinary male’s body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you compare it to an oni male, it can be said to be poor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there is a heavy responsibility hanging on that back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wish I could help him with that.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Once he goes up from the bath, you can feel the tension rising.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The information that the village chief has gone out of the bath is quickly spreading.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the secret meeting, the order has already been decided but there are still some who recklessly do things on their own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Recently, a beastgirl was caught and she has been taken care of.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With an impregnable wall guard, I have to accompany the village chief to his room safely.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is my mission.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is the main objective of village chief duty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And my work is only until there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m free after taking the village chief into his room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fufufu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the bath to the house, it feels really far.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The next morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wake up before sunrise as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hastily cleanse my body and wear my clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I prepare some hot water and a towel then greet the village chief and move to the message board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already know the schedule without looking at it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After my village chief duty turn, it will be my rest day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I check it for confirmation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I confirm that there is no message written on the message board and wait for the morning assembly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Today is a rest day.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, a day where I can do whatever I want.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, I can also work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I haven’t decided what to do but for the time being, I’d like to help cleaning the village chief’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It will be embarrassing if something was left behind.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I’ll do my best today too.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-94"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 92 &ndash; Festival Preparation</h1><p class="calibre2">The new village building is proceeding smoothly.<span id="calibre_link-189"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">The one thing that’s not going well is the festival executive committee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「For the time being, the best thing to do is to imitate festivals everyone knows of.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If we mix some strange things, I don’t think anyone will be pleased.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The festival executive committee, after a long discussion, there is finally a conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We wrote down the names of every festival we know of and put it in a box. It will be decided by lottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have thought about it earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We wasted a lot of time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Martial arts tournament?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s what’s written on the paper I drew.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So the festival will be a martial arts tournament?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Who wrote it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, why the heck was this even here?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can I draw something else?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I really want to do so, the paper we use in this lottery is really expensive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We also agreed that this is a one-shot game and no one will complain no matter what the result is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, the festival has been decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a martial arts tournament.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I feel like the atmosphere of the village has changed immediately after notifying the villagers about the martial arts tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, perhaps it really changed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The number of people who practice martial arts outside has increased.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time, the number of time Loo, Tier, and Flora have to use their healing magic has increased too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Frau and the civil servant girls gather early in the morning to jog.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some lizardmen enter the forest and are helping with hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like the angels flying speed is 20% faster than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dwarves have poured water in alcohol barrel and began training their body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is still acceptable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll train a little at my parent’s house.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Hakuren said that, my brain stopped working.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You’re going to participate?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t have the courage to hear her answer so I forced her to become the referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though she’s dissatisfied, I persuaded her by saying that I’m not familiar with martial arts tournament so I need someone strong to be the referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next problem ……</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll train a little at my parent’s house.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti said the same thing as Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess they will have to participate.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’ll have Hakuren be the referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for Rasuti……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can not think of anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……!</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible to have two referees.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I also want to fight.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to think of something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Think.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………………!</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Rasuti, have you ever fought Hakuren?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Of course, however, I never won.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I assume that both of you are in your dragon form during those battles.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You’re right.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Have you ever fought each other in your human form?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? Then, I would like you to fight against Hakuren for a model match. You don’t mind it, right Hakuren?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Model match?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, a model match. Since it is a martial arts tournament, it is normal for masters to show them how it is done.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I flatter them with the word “master”.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Master….I’m fine with it. However, Rasuti-chan might not like it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Master….I don’t mind. Since Hakuren-oneesama is my opponent, I’ll accept it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Both of you, thanks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Good. Then, I ask both Rasuti and Hakuren to show a good model match. Ah, since you’re the referee, I’ll also ask you about the rules. Ah, both of you, please be the referee.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Okay.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Got it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alright.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While doing a <em class="calibre5">guts pose</em> in my mind, I’m currently immersed in the sense of accomplishment that one usually gets after clearing a really difficult challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I dare you. It has been a long time since you tasted the power of my arms.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m wondering if your arms are now rotten or it looks shorter than the last time you use it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo and Tier are already having match using their mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t mind you being in high spirit because of the martial arts tournament but I want you to stop it. Alfred and Tiselle are still on your arms.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have to make sure that there’s no battle before the martial arts tournament.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The martial arts tournament will be divided into three divisions, common section, warrior section, and knight section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The common section is open for everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those whose profession doesn’t have anything to do with fighting like Frau, the civil servant girls, and the beastgirls will be participating here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The warrior section is for warriors.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Those who hunt in the forest can participate in this section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The main participants are the high elves, onis, lizardmen, dwarves, and mountain elves.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The knight section is for high ranking warriors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Only those who are recognized by the village chief are eligible to participate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The participants are Loo, Tier, Gran Maria, Kuudel, Corone, High Elf Ria, Oni Ann, Lizardman Daga, Devil Bulga, and Devil Stifano.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know how powerful the two devils are but since they are servants of dragons, they surely won’t be weak. It has become a division where only those I recommend can participate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are two other individuals who’ll participate in the knight’s section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros held a preliminary competition and the winner was Uno.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many females are pregnant so the males are the only ones who participated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, does that means that Uno is the strongest male?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Did Kuro lose? Or did he not participate?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other one is selected by the spiderlings. It is a spider that is as large as half a tatami mat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though it has become large, it seems like it was one of the spiderlings that participated in the Lamia <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> capture.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It has no name and it will be troublesome during the time of the tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Your roundness is comparable to Zabuton…. you’re now Makura.」</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Makura = pillow.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">I have no naming sense.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks pleased so I guess its good.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The referees are Hakuren and Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora won’t participate. She probably doesn’t want to stand out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You don’t want to?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t you think you must, at least, have one person to be in charge of healing?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…..right.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t worry, I’ll have another chance. Besides, doesn’t the village chief not participating too?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Everyone will be anxious if I participate.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha, for sure.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the village chief, I’ll do my best to manage the martial arts festival.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Everyone’s energetic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m currently shaving the forest at the south of the residential <em class="calibre5">area</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m going to make the venue for the martial arts tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I thought of building it in the residential <em class="calibre5">area</em> but I’m a little frightened with everyone’s spirit so I had to build it here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ring is a 20 meters square.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is also 50cm above the ground. I adjusted the ring’s surface for it to be not too hard or not too soft by hammering and plowing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I want to prevent injury as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the possibility of participants being thrown out of the ring, I softened the ground around the ring to the maximum.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll dedicate one side for the participants and all other three sides as audience seats.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I thought of making an auditorium type seating arrangement so that they can sit to directly to the ground but it will be difficult for those who are far away to see what’s happening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, because the martial arts festival is scheduled to run the whole day, food will also be served.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think it is necessary for the audience to have a chair to sit on in order to eat easily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though that is the plan, it takes too much time and effort to make a monopod chair so I drop it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I cut down a big tree, cut it again vertically and plane the upper side to make a long bench.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A larger diameter tree will also be similar to a stair up bench.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I left space for the aisle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yup, this is now the venue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, in a slightly far place is the cooking <em class="calibre5">space</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do I have to build an eating and drinking <em class="calibre5">space</em> too?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Mou.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Forgive me for making easy to make table and chairs made of round logs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, <em class="calibre5">toilet</em> is also necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll make more water closet than usual.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also must not forget to put a slime on it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess the venue can be considered complete.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, let the festival begins.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Doraim, Doraim’s wife, Dors, and Raimeiren came to watch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They look like parents looking forward to their daughter’s presentation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beezel and Yuri also came to watch and they are with an unknown middle-aged ikemen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if they are here to cheer for Frau and the civil servant girls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo’s grandfather, ancestor-san, is also sitting at an audience seat before anyone noticed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dors, ancestor-san, and the middle-aged ikemen are talking peacefully.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they acquainted?</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, looking at them, the unknown middle-aged ikemen is definitely the weakest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Six lamias from the southern <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em> also came to participate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I accepted them and let them participate to warrior and knight section.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/LSKBQz9/u39-f377f753-f99e-4fad-bf84-25eb359d0738.jpg">

<p class="calibre2">From the <em class="calibre5">Howling </em>village, after consulting Doraim, Gulf and three others came to participate.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I heard that they panicked when they first saw a <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> but it seems like they are used to it now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..Maa, of course they would, they always see <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> carrying crops from here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We accepted them because all of them wished to enter the warrior’s section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not order anything about keeping the martial arts festival a secret so it probably leaked out somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Should I have kept it confidential?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, a lively festival is a good festival.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Though there were unexpected things, let the festival begins.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-11"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 93 &ndash; Martial Arts Tournament, Common Section</h1><p class="calibre2">During the martial arts festival, the village will be completely closed.<span id="calibre_link-190"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Even so, there are still things that need to be done.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros and spiderlings are doing their best to guard the whole village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the village is attacked by a monster in the middle of the festival, it will spoil the fun.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll give them their favorite food to thank them later.</p>


<p class="calibre2">There is also the need for cooking. Someone has to cook for the participants and the guests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even I must take care of Alfred and Tiselle personally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though they will participate in the festival, the civil servant girls and the onis must work hard because the guests include personalities like Dors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I’m working hard too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m helping with the tournament, cooking, and welcoming the guests.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, let me introduce to you my father.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuri introduces me the unknown middle-aged ikemen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuri’s father, then it means…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. I’m the Demon King Gullgald of the Demon King’s Kingdom. Fuhahahahahaha」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Oohh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father, you’re a little too frank.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yuri’s <em class="calibre5">papa</em>, nice to meet you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, yes. Nice to meet you too.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised by the demon king’s initial greeting so I subconsciously call her Yuri’s <em class="calibre5">papa</em>-san instead of demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I’m talking to a normal <em class="calibre5">papa</em>-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahh, village chief, I apologize for suddenly intruding.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No no」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I love festival like this for a long time. I’ll fully enjoy it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ancestor-san? I should have greeted him with Loo.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is Hakuren causing you trouble?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, I think that’s normal for her.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing my reply, Dors smiled satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The guests all gave me something after our greetings and all of them are something that can be eaten. Michael-san, however, sent a letter indicating his regret for not being able to watch and delivered seafood products as a token of apology.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if food is the standard gift for a festival in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll make sure to remember it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And while appreciating their gifts, I’m struggling after seeing some strange ingredients.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Village chief, I know that cooking is important but if we don’t start soon, we’ll run out of time.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I understand.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Then, let’s start the first ever martial arts festival of Big Tree Village!」</p>

<p class="calibre2">After hearing my opening remarks, everyone responded with a loud roar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It also seems like it caused a little tremor.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Then, let’s start with the common section.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The host of the common section is Gran Maria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was also a suggestion of me being the host but I refrained.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have an important duty which is helping with cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was thinking of that, they made me seat in a specially prepared seat near the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Dors and other distinguished guests came, the villagers remodeled a part of the venue thinking that noble guests should seat there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I’m on the village chief’s seat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the village chief, I have to stay here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For some reason, ancestor-san and Doraim’s wife were the ones who helped with cooking.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They dexterously peeled potato and carrot skins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My apologies.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I gave up on various things and decided to concentrate on the common section battle.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Matches in common section are decided by lottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One should fight successively.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the <em class="calibre5">rule</em>, one wins if the opponent was defeated.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Who would have thought?</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">There are a number of conditions for defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the participant losses consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the participant directly said that he gives up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the participant was knocked down and was unable to get up within ten counts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the participant landed on anything other than the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If the referee judged that the participant can no longer continue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those five.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of that, I’m expecting that the main reason for winning are opponents losing consciousness and being pushed out of the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, the <em class="calibre5">rules </em>the others thought about are too wild. You could only obtain victory if the opponent can no longer fight or give up so I added a few mild <em class="calibre5">rules</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, as a major <em class="calibre5">rule</em>, you can only take up two weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You have to show it to your opponent before the start of the match and you must make sure that there is a rolled cloth on your weapon to reduce damage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can wear the armor of your choice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You can also use any magic you want.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, since this is a festival, no one should kill someone. If you kill your opponent, you will be automatically disqualified and will be heavily punished later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not tell the details of the penalty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I convey the details of the penalty unskillfully, they wouldn’t be bothered with it. It might even result for a participant to think that it’s okay and that will be a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m sure using their common sense, they will never think of killing their opponent….but if they get intoxicated by the battle….</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not used to fight against each other so I just can’t relax.</p>

<p class="calibre2">I’ll just put all my trust in the referee’s judgment.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After the referee, Hakuren, goes up to the stage, the host, Gran Maria, announced the first battle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first match is between a beastgirl and a civil servant girl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On ordinary days, both of them are wearing <em class="calibre5">skirts</em> but now both of them are wearing pants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m the one who suggested it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastgirl has short daggers on both hands while the civil servant girl is equipped with an ordinary sword and shield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fight!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After Hakuren’s shout, the battle starts and the excitement of villagers and other spectators rise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Support is free and I already told them that no trash talking on the opponent of the participant they support so there are only cheers of encouragement.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The match ended in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It started when the beastgirl lowers her posture and charges. The civil servant girl tried to block her with the shield but the beastgirl rolled from the front to her right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The civil servant girl is holding her sword using her right hand so it seems like she’s avoiding that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even though she went away from the sword, the shield is in front of her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, the beastgirl crawls below the shield to the legs of the civil servant girl and tried to take her down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The civil servant girl’s posture broke but she was not knocked down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She hit the leg of the beastgirl with her shield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastgirl then rolls again from the right to the front.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that, the civil servant girl turn her body and swing her sword to the rolling beastgirl.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The beastgirl was not disheartened and tried to attack using the daggers on her hands too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And she lost consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sword of the civil servant girl hits the head of the beastgirl who failed to defend because she’s rolling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though both of her daggers hit the civil servant girl, she only hits her lower body and it is incomparable to a sword swinging down at her head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Stop! Match concluded!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren stopped the match and announced the victory of the civil servant girl who knocked out her opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Cheers rose from the venue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I was surprised with what happened. Never, even for a moment, show your back to your opponent.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria commented on the match. I’ll take a note of that for future reference.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, it is impossible for me to be the host.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll just do what I can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The victorious civil servant girl came in front of me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I praised her and gave her 1 reward <em class="calibre5">medal </em>for winning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The civil servant girl received the reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> with a full smile. She’s obviously in pain so Flora healed her with magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though not visible, it seems like the daggers of the beastgirl <em class="calibre5">damaged</em> her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it’s painful, you don’t need to endure it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You could have received treatment first.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The common section proceeds like that.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, there’s no serious injury.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-30"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 94 &ndash; Martial Arts Tournament, Warrior Section</h1><p class="calibre2">The <em class="calibre5">best bout</em> of the common section is the battle between Frau and the beastkin Senna.<span id="calibre_link-191"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Although most of the battles were finished within a minute, the battle between those two lasted for five minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Frau conjures a one-handed sword while Senna fights with her bare hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The matched develops to the point where Senna grabs Frau then tries to toss her but Frau managed to grab her too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, both of them were defeated since they were entangled and fell from the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because both lost, they were not able to receive reward <em class="calibre5">medals </em>for the winner but they were praised for showing a good match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Senna…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought that you were the throwing type….. That was unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, Beezel, Yuri, and the demon king showed their fiery support from their seat all the way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That was regrettable.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It was a close match.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Beezel’s daughter is a tough one. However, I never thought that that young beastgirl can really fight that good….umu.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Since the common section ends, it is now time for the warrior section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This time, it’s a last man standing tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The person who won the match will remain on the stage and fight against the next opponent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The one who’ll win the most will be the champion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, I intended to do it in a normal elimination method but I gave up because there are so many participants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even thinking that it will only last a minute and the contestants will be replaced smoothly, it will still take a while.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It would have been good if I had prepared several rings….let’s add that to my future task.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Does that mean that we’ll also have a martial arts festival next year?</p>


<p class="calibre2">The warrior section participants: high elves, onis, lizardmen, dwarves, mountain elves, beastkins from Howling village, and lamias from the southern <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might have been correct to use knockout tournament for this but it seems like luck will play the biggest part.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now that it’s the warrior section, ancestor-san and Doraim’s wife are now on their seat to spectate.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The rule of the battle is almost the same as the common section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, both of their arms and legs are covered with cloth and they are also wearing hachimaki.</p>
<p class="calibre2">About the lamias, instead of legs, their tails are covered with cloth. The lizardmen’s tails are covered with cloth too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, if two cloth cover, including the hachimaki, were taken, it will also mean defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The major difference from the common section is they can <em class="calibre5">challenge</em> again even after being defeated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is permitted to have Flora heal the contestant then line up for a match again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the very least, after all participants have taken their turn, the tournament will continue until the scheduled time.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The referee changed from Hakuren To Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hostess changed from Gran Maria to Frau.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria will appear in the knight section after this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was good that Frau was not injured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it is thanks to Flora’s healing magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, Beezel, Yuri, and demon king, I would appreciate it if you don’t cheer at the host that much.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Matches were held one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is because the next challenger appears as soon as the loser left the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because there are almost no intervals between matches, only a few people can win consecutively.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After winning once, most of them lose at the next battle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The ones who endured the most were the dwarf Donovan, the mountain elf Ya, and Gulf of the Howling Village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, the lamia from the southern <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are four lamias participating in the warrior section and all of them is strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They use sword in a short distance battle and magic at long range.</p>
<p class="calibre2">During melee, their tail wrap attack is super effective.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once they are wrapped, most people can’t do anything anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that time, referee Rasuti will stop the match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I think her judgment is pretty good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Presently, only the dwarf Donovan was able to endure the lamia’s tail wrap attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was able to endure the pressure of being wrapped and managed to remove the cloth from the hand and tail of the lamia. He won that way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for the others, they are seriously evading the tail wrap attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at that, it can be said that the lamias are the <em class="calibre5">keyman </em>of the warrior section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Match after match, the number of victories of Gulf from the Howling village and the mountain elf Ya are among the top four.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The mountain elf Ya maintains mid-distance from her opponent and wins using a one-handed sword and magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her winning streak was stopped after one of the high elves engaged her with a high-speed melee and throw her out of the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gulf of the Howling village was really lucky being unable to fight against any of the lamias but one of the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em> beside me told me that he is strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He fights against his opponents by aiming at the weak points and tossing the opponent out of the ring using speed and power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the rule of taking two cloths has worked advantageously for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was a lizardman who defeated Gulf.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Gulf is not accustomed in fighting against races with tails.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He loses against other lizardmen a couple more times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The warrior section’s time is running out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With things going this way, the champion will be either of the two.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I thought so, the other participants seemed to have guessed it too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Several participants surrendered against Ya and Gulf.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is only one way to settle this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will be your opponent.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I came to win. Don’t bear a grudge.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing those, Rasuti signal the start of the match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ya, who’s wearing her everyday clothes, took her stance while holding her one-handed sword.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vJWqBgm/u39-7eb4cfa2-9d00-4627-9b15-7e849db99363.jpg">

<p class="calibre2">She can use magic so she’s planning to take some distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gulf is a warrior. He came to this village with his leather armor and one-handed sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though Gulf can also use magic, it seems like it won’t be effective against Ya.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He rushes forward to go for a close combat match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps this match will be decided to the one who can control the distance between them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I feel like I’m watching a sword dance match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t even know who has the upper hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking about that, I suddenly heard a loud noise. Ya’s sword is whirling in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ya lost?</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment I thought of that, Ya grab the hilt of Gulf’s sword and his arm then threw him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gulf’s body rotated three times in the air but immediately regains his balance and lands with his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">No damage</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the place where Gulf landed was outside the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Match ends! Winner, Ya!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">With Rasuti’s declaration, the champion of the warrior section was decided.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Unlike the common section, I handed seven reward <em class="calibre5">medals</em> to the champion of the warrior section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I also gave three reward <em class="calibre5">medals</em> to Donovan and the four lamias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I also have to reward Gulf but I can’t give him reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> so I tried to reward him with a good amount of alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will take one as a memento. The remaining two will be traded for alcohol.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I acknowledge it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, I also handed one reward <em class="calibre5">medal</em> to other excellent participants of the warrior section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the end of the warrior section tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is good that no one was seriously injured.</p>


<p class="calibre2">After the break, it will be the knight section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But before that, the full-scale food match first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since the start of the common section, food was being prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I prepared several places where they can get food in <em class="calibre5">viking style</em>…..or should I say like a festival stall?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Viking style in Japan means an eat all you can buffet. The first one who brought that up in Japan called it Viking since he saw it in Denmark.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">This is basically free eat all you can.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We prepared an eating and drinking space in a place far away from the stage but it was not popular. Most brought their food the and audience seat and eat there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although alcoholic beverages are also available, it is forbidden for the participants to drink.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because there are those who can’t drink, it was noted that others should be modest until the night.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because Dors group don’t seem to go to get some food, I asked the oni <em class="calibre5">maids</em> and the civil servant girls who didn’t participate in the tournament to take care of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for me, I have to go get my own food.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like we prepared too much variety of foods.</p>

<p class="calibre2">No, this is a festival.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is better to be lively.</p>


<p class="calibre2">I also enjoy eating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Loo and Tier will participate in the knight section, they left and warmed up after eating.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do your best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Alfred and Tiselle are being taken care of by the oni <em class="calibre5">maids </em>and they look like they are enjoying the festive atmosphere.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-49"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 95 &ndash; Martial Arts Tournament, Knight Section, Round One Part One</h1>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nmRpYFq/u39-99babea7-770d-4d12-abf6-39e6caab69df.jpg">

<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Main event</em>.<span id="calibre_link-192"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Martial Arts Tournament, Knight Section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, let’s introduce all the contestants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo(vampire)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier(Angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuudel(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Corone(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria(high elf)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann(oni)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga(lizardman)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bulga(devil)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stifano(devil)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uno(inferno wolf)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura(spiderling)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Junea(lamia)</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sunea(lamia)</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are assembled on the stage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Junea and Sunea are the dungeon master and head warrior of the southern <em class="calibre5">dungeon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were the ones who brought here by the spiderlings and the pups after conquering their dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The last one who came with them is<em class="calibre5"> dungeon</em> sitting.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The knight section is a single elimination tournament.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You’ll obtain victory if the opponent was incapacitated or declared his defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This will be a considerably serious tournament since the ring out <em class="calibre5">rule</em> and the previous light <em class="calibre5">rules </em>were ruled out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are contestants who can fly so the ring out <em class="calibre5">rule</em> is too advantageous for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, if you leave the ring too far, the referee can disqualify you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Contestants are free to choose their weapons and there were no damage decreasing methods used for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If both contestants were knocked out simultaneously, the match will be judged for the winner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I disagreed with these rules but they told me that putting something on their weapons will lose much of their control and will have an opposite effect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Really?</p>


<p class="calibre2">One match is scheduled to go for 10 minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If they run out of time, the winner of the match will be decided by me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope that no match will reach that point.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And, if possible, I pray that no participants will be hurt.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Hakuren will be the referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hostess will continue to be Frau.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The matchup will be decided by a lottery.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because there are 14 of them, it is not balanced.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, what will be the arrangement?</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">01 Stifano(devil)</p>
<p class="calibre2">02 Tier(Angel)<br class="calibre6" />
03 Gran Maria(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">04 Loo(vampire)<br class="calibre6" />
05 Ann(oni)</p>
<p class="calibre2">06 Junea(lamia)<br class="calibre6" />
07 Kuudel(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">08 Ria(high elf)<br class="calibre6" />
09 Bulga(devil)</p>
<p class="calibre2">10 Sunea(lamia)<br class="calibre6" />
11 Uno(inferno wolf)</p>
<p class="calibre2">12 Daga(lizardman)<br class="calibre6" />
13 Makura(spiderling)</p>
<p class="calibre2">14 Corone(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">01 Stifano(devil) and 14 Corone(angel) are seeded.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With that, the first match of the knight section is the battle between Tier and Gran Maria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A sudden confrontation between angels.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria has a face filled with despair so hang in there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was an instant kill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier immediately overwhelmed Gran Maria and the match ends.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The second match is a battle between Loo and Ann.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before coming to this village, Ann is working as a <em class="calibre5">maid </em>for Loo and Flora. This will be complicated in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Will it be hard for her?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「This is a one in a thousand chance.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s pretend not hearing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The best way to describe their match is mudslinging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann tries to make the match into a melee while Loo tries to take distance.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because both of them don’t have weapons, dull bangs and shock can be felt on the ring but none of them falls.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But looking at it, Ann is clearly the one that receives more damage….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Can’t you make the room cleaner!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ann’s attack is clearly becoming weaker.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Why don’t you try to return the things you use to where they originally are!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>

<p class="calibre2">It seems like each of them accumulated a lot of things inside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can’t you be a little gentler with each other?</p>
<p class="calibre2">At least, reflect a little.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, that’s what you should do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And so, the time limit was reached and I will need to judge the match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was obvious that Loo is the winner but before I said my judgment, Ann fainted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Lulushi, come over here. If you want to talk about something, tell me about it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The winner, Loo, was called by ancestor-san and they had a long talk.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hang in there.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The third match is between Junea and Kuudel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Kuudel can fly, is she in an advantageous position?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Personally, I would like to support Kuudel … how will this match turn out?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as the match starts, Kuudel flies in the air as expected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that the lamia Junea will be on a defensive stance but she uses her tail like a spring and jumps!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kuudel who did not expect that surprise attack was wrapped.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And fell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that Kuudel was done for but she did not give up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She managed to get off Junea’s tail wrap by using brute strength.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So this is how a <em class="calibre5">power character</em> battles, I’m a little scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After that, Junea counter attacked but Kuudel receives it with a double exchange. She won with that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the first time I saw something like this so I think it is good.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Fourth match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria against the devil Bulga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though Ria hesitated to enter the knight section….she probably at least has some confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about it, I don’t know how strong Ria is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She always hunts in the forest so will she fight with a bow?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, will this match a long range battle?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I don’t want her to get hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Bulga is Rasuti’s servant, I had a chance to talk with her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I managed to but….I don’t know how she fights.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Rasuti and Hakuren, it is impossible to be a personal steward of a dragon if you’re weak…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like usual, she’s wearing a butler’s clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When she came here, she was wearing a <em class="calibre5">maid</em>’s clothes that makes her looks like a village girl but it seems like she personally wants to wear butler’s clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It doesn’t look like she’s the only one who wants to wear butlers clothes, even Stifano is wearing the same butler’s clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At any rate, the match began.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, Ria took some distance and attacks with a bow.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The next moment, I was surprised that there was already another arrow following the first arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those attack Bulga’s…bunshin?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, they all acted in different ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">One attacks with magic, another one throws <em class="calibre5">knife</em>, one uses dagger, and one seems to be a barehanded fighter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like they are covering each other’s attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is an overwhelming method but Ria shots them all with arrows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">An arrow hits the magic, the <em class="calibre5">knife</em>, the dagger, and the fist blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After hitting all of the attacks, she still has the room to attack Bulga’s bodies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Every time Bulga’s body was hit by an arrow, the body disappears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And one arrow pierces Bulga’s chest, the body did not disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I got impatient seeing Bulga’s real body with an arrow on her chest.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That looks bad!</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, when I looked at the referee, Hakuren, she doesn’t seem to be bothered in any way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are you kidding me?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I almost shouted to stop the match but Bulga’s body with an arrow on her chest disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha, fool yah.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before I knew it, Bulga is already standing at the edge of the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unhurt.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It would have been better if you relaxed your guard down.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria did not hesitate to shoot an arrow to the talking Bulga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Bulga managed to evade that arrow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The arrow suddenly stops and falls to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It a magical barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Ria uses a bow, Hakuren surrounds the spectator’s area with a barrier before the match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thanks to Hakuren-sama, no one will be hurt even if I evade those arrows.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bulga bows to Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She evaded another arrow by bowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria’s arrow is not your normal arrow that goes straight after releasing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The arrows she shoots are curving left and right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it was all avoided by the laughing Bulga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A devil’s laugh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bulga’s body disappeared and suddenly appeared behind Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That moment, Ria discarded her bow and arrows and pulled out the dagger on her waist and attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bulga bends her upper body to evade the dagger eight bunshin suddenly surrounded Ria.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The eight Bulgas only surrounded her but none of them attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ria did not move either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Ria gave up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can’t fight against this number. Please reduce it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha, will you give up if it was seven?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, I think I still have a chance with seven.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I see. So eight is beyond your limit.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It might be weird to say that I glad but…. this is my complete defeat.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The match ends with Bulga’s victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So, Bulga is strong. 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Upon saying that, the oni <em class="calibre5">maid </em>beside me seems to be shocked that I don’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I did not know but Bulga seems to be famous for being strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, there are a lot of things that I don’t know.</p></div>

<p class="calibre2">Martial arts competition, knight section.<span id="calibre_link-193"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Next match is the lamia Sunea against Uno.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Uno appeared, the kuros appeared at the outer periphery of the audience seat.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can see Kurosan there, Uno’s <em class="calibre5">partner</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be my imagination but Uno’s spirit seems to be overflowing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, Sunea is bearish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「All right. This is different from last time. I will not be defeated since this is one on one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like she’s fighting against her past trauma.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sunea is holding a short spear on her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Her spear has three spearhead, it looks like a weapon of the sea god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder what will happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the referee Hakuren signals the start of the match, Uno’s horn shines. It spreads to all his fur and it looks like he has grown one size bigger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ohhh.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a form I’ve never seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looks strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised but Sunea was not surprised at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like she’s already familiar with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sunea coils her tail like a spring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like she’s going to<em class="calibre5"> jump</em> like what Junea did.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uraaaaaaaaaaa!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sunea shouted as she <em class="calibre5">jumps </em>towards Uno while holding her spear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uno moves sideways to avoid her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know how but Sunea’s jump route curved and chase the evading Uno.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it closely, she’s not really in the air. I can see the tip of her tail not far from the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Could it be that she can stretch her tail when she <em class="calibre5">jumps</em>?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is impossible for him to evade now so Uno showed his fang to intercept.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And they meet….Uno is now biting Sunea’s neck before anyone noticed it so the referee stopped the match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Stop! Winner, Uno!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing that, the spectating kuros began howling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uno, who’s on the ring, looks proud.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ugh, I wasn’t able to win….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Sunea, you did your best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Junea-sama.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s train together starting tomorrow.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like there’s no damage on Sunea’s neck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it some sort of play bite?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, it’s good that she’s not injured.</p>



<p class="calibre2">Daga against Makura will be the first round’s last match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga has an overwhelming physique.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura is about half tatami size.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, Makura has eight legs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And can use string shot.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga, on the other hand, is an orthodox swordsman that can use tail whip. He is also equipped with a sword and a shield.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To be honest, I concerned about Makura. What if Daga crushes it?</p>
<p class="calibre2">And the match begins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga is constantly attacking Maruka suing his sword and tail but Makura dodges them all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura is not attacking and seems to be concentrating on evading.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If this continues, Daga will hit Makura sooner or later and will win the match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The amateur me thought so but it seems like the audience sees something else.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hurry up!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A little more!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s dangerous!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are cheering for Daga as if he’s on a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Something gleamed on the ring. I focused on it to check what it is.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah….web.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura has already produced countless of threads and some of them are already entangling Daga’s body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not sure but it looks like those web entangling Daga’s body is hindering his movements.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And when Daga significantly slows down, Makura jumps and rides Daga’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Stop! Winner, Makura!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The match ends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura is strong.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura raises one of its legs and waves at me so I wave back.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The hostess Frau interviews Daga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「If there are handicaps, would you have still preferred to fight using sword and tail, or grapple? 」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Grapple…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga calls Makura.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「However, with my speed, it will be difficult to catch you….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daga sat next to Makura who came near him. Daga lifted Makura using both of this hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I can’t even win against you in terms of power so I think that you’ll only be the winner of our match.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha. Excuse my impoliteness.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">The first round is over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The matches of the second round are as follows:</p>

<p class="calibre2">01 Stifano(devil)</p>
<p class="calibre2">02 Tier(Angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">04 Loo(vampire)</p>
<p class="calibre2">07 Kuudel(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">09 Bulga(devil)</p>
<p class="calibre2">11 Uno(inferno wolf)</p>
<p class="calibre2">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">13 Makura(spiderling)</p>
<p class="calibre2">14 Corone(angel)</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there is a break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is in order to give those participants in the first round enough rest since there are two seeded contestants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The model match will be held during that break.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a match between Hakuren and Rasuti in their human forms.</p>


<p class="calibre2">They stood on the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not wearing their usual skirts. They are wearing trousers in order to move easily.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti alters the buttocks part for her tail.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not wearing armors and they also don’t have weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They also tie their hair back and it looks like they’ll start running.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s do our best.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will not lose.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are already fired up….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah….remembering the times when they first came to this village, I’m worried about them overdoing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti looks sharp.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren looks sharp too and they are both calm. However, I’m still worried about something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, they wouldn’t be planning on rampaging as a playful joke, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, I’m uneasy.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Even though it’s a model match, a referee is necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren and Rasuti were alternately acting as referees on this festival and I have no other referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I already asked several people in advance but nobody was confident enough, they all declined.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought of doing it myself but since Doraim came to watch, I asked him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I never thought that Dors will take the role of referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I promise to be a fair referee.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since he already said it like that, there’s no way I can refuse.</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, I’m even relieved.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Thank you very much.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The model match started.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought about the certain manga that I read a long time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The movement of the two is so fast that they cannot be caught by naked eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand the position of their body like arms and legs but they sometimes disappear then hits the other party and appear again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m looking at them at a distance and I don’t know when or how they moved……just how fast are they?</p>
<p class="calibre2">A gust of wind arises on the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At that moment, Dors conjures a thin film to surround the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is in order to protect the spectators.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dors is a good referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the one who suggested the two to have a model match, I have to reflect.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m praying for the least possible damage.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The model match lasted for about five minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, they are fully using and moving around the ring but they finally stop and fought at the center of the stage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now they are visible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The match is dominated by Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, she did not one-sidedly trample Rasuti. She was hit by some good counters a number of times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti’s attacks that hit are <em class="calibre5">short upper</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is Hakuren weak against attacks that are coming from below?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, with a chest like that, how can she see something below her?</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..that’s probably it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While thinking about that, Hakuren was hit again by Rasuti’s <em class="calibre5">short upper</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like that shot really connects. Hakuren’s face turns upward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is a chance for Rasuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti probably thinks the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She puts all her might to a<em class="calibre5"> body</em> blow for Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing the blow that hits Hakuren’s face earlier, I thought of Hakuren’s body breaking into pieces.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder if I should have given them gloves to wear.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Rush</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti repeatedly hits Hakuren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s hitting her several times but there’s only one heavy sound.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is this a come from behind victory for Rasuti?</p>
<p class="calibre2">That’s not it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite being beaten, Hakuren managed to step one foot forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">And <em class="calibre5">swing</em> a <em class="calibre5">straigh</em>t right on Rasuti’s face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren’s fist dug Rasuti’s face as she hits the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A loud noise was heard and a big crack appeared on the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti is not moving.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Stop! Model match ends!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is she safe?</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s not dead, right?</p>
<p class="calibre2">My uneasiness was immediately canceled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rasuti moves and stands up as if nothing happened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uuh, I couldn’t win….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I will not hand over it to you yet.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The two of them are cheerful.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After fighting like that, it looks like there’s no <em class="calibre5">damage.</em></p>
<p class="calibre2">Their faces and other places that were hit….there’s not even a bruise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So this is a<em class="calibre5"> dragon</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To my surprise, Dors, the referee, said a few words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Both of you, your holding back control in human form improved.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yey」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahaha, thank you, grandfather.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…..</p>
<p class="calibre2">You call that holding back?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, if they fought against each other on their <em class="calibre5">dragon</em> form….. let’s not think about it. I’ll just show my appreciation on the two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Now, next is the second round.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Ah, I still have to repair the ring crack before that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Got it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s hurry.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-88"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 97 &ndash; Martial Arts Tournament, Knight Section, Round Two</h1>



<p class="calibre2">The first match of the second round.<span id="calibre_link-194"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">A battle between Stifano and Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s a battle between an angel and a devil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Can this be considered as fate?</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you for delivering medicinal herb before.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Don’t mention it. I will show you the result from that magical research today.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">They seem to have no special relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier overwhelmed Gran Maria in the first round so, how about Stifano?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know how strong Stifano is but it will be a good match is she’s as strong as Bulga.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hakuren is the referee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like she’s not affected by the model match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fight!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the same time as the match started, Stifano casted a spell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Countless black spears sprouted on the ground targeting Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier did not escape to the sky. She moved sideways by rotating gracefully to evade the jet black spears.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And counterattack with magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stifano’s body suddenly flared up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Seeing that scene, I was frightened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is too serious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Defying my worry, the jet black spears jumped onto Stifano as it turned into a big cloak that wrapped the burning Stifano.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The flame was completely covered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When the cloak is unraveled, no one is inside.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Magic trick?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stifano suddenly appeared behind Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was thinking how Stifano managed to get behind Tier, jet black spears jump out of Stifano’s whole body and pierce Tier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uwooh」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I instinctively shout.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Tier was safe.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「In terms of compatibility, I’m at an advantage.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The jet black spears that pierced Tier deteriorate and disappear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There’s not even a mark on the pierced part.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the contrary, three pure white spears pierced Stifano’s body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. I <em class="calibre5">give up</em>.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The match between Stifano and Tier ended with Tier’s victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Stifano, are you alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes, thank you. I’ll be healed in no time.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Husband, are you not worried about your beloved wife?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「My heart almost stopped when I saw Stifano’s black spear piercing you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m alright. I managed to avoid being pierced on fatal places.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Tier said so, the pure white spears penetrating Stifano disappears.</p>

<p class="calibre2">There are penetration marks but there’s no blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And all the mark was healed and disappeared in a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I’m pleased with Tier’s victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Next match is….Loo-san and Kuudel. Fufufu, I hope Loo-san’s arms have not become less capable.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo’s battle during the first round was a mudslinging match.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The second match of the second round is a battle between Loo and Kuudel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo just spoke with ancestor-san and she looks full of spirit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the other hand, Kuudel has a face full of resignation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Kuudel, don’t give up from the start!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Gran Maria cheers from the audience seat, but Kuudel’s face still looks the same.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, Loo-san is that Lulushi. She’s as powerful as Tier-sama that the three of us can’t beat.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I just fought with Tier-sama! You’ll be alright. There’s still a one in a thousand chance.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「O-one in a thousand….chance?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The match began.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It ended with an overwhelming victory for Loo. Kuudel was right.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If she can do that, why did she fought a mudslinging match on the first round?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is Ann strong?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or is it a mismatch?</p>


<p class="calibre2">Second round, third match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A battle between Bulga and Uno.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As for this match, I absolutely have no idea on what will happen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Judging from the first round, can Bulga’s bunshin deceive Uno?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like this match will be decided whether or not Uno can see through Bulga’s bunshin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that bunshin just an afterimage?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or is it the real one?</p>
<p class="calibre2">But what if…all of them are real?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, let’s stop thinking about it since the match is about to start.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The match started.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Like the first round, Bulga made bunshin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uno is attacked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought Uno will evade but he charges head-on.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He smashed Bulga’s bunshin one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That look, the look of a hunter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What will happen if he those are real?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bulga created a number of bunshin again and fought back.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The match seemed to take a long time but in reality, the match ended in no time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The bunshin’s saturated attack repressed Uno so the referee was forced to stop the match declaring Bulga’s victory.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uuhh, there are too many bunshin.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although Bulga was victorious, it seems like she’s considerably exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Uno, the loser, looks more energetic but he got off the ring with his tail down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The kuros, including Kurosan, met up with him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like they cheer him up, Uno’s tail return to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, Uno did his best.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Second round, fourth match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A battle between Makura and Corone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thinking about what will happen, it ended soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Corone immediately tried to fly at the beginning of the match….but she was not able to.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A thread got her foot and she fell from the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And got tied up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s too much of a mismatch! It’s her natural enemy!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It ended with Makura’s victory.</p>


<p class="calibre2">With that, the second round ends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are four people remaining.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The semifinals will be as follows:</p>
<p class="calibre2">02 Tier(Angel)<br class="calibre6" />
4 Loo(vampire)</p>
<p class="calibre2">09 Bulga(devil)<br class="calibre6" />
13 Makura(spiderling)</p></div>

<p class="calibre2">Martial arts tournament, knight section, third round.<span id="calibre_link-195"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier vs. Loo</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even before coming to this village, these wives of mine who both bore my children are eternal rivals.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is an anticipated match where no one knows what the result will be.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are both wearing a pair of trousers and no weapons on hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Fufufu, long time, no see.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Right. However, ancestor-sama is watching so I will not hold back.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Of course, that is something I already expected.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Both of them are motivated enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Referee Hakuren signaled the start of the match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I thought that the two of them were going to take some distance or fly in the sky but they two of them walk slowly towards each other at the center of the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Once their feet stopped, they started exchanging blows.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It looks like an <em class="calibre5">American</em> movie, after receiving one blow, it will be your turn to hit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But men do that on movies, it is scary looking at ladies do that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, the two of them are my wives.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m really scared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are not hitting each other with palms but with hard fist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They are clearly aiming for each other’s cheeks with <em class="calibre5">hooks</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And after being hit, I could never forget how they grin.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the future, I must do everything I can to avoid a husband-and-wife quarrel.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: That moment you realized that the women you raped are capable of turning you to minced meat.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">After fistfighting for a while, they took some distance with each other like it was the natural thing to do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And starts a magic battle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fire, water, wind, and other unknown magic collide.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although the spectators’ seats are protected by Hakuren’s magic, the place where I’m watching is relatively close to the ring and I can feel the power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I don’t know who has the advantage at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the magic battle, the two of them flew in the sky and hit collide with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Are they magically colliding? Or just physically….?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I really don’t know but I know that they are fiercely battling.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And it ends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When they land on the ring from the sky, Tier was standing while Loo was kneeling with one knee.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m today’s winner.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier is the winner.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Both of them are tired but they don’t seem to be heavily injured.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I meet with the two of them to show my concern.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Husband, Tier bullied me.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Loo-san, that’s underhanded.」</p>



<p class="calibre2">Third round, second match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A battle between Bulga and Makura.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was not a match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bulga was too exhausted because of her match against Uno so she couldn’t even conjure a bunshin. She was not able to evade Makura’s thread.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Uuhhh. It ended so soon….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura was victorious.</p>


<p class="calibre2">And the final contestants are now decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier and Makura.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Before that, let’s talk about the third place first.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is a match between the two who didn’t manage to get into the final.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Loo aside, Bulga is completely down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Flora also said that she can’t permit her to have another match so the third place battle was called off.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it’s not like we necessarily need to have a third placer.</p>


<p class="calibre2">And the final starts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, it did not go well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But everyone understands why.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The battle between Tier and Makura.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is similar to the battle between Corone and Makura earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s really a mismatch.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tier was tied up with web and was defeated.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The martial arts tournament winner of knight section is Makura.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zabuton’s offspring, Makura, is the champion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura raises one of her legs to respond to the cheers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She looks happy.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Now that the tournament ends, it is now the awarding ceremony.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I give Makura 10 reward <em class="calibre5">medals</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And a wooden championship<em class="calibre5"> trophy</em>. I prepared it especially for this festival, it is a wooden crown.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I consulted Loo first before carving the crown since I don’t know if there is a strange meaning if I hand it as a prize but she said that I don’t have to worry about anything since we are part of the demon king’s kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing that, I made a crown.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Because I assumed that a bipedal person will wear it, the size of the crown is not suitable for Makura.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/7nJN1Pt/u39-8965fc3b-7d2a-4c22-8b59-78592643102f.jpg">

<p class="calibre2">While I’m thinking of how should I salvage the situation, Makura received the crown and put it on her buttocks.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The crown is on her butt…..it suits her so I guess it’s <em class="calibre5">OK</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Makura proudly shows off the crown to the audience and waves her hand.</p>


<p class="calibre2">The second place Tier, I gave her five reward <em class="calibre5">medals</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I also gave one to those who won once and two to those who won twice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please do your best in the future.</p>


<p class="calibre2">With that, the martial arts tournament ends but there’s still a banquet that will last until late night or probably until tomorrow morning.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the ring is still there, free matches were held.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, because it will be dangerous if one gets heavily injured during the match, we made sure that there is a referee in all matches.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The high elves and the mountain elves who were not able to participate and the beastkins from the Howling village that came here with Gulf entered the ring to fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Some beastgirls also climbed the ring from time to time as if treating it as a battle training. Even Loo challenged Tier for a revenge match.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even when the sun sets and it gets dark, the matches continue with the help of torches and illumination magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On one side….</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king, how about having a match with me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahahahaha, please don’t joke around.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The demon king declined Dors’ invitation while ancestor-san, Beezel, and Yuri are talking about the ongoing matches.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It would be much better if no chant magic will be used more frequently.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「However, not chanting will decrease the power. I think one should asses the situation first.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I don’t know how to cast magic without chant.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really? Then I’ll explain it to you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Wa-wait a moment. Is it alright for a person of your standing to teach the princess of a country?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hnn? I don’t really care about social standing. Don’t worry about unnecessary things.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Thank you very much. I’ll do my very best to remember them all.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Doraim is enjoying the food with Hakuren, Rasuti, his wife, and Raimeiren.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Grandmother, I should polish my humanization form a bit more.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? You don’t have to be flurried. Even Doraim had some trouble transforming into human….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Mother, please stop. Besides, ah, uhm….Right, what happened to the marriage of Sekiren?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Doraim-chan, why are you talking about younger sister’s marriage in front of me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「P-please don’t mind it. Besides, isn’t your situation here similar to being married?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh, ah, we-well, do you think so? Yeah, seems like it….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「An embarrassed Hakuren….what a rare sight.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Grafaroon, if you tease me more I might tell a story about you from the old days.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…..I’m sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">What a lively meal.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Since Bulga and Stifano recovered, they are moving around as their stewards again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While not being obstructive, additional food and alcohol were given to them by Bulga and Stifano.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, what’s with the story from the old days of Doraim’s wife?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……….I’m scared to hear it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">At any rate, I feel bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Probably because of mental fatigue.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess I’m too exhausted from worrying about injuries.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next year, let’s absolutely change it to another festival.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I spent the night of the festival thinking that.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-37"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 99 &ndash; A Certain Demon King’s Mutter Part One</h1><p class="calibre2">I am the demon king.<span id="calibre_link-196"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">Demon King of the Gullgald’s Demon King’s Kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised when I heard that my daughter will go out with Beezel so I forcibly follow them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And there’s a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though it’s in human form, it cannot hide its magical power.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, its the dragon king Dors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are also other <em class="calibre5">dragons</em> around him and they are not weak at all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’ll say it honestly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I almost peed my pants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I endured it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Good job, my lower body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Maa, that’s really surprising.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m already preparing to greet him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dragon king Dors, I believe this is the first time we meet.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Are you the current demon king? Maa, we don’t have any dispute so let us not cause trouble.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu, I also certainly don’t want trouble.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Goooood, good good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m amazing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuri, did you see it?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><em class="calibre5">Papa</em>’s brave figure!</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Bufu!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I looked around to check where Yuri is, I spouted in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was another person who was not supposed to be here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like Dors, who’s near me, seem to know him too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected of Dors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But unlike me, he’s smiling wryly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m depressed with the difference of our reaction….however, I can’t be depressed with such a great person approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Re-religion leader Valgreif!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The founder of the <em class="calibre5">top</em> religion Korin which has the greatest power in areas where human lives!</p>
<p class="calibre2">The forever young like a true living god.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His identity as the true ancestor of the vampires is only known to few people.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is one of the most confidential matters that will be handed down by a former demon king to a new demon king upon taking office.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yow demon king, are you well?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Y-ye-yeah」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahahaha, don’t be too stiff. This is our first meeting, right? Sorry sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yeah, this is our first meeting….that, do you really know me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You are famous, are you not? I saw your picture from an acquaintance. By the way, it is circulating in the market.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Is that so? I am honored.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, what honor are you saying? I’m lucky to have met the demon king. Do you think so too, Dors-kun?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">Did he call the dragon king Dors Dors-kun?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do the two of them know each other?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it’s not surprising if they do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, it’s the true ancestor of the vampires.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Great.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there any other demon king who met him personally?</p>
<p class="calibre2">No no, that’s not something unexpected.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m the demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Someone that rules a country.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I only should ask what I need to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「By the way, religion leader-dono, what do you think of the brutality that the hero committed in the <em class="calibre5">Fullheart </em>Kingdom?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahaha, you sure touch a painful spot. If I say I’m unrelated, I’m obviously related. Maa, let me tell you. I’m also troubled with his recklessness in <em class="calibre5">Fullheart</em> Kingdom. The Galbart Kingdom branch is even preparing subjugation troops. By the way, <em class="calibre5">Fullheart</em> Kingdom, Galbart Kingdom, and Gullgald Demon King’s Kingdom’s names are similar. They are more like a tongue twister.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「So-sorry. It is derived from a name….subjugation troops? Is that true? Why are you sharing such an information to me?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s true it’s true. You ask me. And we found it troublesome too. Don’t you think that a miraculous bargain will certainly earn profit? Ah, even if you defeat the hero, you can rest assured that the headquarters will not move. Because of our position, we will issue protest but you can just ignore it.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「……Thank you for the information.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Dors too. You don’t need to hold back if ever they come to you.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A group already came. They are rude so I sent them away.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You sent them away? Dors-kun is gentle. You should at least knock them if not crush them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Nah, they’ll be annoying the moment they bear grudge.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ahahaha, indeed. Maa, I’ll do something in the future.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Do something?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am saved.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The hero is really troublesome.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The damage they do is at the<em class="calibre5"> level </em>that can’t be ignored.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, please do something soon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps….</p>
<p class="calibre2">After this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the way, should I accompany Dors and religion leader-dono?</p>
<p class="calibre2">……</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beezel, help me!</p>


<p class="calibre2">Along with Yuri, Beezel is talking happily with villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Looking at it carefully, the villagers are demons.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Areh…..I feel like I’ve seen them before….Isn’t that one a daughter of a count and that one of a marquis?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Or is my memory wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Aren’t they Sokuri-san?</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4"><em class="calibre5">TN: Sokuri-san is an anonymous name which means a person who looks similar to someone.</em></strong></p>
<p class="calibre2">No.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That one genuinely looks like a village girl.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Ah, I know that one.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beezel’s daughter, Fraurem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">She’s the governor of this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like she’s well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">….Or not?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Fraurem is dressed like a village girl, it means that the other village girls around her are daughters of demons too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Pull yourself together, me.</p>


<p class="calibre2">As expected, my seat was prepared near Dors and religion leader-dono.</p>
<p class="calibre2">My only salvation is that Beezel and Yuri are also nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though Yuri is comfortably talking to the dragon beside Dors. Does she know who she is?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah….my stomach hurts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Beezel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why are you looking at me with a pitying face?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems like the thing that I wanted to say was noticeable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m Raimeiren.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, yes, I’m the demon king Gullgald.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s the <em class="calibre5">typhoon</em> dragon of the south.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Dors wife.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to the information that recently came.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is that so?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Raimeiren-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">………</p>
<p class="calibre2">Isn’t she a dragon more ferocious than Dors!?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And Beezel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stop looking at me with that face.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-56"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 100 &ndash; A Certain Demon King’s Mutter Part Two</h1><p class="calibre2">Ah…..what is a demon king?<span id="calibre_link-197"></span></p>
<p class="calibre2">I have thought about it many times.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I am the demon king Gullgald of the demon king’s kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, a king of a country.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With important responsibilities.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have not brought my common sense when I decided to follow my daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Daughter of mine.</p>
<p class="calibre2">You must not go to such a place.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hahaha.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father, are you alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Eh? Ah, of course I am. Sorry. I must be tired from working every day.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">My daughter is worried about me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t be happier.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king-sama, I took some food and drinks, let’s eat.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Beezel is a nice guy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The foods he recommended are easy to eat and good for the stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu, this alcohol is good too but….it tastes strange.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I agree, this might be a new product. I will put out a purchase request.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Umu. It is easy to drink so I want two barrels.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I do my best for your request.」</p>


<p class="calibre2">Dors and religion leader-dono, who are nearby, are also enjoying the drinks and seem to be planning on purchasing too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">These, can these kinds of foods really be prepared in the forest of death…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, there are also seafoods which can only be taken from the port town in the south.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Umu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are different kinds of dishes that I have never seen nor tasted before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everything looks delicious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「The chef here, can we hire him?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Do you think we can?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「How about borrowing him?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That will be difficult.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father, I also tried but failed.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「No, this is the demon king’s desire….」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I must not be unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Let’s just think about how we can buy seasonings. I especially like this one.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, the miso? I already have a lot back at home.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「At home?….Why didn’t you gave me any?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「We consumed everything ourselves for poison testing. Or probably because it has a unique smell. Hahahaha. Let’s just check if we can purchase some again. Oh, it will start soon.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">The referee has appeared on the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah, the referee is a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s not think about it.</p>


<p class="calibre2">With religion leader-dono and one of the dragons helping with cooking, I am thankful since it lightens the pressure a bit.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The common section will start soon. Beezel’s daughter, Fraurem, seems to be a contestant so let’s cheer for her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Father, Fraurem is not the only one who’ll participate. There are others too so please support them.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">…….</p>
<p class="calibre2">A demon king shouldn’t think things like this deeply.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will do my utmost to cheer for them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fraurem regrettably had lost with a draw but their match is not bad.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It might be better to say that the opponent was good.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is said that those who live near the forest of death are naturally strong but….</p>
<p class="calibre2">I never thought that a beastgirl can move that much.</p>


<p class="calibre2">And the tournament continues.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Warrior section, knight section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I know of the participants even without being introduced.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Bloodsucking princess, angel of annihilation, angels of holocaust, revelry Bulga, black spear Stifano, crazy dragon Rasutisumoon, and the elder sister of the gatekeeper dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That oni called Ann is probably nominated because of her ability too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, there are lizardmen, high elves, mountain elves, elder dwarves, and lamias.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is also a mountain like <em class="calibre5">inferno wolf</em> and an offspring of the <em class="calibre5">demon spider</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Compare to the demon king’s castle….no, their war potential exceeds the whole demon king army.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it’s one on one I can probably manage somehow…can I?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’m not sure if I can even take Rasutisumoon much more the elder sister of the gatekeeper dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ah, Dors, even if you invite me for a match, I won’t fight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Though I hate it to admit it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I absolutely must not.</p>


<p class="calibre2">「Beezel」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I plan on conferring the village chief with a peerage, what do you think?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That would be a foolish move.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really?」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would be able to grasp him if I gave him a peerage but Beezel opposed my proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He probably thought that it will not end well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, even the dragon king Dors and the religion leader-dono can’t hold this village and even personally came here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If I do extra things, I might invite hostility. It is probably the best to maintain our present relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The human which is the<em class="calibre5"> top</em> of this village….surely, the <em class="calibre5">top </em>can’t be a normal human.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I first met him, I thought it was a joke but looking at the surrounding, no one is joking around.</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Beezel’s report, he is the powerful person who exterminated the wyvern of the iron forest….</p>
<p class="calibre2">He looks like an ordinary young man.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, an ordinary young man can’t make a village in the middle of the forest of death, will not gather this much war potential, and will never be acquainted with dragon king Dors and religion leader-dono.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yeah.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, we’re saved since he doesn’t have any bad impression about the demon king’s kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Furthermore, it is possible to casually talk to him and he is really gentle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As long as he’s the <em class="calibre5">top</em> here, there will never be a problem.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should give him a secret medicine for long life.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He must live long.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I want him to stay alive as long as I’m the demon king.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even for a human, if I give him the best, it would be possible for him to live for 400 to 500 years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Don’t die on your 50’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Please don’t.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ask of you.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Thinking about the worst case scenario, I thought of marrying him with my daughter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because the position of demon king is not something that can pass with blood relative succession, there is no marriage policy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I retire, Yuri will become a daughter of an ordinary noble….</p>
<p class="calibre2">Leaving the security aside and thinking only about my daughter’s well-being, should I really let her marry?</p>
<p class="calibre2">If possible, I don’t want her to fall on someone with bad hand….</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only problem is that he’s already married to the blood-sucking princess and angel of annihilation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If things go bad, she might not even be a third wife but a fourth….</p>
<p class="calibre2">No, it’s useless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuri is still a child.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s still too early for her to get married.</p>
<p class="calibre2">……..</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let’s leave him as a candidate in the corner of my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king-sama, are you alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Ah, yes. I’m alright. Beezel, I want to ask you something.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Yes?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「You sent your daughter Fraurem here…」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Though my loyalty for the demon king’s kingdom is unshakable, I still care for my daughter.」</p>

<p class="calibre2">「I understand what you feel about your daughter so I will not blame you. Though I don’t blame you….if the worst case happens, I would like to rely on your connection for Yuri.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Well, though she can’t be promised for marriage, it is okay for her to live in this village.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Really?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Have you forgotten? I’m still one of your four heavenly kings.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「As expected of Beezel, you are really reliable.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’m also planning to live here when I retire.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…..eh? W-wait, retire? Hold on, if you’re gone, the demon king’s kingdom will be in danger.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Come on, demon king-sama. It’s the night of the festival. Let’s enjoy delicious food and alcohol.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It’s still something I’ll do in the future. Probably for about 1000 or 2000 years later.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Hahahaha, cheers!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">Wai-wait.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Also, Dragon king Dors.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will not fight you.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I will never fight you so don’t look at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The night of the festival passed lively.</p>


<p class="calibre2">Digression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Demon king’s castle, future.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Retirement?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「I’ll retire in about 100 to 200 years so be relieved….What’s this?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「A written oath.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「…Are you doubting my loyalty?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「It is for my peace of mind.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Demon king-sama….Okay, I’ll sign….areh? I think there are mistakes here. It is written that I’ll need to be here for a thousand more years.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「That’s not a mistake.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「….is that so? Ehto, it will either be according to the time of this oath, OR until demon king-sama dies, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Wait, you! Guards, rebellion! A rebel appeared!」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「What scandalous thing are you saying? I’m just confirming it. We’re talking about something serious so don’t approach the room.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">After a rough fist fight, it was decided that he’ll be in service for another 300 years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Kuh, I won’t sign an oath.」</p>
<p class="calibre2">「Even if there’s no oath, I can’t let you retire. I’ll even give you another territory.」</p></div>
