<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>Regarding Alma&#8217;s true identity and the conversation they had, Reid was frank with Elria and told her everything.</p>
<p>Elria nodded and simply replied, <em>&#8220;I see&#8221;</em>, which surprised Reid a little, but he realized that Elria&#8217;s apprentice had also inherited the name of Caldwen and left a name for future generations, so it was similar in a way.</p>
<p>As for the mysterious points, they concluded that,<em> &#8220;There is not enough information to speculate on past events&#8221;</em>, so they decided to maintain the current situation and gather more information. After all, they are still students of the academy, and there are limits to what they can investigate. Therefore, it was safer to leave it to Alma, who held the position of a special rank mage.</p>
<p>Thus, Reid and Elria continued their peaceful academy life. Wiesel and Millis were given daily challenges, and they would say, <em>&#8220;I want to have another safe day tomorrow&#8221;</em>, but they seemed to have become much more relaxed when compared to the first day.</p>
<p>And just as the day after tomorrow approached, which was the day of the examination ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― Hey, everyone, do you have any plans for the day off?&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis brought up a topic after finishing their meal in the dormitory’s dining hall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m planning to go back home and adjust my magic tools. There&#8217;s a lot of them, so it&#8217;s going to take a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, that sounds like a lot of work for you, Wiesel-san…&#8221;</p>
<p>Over the past month, they had come to understand each other&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses. Wiesel did not excel in any particular magic, but he is able to use multiple magic tools based on the situation and is specialized in support rather than combat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I plan to spend it completely focused on the examination.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What…? But I was thinking we could all go out together on our day off…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t they explain that the day off before the examination is meant for adjusting magic tools and recuperation? You&#8217;re the only one who wants to go out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In two days, the &#8216;Conditional Examination&#8217;, which would determine their individual evaluations, would be held.</p>
<p>The students were given a day off before the examination, not only to ensure that they could take the examination in perfect condition, but also to allow the academy to prepare for it as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were praised by Elria for your magic control, but she probably told you to work harder on your combat skills. So, you should be doing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230; but I&#8217;m already receiving Alma&#8217;s absurd training every day!! And to top it off, the royal capital, which is the envy of the countryside, is nearby!! Isn&#8217;t it okay to have a little fun as a reward for working hard every dayyyyyyyyyyyy!!&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Millis could not give up and slumped over the table, pouting her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand how you feel, but give it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a demon, Reid-san!? Girls are the kind of people who can&#8217;t live without those kinds of rewards for themselves!! Elria-sama is the same, isn&#8217;t she!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis turned to Elria as she puffed up her cheeks, but ――</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no response from Elria.</p>
<p>On the contrary, she nodded her head, as if she was tired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh my&#8230; she seems quite exhausted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lately, she hasn&#8217;t been feeling too well. She&#8217;s doing some magic research and staying up late, so sometimes I go to bed before her. It&#8217;s tough because she also wakes up late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, you two often come to the classroom at the last minute, like on the first day.&#8221;</p>
<p>In reality, the mornings for Reid were very busy.</p>
<p>He would soothe Elria, who had entered a lethargic state, help her take a bath, and even help her change clothes while he was blindfolded, sometimes even carrying her halfway.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s Elria, she probably doesn&#8217;t have to study for examinations, and she probably wouldn&#8217;t be exhausted from training with Alma&#8230; I&#8217;m starting to get a little worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; I-I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be okay! Elria-sama is someone who everyone at the academy is paying attention to, so she&#8217;s probably just working hard to achieve results that are worthy of that attention!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Do you know something?&#8221;</p>
<p>asked Reid, narrowing his eyes. Millis jumped and started sweating from her forehead.</p>
<p>Recently, the two of them had made it a daily routine to go to the large bath together, and there were also times when Elria would stop by Millis&#8217;s room, saying, <em>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to teach Millis some magic&#8221;.</em></p>
<p>Elria considered Millis to be a close friend of the same gender, so there might be conversations that she did not want to be heard by Reid, who is a guy. Elria did not say anything, but seeing Millis&#8217;s behavior, his assumption seemed incorrect.</p>
<p>&#8220;A-Anyway, what about you, Reid-san!? You&#8217;re also getting just as much attention as Elria-sama now, so you can&#8217;t afford to mess up, you know!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis tried to change the topic, feeling the situation was worsening. However, it is true that Reid himself was also receiving attention from others.</p>
<p>Not only did Alma, a renowned special rank mage, become their homeroom teacher, but in addition to that, Elria was able to keep up with the special rank mage, Alma. Furthermore, Reid had caught and mowed down the tenth tier magic unleashed by Alma with his bare hands.</p>
<p>The topic quickly spread among the students. And perhaps because of such circumstances, talks about Reid have also gradually been spreading.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&#8217;ve been talking with Alma-sensei lately, too, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it. You were called &#8216;Your Excellency&#8217; before. What was that about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; it&#8217;s just a nickname. Alma-sensei is the granddaughter of someone I know, and that person used to call me &#8216;Your Excellency&#8217;, so she knew about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;No, but how did you get that nickname in the first place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s because I kept winning at chess against the old man. Something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>After that incident, Reid and Alma exchanged information several times after school, but when Alma talked to him, she started calling him &#8216;Your Excellency&#8217;, and it became a habit. There was a time when they passed by each other in the hallway, and she greeted him with an <em>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Your Excellency. Good morning&#8221;</em>.</p>
<p>At the time, Reid told her to be careful about it, but she just laughed it off. It was an attitude that did not seem to befit a descendant of Lyatt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, in my case, it depends on the content of the examination. There&#8217;s a possibility that the content may be something that I, who cannot use magic, can&#8217;t do anything about. I won&#8217;t know until the day of the examination.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly, being unable to use magic is a big handicap, but Reid&#8217;s power is beyond common sense. If it&#8217;s used properly, there shouldn&#8217;t be any problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! At the very least, you have the strength to stop Alma-sensei&#8217;s magic!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Encouraged by the two, Reid made a wry smile, but at that moment ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― Tch… annoying commoners are making a racket.&#8221;</p>
<p>Such audible words were directed at them.</p>
<p>When Reid turned his face in the direction of the voice, he saw the figure of Faregh. While his expression had less fatigue compared to the other students, it was clearly unpleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only are the people around us irritated by the unpleasant commoners, but we are also bothered by those who forget that this is a place to dine in and are making a fuss. Truly is the worst place to be at right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; I-I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing that they had made too much noise, Millis bowed her head frankly. However, Faregh sneered at her actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah…! Do commoners even know how to apologize? When bowing your head to someone in a higher position, you should prostrate yourself and rub your forehead against the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I apologize for causing a disturbance. However, there&#8217;s no need to say something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis could not bear Faregh&#8217;s words and returned them by starring daggers.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What? Are you saying that to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at Millis&#8217;s rebellious attitude, Faregh smiled sadistically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The difference between you and me isn&#8217;t just our positions. Even our talents for handling the great magic created by the Sage are different!!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then ―― he drew his magic equipment from his waist.</p>
<p>A small sword unfolded in Faregh&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>Seeing the shocked expression on Millis&#8217;s face, Faregh laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Commoners!! ―― Don&#8217;t you dare oppose me!!&#8221;</p>
<p>A dazzling light was born from the tip of the small sword, creating a bright red flame.</p>
<p>Just as the flame was about to explode in front of the standing Millis ――</p>
<p>It was crushed by Reid&#8217;s left arm, which extended instinctively.</p>
<p>Without turning back, Reid waved his hand lightly and spoke,</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, kid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;K-Kid&#8230;!? How dare you call me that, a proud member of the Welminan family ――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with calling a brat like you a kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid turned his head and directed a sharp gaze at Faregh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you understand what you did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;? I just tried to educate the commoners ――&#8221;</p>
<p>Faregh&#8217;s words were cut off, unable to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you if you don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid stood up and grabbed Faregh by the head, causing him to scream briefly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Magic is something that has taken the lives of many people. Using it on others means that you must be prepared to receive the same fate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faregh was completely overwhelmed by Reid&#8217;s gaze and intimidation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it was a &#8216;great magic created by the Sage&#8217;. Unlike you, that &#8216;Sage&#8217; didn&#8217;t use magic for fun. She risked her life and everything to create it. It&#8217;s not something a kid like you can just play with like a toy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Reid tightened his grip on Faregh&#8217;s head, a pained scream escaped from his mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to talk about yourself, talk about your own actions and accomplishments, not just the prestige of your family. Instead of sulking and complaining about things you don&#8217;t like, why don&#8217;t you show others something to be proud of? If you can&#8217;t do that&#8230; then you ought to know your place.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid threw Faregh to the ground and left him there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kuh&#8230; damn brute with stupid strength&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After commoners, now it&#8217;s brute. Well&#8230; I should give punishment to those who don&#8217;t listen.&#8221;</p>
<p>After exhaling lightly, Reid reached out to the small sword that was rolling on the floor and broke Faregh&#8217;s magic equipment with a loud sound.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;MY MAGIC EQUIPMENTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Here, take this and get lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at his broken magic equipment, Faregh shook his shoulder and folded his knees, feeling devastated.</p>
<p>&#8220;My magic equipment… the precious magic equipment bestowed upon me by my father&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Faregh-sama! Please be strong!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just tape it up or something so that your father won&#8217;t notice!!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two followers who had been watching the situation dragged the dejected Faregh out of the dining hall.</p>
<p>After watching them leave, Reid returned to his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millis, are you hurt or anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no… thank you very much&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis nodded in a daze. However, she suddenly raised her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you doing trying to act cool like that!? You can&#8217;t do that without Elria-sama watching!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t suddenly start talking nonsense.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, did Lady Elria not wake up in the midst of all the commotion just now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to Wiesel&#8217;s words, Elria was closing her eyes and rocking her body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Elria-sama? You can&#8217;t sleep here, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mmm&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>As her body was shaken, Elria opened her eyes slightly. Then, rubbing her eyes, she stood up and sat on Reid&#8217;s knee. She then squirmed to adjust her position slightly and leaned back onto Reid&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Mm.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, as if nothing had happened, Elria began to sleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hey, it&#8217;s just her changing her sleeping place, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? What&#8217;s this? Isn&#8217;t this cute creature dangerous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that Elria&#8217;s homing instinct is registered to &#8216;Reid&#8217; as her home base.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they watched Elria sleep peacefully on Reid&#8217;s body, each of them gave their thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Elria, wake up. If you&#8217;re going to sleep, do it after going back to our room.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaking her body again ――</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Nooo.&#8221;</p>
<p>She twisted her body and buried her face in Reid&#8217;s chest while pushing her head against it.</p>
<p>……………</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, wait, wait! You can enter your dozy lethargic state just like that!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that, Reid-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, even if you ask me, it&#8217;s hard to explain…!!&#8221;</p>
<p>But judging from her reaction, Elria is clearly in a lethargic state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply put, it&#8217;s a state of being very sleepy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heh&#8230; So when Elria-sama is drowsy, she becomes even more childlike than usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing Elria in a lethargic state, Millis pokes her cheeks, and Wiesel strokes his chin with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. It&#8217;s possible that consciousness is not completely aware when prematurely awakening from a deep sleep, but it&#8217;s rare for it to happen in a light sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re unusually calm about it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spent enough time with you guys that I&#8217;m not surprised by most things. Anyway, if we stay here in the dining hall, we&#8217;ll attract attention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon being pointed out by Wiesel, they notice that the students in the dining hall are looking at them due to the commotion earlier.</p>
<p>Considering Elria&#8217;s behavior when she&#8217;s in a lethargic state, it is not good to stay in a place where people can see them for too long.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, but we&#8217;ll go back to our room first. Can we leave the cleaning and such to you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood. Millis and I will take care of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. See you again the day after tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carrying Elria on his back and drawing the attention of the students, Reid left the dining hall. During this time, Elria clung tightly to his neck, pressing her head against him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re doing, but don&#8217;t push yourself too hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But… I want to make Reid happy&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes… I&#8217;ll do my best to make you smile like you used to in the olden days ――&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Elria&#8217;s words stopped.</p>
<p>Thinking something was wrong, Reid turned around and saw Elria with a bright red face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh…? Why am I… on your back…!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Moving her mouth shakily, Elria confirmed her situation with words.</p>
<p>Maybe because she had taken a nap, her lethargic state only lasted a short time.</p>
<p>Covering her reddened face with both hands, Elria swung her legs back and forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I… I&#8217;ll get o-off!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t struggle in that state. You&#8217;ll bite your tongue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;B-But… I&#8217;m heavy…!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Far from being heavy, you&#8217;re so light that I&#8217;m worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh… bu-… but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just stay still until we get back to our room.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a faint response, Elria&#8217;s presence seemed to shrink on his back.</p>
<p>As they began to walk again, Elria spoke to Reid over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That said, I might still do something reckless.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, just don&#8217;t overdo it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Don&#8217;t you want to know why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Millis seems to know what&#8217;s going on, and she&#8217;s not the kind of person who would hide something dangerous from me. So, I think there must be a reason why you&#8217;re not telling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Being too perceptive like that is not good either.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a dissatisfied voice, Elria lightly tapped his back. It&#8217;s unreasonable of her to complain when he was trying to be considerate by not asking.</p>

<img src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/rhxs_vol1/RHXS_Vol1_12.jpeg">

<p>&#8220;Well, if something happens, you can rely on me. Do whatever you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay&#8230; thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Burying her face in his back, she murmurs with a tired voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right now&#8230; I feel really safe because Reid is with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>After saying that, the sound of her quiet breathing could once again be heard from his back.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>There are two examinations at the Vegalta Royal Magic Academy.</p>
<p>To determine the magic ability and skills of aspiring mages, and to evaluate whether they are suitable to use the powerful force of magic to protect the peace of the people and carry on the legacy of the Sage&#8217;s magic for future generations, the evaluations must be conducted strictly and fairly.</p>
<p>And one of the two examinations is ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― Well then, let me explain the &#8216;Conditional Examination&#8217; again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alma announces to the students in a stern voice.</p>
<p>However, it was not just the voice that was different. The setting this time is not in the familiar classroom of the academy, but at the entrance to a vast forest with towering mountains in the background.</p>
<p>&#8220;As previously explained, you will be entering the &#8216;designated danger zone&#8217; where magical beasts reside. Please be aware that there is a considerable risk to your lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Magical beasts are entities that have undergone evolution different from ordinary animals. They have experienced sudden mutations due to the influence of magic power that arises from nature and has grown larger than usual. This is Reid&#8217;s understanding of them.</p>
<p>However, over the course of a thousand years, changes have occurred in the ecology of magical beasts. They now breed with other beasts and give birth to offspring that are also magical beasts. As a result, the number and variety of magical beasts have increased significantly compared to before, gradually expanding their habitats.</p>
<p>Therefore, areas with abundant natural magic power, where magical beasts are likely to be born, are &#8216;designated danger zones&#8217;, where entry is prohibited for non-mages.</p>
<p>And so, mages are stationed in areas where magical beasts are likely to appear. They patrol the perimeter of the &#8216;designated danger zones&#8217; to subdue any magical beasts that stray into human habitat. They also regularly reduce the excessive number of magical beasts that have settled in the area.</p>
<p>&#8220;This exercise is the lowest E-rank within the &#8216;designated danger zones&#8217;. All the magical beasts that will appear are limited to small and medium-sized ones. The medium-sized magical beasts that we saw during our inspection yesterday were already taken care of by our academy&#8217;s personnel. So, there should be no significant danger unless something unexpected happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Alma continued,</p>
<p>&#8220;That said, injuries can still occur due to carelessness and overconfidence, leading to dangerous situations and even death. You must never forget that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon hearing Alma&#8217;s warning, the students nodded with serious expressions.</p>
<p>After observing their reactions, Alma continues with her explanation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let me explain the details of this &#8216;Conditional Examination&#8217;. The scenario we are simulating is, &#8216;the rescue of civilians who have accidentally entered a designated danger zone&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Saying that, Alma took a doll out of thin air.</p>
<p>&#8220;Multiple dummy dolls will be placed within the zone, and the objective is to locate, retrieve, transport them out, and return to the assembly point within the time limit. Naturally, the more dolls you retrieve, the higher your evaluation will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>While explaining, one of the students raised their hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a question. We were told that the &#8216;Conditional Examination&#8217; is linked to individual evaluations, but if we prioritize our evaluations, should we act individually?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only say &#8216;it depends&#8217;. While it&#8217;s true that doing everything alone would lead to a higher evaluation, achieving the objective is the most important aspect of this examination. That means it&#8217;s much easier to succeed with multiple people than alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, while succeeding alone would lead to a high evaluation, failure would result in no evaluation at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, that&#8217;s it for my explanation! We&#8217;ll depart in thirty minutes, so please prepare your magic equipment and hold any necessary discussions among yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as she finished, the students split up into their respective groups.</p>
<p>Similarly, Reid and his companions gathered to discuss their plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then… let&#8217;s decide what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On that note… we&#8217;ll undoubtedly be a hindrance. Considering that it will affect our individual evaluations, wouldn&#8217;t it be better for Reid and Elria to go alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true… Thanks to Alma-sensei&#8217;s training, we&#8217;ve improved a bit, but there&#8217;s still a significant difference in skill between us, so it might be best for me to team up with Wiesel-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Reid shook his head and denied their proposal.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, as for Elria, that may be true, but I need you two, especially in my case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8217;Need&#8217; is an interesting choice of words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The objective of this examination is to &#8216;rescue&#8217;, and the rescue targets are &#8216;immobile dolls&#8217;. Based on that, what kind of people do you think require rescuing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re immobile… perhaps they are people who are frightened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, it means they are injured and can&#8217;t move?&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid nodded in response to Wiesel’s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both answers are correct. We need to calm down frightened people, provide medical treatment for the injured, and then transport them out of the zone&#8230; It&#8217;s difficult to accomplish all of that alone. Especially since I can&#8217;t use magic, it&#8217;s impossible for me to use healing magic on the dolls. That&#8217;s why I need you two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; That dummy doll was definitely a type of magic tool. So there&#8217;s a high possibility that some sort of mechanism is built into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning that there&#8217;s a possibility that it won&#8217;t react unless multiple people find it or that it can&#8217;t be transported without healing magic?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. That&#8217;s why I think dealing with the magical beasts should be my job, Wiesel should handle the transport of the dolls using multiple magic tools, and Millis should deal with the mechanisms on the dolls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid had almost complete confidence in this idea.</p>
<p>Considering that Alma had recommended working in a team, and added the word &#8216;transport&#8217; along with locating and retrieval, it indicated that achieving the objective is crucial.</p>
<p>If the &#8216;Conditional Examination&#8217; simulated actual scenarios, then it is safe to say that it recreated any possible variables that could actually occur.</p>
<p>The examination is designed in a way that prioritizes evaluation, so there is a high possibility of failure if one acts alone, but if one does not forget, they can surely get a good evaluation.</p>
<p>It could be said that it is content suitable for the first examination.</p>
<p>&#8220;But in that case, wouldn&#8217;t it be better if Elria-sama is with us, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230; I&#8217;m told that I must do it alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. The headmaster told me that if I work with others, it will be difficult to evaluate their performance. So she wants me to take the examination alone if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, that certainly makes sense…&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis nodded in agreement, perhaps because she had seen Elria&#8217;s magic up close before.</p>
<p>Although the headmaster restricts Elria from using magic beyond the fifth tier, the quality of her magic, such as its power, speed, and range, surpasses that of an average mage.</p>
<p>As a result, it becomes difficult to determine whether the results obtained by a team taking the examination together are based on their collective efforts or Elria&#8217;s abilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Reid&#8217;s proposal makes sense. If it were just transporting the dolls, it wouldn&#8217;t be enough to make it an examination, so some sort of ingenuity must have been applied.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Considering that, it could even be a part of the examination if we are not careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Both of you have thought things through so quickly in such a short time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just thought I would retrieve the dolls normally&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;I had a feeling it would be something like this.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>The two answered calmly in unison in response to Wiesel and Millis&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>After all, Reid and Elria have experience in rescuing injured people on the battlefield and rescuing allies stranded in enemy territory.</p>
<p>As Reid and the others were deciding on a course of action ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― Hah! It seems that you two understand nothing!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Such a commanding voice could be heard from behind.</p>
<p>Turning around, there was Faregh with a smug smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up, kid? You&#8217;re looking lively today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop calling me that!! Our ages aren&#8217;t that different, are they!?&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as Reid replied with those words, Faregh spluttered with outrage. Perhaps due to the incident the other day, the nickname &#8216;Kid&#8217; had become firmly established.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, do you have any other ideas?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I do! I think this examination has other objectives besides just rescue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Other objectives?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. Although Alma-sensei stated earlier that there are no medium-sized magical beasts, she didn&#8217;t say a word about there being no large magical beasts!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Faregh spoke loudly with such a misguided idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is likely to be only one large magical beast in the zone! Whoever defeats it will receive a great evaluation ――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s unlikely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not done talking, you know!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An apprentice who hasn&#8217;t even become a mage is more likely to die than just get injured when facing a large magical beast. If the academy prepares something like that, it would be a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to think that way, then go ahead. I have the power to subjugate even a large magical beast!!&#8221;</p>
<p>With confidence, Faregh raised his magic equipment up in the air. It seemed that his magic equipment, which he had sent for repairs, had been fixed, making him feel invigorated today.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that my magic equipment is back, it&#8217;s the perfect opportunity for me to use my full power ――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, doesn&#8217;t your magic equipment look shorter than before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because you broke it!! Even the magic equipment engineer employed by the Welminan family said it couldn&#8217;t be repaired, but I had it forcibly cut and fixed!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good thing you have a skilled engineer. Don&#8217;t get too carried away just because you can use magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you…!! You will definitely be sorry for this!!&#8221;</p>
<p>After spitting out those words, Faregh left with his followers.</p>
<p>Watching them leave, Millis scratched her cheek apologetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahaha… I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s kind of my fault&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. He&#8217;s been eyeing me since the beginning, and I think he has a lot of gall to come at me after being humiliated in front of so many people and having his magic equipment broken.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah… when I hear you say that, it makes that noble seem pitiful&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis looked at Faregh as he walked away with a sympathetic look. Faregh probably did not think he would get pitied like that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well… let&#8217;s go then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm, please be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, you too. You&#8217;re alone, so be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>After patting Elria&#8217;s head, Reid leaned forward slightly. Elria then reached out and put her hand on his head.</p>
<p>Watching the two of them ――</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Those two are already flirting even before the examination.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just think of it as the leeway of the strong. If we get influenced by them, our senses will be disturbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right… since we&#8217;re in danger, let&#8217;s keep our guard up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel and Millis nodded in agreement while looking at the two of them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Several tens of minutes have passed since Reid and the others entered the &#8216;designated danger zone&#8217; where magical beasts run rampant. They were making good progress.</p>
<p>&#8220;―――― Take this!&#8221;</p>
<p>When a magical beast pounced on him, Reid delivered a kick and a shout. In that instant, the magical beast was blown away without even a chance to scream, crashing into a tree and coming to a halt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, the magical beasts themselves are not that strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The opinion of someone who can blow them away with their bare hands without using magic is not really helpful, though&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When you actually witness it like this, the abnormality of Reid stands out even more.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two who were waiting behind him voiced their impressions.</p>
<p>Although small in size, the magical beasts are no bigger than a human.</p>
<p>The wildcat-like magical beast that Reid had kicked away earlier was clearly larger than a human, and fighting it empty-handed would normally be an act of suicide.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m holding back even with this. If I hit it with all my strength, there would be collateral damage, and I wouldn&#8217;t want to be covered in its blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Magical beasts become ferocious and have bloodlust from the moment they mutate. If other magical beasts gather in response to the smell of blood, it will be difficult to move forward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t want to walk around with Reid-san covered in blood either&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>As they were moving forward, Millis suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Will Elria-sama be fine? Even though she&#8217;s strong, she&#8217;s still alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No problem. Even if a thousand or so magical beasts jump at her from all directions, she can handle them all with just first tier magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mages have a diverse roster of fighting methods.</p>
<p>The basics of combat for a mage is to cast magic from medium to long range, but if there are many enemies, it would be difficult to keep up and might get attacked unexpectedly. At such times, &#8216;close-quarters combat magic&#8217; is to be used.</p>
<p>By storing magic in the magic circuit incorporated in the magic equipment, the time required for chanting and deployment is shortened to the utmost limit, allowing for effective use in rapidly changing battle situations, high-speed combat in close quarters, and even one-on-one combat.</p>
<p>Not only did it involve general body strengthening, but it could also take on various tactics depending on the magic stored in the magic equipment, such as evocation magic that deploys flames like a sword, barrier magic that forms a safe space instantly, or defensive magic that repels attacks from opponents.</p>
<p>In close-quarters combat, tactics are more important than power, so even lower tier magic could overwhelm the opponent if used correctly.</p>
<p>And its creator, Elria, is also known as the &#8216;Sage&#8217;.</p>
<p>She has her own unique method of shortening chants and magic deployments without relying on magic equipment, but it seems to be difficult for ordinary people. And it is said that she created it so that anyone can handle it.</p>
<p>Moreover, she has mastered various martial arts to verify her theory. She has used these techniques in close-quarters combat with Reid in the past, but not for her own benefit. She works hard so that others can use them, and her spirit of dedication is admirable.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s against an ordinary person, Elria can completely dominate them with pure martial prowess without using magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No way! That slender and cute Elria-sama? Under normal conditions, she would lose if she fought without using magic.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>&#8216;Hahaha&#8217;</em>, Millis laughs casually and waves her hand.</p>
<p>It is probably because magic combat is highly specialized now to the point that many martial arts and swordsmanship that were common a thousand years ago are now almost gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;However&#8230; now that you mention it, Reid&#8217;s movements are quite unique compared to other mages. As for me, that&#8217;s also quite intriguing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, then let’s give it a shot next time. Wiesel is also more inclined towards close-quarters combat with magic equipment, so it will be useful in case of a one-on-one combat situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be great. I&#8217;ll definitely receive your guidance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ehh&#8230; I&#8217;m not good at hitting or kicking people, though&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You might want to ask Elria about that. She knows more about it. Just knowing some simple self-defense techniques or how to move your body can make a difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they walk and exchange such conversations, Wiesel suddenly squints his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too late to mention this, but&#8230; Reid and Elria seem to know a lot about strange things, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; Well, you see, the Caldwen family has been around for about a thousand years, so they have many ancient texts and documents. That&#8217;s why we know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you were originally from the countryside, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it&#8230; we seem to get along well despite not being old acquaintances, it means that you must have lived in the countryside for a long time… So, when did you two get engaged?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, we got engaged about two months ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two months&#8230; but despite that, you both seem to trust each other and have a very good relationship… It&#8217;s not like you have known each other for a long time, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Under the questioning of the two, Reid stumbles on his words a little. He had spent a lot of time with them, even during class, and he trusted them. So he ended up talking more than he intended to.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you all about it with Elria next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>After brushing it off, Reid contemplated.</p>
<p><em>(&#8230;I&#8217;ll talk it over with Elria about all that stuff next time.)</em></p>
<p>Telling others about their reincarnation situation requires much deliberation.</p>
<p>According to the notes left by his former subordinate, someone has erased information about the ‘Hero’. Therefore, there is a possibility that harm could come to those who know about it.</p>
<p>There are too many unknowns at the moment.</p>
<p>Why were the ‘Sage’ and the ‘Hero’ reincarnated a thousand years later?</p>
<p>Why has the existence of the ‘Hero’ been erased, and only a part of it remained incomplete?</p>
<p>Why does Reid have a power that is different from ordinary humans?</p>
<p>If it is not just magic power, what kind of power is it? What kind of effect does it have on the surroundings, not just on himself? And does it have something to do with reincarnation?</p>
<p>And ――</p>
<p>―― Why did Elria Caldwen die?</p>
<p>According to texts, it was reported that she died of illness. Elria herself had no doubts about her own death. If it were a disease unique to the elves that Reid did not know about, it would not be strange if Elria mentioned it. And if it were an assassination, Elria would have had questions about her own death.</p>
<p>However, there is no longer anyone who knows the details of her death. Over a thousand years, that memory had been lost. There was a sense of incongruity scattered throughout. They could not continue to ignore them.</p>
<p>While he was thinking vaguely about it&#8230; suddenly, Wiesel stopped in his tracks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, I see something over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;M-Maybe it&#8217;s a magical beast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; it’s a cave. It&#8217;s probably natural.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel lightly tapped his glasses and turned his face towards it.</p>
<p>It was a magic tool that he had used during Elria and Alma’s mock battle, and it was very helpful in this examination as it could detect traces of magic that could not be seen and detect heat emitted by organisms. It could also scout places from afar by changing the magnification.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wiesel, are there any magical beasts around?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; I don’t see any in the surrounding area.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that&#8217;s a hit. There&#8217;s definitely a doll in the cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? How can you be so sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you were injured while escaping from a magical beast, you would seek refuge in a safe place. Since there are no dolls lying around, it is safe to assume that they were placed with some intention and consideration of the situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, they had not seen any dolls along the way, so it is reasonable to assume that they were not randomly placed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;ll go ahead. Wiesel will keep watch, and Millis will assist you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid led the two of them into the cave. He searched for any signs of life inside the cave, but there were none. Then ―― he saw a figure in the darkness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wiesel, please confirm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same as what Kanos-sensei showed us. As for the number&#8230; there are five of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!? There are that many!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess the setting is that they all escaped together as a group. I don&#8217;t want to touch them and risk breaking them, so I&#8217;ll leave it to you two from here on out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid kept watch outside the cave for any magical beasts, while Wiesel and Millis began working inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;This magic circuit… detects multiple heat sources. It&#8217;s probably designed to deactivate when two or more people approach it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ohh&#8230; it’s just as Reid said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lady Millis, what about the other dolls?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, I think they&#8217;re all the same ――&#8221;</p>
<p>said Millis as she reached out to touch one of the dolls.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the doll let out a loud noise and shook violently.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;UWAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!?&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hey! What&#8217;s the matter!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay! It&#8217;s probably a mechanism triggered by the doll!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel grimaced at the echoing sound and looked at the doll&#8217;s thigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;This… It seems to be responding to magic power and activating a timer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-What does that mean…?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Judging by the decreasing numbers, it seems like a time limit&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it be that… it’s the time limit for the doll to die from its injuries…?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s a high possibility. If it&#8217;s an injured person, we have to treat them before we can move them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;T-Then let&#8217;s heal them right away! Elria-sama herself has taught me all the basic healing magic, and I&#8217;ve also received her seal of approval!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis confidently deployed her magic equipment and lightly swung her wand toward the doll.</p>
<p>At that moment, a faint light enveloped the doll ―― and a loud sound rang out.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;UWAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;What’s the matter this time!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t scream right next to me, Lady Millis! My eardrums will burst!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel hit her on the head with a bang in response to Millis&#8217;s scream, which was louder than the doll&#8217;s.</p>
<p>While rubbing her head with teary eyes, Millis looked at the doll.</p>
<p>&#8220;D-Didn&#8217;t you say that it would be undone if we cast healing magic on it!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m sure we did something right since it reacted, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing the conversation between the two, Reid called out from a distance,</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, could it be that the emergency treatment order is also important?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Order?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if you close the wound with healing magic right away, there are cases where you can still get infected depending on the condition of the wound. So first, check the condition of the injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s just a doll… it can&#8217;t be injured!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well… maybe they consider the position of the magic circuit as the injured area. Besides magic detection, there are also pressure sensors in the vicinity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;B-But… we only have five minutes left!!&#8221;</p>
<p>When Reid focused his gaze, the number displayed on the doll&#8217;s thigh showed that they had less than five minutes left. If they did not take appropriate measures by then, the doll would die.</p>
<p>&#8220;E-Emergency treatment… err, I think the first thing to do is&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calm down, Millis. I&#8217;ll give you instructions, so take it slowly. Wiesel, check if the magic circuit has been undone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid instructed them, then lowered his voice to calm Millis down.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, apply detoxification magic around the wound… the magic circuit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>Following Reid&#8217;s instructions, Millis cast detoxification magic on the doll, but no warning sound was heard this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Good, part of the circuit has been undone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S-Should we put pressure on the wound next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before that, gag the mouth with a cloth or something. Considering that it&#8217;s injured and exhausted, it might be in a state where it is prepared to die. Some people may bite their tongues and commit suicide during treatment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I understand!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis tied a handkerchief around the doll&#8217;s mouth, and Reid continued giving instructions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next, put pressure on the wound and lay the injured doll down. If the injured area is the thigh, raise it higher than the heart and stop the bleeding to some extent before checking on the wound again.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a serious expression, Millis followed Reid&#8217;s instructions and carried out the treatment. Each time, they confirmed with Wiesel and proceeded to the next treatment and healing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-It ―― should be fine now!!&#8221;</p>
<p>And the moment Millis finally cast her healing magic that failed previously, the timer displayed on the doll stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-Is it okay now…!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; all the mechanisms have been undone. Judging from the fact that the magic circuits of other dolls have also stopped, helping this doll was also a condition.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Wiesel was checking the other dolls, Millis sat down weakly on the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pheeewww&#8230; I&#8217;m so glaaaadddd&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, you did a good job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you sooo muchhh, Reid&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Millis expressed her gratitude in a tearful voice, perhaps because she was very nervous and felt the weight of the responsibility of saving someone&#8217;s life in a rescue operation within a time limit. It must have been a considerable burden for Millis, who was in charge of the treatment.</p>
<p>As Reid watched Millis, who was relieved, Wiesel approached them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did well too, Wiesel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;No, I was just checking the magic circuit. This is Lady Millis&#8217;s achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that. You need to check the patient&#8217;s condition while performing the treatment, and it just so happens that it was a magic circuit this time. It&#8217;s also necessary to talk and distract the patient to avoid anxiety while observing the treatment, so your role is also important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m grateful to hear you say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel smiled happily, which was rare for him. However, after adjusting his expression, Wiesel lowered his voice and asked,</p>
<p>&#8220;Reid, have you ever seen a dying person before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh? What&#8217;s this all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well… your instructions were so precise, and you seemed to be explaining it as if you had actually seen a dying person.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel asked with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>That was why Reid answered while avoiding eye contact.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah… I&#8217;ve seen some people on the verge of death before, and some I couldn&#8217;t save. So even though it was with a doll this time, what you guys did was admirable.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid thought of the scenes where people fell on the battlefield and died, full of regret. In that situation, friend or foe did not matter. When someone died, those who knew them would grieve as well. He had seen that kind of scene many times.</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why ―― thank you for saving the dolls.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid said those words to the two of them with a wry smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reid, you ――&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel was about to ask something, but then&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;UWAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, stop screaming every time something happens!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, look! Someone&#8217;s coming this way!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing her pointing at the cave entrance, Reid and Wiesel turned around.</p>
<p>Three figures were running from across the forest.</p>
<p>They recognized the figures.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that… Faregh the Kid and his two followers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-No way… they&#8217;re not planning to steal the dolls, are they!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No… something seems off.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel observed the three of them while adjusting his glasses.</p>
<p>At the sight of it, Wiesel&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reid! Call those three over here right now!! There are injured people!!&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment he heard that, Reid immediately jumped out of the cave. He then rushed over to Faregh and the others.</p>
<p>Seeing Reid’s approach, Faregh lifted his head in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the Caldwen&#8217;s ――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What happened to them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Faregh was supporting the other two with his shoulders.</p>
<p>The two had injuries all over their bodies, with one arm hanging limply and the other&#8217;s leg bending in an unnatural direction.</p>
<p>After confirming that they were not in a life-threatening condition, Reid helped carry them up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, let&#8217;s head to the cave. It&#8217;s safe there without any magical beasts.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment Faregh heard the word ‘magical beasts’, he shuddered in fear. His eyes were vacant and lacked any spirit. His face also had turned pale.</p>
<p>While questioning his behavior, Reid led them into the cave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millis! Take care of the two injured!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>EEEHHHH!?</strong> You want me to take care of them right away!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From what I can tell, it seems like they only have broken bones and aren&#8217;t in any life-threatening condition. But make sure to check them properly. I need to talk to this guy.&#8221;</p>
<p>While saying that, Reid turned his gaze to Faregh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, kid. Explain what happened to them. Were they attacked by magical beasts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Magical beasts&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>After hearing those words, Faregh sat on the ground and trembled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know… I don&#8217;t know&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that it&#8217;s a magical beast… but I&#8217;ve never seen that kind of magical beast before&#8230;!! I never thought that kind of monster could exist&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>As Faregh continued to mutter while shaking, Wiesel, who was keeping an eye on the outside, spoke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Reid, this might be a little bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t confirmed its appearance yet… but there&#8217;s something moving in the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wiesel&#8217;s voice was trembling slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the very least… it&#8217;s not small or medium-sized. There is a presence in the forest that is clearly different from the magical beasts we&#8217;ve seen so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then ―― there was movement in the forest before them. Trees are falling over and over. A black figure became visible among the dense trees.</p>
<p>It was ‘Armor’. A jet-black outer shell that radiated a metallic luster. The massive body covered in that armor-like outer shell pushed back the trees, causing them to fall. And from between the tall trees, a neck slowly lifted up.</p>
<p>It was a ‘Dragon’. A long neck covered in glittering black scales. A rectangular face covered like a helmet by a sturdy outer shell. But its mouth reveals a myriad of white fangs and a slightly open red oral cavity. Its twisted head moved as if it were looking around for something&#8230; and eventually, it stopped at the sight of the cave.</p>
<p>As its blood-red eyes looked at Reid and the others inside the cave ――</p>
<p><em><strong>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ――― !!</strong></em></p>
<p>A deafening roar reverberated through the trees.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>At the moment when the roar reached their ears, Reid shouted at everyone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millis, Wiesel! Take those injured and go deeper!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon seeing the armored dragon charging towards them with a thunderous roar, the two carried the wounded and headed deeper into the cave.</p>
<p>As Reid dragged the stumbling Faregh ―― a heavy impact and crushing sound was heard from the entrance of the cave. It was the armored dragon trying to stick its head into the cave. However, due to its large body, it could only fit its head inside, and it snarled its fangs, trying to devour Reid and the others before it.</p>
<p>Then, as the armored dragon roared again, Faregh let out a short scream and covered his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eek&#8230; I-It’s attacking us&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;No way. Did you guys attack it first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! We were searching, thinking that the academy had something prepared&#8230; But we didn&#8217;t expect it to exist, and when we found it, my legs gave out. Then Valk and Lucas tried to help me and got injured instead&#8230; That&#8217;s all…!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Faregh explained the situation clumsily while shedding tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>He continued to curl up and cry. It was unclear whether it was for causing the injuries to the two or for involving Reid and the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I caused trouble&#8230;!! If I didn&#8217;t suggest searching for it, thinking that there might be a large magical beast around, this wouldn&#8217;t have happened&#8230;!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Faregh expressed his remorse while shedding tears.</p>
<p>Upon seeing this, Reid gently patted Faregh&#8217;s head and said,</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you crying for, kid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could have seen it and run away, but you didn&#8217;t abandon your friends and desperately fled with them while supporting them on your shoulders.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faregh had been carrying the two while frantically trying to escape. His body was covered in dirt. He definitely had fallen several times in fear, but he could have abandoned the two and saved himself. And yet, he continued to stand up and desperately ran to save the two.</p>
<p>&#8220;What you did was admirable. That&#8217;s when you should hold your head high.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid smiled at Faregh and then turned to the two behind him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millis, Wiesel, can you use barrier magic while providing treatment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I have some magic tools specialized in barrier magic. Even if Millis-san uses up her magic power during the treatment, we should be fine for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood. Hang in there after I leave the cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-What…? You&#8217;re not planning on fighting that thing, are you!?&#8221;</p>
<p>shouted Faregh, guessing what Reid was about to do.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible! I tried to fight back, but that thing ――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to say that &#8216;magic doesn&#8217;t work on that thing&#8217;, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Cutting off Faregh’s words, Reid looks at the armored dragon before him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a magical beast called &#8216;Armament Dragon&#8217;. It feeds on mineral veins found in mountains and canyons as its main food source, absorbing metals and magic ores to create an armor-like outer shell. The shell imbued with magic power deflects and reduces the power of incoming magic attacks.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a story from over a millennium ago. Altein was at a disadvantage due to the magic created by the ‘Sage’ and was planning to use a certain magical beast as a weapon in battle. That magical beast was the dragon called ‘Armament Dragon’.</p>
<p>After capturing the Armament Dragons, they released them on the battlefield in an attempt to counter the mages led by Vegalta. However, Altein could not control the Armament Dragons, causing massive damage to both sides.</p>
<p>&#8220;How… do you know something like that…?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I just know because of various reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Either way, it&#8217;s reckless to fight against that thing… We should wait for the academy to notice the situation and send reinforcements!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. Even if it were not the academy but Elria, who noticed the abnormality and came here, the situation would have been resolved quickly&#8230; But we don&#8217;t have time to wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Armament Dragon is still trying to devour them and keeps putting its head into the cave. The cave shook every time it did, and dust fell from the ceiling. It was highly likely that the cave had become compromised due to its previous attack. If they left the Armament Dragon alone, they would undoubtedly end up being buried alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wiesel, as I said before, set up a barrier once I go out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;S-Stop it! Going alone is suicidal!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I&#8217;m not thinking of doing this with the intention of dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>said Reid as he slowly approached the dragon&#8217;s jaw.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Armament Dragons caused great damage on the battlefield. Their magic immunity made it difficult for the mages of Vegalta to fight against them, and even defensive barriers and protections were useless, making it impossible to defend against them.</p>
<p>Altein soldiers, accompanied by Armament Dragons, were helpless and scattered, devoured and crushed by them. The battlefield was engulfed in chaos and despair.</p>
<p>However, the rampaging Armament Dragons were annihilated by a single man. And the man was given a title as the one who saved them from an unprecedented crisis ――</p>
<p>&#8220;Just being a ―― ‘Hero’, is enough to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>With those words, he raised his fist, and a metallic sound resonated. The massive body of the Armament Dragon floated up from the ground. The Armament Dragon was sent flying and rolled away from the entrance of the cave.</p>
<p>While watching this, Reid slowly stepped out of the cave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Surprisingly tough. I didn&#8217;t know back when I used a sword.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shaking his fist, he speaks to the Armament Dragon, that is lying down. A faint emotion was visible in the Armament Dragon&#8217;s red eyes.</p>
<p>Fear.</p>
<p>As a living creature, it was natural for it to feel fear in the presence of a stronger being than itself. To the strongest human who was once called a ‘Hero’.</p>
<p>&#8220;How nostalgic&#8230; When was the last time we fought?&#8221;</p>
<p>Against Reid, who utters such words, the Armament Dragon roared and swung its powerful arm. It was a horizontal slash that was more than enough to crush a human.</p>
<p>Without even tracking its movement with his eyes, Reid stopped the attack by raising his right arm ――</p>
<p>It was an attack delivered by an overwhelming difference in size. However, even when receiving the attack, Reid did not flinch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; no good. Other than the ‘Sage’, I can&#8217;t remember the weaklings.&#8221;</p>
<p>Having said that, Reid then focused his strength on his left arm. With a sensation that surged through his body, he faced the fierce-looking Armament Dragon once again ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― And that means you&#8217;re just that weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>He punched its jaw with his fist.</p>
<p>There was a high-pitched sound of metal colliding, and a dull sound of flesh being hit occurred simultaneously. The huge body that flew past the trees lightly danced in the air. After the massive body fell, the ground shook, and a dust cloud rose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tch&#8230; I guess I can&#8217;t break through its armor.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the sight of the Armament Dragon stumbling to its feet, Reid clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>Although the Armament Dragon itself also showed fear towards Reid and had stopped moving, it did not show any intention to escape, and judging by its red eyes showing anger, it will likely continue to fight back.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s not all ――</p>
<p><em><strong>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO ――― !!</strong></em></p>
<p>Resonating roars were echoing from far away.</p>
<p>It seems like there is more than one Armament Dragon in the area. At least, there might be several&#8230; Perhaps even the possibility of more than ten.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It would be a pain in the ass to deal with all of them barehanded.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would not be difficult for Reid alone to get through this. However, it would be difficult to escape from a group of Armament Dragons in a situation where there are injured people. If they continued to fight in the vicinity of the cave, there is a possibility that the cave would collapse due to the aftermath.</p>
<p>As Reid was pondering on what to do ――</p>
<p>Like rain falling from the sky, a light whip wrapped around the Armament Dragon&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>After being caught off guard, the Armament Dragon rampages while roaring, but as if to capture its movements, the light whip binds its massive body.</p>
<p>&#8220;―― Sorry, I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a calm voice from above, Reid looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Elria.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. When I went to hand over the dolls, Alma-sensei told me, <em>&#8216;We have confirmed multiple unidentified magical beasts, so if you find any students, please bring them back&#8217;</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are multiple, then it&#8217;s not just one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the exact number, but it seems like there are enough Armament Dragons that all the teachers in charge are dealing with them. They need more manpower and fighting power, so I was told to have my restrictions lifted, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>After dismounting from her staff, Elria turned her gaze to Millis, who was in the cave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Millis, maintain the barrier as it is. Did I make myself clear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-Yes! I will maintain the barrier!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm, good girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>After murmuring softly, right after that ――</p>
<p>The cave in front of them disappeared as if the entire space had been gouged out.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spatial Transfer.</strong></em></p>
<p>Moreover, it was a large-scale teleportation magic that moved the entire cave.</p>
<p>&#8220;With this, we have secured everyone in our class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, couldn&#8217;t we have just teleported those guys alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s because… there are Armament Dragons all over the place, so the surrounding magic power is unstable. It would be a mess if we just teleported them only.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But isn&#8217;t it crazy to teleport the whole cave?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t want to hear that from someone punching an Armament Dragon bare-handed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria pouts, and a voice is heard from her waist.</p>
<p>‘Elria-chan? There are students inside the cave that was teleported here, right?’</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there are five people other than Reid. Have you checked all the students?&#8221;</p>
<p>‘In that case, we have confirmed all the students who were taking the examination, including the other classes. Some are injured, but there are no students in critical condition. All the teachers have also withdrawn.’</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm, that&#8217;s good to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria nods as she listens to Alma&#8217;s voice from her magic tool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, we&#8217;ll blow everything away now, so protect the students.&#8221;</p>
<p>‘Huh? Wait a minute, what are you planning to do?’</p>
<p>&#8220;Since it&#8217;s disadvantageous for mages to fight Armament Dragons, Reid and I will blow them all away now.&#8221;</p>
<p>‘No, wait! I didn&#8217;t say you could do that ――’</p>
<p>Elria cuts off communication with the magic tool and rushes over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reid… it&#8217;s been a while. Don&#8217;t you want to get serious for a change?&#8221;</p>
<p>asked Elria with a slightly proud expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Serious, you say… If I hit with all my strength, I could take down one or two ――&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll make sure you can get serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria raises her wand with a smile. Immediately after, a change occurs in the space in front of them. The concentrated magical light flowing through the wand focuses on one point and takes on a clear shape.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for a long time. How can Reid fight at full power again… How can he smile like he used to when we were fighting?&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike a thousand years ago, Reid has no weapons he can use now. Weapons these days cannot withstand Reid&#8217;s power.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought that if it was created from my magic, it could withstand your power.&#8221;</p>
<p>The shape that the concentrated magical light takes on is a ‘sword’. A greatsword that surpasses Reid&#8217;s height.</p>
<p>It is an existence that can be called another version of himself, having passed through countless battlefields together.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s late, but ―― it&#8217;s a congratulatory gift for your successful enrollment.&#8221;</p>
<p>said Elria while blushing and turning her face away.</p>
<p>The moment Reid saw it… he could not help but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;<strong>HAHAHA</strong>, I see! So it&#8217;s a gift for my enrollment!!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;W-Why are you laughing&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No… I really think it&#8217;s just like you. Only you would think of making a sword with magic and calling it a congratulatory gift for enrollment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;B-Because… I thought Reid would be the happiest about it…!&#8221;</p>
<p>Maintaining the magic, Elria said it with her face turning bright red.</p>
<p>However ――</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just about being happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling a surge of strength in his right arm, Reid held the ‘sword’ in his hand.</p>
<p>Despite the sensation of the magic power disappearing as it opposed Reid’s strength, Elria is able to maintain its shape through the continuous use of magic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your magic, which you used to fight me, is what makes it so durable.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sword was created using the technique of ‘Weighted Multiplication Deployment’, which combines a myriad of spells, devised by Elria to defeat Reid. It is perfectly reproduced not only in size and shape but also the detail, such as the fine scars on the blade. Perhaps it is based on Elria&#8217;s own memories.</p>
<p>It can be called a ―― &lt;&lt;Magic Sword&gt;&gt;, created by the ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>The ‘Sage’, who was once a sworn enemy, controlled the &lt;&lt;Magic Sword&gt;&gt; while standing beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it… this is the first time I’m fighting together with Reid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s true. We were enemies, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But now we&#8217;re together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. A united front in a world one thousand years in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>In front of Elria&#8217;s smiling face, Reid lifted the &lt;&lt;Magic Sword&gt;&gt; as if to show it off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now then… I&#8217;ve received such a good present.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment he grips the &lt;&lt;Magic Sword&gt;&gt; with his hands, a surge of power flows through his entire body, causing crackling lightning sounds in response to Elria&#8217;s magic.</p>
<p>He was not looking at the Armament Dragon that was dying in front of him. The ‘Hero’ was focused on something far more significant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to show you my ―― ‘true strength’.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had fought against each other many times in the past. However, Reid had never shown Elria all of his powers. And that was because Reid was a ‘Hero’.</p>
<p>He represented Altein and was willing to risk his life to protect the land and its people. Not just his own countrymen, but also others.</p>
<p>The ‘Sage’ who envisioned the future, drastically changed the world with new technology called ‘Magic’ and sought to protect that future.</p>
<p>They could not afford to lose that future to futile acts of war. To protect everything and to prevent harm, they had to restrain their power.</p>
<p>However ―― the current Reid is a nobody.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though it&#8217;s been a while, the body doesn&#8217;t forget anything!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid bares his teeth and lets out a gleeful roar. His unique magic power surged and exploded, crushing everything around him.</p>
<p>With just the motion of holding his greatsword deeply at his waist, the pure ‘power’ overflowing from Reid was too much for the ground to bear as it sank under his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Watch closely ―― Elria Caldwen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of calling her ‘Sage’, he speaks the name of a young girl who he admires and reveres as a worthy opponent, as someone who desires to continue fighting from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my ―― ‘true strength’!!&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately after he declared that, Reid swung his greatsword with great force. Then ―― the world before them was engulfed by overwhelming ‘violence’.</p>
<p>A blow that forcibly obliterated the existence of the world itself.</p>
<p>A serious blow was delivered by the one who bore the name of the strongest, the ‘Hero’.</p>
<p>After watching the scenes unfold in front of her ――</p>
<p>“――――――”</p>
<p>Elria was captivated by the sight and became speechless.</p>

<img src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/rhxs_vol1/RHXS_Vol1_13.jpeg">

<p>There was nothing there. The solid ground, which should have been sturdy, had been gouged out to the depths of the earth. The forest that had dyed the earth deep green for countless years had disappeared. Not even its shadow remained. White clouds that hung in the blue sky were split apart as if to indicate the path of ‘violence’. Even the sun floating high up in the sky had its light twisted and distorted.</p>
<p>It was an endless horizon.</p>
<p>What is left was ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― Did my ‘true strength’ exceed your imagination?&#8221;</p>
<p>Only one human, carrying a greatsword on his shoulder and wearing a delighted smile.</p>
<p>Looking at his figure, Elria returned his words with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it was amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you give me a bit more praise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was so amazing that all I can say is &#8216;amazing&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a passing grade, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he said that with a laugh, Elria squinted her eyes happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Reid always seems to have the most fun when fighting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh? Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. But&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s not a sword you can keep using.&#8221;</p>
<p>The greatsword he was carrying was gradually diminishing. Even though it was made by Elria&#8217;s magic, it could not withstand Reid&#8217;s magic power completely and would disintegrate and disappear if Elria stopped controlling it. However, Reid shook his head calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, you thought I laughed because I finally got to fight with a sword after a long time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Is that not it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s true that I was happy, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Reid&#8217;s laughter during battle was not just because fighting was enjoyable. He was not laughing from the bottom of his heart just because of that. Most important of all ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m with you that I&#8217;m always having fun and smiling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, he answered with a broad smile.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After a while, Reid and Elria made their way to the shelter where the teachers were gathered. And then, they were made to sit in seiza position.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I gave Elria permission to lift the restrictions, and I think His Excellency did a good job dealing with the unknown magical beast, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>With a vein popping on her forehead, Alma pointed with her thumb.</p>
<p>&#8220;―― I never said to rewrite the map, did I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The forest that once existed is now gone. The shadow of the hills that were a bit far away can no longer be seen. It is now just a straight horizon that extends endlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;We just got carried away and couldn&#8217;t stop having fun along the way.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. I can&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>‘Alma-chan, you shouldn&#8217;t agree with them!!’</p>
<p>From the communication device, Elise&#8217;s yelling and the sound of banging on the desk could be heard.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you do to make the entire examination area disappear!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I made a sword with my magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used that sword to make everything disappear.&#8221;</p>
<p>‘Don&#8217;t let the two nonstandard people harmonize in a weird way!! I need to report this to the country and other relevant parties, you know!? If I submit it like this, I&#8217;ll be scolded and told to investigate and report in detaaaiilllllll…!!’</p>
<p>Elise&#8217;s voice turned to tears as she listened to Reid and Elria’s explanation. For a little girl, she worries a lot.</p>
<p>‘So, Alma-chan&#8230; What about the investigation report on the reinforcements you sent…?’</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s nothing left as if it never existed, but I think some fragments might remain. After all, it was a magical beast that even my magic would only be half as effective.&#8221;</p>
<p>While saying that, Alma&#8217;s expression changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve also gathered testimonies from the students who encountered it and confirmed that almost all magic is reflected or nullified. And when I tried to use magic, not only the surrounding land but also the magic power of the mages fluctuated. We also confirmed a phenomenon where magic became unstable.&#8221;</p>
<p>‘In other words… does that mean they had all possible measures against magic?’</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that simple. Even my <strong>&lt;&lt;Undead Brigade&gt;&gt;</strong> was slowed down by the magical beast’s influence and was easily crushed due to its reduced magic power.&#8221;</p>
<p>‘&#8230;I see. If even tenth tier magic was inhibited, it doesn&#8217;t seem like an optimistic situation. Let’s call back the reinforcements and send a specialized investigation team instead.’</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. We&#8217;ll talk to the students again.&#8221;</p>
<p>After ending the communication, Alma called out to Faregh, who was waiting nearby.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you actually fought against the magical beast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes. During our search, we encountered an unknown magical beast. Valk and Lucas, who were protecting me, were injured. We then determined that it was a dragon-type magical beast from its appearance. So, we walked in the Horwakka grass, where it grew in clusters to mask our scent, burned some of the trees to avoid thermal detection, and fled to the cave with the two of them to wait for rescue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. You made the best judgment in a dangerous situation. Well done.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a snickering laugh, Alma patted Faregh&#8217;s shoulder firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;For now, there&#8217;s a temporary resting place over there, so go get some rest. Don&#8217;t worry. This time, the evaluation for the examination won&#8217;t count for everyone. However&#8230; don&#8217;t talk about this incident to anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alma also looked at Millis and Wiesel, who were present, and scratched her head with a troubled expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, we were dealing with the magical beasts in the ‘designated danger zone’ the day before, and we had teaching staff monitoring the examination closely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; so you&#8217;re saying they appeared out of nowhere despite being monitored?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. To be honest, we can&#8217;t rule out the possibility of a hole in our monitoring system. That&#8217;s why we need to investigate carefully, considering various possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to Millis’s question, Alma&#8217;s words were vague, and the reason could be easily imagined.</p>
<p>The academy had investigated the ‘designated danger zone’ in advance, and even on the day of the examination, they had personnel in place… yet they allowed several large magical beasts to enter.</p>
<p>If it was not an accident… there was a possibility that a third party or someone from the academy had brought in the large magical beasts. And if they include diplomatic relations, even students could be considered suspects.</p>
<p>That was why Alma must have insisted on keeping it confidential, thinking that an investigation in this area was necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not only students in our class but the other classes have also witnessed it, so I just want to ask you not to spread it to outsiders until the investigation is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>After saying that, Alma let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Other than Reid and Elria, who are kneeling, must stay. The rest of you can leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re just students. Can&#8217;t you let us go, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want something salty for dinner tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You two are so noisy. Just come over here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alma dragged the two of them by the scruff of their necks and took them away to a secluded place. Then, she brought up the topic.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, Your Excellency. Is it okay to give Elria-chan some information, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s fine. Elria might even know more about the ‘Armament Dragon’ than I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; it was difficult to deal with even in the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>However, Alma&#8217;s reaction was different from what they expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;So, that magical beast is called the ‘Armament Dragon’.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that mean you have never heard of that magical beast before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. At least I&#8217;ve never fought against a ‘magical beast that affects magic’. Besides, it&#8217;s a problem that not only I but also the Welminan’s child didn&#8217;t know about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it&#8230; wasn&#8217;t that boy&#8217;s family related to magical beasts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. The Welminan family has made achievements by subjugating magical beasts. They not only collect information and ecology about the magical beasts they have subjugated, but also about the magical beasts in various places. And yet, the child of such a family said he didn&#8217;t know about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible that the child didn&#8217;t have enough knowledge?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That child&#8217;s handling of the dragon-type magical beast&#8217;s nature and habits was correct. If it wasn&#8217;t for that, he wouldn&#8217;t have been able to escape with two injured people and would have been killed before they even got to the cave.&#8221;</p>
<p>After correctly evaluating Faregh&#8217;s ability, Alma turned her gaze to Elria.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; from what I have heard from His Excellency, if it were true, maybe it would be better to use honorifics, but&#8230; it&#8217;s a hassle to be honest, so can I just talk to you normally?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;d be happier if you used ‘-chan’.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then, Elria-chan. What exactly is that magical beast?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The natural habitat of the Armament Dragon is mountainous areas and valleys, especially places where mineral deposits can be extracted. It is a dragon-type magical beast that forms a unique outer shell by consuming minerals, which are their main source of food. However… if they formed an outer shell powerful enough to neutralize magic, it&#8217;s highly likely that they were given magical minerals artificially.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s definitely not something from the current era, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria nodded, and Alma&#8217;s expression became serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case… it becomes even more confusing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alma then began to speak softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I specialize in the history of magic, so I&#8217;ve heard of the existence of a ‘magical beast that affects magic’ before. However, none of them have survived to this day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;None of them survived?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They were thoroughly hunted down. As long as magic is prevalent, any creature that can affect magic is considered a threat above all else. Even those that have become mutated beasts were completely exterminated&#8230; It happened hundreds of years ago, and public records confirm that they have been completely wiped out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― Such a magical beast should not exist in the present day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alma asserted.</p>
