<h3>Chapter 4: Big Accident at Cosmoland</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under clear skies, Shirasawa-san and I arrived at the front entrance gate of Cosmoland.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stood in line to buy our tickets. Since the tickets included free fast-passes along with it, its base cost was quite expensive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The purpose of coming here was to check up on Kohaku, however&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we go have some fun as well since we’re already here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nijino-kun, do you want to have some fun here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rather than the notion of wanting to have fun here, if we don’t have fun here, it’d be a complete waste of money. Of course, I know very well that the surveillance of Shirasawa-sensei happens to be the main priority.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many participants had been playing and having fun at the themed park since 10:00 a.m.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to Shirasawa-san, at noon there would be a 30-minute lunch break and afterward, the students were supposed to meet near the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, students would be free to do whatever they wanted. Students who wanted to go home could also be on their way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, even the teachers were allowed to disband their respective duties and have some free time to themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter when Kohaku was planning to leave, she would have to spend at least an hour in the park.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if we didn’t wait near the stage after finishing lunch, it would be difficult to find out who her sister&#8217;s boyfriend was &#8212;Or so Shirasawa-san was probably thinking right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, if I contacted her, she would definitely tell me where she was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I remembered telling Kohaku in advance to make sure she put up a show that she was having plenty of fun to clear any of her sister&#8217;s doubts of anything whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku should also be able to pull the wool over her sister&#8217;s suspicions for the time being if she acted in a way that made it seem like she really didn’t need to have a man in her life and therefore, didn’t have one in her life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, since there were still thirty minutes left until noon, we could still enjoy ourselves lightly and then head to the stage. We could definitely make it in time&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So what do you think? Want to enjoy ourselves?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeap, let&#8217;s do that. The thing is, I also thought I might as well enjoy myself at this place since I’m already here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she had brought me here for the sole purpose of keeping an eye on her sister, she must’ve found it difficult to enjoy herself until now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What kind of rides do you like, Nijino-kun?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I guess the ones that make you want to scream. Ah, but you can go ahead and choose the one you like Shirasawa-san. I&#8217;m basically the type of person who can enjoy basically anything.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must be bad with the scream-o types of rides. Looking at her face going cloudy after I stated my preferences, I decided to add this tidbit at the end, &#8220;I like the planetarium.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Planetarium? Was there even such a thing here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san made a surprised face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? You don&#8217;t know? If you come to Cosmoland and don&#8217;t get the chance to see the planetarium, you&#8217;re already missing out on most of the experience.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is it really all that great?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s really amazing. Cosmoland puts a lot of effort into its planetarium just because it&#8217;s a space-themed park. Take it from me, it&#8217;s a real beauty. When I came for the welcome excursion, it was to the degree that I forgot to go to the stage at that time.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is it that beautiful? If that’s so, then I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, you’ll be sure to love it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because she found stars fascinating, Shirasawa-san had such an excited face while passing through the entrance gate with me, so much so that she was skipping as we were heading in the direction of the planetarium. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because it was a Sunday, the park was quite busy. Couples that were university students and families with small children were all over the place, however, there were no groups with school uniforms among them. Were they heading for the stage already?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What should we do? Should we wait near the stage first?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why don&#8217;t we have our lunch before that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good idea. Let&#8217;s eat before the store gets crowded.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No&#8230; Actually, I made a bento. Of course, if Nijino-kun wants to eat at the shop, I won&#8217;t argue&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bento is good. Thank you for taking the trouble to make it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing that the bento box she had made for today wouldn&#8217;t be going to waste, Shirasawa-san made a rather relaxed expression after that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. Ah, but I can&#8217;t guarantee the taste. Unlike my sister, I&#8217;m not such a good cook.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don’t worry, I won&#8217;t compare you with Shirasawa-sensei. I soo want to eat Shirasawa-san&#8217;s home cooking as soon as possible.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really, please don&#8217;t get your hopes up, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heading to the lawn square with Shirasawa-san, we sat down among the other children and couples also enjoying their lunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please do tell me if your stomach starts hurting. I&#8217;ve brought stomach medicine with me as well just in case.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could tell she didn’t have much confidence in her cooking skills when she prefaced with that and then took out a lunch box from her bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first tier was packed with rice balls, and the second tier was packed with wiener sausages and grilled eggs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By all appearances, it was a normal bento.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to put it bluntly, I was just a little worried about the sloppy arrangement and the fact that there were only two side dishes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I could only make this much properly.&#8221; Probably reading up what was going through my mind right then, Shirasawa-san started apologizing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, no, wieners and grilled eggs are the king of side dishes, right? With these two items here, it&#8217;s more than enough! Can I dig in already?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, yeah, sure, go ahead&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Shirasawa-san looked at me anxiously, I bit into my first rice ball.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my head, I was thinking that maybe she could’ve mistaken sugar for salt, but it was just a regular rice ball.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, one of the ingredients was mentaiko. It was my favorite. With that being said, I didn&#8217;t think that the combination of salty rice balls and salty mentaiko was too salty, but the tamagoyaki was super sweet. At the same time, I thought it was well-balanced.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; How is it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s really delicious! Shirasawa-san, perhaps you have a talent for cooking, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oops. Maybe I exaggerated the praise a little too much. It would’ve been better if I had just praised her normally, perhaps&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was worried that I sounded like I was putting up an act right there, but Shirasawa-san&#8217;s face lit up right after hearing that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s my first time hearing someone compliment me on my cooking. You comforted me on the phone the other day as well&#8230; Nijino-kun, you&#8217;re really kind. You were quite popular at your previous school, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me?! Popular?! That&#8217;s absolutely not true at all! Let alone be popular, I don&#8217;t even have any friends!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was me, in complete denial right then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Love banners were too dangerous. I had to somehow get off-topic. Otherwise, if she started to dig deep, she would start to take notice of my ex-girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Shirasawa-san, who had the qualities of a detective, found out about that, she could easily find out the true identity of her sister&#8217;s ex-boyfriend on her own.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so on, I was somehow feeling anxious, when――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nijino-kun, you don&#8217;t have any friends, huh? Then I&#8217;ll be your friend.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had just landed in an unexpected spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shirasawa-san, you want to be my friend?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, what? Do you have any objections?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t, no, I don&#8217;t! I&#8217;ll be glad to have you as my friend!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They weren&#8217;t words with lies or double meanings, rather they were the complete truth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I&#8217;ve spent half a year at this school and had no friends. If I went on like this, I’d end up living a lonely school life and would have to resign to the fate of graduating as a loner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that we have become friends, shall we call each other by our first name from now on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That will be nice. From now on, I&#8217;ll call you Mashiro-san.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You went and called me like that so readily. I thought you would be a little more shy. Nijino-kun&#8230; no, Touma-kun, aren&#8217;t you used to hanging out with girls?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me? Being used to girls!? Impossible! It can never be! Mashiro-san is my first female friend! Rather, I feel hungry right now! Can I eat?!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, go ahead. You can eat as much as you like.&#8221; As I diverted the topic, Mashiro-san said that with a rather sweet smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230; Her smiling face had such a striking resemblance to Kohaku&#8217;s, that I unconsciously felt my heart leap out of my chest for a moment there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A</span><span style="font-weight: 400">fter that, having finished our lunch, we headed to the stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Many came out here, huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san started looking at the students that came out in huge numbers from the stage while I looked sideways and secretly sent a mind-link to Kohaku. &#8220;The monitoring has started. You can come out now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are the two of you doing together?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「「……!」」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a voice called out from behind us and we trembled in fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, Akari was standing there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she call out to me when Mashiro-san was here?! I remembered sending a warning message to Akari yesterday too though!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me, are you both on a date? I have to say that&#8217;s youth for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may look like a date from the outside, but the real purpose was to monitor Kohaku.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should’ve told Akari about that as well, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not a date, all right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I just wanted to hang out at Cosmoland for the first time in a long time, but I heard that there were people who picked up women here, so I asked Touma-kun to join me here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari&#8217;s eyebrows twitched upon hearing that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Heh, is that so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared straight at Mashiro-san with a slit for eyes. Those eyes had the same glaring looks that she always gave Kohaku. It couldn’t be, was this girl really jealous of Mashiro-san over here?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a lot of hitting on women, huh? This is the first time I’m hearing of this. If that’s really so, can I also accompany you guys here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that strange?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s strange about it at all?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normally, teachers don’t join students who have come to play. However, Akamine-sensei was about to go out with Touma-kun yesterday too… I can&#8217;t help but wonder if the two of you have a special relationship?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you doing, Akari?! You&#8217;re already getting her really suspicious of us!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As you put it correctly, Touma and I don’t have a normal teacher-and-student relationship.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of deceiving her, she straight up admitted that I was in a special relationship with her. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Please don&#8217;t go and expose that you were my ex-girlfriend&#8230;</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What kind of relationship do you have?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Relatives. He’s my cousin.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, so that&#8217;s it.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Certainly, it wouldn&#8217;t appear strange if we told Mashior-san we were related.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, even if she was witnessed entering my room, there would be no suspicion of dating whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have revealed this to Mashiro-san so that she could get closer to me before Kohaku made things impossible for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, the problem was whether Mashiro-san would believe her story in the first place though&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, that&#8217;s what it was.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was good. It really seemed like she believed her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was more credible than her revealing the story that Akari and I used to date. There was a five-year age difference, and on top of that, we were the beauty and the beast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I kept it a secret from you for this long.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s a given. Ordinarily, I wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone either. If the students knew about it, there would be people who would try to find out your contact information as well. Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t tell anyone, so —&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san suddenly fell silent. Following her gaze, I saw Kohaku had just emerged from the stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Would you like to play over there together?&#8221; Mashiro-san said. Even though she readily accepted Akari joining us, she didn’t bother to reveal her original purpose to Akari.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it was a perfectly natural decision. Mashiro-san was here to keep an eye on Kohaku. If too many people knew about it, our mission might be exposed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I and Akari, of course, knowing about the situation, nodded our heads, keeping a distance of about 50 meters, and chased after Kohaku――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You must be kidding…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san&#8217;s face twitched as blood pooled into her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a matter of fact, it was indeed not the sight of Kohaku meeting up with a man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What Mashiro-san saw was Kohaku lining up in a queue &#8212; Kohaku was waiting in line to get on a Jet roller coaster.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if my prediction was correct, as it turned out, Mashiro-san had an extremely hard time with hardcore rides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And since I had noticed that about her already, there was no way that her very older sister Kohaku wouldn&#8217;t notice that either.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;re supposed to prove your innocence, so why are you trying to fend off Mashiro-san&#8217;s pursuit even more?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you want to do? Take a break on the bench?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, no. I-I&#8217;ll ride the roller coaster as well.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t overdo it. Mashiro-san, you&#8217;re not so good with rides that are too intense, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-How did you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anyone can tell by just looking at your face. Come on, let&#8217;s sit down on the bench over there.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san looked confusedly at the bench and shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to ride that roller coaster. I might meet the man she’s going out with on that very ride and might even come across her boyfriend while waiting in line,” Mashiro-san said in a low voice so as not to be heard by Akari.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, our goal today was surveillance. It didn’t matter if our eyes weren’t always trained on our target. In order to prove Kohaku&#8217;s innocence, I was willing to allow Mashiro-san to continue with her monitoring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, let&#8217;s go on the ride as well then.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stood in line, and about five minutes later, it was our turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku was sitting in the front row of the coaster, and we were sitting in the last row of the coaster and there were empty seats in front of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, one car had only room for two, and an aunt was already sitting in the empty seat that was in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, where will you sit in the ride?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll sit in the front. If I don&#8217;t ride close enough to her, I won&#8217;t be able to know properly.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please excuse me for sitting next to you,” Mashiro-san said to the aunt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ara~ Ara~, how very polite of you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san sat down next to the aunt. Akari and I sat behind her and lowered the safety bar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, Akari put her hand on my thigh. It appeared she was in the mood to flirt with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-Its really bad here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much the backrest served as a blindfold, it was still not a good idea to do something erotic in a place like this. If Mashiro-san for some reason turned around, we would be caught immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We wouldn’t even be able to use our excuse of being related.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Heh?! Is something wrong!? Is the safety bar actually unsafe?!&#8221; Mashiro started panicking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No, it&#8217;s not that. I didn&#8217;t mean it in that way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, is that so? Then it isn&#8217;t bad?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not bad at all. I&#8217;ve never heard of an accident occurring on a roller coaster. Let&#8217;s enjoy it without worrying too much about it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Sawa Ssawa.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was different, I tell you! I didn&#8217;t tell her because Akari was right next to me! It was definitely not due to the fact that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to enjoy naughty things with a peace of mind without warning her in advance!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if I raised my voice, Mashiro would immediately start becoming suspicious of me. I tried to urge Akari to stop with my gaze. However, Akari just stared straight into my eyes and went on to caress and feel my thighs from above my pants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slid her hand up and down, rubbing the portion just around my pri&#8212;es, but absolutely not coming into contact with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like she was trying to make me uncomfortable and h&#8212;-y for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In all honesty, I actually began feeling lewd at this moment. Was this some kind of a suspension bridge effect?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her soft and light touch around my pri&#8212;-es made me even ho&#8211;ier than usual as my son started to fidget.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pururururururu――!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, as the buzzer sounded, I suddenly returned to my senses.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, no.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was right about to accept what Akari was doing as a matter of fact when I caught myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I must keep my will strong intact!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the rolller coaster moved up the rail with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Katan-Katan </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">noises. Mashiro started to voice out the preludes to her screams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uu&#8211;uugh. I&#8211;I&#8217;m scared&#8230; I feel&#8212; really scared&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is this something really all that scary?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The aunt sitting next to Mashiro-san started a gentle conversation with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry. I was being noisy, wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry too much about it. If you&#8217;re that scared, then this Auntie over here can hold your hand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, thank you very much…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because she was holding hands with the kind aunt, Mashiro-san&#8217;s trembling subsided.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Chu (kissing sound).</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with that, suddenly, a hot feeling burst from my cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari had just kissed me on the cheeks! Startled by that, I quietly retorted, &#8220;What the h&#8212;k are you doing?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I said that, Akari responded by making a sweet kissing face.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Super erotic&#8230;</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">T-This face was definitely foul play! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, you made me really want to kiss you!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t help myself. How about I kiss her just this once? If I do that, surely even Akari would also feel satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While praying that Mashiro-san wouldn&#8217;t turn around, I took hold of Akari&#8217;s reddened lips with my own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was entwining my tongue to her dripping wet one, Akari went on to grab my hand and guided it to her b&#8212;bs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as I was absorbed in kissing her deeply while massaging her b*****s softly, Akari&#8217;s hand finally went to my most sensitive area and touched it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this scene where she was rubbing my vertically upright zipper by its vertical length and my head was being engulfed and driven into almost crazy excitement &#8212;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The coaster fell.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">OUCH!, it hurts, it hurts! The place where she grabbed was completely wrong!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was definitely not the safety bar!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must’ve done this out of a reflex.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari immediately let go of her hand which was holding the muscle tissue beneath my abdomen, but the pain caused by that sudden strength did not leave me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was desperately holding on to my consciousness due to the incredible pain, the coaster swooped down and twisted left and right, repeatedly ascending and descending, and reached the finish line in no time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s finally over&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought I was going to die&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Were you scared too, Touma-kun…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In a sense, I felt a good amount of terror, but trust me&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so&#8230; I guess we share similar feelings&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san got off the coaster accompanied with messy hair and a pale face, and stumbled her way in the direction of the exit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at her stumbling her way forward made me feel quite bad, so I helped guide her to a bench so that she could have a seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s rest here for a while.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No, we can&#8217;t&#8230; It&#8217;s not time to take a break yet. If we&#8217;re not on the move&#8230; we have to go&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Mashiro-san, your face looks really pale.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-If I stay here&#8230; I&#8217;ll lose sight of her&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Just rest for the time being please.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was trying to persuade Mashiro, I heard from behind me, &#8220;Mashiro-chan, what are you doing here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku spoke to her with a nonchalant face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro looked away awkwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;For some reason, I felt like I wanted to hang out at Cosmoland. But when I heard about cases of people hitting on single girls, I invited Touma-kun to come along with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So that&#8217;s how it is. By the way&#8230; you look really sick, are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I feel nauseous&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surveillance was suspended now that Kohaku had caught us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku honestly expressed her feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Akamine-sensei, can I ask you to take care of my sister?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much. I’m really sorry about this Mashiro-chan, I have some places I need to go to now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, uh. I understand. Have a nice day.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being seen off by Mashiro-san, Kohaku immediately ran away. Following that, Mashiro-san whispered in my ear, &#8220;Just in case, try tailing Onee-chan.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head, entrusted Mashiro-san&#8217;s care to Akari, and chased after Kohaku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found Kohaku sitting and waiting on another bench.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she saw me coming, she stood up and welcomed me with a big wide smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, you came at last.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mashiro-san asked me to monitor you. &#8230; I guess you were waiting for my arrival after that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh. That’s because I wanted to go on a date with Touma-kun.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m happy about your feelings, but if we go on a date in a place like this, the students will see it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was spending time with Akari until a while ago, but as I was with Mashiro-san before, even if some students did see me, it wouldn’t occur to them that I was currently on a date with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, it was just the two of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to protect Kohaku&#8217;s position in society, I couldn’t allow the students to see the two of us spending time alone together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we were going on a date, we’d have to move to a place where there weren’t that many people around――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over there.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pointed at the Ferris wheel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was the Ferris wheel, I wouldn’t have to worry about getting caught even if we had plans to flirt inside it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I somehow managed to satisfy Kohaku with my flirting, her desire for a date should as well be satisfied, and then she should act in a way that Mashiro-san wouldn’t suspect us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We stood in line to get in the gondola. And as soon as we were alone in that enclosed space, Kohaku wrapped her thin arms around me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When we do this, it kind of reminds you of our previous dates, doesn’t it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess it was around two months after we started dating that we went on a date outside of our homes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was worried about where to take Kohaku on a date to make her happy, and as a result of such heavy contemplation, I decided to take her out to this very Cosmoland.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By that time, we were kissing every time we met, but&#8230; it was my first time going on a date with a lot of people around us, and because of that, I wasn&#8217;t able to flirt as much as my heart desired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I had fun with Kohaku on our date at the park that time, who got embarrassed simply from holding hands, we decided to ride the Ferris wheel to conclude our date that day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right then, when I saw Kohaku shyly saying, &#8220;We&#8217;re finally alone, aren&#8217;t we,&#8221; my heart tightened up and I frantically kissed her dead on the lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku’s face had turned a beet red&#8230; however, she didn&#8217;t look offended, so we kept on s&#8212;-king our lips and to&#8212;ues together till the gates of the gondola opened again after completing a full circle.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Ferris wheel was a place filled with an incessant number of memories between me and Kohaku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It feels like it&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve at last got to be alone with Touma-kun.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, since Akari is always there after all.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, but today I won&#8217;t be disturbed by Akamine-sensei. Akamine-sensei will be busy taking care of Mashiro-chan. And I have already gone and had a discussion with her beforehand as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Discussion?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, she nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We shared an agreement that if she lets me go on a date with Touma-kun today, I won’t seduce him for the rest of this week.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, after making that promise before, she went and kissed me on the roller coaster&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Didn&#8217;t she just take away the best part already beforehand?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, I was going to get Mashiro-chan to go on the roller coaster, and then call Akamine-sensei over here. I never imagined that she was together with you. Tell me, did you share a hidden kiss with her on that ride?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I ca&#8211;n&#8217;t even possibly do that. Mashiro-san was with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. … By the way, you&#8217;ve been calling Mashiro-chan by her first name. Did something happen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We became friends.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Please treat her well only as a friend, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I had just been stabbed by a nail.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know that already.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing all was very well and fine, she smiled and stared at me as if begging me to begin. It was pretty obvious what she wanted me to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gondola was already near the top. Even if we kissed here, we wouldn’t get found out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I kissed Kohaku. Even though I said a kiss, it was just a light kiss with only our lips touching one another’s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; ~Please, ~do me more?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I moved my lips away, she again begged me in a sweet voice. I kissed her yet again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mmmm&#8230; ~I want to do it more, ~mm&#8230;~mo~re.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While repeating short kisses, her eagerness reminded me of that time when I went on the amusement park date with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My love for her spread in my heart and I started to have the desire to love Kohaku even more than ever before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I placed my hands inside her clothes, groped her b*****s, slipped past her brasserie, and went to rub them directly &#8212; Kohaku&#8217;s body jolted as if an electric current was passing through her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Our lips separated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-As I thought, this is no good after all&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;S-Sorry. I guess I went too fast on wr–ging your br&#8212;-ts.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. That’s not what I mean.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Kohaku shook her head sideways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then muttered to herself as if she was trying to repent from her own actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I made Mashiro-chan go through a bad experience&#8230; Just to go on a date with Touma-kun, I sacrificed my own little sister to mental exhaustion&#8230; I’m disqualified as her Onee-chan&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, so that was what it was&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san rode the roller coaster of her own free will. There was no need for Kohaku to feel responsible for her actions, I thought to myself.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-17462" src="https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Volume-2-Chapter-1.jpeg?resize=374%2C522&#038;ssl=1" alt width="374" height="522" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Volume-2-Chapter-1.jpeg?resize=215%2C300&amp;ssl=1 215w, https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Volume-2-Chapter-1.jpeg?resize=75%2C106&amp;ssl=1 75w, https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Volume-2-Chapter-1.jpeg?w=674&amp;ssl=1 674w" sizes="(max-width: 374px) 100vw, 374px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230; it was true that she devised a strategy to make Mashiro-san mentally exhausted, and it was also true that she had come up with the plan with an ulterior motive in mind. At the same time, it wasn’t her fault and she shouldn’t feel responsible or guilty for what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, no one could really enjoy a date when you were shrouded in a dark mood. Dates should be fun and not depressing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go on another date later.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… You’ll go on a date with me again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that obvious? I can&#8217;t calm down if it&#8217;s nearby, so let&#8217;s go have fun at a place far away next time!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that in a light tone and with a smile on my face, Kohaku became cheerful again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m looking forward to it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m also looking forward to it as well!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gondola arrived on the ground and we smiled at one another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then we decided to act normal as we returned to where the others were.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari and Mashiro-san were in the same place as before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But unlike before, things looked quite different there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at them, they seemed to be sitting on a bench and arguing with men on both sides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looked like two young men were gesticulating and giving impassioned speeches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To which Akari just went on listening with a grim face and Mashiro-san shrugged with some anxiety on her part. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn’t seem like they were asking for directions…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; these guys are definitely trying to hit on them, right?” Kohaku asked anxiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, it seems that way. Wait a minute, I&#8217;ll chase them away in a bit.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Won&#8217;t it lead to a fight&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, I&#8217;ll make sure to settle this peacefully.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guys, who hitted on girls, usually took action according to the number of their target’s party. As it were, failure was a rather normal occurrence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if she tried to hold back and refuse, the moment he found out that there were men accompanying her, he should definitely be on his way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just in case—</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;ll be troublesome if you also got entangled in this. So, Kohaku, wait here, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, uh. Please be really careful&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being seen off by a worried Kohaku, I ran to the two of them before things got out of hand.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my distance from the two grew lesser, the conversation that was taking place became clearer and clearer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come on already, let&#8217;s have some fun together!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We’ll definitely not let the two of you get bored!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn, so persistent. Scrap away.&#8221; Akari told them to back off with a really scary face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But those brazen men didn&#8217;t show any signs of backing down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You already have such a beautiful face! Don&#8217;t make it uglier with such a scary expression!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;ll make you smile!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari and Mashiro were two super cute girls. I didn’t think those men would just give up on them anytime soon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That being said, if they found out that they were already accompanied by a man, they should definitely stop their pursuit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sorry, I made you both wait!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> When I rushed over to the two of them, the two men glared daggers at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Who the *&#8211;k are you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Right now we&#8217;re talking to them. Find someone else.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a pretty strong comeback they had there. This guy here was ten centimeters shorter than me and his body was lanky&#8230;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Does he feel powerful just because for me it&#8217;s two-on-one with the odds in his favor?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I was in elementary school, my body&#8217;s development was usually bigger than the other kids. It was because of this that my upperclassmen often always had their eyes on me.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also not just once or twice that I was in a quarrel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was already used to fighting and I didn’t think I would lose to these guys&#8230; but then, I got to thinking that starting a fight outside of school might not be a bad thing after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, it would be really bad if I played this scene poorly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If showed him an ounce of fear, it would actually make things even worse than it was already.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey pu&#8211;k, are you already scared?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t just keep your mouth shut, why don’t you say something already?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That made me feel better in an instant.</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> If that was what you were asking for, then I’ll take you up on your offer as well!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The ones you s&#8212;ts are hitting on right now are my friends! Word of warning: Don&#8217;t start hitting on the first girls you see! They might be someone else’s friends!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I fell into my stance suddenly, the two of them visibly flinched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I glared at them threateningly, they averted their eyes like they were scared ―― but suddenly the color of their eyes changed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following what their eyes were latching onto, I saw that they had spotted Kohaku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey look! What a hot beauty! Let’s just drop this, let&#8217;s go over there instead!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It really can&#8217;t be helped, huh? Hey, lad, we&#8217;ll go over there then. Be grateful!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the two arrogantly yelled those words and were on their way to head over to where Kohaku was standing, all of a sudden…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please stop already!&#8221; Mashiro-san shouted with a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The duo stopped and glared back in Mashiro-san’s direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Different from the grinning stare they were giving Akari just mere moments ago, it was now a stare full of hostility.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You have nothing to do with it! Don&#8217;t stand in our way!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I have everything to do with that! Si&#8211;since she’s my Onee-chan!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she raised her voice timidly and shakingly, they both instead burst out laughing and they looked at Mashiro-san as if she was crazy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t lie. You both don&#8217;t look alike at all.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re only interested in cute girls. We weren&#8217;t even trying to hit on you in the first place. Just go play with your lonely self somewhere.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8212;-uk&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears welled up in Mashiro-san&#8217;s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt something break inside me right then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All feelings of forgiveness fled from my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t act smart shi&#8211;eads! Retract this moment! Else I’ll make you see stars!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah!? What&#8217;s this? What&#8217;s wrong with telling a person who&#8217;s not cute that they’re not cute to their faces?!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are those eyeballs rotten?! Isn&#8217;t she really cute?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The *&#8212;k!? Don&#8217;t pretend to be cool just because you&#8217;re in front of a woman!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think I won’t hit you?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since he tried to grab me by my collar and raised his fist, I gave him a good headbutt as a return gift. Immediately, the man fell on his buttocks, held his forehead, and let out a painful groan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Damn that hurts&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;B&#8211;bast&#8212;d! What do you think you are about, *&#8212;k!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when the other guy was about to throw up his arms to try and punch me…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you over there, what are you doing?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An old man in a suit came running over to where we were all collected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Freaks! Isn&#8217;t he the vice principal? Hey, come on, let&#8217;s get out of here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if they were familiar with each other, since right when the vice-principal showed his face, the two ran away in such a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My instincts kicked in and I also felt like running away as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if they were school officials, students could make excuses and say that everything was fine but to get found out by the vice-principal was really the worst-case scenario.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vice principal continued to stare at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re&#8230; Nijino, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8211;wa. Y-Yes, it&#8217;s Nijino&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even though it&#8217;s only been half a year since you transferred schools, what the he&#8211;k are you up to right now&#8230;&#8221; the vice principal said with an astonished face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I transferred schools, I had an interview with the vice principal directly face-to-face, so it looked like he remembered who I was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vice principal let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even though you&#8217;re already a problem inside the school, if you cause a fight outside the school as well&#8230; you can&#8217;t complain even if you end up getting expelled.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please wait!&#8221; Akari raised her voice in protest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He didn&#8217;t take part in any fight! He was only defending us!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s exactly like Akamine-sensei says! He&#8217;s not being bad at all!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku rushed over and joined in on my defense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even so, violence is violence. This must be reported to the principal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the evening, I was lying in bed, feeling depressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was either on the brink of expulsion or suspension, so it was really hard for me. I honestly felt like bursting into tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of Mashiro-san, I somehow pretended that I didn&#8217;t care much about it, but as soon as I was alone, my heart sank sorrowfully in my chest and I had been in a depressed mood for a long time now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I searched for 『High School Violence Innocent person getting Lucky』 on the Internet hoping for some salvation. However, I couldn&#8217;t find even a single case where the person who got themselves involved escaped punishment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, in that midst of misfortune, I found out that the majority of students were suspended from school and there were only a few cases where they were expelled&#8230; However, it wasn’t much of a consolation for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I got lucky enough and ended up with just a suspension, the way the people around me would look at me would immediately change. I would become even more alienated than I already was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mashiro-san told me that, but it would be a problem if people started disassociating from her too just because she was friends with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was happy that she was my friend, but I couldn’t let any friend of mine get involved in my mess&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of problems, there was one more right there. I still needed to think of a way to explain to my parents later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My father and mother both work abroad, but still, it&#8217;s not like they won&#8217;t be back indefinitely. Even if I tried to hide it for some time, it would eventually be found out by them later on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though they had a laissez-faire policy toward me, they wouldn’t just pass it up if I was expelled one day. They might get angry and even feel disappointed in me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was afraid to even think about their reactions right now&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haa&#8211;ah&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the nth big sigh that came out of me today. I was feeling more and more gloomy now as my stomach growled. Should I make some to eat with what I have in the fridge and fill my stomach now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I decided to do so, I received a message from Akari.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Are you home right now?】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【I&#8217;m there.】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">【Please come to my house right now.】</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much she liked me, I didn’t think she would tempt me erotically at this point in time. I had a feeling she must be worried about me and trying to do her best to console me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t let Akari continue to worry about me. I had to show her that I was in good physical and mental health to reassure her!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the house and visited the room next door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I pressed the intercom, Akari immediately showed up at the door. Just as I thought, she had quite a serious look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed Akari to the living room. That was when I saw that Kohaku was there also. She was sitting on the sofa, with a worried look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want to see my ex-girlfriends’ pained faces. If I showed my depressed face right now to them, it would make them feel even more uneasy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was affected by what happened, but right now, I had to pretend that I didn’t mind any of this at all!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s quite rare for the two of you to be together. Please do me a favor and don&#8217;t argue over me at this time!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told them this in a joking tone, they reacted with serious faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I won&#8217;t do something like that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I won’t cause Touma any more trouble. It’s my fault. I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why is Akari apologizing right now?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari didn&#8217;t do anything wrong. I had no idea what she was apologizing about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I had refused them more forcefully, they might have given up on hitting on us even before Touma rushed over to help…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. Akari is a beauty after all, so I don&#8217;t think that they would give up even if you had flat-out rejected them. Akari isn&#8217;t at fault over here, so please don&#8217;t make such a face.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s not Akamine-sensei&#8217;s fault. It&#8217;s me who&#8217;s at fault.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you saying right now too, Kohaku?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;They&#8217;re the ones to blame. Kohaku doesn&#8217;t need to feel responsible for anything at all.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m also responsible. If I had turned my back to you at that time, I wouldn&#8217;t have been noticed by those two of them. It was because of that that the two of them chose to come over toward me that Mashiro-chan had to ask them to stop them&#8230; And with that, Touma-kun had to&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku quickly became depressed as she said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kohaku isn&#8217;t at fault. It&#8217;s those guys and I who couldn’t handle ourselves. So we are the ones at fault.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I used my head instead of my hands, I couldn’t overrule the fact that I still resorted to violence after all.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun isn’t at fault at all! You went to protect Mashiro-chan after all! It&#8217;s all in self-defense!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Originally, I should have been the one to protect you. I&#8217;m a teacher after all, and yet&#8230; I had to have a student protect me&#8230; I&#8217;m disqualified as a teacher.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: I can&#8217;t understand&#8230; This dude is going through a really painful time right now. His career could get affected because of all this. But he had to go and reassure his ex-girlfriends, even though they were not facing any dire consequences&#8230; Moreover, they called him over in the first place. I just can&#8217;t understand why things are heading in this direction. This is just so ridiculous&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not true! Akari and Kohaku are both great teachers! That&#8217;s why you don&#8217;t need to feel responsible at all!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: And I am amazed at his patience&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite desperate efforts to soothe them, they still remain depressed. In order to liven up the mood of the room, I said in a bright tone, &#8220;Also, didn&#8217;t I tell you girls before as well? I will start treating both of you like when you were still my girlfriends. So, as your boyfriend, it&#8217;s only natural for me to protect both of you from those pick-up b******s. So you two don&#8217;t have to feel responsible at all. Besides, to tell you the truth, I don&#8217;t think dropping out of school is such a bad idea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Yeap, he’s clearly lost it.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Touma-kun, aren’t you having fun at school?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fun. I’ve also finally made some friends. However, being bound as a student I won&#8217;t be able to flirt with both of you as much as I want. If I stop being a student, I will be able to flirt as much as I want to and don’t the two of you also want to flirt with me all the time as well?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even if that&#8217;s right&#8230; If Touma gets expelled from school, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d be able to go about my day unaffected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll never allow Touma-kun to be expelled from school. From now on, I will go and drill some sense into my father at home!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m going too! Since I&#8217;m the only one who saw the whole story in close proximity!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: At last some action from his gfs&#8230;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that they both just couldn’t help but do something to help my present mess, since right now they were being tormented by heavy guilt, thinking that they were responsible for all the events that had taken place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, if I was expelled from school, the two of them might forever continue to suffer in their hearts emotionally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, I didn’t want to see them suffer. If they tried to protect me, they might end up in a bad place with the principal at that point, even though&#8230; they hadn’t done anything wrong in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if that were so, if Kohaku and Akari tried to put in a good word for me, they wouldn’t be punished for doing so in retrospect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If doing so made the two of them feel a little better at that, I would be really thankful to have their opinions being voiced out to the principal directly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this time, I said, &#8220;I&#8217;m happy that the both of you are trying to protect me in your own way, but&#8230; please do so as teachers, okay? If by any chance the principal finds out that both of you have some sort of extra connection with me, even your present positions at the school would be in danger because of that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Right now, rather than thinking about me, it&#8217;s more about thinking about Touma. If it’s okay with you, Touma, it&#8217;s okay with me even if I were to quit my job as a teacher in the end.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry about anything, Touma-kun. I&#8217;ll definitely protect you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being told this with such bravado to my face, I was really happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though, just for me, their bright life as a teacher would be tainted forev&#8212;-. Now that I think about it, it makes me really worried on the contrary&#8230; but the fact that they put their relationship with me above their profession was already so heartwarming for me when I learned of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it made me feel uneasy, but&#8230; it made me very happy at the same that they said that I was more important to them than their jobs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;m happy to be loved by the two of you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing both of them smile, I walked out of the room alongside them. And while I was being seen off by them, I left their apartment for mine.</span></p>
