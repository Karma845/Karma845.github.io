<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 1: My Ex-girlfriends Come to My House</b></h1>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oi oi oi! This is a lie, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost scream even though it&#8217;s the middle of the opening ceremony. My heart is beating fast and I&#8217;m sweating like a waterfall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The newly appointed teachers were lined up on the stage of the gymnasium. Among them are two people I know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One is a gentle-looking female teacher. She is a petite, busty beauty with soft brown hair that reaches her shoulders. She looks at her students with kind eyes and smiles like a holy mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other one is a feisty-looking female teacher. She is a tall, busty beauty with silky black hair that reaches down to her waist. Her interesting face looks straight ahead, and her lips are set in a straight line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They are my ex-girlfriends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s hard to believe that they are someone else. On top of that, the new teachers were introduced to us, and we found out their names were ‘Shirasawa Kohaku’ and ‘Akamine Akari.’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this for real? Are they really Kohaku and Akari? What’s going to happen now? I&#8217;m going to take my ex-girlfriend&#8217;s class? It’s going to be so awkward!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was freaking out,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Seeing those two again… It’s like a dream…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man sitting next to me talked to himself dreamily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two beautiful teachers had just arrived at the school, and I can understand why he would want to grin happily. But what does ‘again’ mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, do you know about Shirasawa-sensei and Akamine-sensei?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to the boy next to me, and his relaxed face scrunched up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m tall and I have an intimidatingly strong face, so I must have scared him off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it’s only my appearance that is scary, and I haven’t done anything wrong, but… It seems that no eccentric person likes to associate with someone who looks scary, so I have no friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ye-Yeah, I guess Nijino-kun doesn&#8217;t know because he&#8217;s a transfer student. They were both interns.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both came to the school last spring–about four months before I transferred here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s so lucky to have two beautiful teachers like that. Ah, by the way, I heard that neither of them has a boyfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought they had found another guy they liked. So they just like him, but they haven&#8217;t confessed to him yet? Or did they confess but it didn&#8217;t work out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this information is from a year ago. They might have a boyfriend now. I mean, it&#8217;s none of my business if they have one or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to get back together, but I can&#8217;t have a relationship between a student and a teacher–I don&#8217;t even know which one I should get back together with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there’s no reason to worry about it. I’ve been dumped anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After he finished explaining to me, he looked at Kohaku and Akari with a fascinated face again. The other students have the same look on their faces. I understand how they feel. They are both super cute and adorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was dating two such girls. As a man, I feel proud of myself. …But, I have no intention of boasting like, “Actually, I dated them! Amazing, right?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would only be a waste of time and would cause both of them a lot of confusion and embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was found out that they were dating a student, they would be looked at with a cold shoulder, and in the worst case scenario, they might have to resign from their teaching position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that their dream was to become teachers. I don’t want to be an evil influence on the two of them who have made their dreams come true. Even though we&#8217;ve broken up, I still love them both.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to ruin their bright and glorious lives as teachers. I will support Kohaku and Akari&#8217;s life as teachers from the shadows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, since we’re going to spend time at the same school, we’re bound to run into each other sooner or later. It would be awkward, so I&#8217;ll try to stay low as much as possible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was making up my mind to do so, the opening ceremony was over, and I headed back to the third grade class. Then homeroom ended, and the day came to an end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those two were as cute as ever!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait for Shirasawa-sensei&#8217;s class!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As I thought, Akamine-sensei is really cool!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I could hurt myself everyday~!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, the classroom was still buzzing with talk about the new teachers. By the way, Kohaku is a home economics teacher and Akari is a school nurse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since there’s only one home economics teacher, the students are obliged to take classes with Kohaku, and if they were injured, they would have to be examined by Akari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I can’t skip Kohaku’s classes and avoid seeing her, I can avoid going to the infirmary. I just have to be careful not to get hurt!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With these thoughts in mind, I finished getting ready to leave and went out into the hallway. Then, I see a blonde girl in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is carrying a tote bag on her shoulder, and her body is leaning forward as if it was very heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you need help carrying it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might scare her, but I didn&#8217;t want to let her go through with it. I called out to her from behind, and she turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s a girl who looks like a gal. Her school uniform is worn out and her skirt is short. She has a strong look in her eyes, but her face is quite well-defined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She glared at me with all her might. …Why the glare?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I won’t give you the contact info even if you hit on me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not hitting on anyone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course I want a girlfriend. But I&#8217;m not so hungry for love that I’d hit on girls whose names I don&#8217;t even know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even though I don&#8217;t know her name, it doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;ve never met her before. We’ve been classmates since this semester, and we’ve passed each other in the hallway a few times during our second year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Um, her name is…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you doing looking at my chest? That&#8217;s disgusting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You’re wrong! I’m just checking your nametag to make sure it&#8217;s correct.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, you&#8217;ve been talking so rudely since a while ago. You&#8217;re so aggressive… Did I do something to make you hate me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Eh? This girl, she’s Shirasawa?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She doesn&#8217;t look like Kohaku. But when we were dating, she told me she had a sister my age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve never met her sister because I never visited her house, but maybe she’s heard stories about me. Maybe that’s the reason why she’s so foul-mouthed towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shirasawa-san, are you Shirasawa-sensei&#8217;s little sister…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes became even sharper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I knew it, you approached me with that intention. You&#8217;re so persistent! Even if you hit on me, I won&#8217;t give you my Onee-chan’s contact information!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. That&#8217;s what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku is a very popular teacher. She won the hearts of first-year students just by showing her face, and apparently, she won the hearts of second and third-year students during her teaching internship. It’s not surprising that some boys tried to befriend her little sister in order to get close to Kohaku.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s often approached by men who want to get close to her sister, and she’s fed up with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not hitting on you. I just found out you’re her little sister.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re so pretentious. How could you not know after all the talk about it last year?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m a transfer student. I moved here last year after the summer break.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san blinked her eyes. With a scowl on her face,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, I see. Then, what&#8217;s the point of you calling me out?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your luggage looks heavy, so I thought I&#8217;d help you carry it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do-Does that mean you&#8217;re hitting on me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I said, I’m not hitting on you. I called you purely out of kindness. I have no ulterior motives whatsoever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, kindness, huh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A still gaze. She&#8217;s doubting me. How distrustful of men are you…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, okay. Um&#8230; Nijino-kun? If you want to help, I&#8217;ll let you help.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said this in a bossy manner, Shirasawa-san crouched down and began to rummage through her tote bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Um, I can see your cleavage pretty clearly. Also, I can see your pink underwear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s showing them off, but… She&#8217;s a girl with a lot of openings for someone who distrusts men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san then took out a cookbook from her tote bag. There were quite a few more she took out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are those from the library?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, I borrowed them during spring break. The due date is next week, but since I don&#8217;t have class today and I don&#8217;t have a lot of baggage, I decided to return them all together. Are you confident in your strength, Nijino-kun?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been well-built from a young age, and my first acquaintances always look at me as if I were three grades older than them. I am now 5&#8217;8&#8243; tall and well muscled for a go-home club member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, take these 10 books please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After handing me the books, Shirasawa-san quickly started walking. I don&#8217;t know how many books there are in total, but they still look heavy. Shirasawa-san is slender, so maybe she’s simply not strong enough to carry them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If they&#8217;re heavy, I can still carry them.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. Rather, don&#8217;t walk next to me. If we walk side by side, people will get the wrong idea that we&#8217;re dating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll get the wrong idea, but they might think we&#8217;re close. If Kohaku sees me in such a situation, she might think, ‘He’s messing with my sister.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want my ex-girlfriend to get the wrong impression of me, so I decided to take the distance as she suggested. Passing the heavy-footed Shirasawa-san, I went down the stairs and&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hyaa!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I stepped down onto the stairs, a scream echoed through the air. I turned around and saw Shirasawa-san had slipped and fallen. I quickly held her and&#8211;Thump, we landed on my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ow..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Are you okay?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stood up hurriedly and looked into my face worriedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, yeah, I&#8217;m fine… Are you injured yourself, Shirasawa-san? Did you sprain your leg?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. Thanks to Nijino-kun. …Thanks for helping me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Why are you so spaced out? Could it be, you hit your head…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No, just my back.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only reason I was in a daze is because I was surprised by Shirasawa-san&#8217;s unexpected straightforwardness. I was sure she would blame me for hugging her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let’s go to the infirmary just to be safe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I said I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, you mustn&#8217;t judge for yourself. You have to go see the nurse.&#8221; (T/N: She said ‘Sensei.’ It can mean doctor, but also Akamine-sensei.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t want to go! If I go to the infirmary, I&#8217;ll run into Akari! Though I can&#8217;t tell Shirasawa-san that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can’t be helped. I&#8217;ll go to the infirmary even if it&#8217;s awkward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll go.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went downstairs with Shirasawa-san and opened the door to the infirmary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I expected the room to be crowded with students who want to get close to Akari, but the infirmary is deserted. Well, this is the right place. They probably thought that it would be a nuisance to barge into the infirmary where there might be sick people, so they hesitated to do so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room reeks of disinfectant, and the only person in the room is Akari, a female teacher wearing a white lab coat over a pants suit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari, who’s sitting on a chair looking over papers, looked at me with slitted eyes and–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes widened in surprise and she stared at me intently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come on, get yourself checked out. I&#8217;ll wait for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san pushed my back and I went to Akari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Akari looked sad for some reason as she gazed at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who she dumped is right in front of her. Normally, people would make a disgusted or awkward face. So why does Akari have a sorrowful look on her face?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This, does this mean she still loves me by any chance–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You look like you&#8217;re about to die.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s a bad omen! That&#8217;s a very punchy greeting. This means she hates me to death, right?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? You’re going to die?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to die!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;B-But, Akamine-sensei said you were…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san is anxious, perhaps mistakenly believing that I&#8217;m dying because of her. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m dying&#8230; Akari isn&#8217;t the type of person to tell jokes, so she can&#8217;t help but believe her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You…look pale. Go to bed and rest.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san took her seriously, so Akari reiterated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Akari wants to keep me around. She wants to talk to me alone. I’m sure she wants to keep me from revealing our relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I&#8217;m seriously ill. I was full of energy when I arrived at school, but seeing my ex-girlfriends again has made me so nervous that I feel like I&#8217;m going to vomit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m really fine. I&#8217;m sure Sensei has work to do, so we’ll get going now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly told her and we left the infirmary. I kept up the pretense of the first meeting until the very end, which should&#8217;ve let her know that I have no intention of revealing our relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, are you sure you don&#8217;t need to rest?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. Maybe the lighting just makes it look like I&#8217;m sick.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Okay then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san looked relieved. I thought she was a foul-mouthed girl earlier, but she really seems to have a gentle personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking down the hallway with a better understanding of my classmates, we reached the library. The door opened and&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku came out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Whaa!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku screamed when she saw me. The book she was holding in her hands fell down, but she doesn&#8217;t seem to care, she just stares at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Onee-chan? What&#8217;s with the sudden yelling…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san followed her gaze suspiciously, and then she reached me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is my classmate, Nijino-kun. He’s helping me carry some books. He&#8217;s big and intimidating, but he&#8217;s not such a bad guy, so don&#8217;t be afraid of him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re a student of ours. Thank you for taking care of my sister! I&#8217;ll make you a pot of tea as a thank you, shall we go to the home economics room?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thank-you tea is just an excuse to be alone with me, and the real purpose is to keep my mouth shut. But I can&#8217;t be alone with Kohaku. If someone sees us talking alone, they might think we&#8217;re having an illicit relationship&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I want to drink Onee-chan’s tea too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We won&#8217;t be able to talk about the past with Shirasawa-san with us anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In return for your help, I&#8217;ll let you have some of my Onee-chan’s tea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said as if to say, &#8220;You should be honored.” In actuality, for the boys, Kohaku&#8217;s tea is truly something to drool over. It&#8217;s one of those teas that they would be willing to humble themselves to drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I want to drink it, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m good. I want to go home and do my laundry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You do your own laundry?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, yeah. I live alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Six months have passed since I moved here, and my family had to move again for work. This time, it was an overseas transfer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I&#8217;m not comfortable living abroad, I decided not to follow my parents and started living on my own this spring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know you&#8217;re tired from helping carry those books, right? If your house is far away, I can give you a ride!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. I live in an apartment nearby.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nearby… Could it be a green apartment?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, but&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s the same apartment as mine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku said excitedly. (T/N: Excitedly!!! YEAH BOIII!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seems to be somewhat pleased about it, but&#8230; That can&#8217;t be true. She just reunited with her ex-boyfriend, and on top of that, discovered they live in the same apartment building. The tension must have just gotten crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m in room 503.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t even ask her and she gave me her room number. By the way–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That’s next door…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought my ex-girlfriend would be living next door!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-How long have you lived here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s been about two weeks. I came to say hello when I moved in, but no one answered…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two weeks ago&#8230; It was the time when the whole family went to visit my grandma&#8217;s house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could hear them going about their lives, and I knew someone had moved in, but I didn&#8217;t go out much during spring break, so we never ran into each other. I can&#8217;t believe it was my ex-girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am at a loss, and Shirasawa-san sharpened her eyes at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re not thinking of going to Onee-chan’s room, are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not thinking about that. I&#8217;m just in the mood to relax at home today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then it&#8217;s okay. You helped me today. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re welcome. Then see you tomorrow. Shirasawa-sensei too… Excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bowing my head, I headed home.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I came…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku came to my house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not at all confused when I welcomed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had told her before we parted that I was ‘in the mood to relax at home.’ For those who don&#8217;t know, it means &#8216;let&#8217;s have a date at home today&#8217; for Kohaku and me. Of course, this time it means let&#8217;s talk at home, not on a date at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yeah. Sorry to bother you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this in a muffled voice, Kohaku went up to the house. I led her into the living room and sat her down in a chair opposite of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku&#8217;s eyes were downcast and she fell silent. It&#8217;s been three years since we were alone together, so it&#8217;s understandable to be nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m nervous too, but not as much as Kohaku. If I can start a conversation with her, we might be able to talk like in the old days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Still, I never thought Kohaku would show up in front of me as a teacher! I was so surprised I thought my heart was going to stop!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the time when we were dating, Kohaku had a tendency to be too sensitive to the other person&#8217;s facial expressions. When I started a conversation with her in a friendly manner to relieve her tension, her cheeks relaxed slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When I opened the door, Touma-kun was standing there. I was surprised too. Maybe the God of Love thought, ‘You two shouldn’t have broken up,’ and brought us together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, it’s impossible to get back together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yeah. I guess so… We’re teacher and student.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s part of it, and doesn’t Kohaku have someone she likes in the first place?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku twitched and shook her shoulders. She then looked at me with a downcast look on her face and seemed reluctant to say anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Actually, that was a lie. I didn’t like anyone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Is that so? So does that mean…you still like me…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ve always liked you, Touma-kun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku said with a serious expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s lying, and there&#8217;s no advantage for her to lie like this. I think it&#8217;s true that Kohaku likes me. …But,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then why did you dump me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s… Touma-kun, you like to kiss, don’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I like it, but… Don&#8217;t tell me you dumped me because I wasn’t a good kisser?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mhmm. You were a good kisser, Touma-kun. You were good at kissing from the very first time we kissed… Did you practice at home?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did! But it&#8217;s embarrassing to admit!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I nodded, because if I didn&#8217;t admit it, the conversation wouldn&#8217;t go anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun liked to kiss, but I felt sorry for him that he only got to kiss me once in a while&#8230; It would’ve been a waste to spend your precious youth in a long-distance relationship&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She thought I would’ve been happier dating a girl from the same neighborhood and backed out in tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, at the time, Kohaku used to apologize to me a lot. She apologized for going to school so far away from home. I told her not to worry about it at the time, but apparently she was very concerned about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I mean, I would miss seeing you only once in a while, but it would&#8217;ve been much better than the pain of breaking up. I really liked Kohaku. You could have at least talked to me about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re so kind, Touma-kun, I thought you&#8217;d stop me if I talked to you about it. But I should have chosen my words more carefully. I dumped you in such a terrible way… You hate me, don&#8217;t you…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How can I hate Kohaku?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku, who had been apologetically looking down, looked up as her face was flicked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Even now, do you still like me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I admitted it, Kohaku&#8217;s face lit up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was stunned by her happy smile. Kohaku is so cute when she smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So we both like each other, yes…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems so. But… We can&#8217;t get back together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because we&#8217;re teacher and student. Kohaku seems to know that it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea for us to get back together, and she looks as if she had just woken up from a happy dream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know. I&#8217;m a teacher. If the school finds out that we&#8217;re dating, even Touma-kun might get looked at with white eyes. …But I&#8217;d be happy if we can get along when it&#8217;s just the two of us, like when we used to be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to have a peaceful school life–and to protect Kohaku&#8217;s life as a teacher, it’s better to act like a stranger, even if it’s just the two of us. If anything, we shouldn’t even be alone together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I do like Kohaku. I can&#8217;t turn down a girl I like when she says, ‘I’d be happy if we can get along.’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. When we are alone, I will treat you as an ex-boyfriend, not as a student.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m happy… Thank you, Touma-kun…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her droopy eyes were filled with tears, and Kohaku beamed with happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, my stomach rumbled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you hungry, Touma-kun? I can cook for you if you want.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to put my all in it~. I&#8217;ll call you when it&#8217;s done, so just relax.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku bounced with enthusiasm and went to the kitchen. She opened the refrigerator, seemed to have decided on a menu, and immediately started cooking&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pin, pon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the doorbell rang, Kohaku stopped cooking and crouched down. She even hid her face with a frying pan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Who is it? Your parents?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She asked in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can understand why Kohaku would want to hide her face. Because I haven&#8217;t told my parents about our relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to brag to my parents that I had found a cute girlfriend, but Kohaku didn&#8217;t want that. She was also five years older than me, so I guess it would be hard for her to say proudly that we were in a relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, Kohaku has become a teacher. In her position, it’s only natural for her to hide her face. …Well, even if she hid her face, if my parents saw her like this, they would surely be suspicious of her. But I respect her determination to hide her identity.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My parents live abroad, so they won&#8217;t be back anytime soon. Maybe it&#8217;s a newspaper advertisement or something.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After reassuring her, Kohaku resumed cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The doorbell rang again. I went to the front door by myself and looked through the peephole to see what was going on outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Akari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought my heart would stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is Akari here?! How did she find out where I live?! Wait, this isn’t good! If she keeps ringing the doorbell at this rate, Kohaku will come!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides… Even if I don&#8217;t know what she wants, I can&#8217;t ignore Akari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told Kohaku that I like her, but I also like Akari. And having seen her anxiously pressing the doorbell, I can’t use the answering machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku is cooking right now, so I can handle this without her knowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Determined, I went outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Touma… You came out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari&#8217;s eyes were moist with happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably worried that I might use the answering machine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think Akari would come. How did you get my address?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I contacted Uncle. I said I wanted to play with Touma for the first time in a while so I asked him to tell me your address.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By Uncle, she means my father.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">    </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is a relative of Akari&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after I was dumped by Kohaku, I met her at a relative&#8217;s funeral service, and she comforted me when I was dragging out the sorrow of my lost love. At the time, I had no romantic feelings for her, and thought of her as nothing more than ‘a kind, relative older sister,’ but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We started to play together often, and before I knew it, we were in love with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was surprised when I heard where Touma was. I had no idea he lived next door to me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seriously?! You&#8217;re next door?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve been living next door to both of my ex-girlfriends?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The school, and the address, it&#8217;s all so coincidental…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s already amazing with one, but to be sandwiched between the two is… If I had friends, I would&#8217;ve found out about this sooner. I spent most of my spring break at home instead of going out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s fate, don’t you think? I wonder if this is the God of Love saying that ‘the two of you shouldn&#8217;t have separated.’&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…I remember hearing this line somewhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t think this is true, but–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If not, feel free to deny it. &#8230;Akari, do you like me or not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I love you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari, who affirmed without any hesitation, looked at me anxiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;What about Touma? Do you like me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well, I like you, but–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hugged me tightly. Her soft b*****s were pressed against my chest, and her delicious fragrance tickled my nostrils, making my heart beat faster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hey, I know you&#8217;re happy, but it&#8217;s not a good idea to hug me, don’t you think?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her to calm down, she released her embrace with a regretful look on her face, and with an apologetic expression on her face,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for suddenly hugging you… I thought you hated me… I never thought you still liked me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari&#8217;s eyes moistened and she smiled happily. I&#8217;m as happy as she is. But I can&#8217;t be openly happy about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I just had a similar exchange with Kohaku earlier&#8230; I have only one word in my mind, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shuraba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.’ (T/N: This means scene or place where chaos/trouble/problem is going to happen. Go*gle it for more details.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to apologize… But you see, we&#8217;re teacher and student. I like hugging Akari, but hugging each other in public isn&#8217;t good. Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean we can do whatever we want at home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hastily added.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she went into the house now, she would run into Kohaku. It would be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shuraba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> if my two ex-girlfriends, who want to reconcile with me, met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sorry Akari, but I&#8217;m going to have to ask you to leave after hearing the reason why you came to my house today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So why did you come to my house?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to apologize to you, Touma. I&#8217;m sorry for the terrible way I behaved at that time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari bowed her head deeply and I told her to look up. …Akari looked sincerely apologetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t make that face. I&#8217;m not angry. You must have had a reason for dumping me even though you liked me, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No matter what the circumstances were, it doesn&#8217;t change the fact that I hurt you. I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I said you didn&#8217;t have to apologize. Just tell me what was going on. Why did Akari lie to get me to break up with her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s because… I&#8217;m a bad woman.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bad woman? Akari?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As far as I know, Akari isn’t bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is tall, shy, has a sour face, and she once made a child cry on a date because of her tendency to blurt when she doesn&#8217;t know the person she&#8217;s talking to&#8211;At that time, she was just trying to help a lost child by calling out to him. It&#8217;s true that she scared him, but Akari was only trying to help a child in trouble. Akari scares small children because of her appearance and tone of voice, but she is really a kind woman. Thanks to Akari, I myself was able to overcome my heartbreak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was an adult, and on top of that, I was going to be a teacher, but I was dating a high school student&#8230; That is unacceptable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I&#8217;ve seen the occasional news story about a teacher who was arrested for dating a student&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If it&#8217;s a serious relationship, it&#8217;s safe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But only if people knew if it was a serious relationship or not. If it got out that we were dating, even Touma might get looked at with white eyes… That&#8217;s why I decided to break up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, she backed out for my sake in tears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if the world looks at me funny. I don&#8217;t care what anyone says about me, I&#8217;m happy just to have the woman I like by my side.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave me a big hug.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her cool appearance, Akari is a sweet and affectionate girl who loves to cuddle. I also like to hug her, so I can&#8217;t help but hug her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I would be in trouble if Kohaku saw me hugging her like this. So I gently released the embrace, and Akari stared at me sadly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I want to hug you more…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I want to hug you too, but I don&#8217;t think we should hug each other here. Don’t you know? Over there is Shirasawa-sensei’s house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know. She greeted me the day she moved in. Shirasawa-sensei seems like a very kind person, but… If she saw me hugging Touma, would she tell the principal?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Shirasawa-sensei would tell on us, but it&#8217;s better if we’re not seen. Let&#8217;s not hug each other outside.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then… Can we hug at Touma’s house?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not good. Akari seems to want to come in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can&#8217;t invite her in. Because Kohaku is–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Dinner is ready.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku appeared without warning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku and Akari looked at each other, and after a pause&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Ehh?! Akamine-sensei?! What are you doing with Nijino-kun?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shirasawa-sensei too, why are you at his house?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh no! It&#8217;s going to be a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shuraba!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I have to somehow cover this up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually, I met Shirasawa-sensei by chance at the entrance! And since we live in the same apartment building, she decided to treat me to dinner! Isn&#8217;t that right, Sensei?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-That&#8217;s right! I&#8217;m a home economics teacher. It&#8217;s my duty to take care of my students&#8217; nutrition! Akamine-sensei too, why are you here? It was Akamine-sensei who rang the doorbell earlier, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Akamine-sensei came to provide on-site counseling for me! I was very anxious about fitting in with my new class… When I met with Akamine-sensei at the infirmary, she recognized my anxiety, and we decided to have counseling together since we live in the same apartment building. Isn&#8217;t that right, Sensei?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As he says.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Leave the rest to me, Akamine-sensei, and you can go home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t do that. Counseling is the duty of a school nurse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Does the counseling have to be today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Otherwise, there&#8217;s a risk that it will interfere with his ability to attend school tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But he says he doesn&#8217;t need counseling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think he did.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he did.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them are speaking on my behalf. Neither of them wants to leave my side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s not stand around and talk. Why don&#8217;t you two come inside?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Kohaku and Akari are supposed to act as teachers in public. They should be able to handle themselves so that my relationship with them will not be revealed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my suggestion, they nodded and entered the house.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku made fried pork with ginger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was served with a rich sauce for my preference for strong flavors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can’t taste it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m too nervous to taste it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why? Because I’m sitting around the dinner table with my ex-girlfriends. And on top of that, both Kohaku and Akari are eating dinner in silence&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, you never know what will bring your past to light, and you have the right to keep your mouth shut, but this atmosphere is just unbearable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, as long as we avoid talking about our love life, I shouldn’t have to worry about my ex-girlfriends finding out about it. Let&#8217;s talk about something harmless, shall we?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shirasawa-sensei&#8217;s pork is delicious!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. Nijino-kun, you like strong flavors, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How do you know what he likes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, we&#8217;re in the gutter&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari gave her a suspicious look, and Kohaku slouched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well, that&#8217;s because… Nijino-kun has a strong face, so… I thought maybe he liked strong flavors…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re saying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“J-Just now was just a joke. Um, well… A-Actually, when I was making this pork with ginger, I asked Nijino-kun to taste the strong and the light seasoning! Isn&#8217;t that right, Nijino-kun?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes! Thank you for taking the time and effort to make this! It&#8217;s so delicious!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku smiled at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You seem to be feeling better after eating my food, and from the looks of things, I don&#8217;t think you need counseling.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s necessary. To the untrained eye, he may look fine, but a professional&#8217;s eye cannot be fooled. Touma has a lot of anxiety.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you just say ‘Touma’?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Again…!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looked at with suspicion, Akari looked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I didn’t say that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You did, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You definitely did!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Actually, I did. But of course, I said it with a reason.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why do you call Nijino-kun by his first name?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s for the success of the counseling. By getting to know me, he can tell me what he really feels.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A good excuse for an impromptu situation. Combined with her serious face, it’s hard to believe that she’s lying. Kohaku seems to believe it too, but… I don&#8217;t feel at ease at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because even if we got through this day, as long as we live in the same apartment, I can&#8217;t eliminate the risk of our relationship being exposed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, they might find out about the relationship–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just thinking about this is enough to cause me a mental breakdown. If I don&#8217;t do something, I will seriously have to go to counseling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;No more. Let&#8217;s stop fooling around. I&#8217;m going to choose one of them after graduation anyway. That was when I&#8217;d tell them about our relationship, but if it&#8217;s going to be a mess sooner or later, let&#8217;s just reveal it quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Calm down and listen to me, both of you. To tell you the truth–Kohaku and Akari are both my ex-girlfriends.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them were blown away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They looked at each other and&#8211;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Ehh?! You were dating Akamine-sensei, Touma-kun?! When?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;After I broke up with Kohaku.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The person who dumped Touma is Shirasawa-sensei…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I admitted it. I really admitted it. The rest is just a matter of what will happen now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Shirasawa-sensei, you&#8217;re not dating Touma now, are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course not. As a teacher, I can&#8217;t date my students. …Akamine-sensei too, you&#8217;re not dating Touma-kun, are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course not. I’m a teacher. I can&#8217;t date my students.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really? Aren&#8217;t you secretly plotting to seduce Touma-kun?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the suspicion was turned on her, Akari shook her head firmly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not plotting that. &#8230;However, I can&#8217;t deny the possibility that Touma may seduce me. After all, Touma loved to do naughty things with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would you say that after shaking your head so firmly?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that true, Touma-kun?! Are you trying to seduce Akamine-sensei?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I did my best to deny it, Kohaku sighed in relief and,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun, you used to love doing naughty things with me, didn&#8217;t you? That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re trying to seduce me. Is that it~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari&#8217;s eyes glinted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma, is that true? Are you going to do something naughty with Shirasawa-sensei?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t! We&#8217;re not even dating! To begin with, we&#8217;re teachers and students! I&#8217;ll act like a student, so you two act like teachers!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The earnest request seemed to resonate with both of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8230; Teachers shouldn&#8217;t do naughty things with their students. I&#8217;ll act properly as a teacher.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As a teacher myself, I swear I won&#8217;t lay a hand on Touma.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that they have no intention of getting ahead of one another, they withdrew their suspicions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what was going to happen, but I was relieved that the situation didn’t turn into a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shuraba.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now my worries are over. Tomorrow, I will be able to live a peaceful school life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I patted my chest and chewed on the strongly flavored pork fried with ginger.</span></p>
