<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 1</b></h1>

<p>That is what he remembers as the ‘Hero’, Reid Frieden.</p>
<p>And so ――</p>
<p>“―― Reid! Hey, Reiddd!?”</p>
<p>Hearing his mother&#8217;s voice coming from downstairs, Reid descends with a yawn.</p>
<p>“Oh, hey, Mom.”</p>
<p>“What did you do!?”</p>
<p>His mother had a pale complexion.</p>
<p>“No, I don&#8217;t remember doing anything in particular…?”</p>
<p>“The village chief told me this morning that a noble from the royal capital came to this village looking for you.”</p>
<p>“A noble, you say&#8230; Are you talking about the ‘Mage’?”</p>
<p>Those who specialize in combat using magic are called ‘Mage’ in this modern age.</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think I have anything to do with that.”</p>
<p>“I thought there was a mistake too, but that noble is referring to you by name.”</p>
<p>Reid’s mother sighs as she sits in her chair, perhaps a little calmed by the conversation.</p>
<p>“Haa… How did this happen…”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not a big deal anyway.”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re really unfazed by anything&#8230; You&#8217;ve always been a child who doesn&#8217;t cry and is always calm compared to other children your age…”</p>
<p>“I mean, it&#8217;s not that surprising.”</p>
<p>As he said this, Reid scratched his cheek.</p>
<p>That was not to say there were not any surprises. Rather, it was just that there was so much going on that he was unfazed by most things.</p>
<p>After all ―― he woke up in a world that was a thousand years in the future.</p>
<p>Moreover, the memory of ‘Reid Frieden’ remains clear.</p>
<p>His appearance remains the same as when he was young. A life in which he was called a ‘Hero’ and had countless battles.</p>
<p>He rushed to the funeral of the ‘Sage’ with wounds all over his body and lost his life. And yet, when he woke up, he was a baby, which was a very confusing moment.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was a world where a thousand years had passed since his previous life.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Altein, which was Reid&#8217;s hometown, had been destroyed and disappeared without a trace. The neighboring country that had once been his enemy had now changed its name to ‘Vegalta Magic Kingdom’, and the ‘Magic’, which had only been prevalent in some of the neighboring countries in his previous life, had spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>After seeing such a world where everything has changed, he is no longer surprised by most things.</p>
<p>Moreover, it has already been eighteen years since he was born into this new world.</p>
<p>He has gotten used to the new world, and unlike before, there is no great war but peace, and if Reid includes the experience of his previous life, he would be close to ninety mentally. There are not many things that would surprise him now.</p>
<p>As Reid was thinking about this, his mother put her hand on her forehead and blurted out.</p>
<p>“I guess it has something to do with your inability to use magic&#8230;”</p>
<p>In this world, ‘Magic’ is something that anyone can handle.</p>
<p>The magic technology created by the ‘Sage’ of the past has been studied and honed by those who have followed in her footsteps and is now widely used as a technology that even ordinary people can handle simple magic.</p>
<p>However, Reid could not use any magic.</p>
<p>“Maybe because my brother and sister were so good at it, so I have to balance it out?”</p>
<p>“How does that make sense…!?”</p>
<p>“I have no choice but to live thinking like that. Besides, I don’t have to use magic to help the people in the village by plowing the fields and carrying the load.”</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re happy with that, I&#8217;m not going to say more either…”</p>
<p>To which Reid gave no response.</p>
<p>The ‘Mage’ in this world is a symbol of admiration. They are an entity with magic power and skills superior to others who fight against menacing monsters.</p>
<p>That is why they are the envy of many people and receive a lot of fame.</p>
<p>However ―― conversely, those who cannot use magic are worthless.</p>
<p>The magic you can handle determines the job you can get, and only mages with guaranteed combat skills are allowed to work in combat. Such is the world of magic supremacy.</p>
<p>Even if he was called a ‘Hero’ in his previous life, Reid is considered worthless if he cannot use any magic. Regardless of his abilities, only a mage is allowed to fight.</p>
<p>That said, Reid isn’t dissatisfied with his current life. Compared to his previous life, when neighboring countries fought each other, this world is peaceful.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the time when people fought for their lives on the battlefield, living in the peaceful countryside while plowing the fields is refreshing and not a bad way to live one&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>However ―― the smoldering embers in his heart will never go away.</p>
<p>The person he used to be when he was called a ‘Hero’ is looking for a battle. A battle in which Reid can give his all and enjoy it from the bottom of his heart.</p>
<p>If he had any complaints, then that was about it.</p>
<p>In this life, Reid will only be able to cultivate the fields and love the crops that he has carefully nurtured.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I&#8217;m going to the village chief’s place. It might have been something urgent, and it&#8217;s not a good thing to keep people waiting too long.”</p>
<p>“If you caused a problem or something, could you just pretend that mother didn’t know anything about it!?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t care.”</p>
<p>“That’s sad. Then let us atone for our sins together!!”</p>
<p>“First of all, I’ll deny the premise that I did something wrong&#8230;”</p>
<p>After returning a wry smile to his mother, Reid left the house and headed for the village chief’s house.</p>
<p>As he walked along, admiring the tranquil landscape, he could feel the eyes of the people around him.</p>
<p>The villagers are looking at him from afar as if words have been spread that he was summoned by a noble. This will be a topic of conversation for a while.</p>
<p>Then, as he walked along the path thinking about it ―― he saw something unfamiliar.</p>
<p>It was a magic vehicle. An iron carrier powered by magic, without the use of horses.</p>
<p>A thousand years ago, this would have been unthinkable, but magic technology is much more developed than it used to be.</p>
<p>The ‘Sage’ created not only magic but also a ‘Magic Circuit’ that enables magic to be activated simply by channeling magic power, and these have been developed over time and have become widely used in people&#8217;s lives.</p>
<p>However, magic vehicles are only widely used in certain parts of the country. The privately owned ones would belong to a noble household that has produced mages or distinguished families with a long history.</p>
<p>It was only natural for his mother to be surprised and flustered when such a person called out to Reid by name. And it was the same for the village chief.</p>
<p>The village chief, who was restlessly pacing from right to left, looked up when he saw Reid.</p>
<p>“Reid, what have you done!?”</p>
<p>“Village chief, this is the second time I have had this conversation.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t care about that! I thought my life was about to be cut short!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Is a big shot here?”</p>
<p>“Just come quick! If something happens, then I don’t know anything!!”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s fine with me.”</p>
<p>“Kaa! Do you think I would abandon a member of my village?”</p>
<p>“Again, this is the second time I have had this conversation, but I appreciate your feelings.”</p>
<p>And so, he followed the village chief into the residence.</p>
<p>“So, who&#8217;s here? I heard that some noble has asked for me.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;It’s not just any noble.”</p>
<p>The village chief then talks about this person with a tense expression on his face.</p>
<p>“The person who summoned you is a collateral descendant of the royal family in the Vegalta Magic Kingdom that everyone knows.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Why did such a person ask for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know.”</p>
<p>“Then don&#8217;t call on me when you don&#8217;t know either.”</p>
<p>“That person only said, <em>‘He&#8217;ll know when we meet’</em>.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;But I&#8217;ve hardly ever been outside the village, though?”</p>
<p>“That’s why I said I don&#8217;t know.”</p>
<p>With wrinkles furrowing his eyebrows, the village chief nodded his head triumphantly.</p>
<p>“Just meet the person and find out. Maybe you&#8217;ll know something.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I’m off then.”</p>
<p>He arrived at the front of the reception room and slowly opened the door.</p>
<p>As soon as the door opened ―― he was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>The person has neat silvery white hair. Her eyes have the color of the deep sea. And she has a face that is exquisitely well-defined with an indifferent expression.</p>
<p>A figure that looked exactly the same as he remembered it from before.</p>
<p>But at the same time, he understood that it was impossible.</p>
<p>This world is a thousand years after his previous life.</p>
<p>Even if not ―― the person in question was already dead.</p>
<p>And Reid himself, of all people, had seen the corpse.</p>
<p>And yet ――</p>

<p>“―――― Long time no see, Reid.”</p>

<p>A familiar, clear voice calls out Reid&#8217;s name.</p>
<p>The very same ―― Elria Caldwen, stood quietly behind the door.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>
<p>After Reid entered the reception room in a daze, Elria ordered her attendants to wait outside, and they were again left alone. She then sat down on the couch before giving a slight nod.</p>
<p>“Long time no see, Reid.”</p>
<p>Elria turns and has her blue eyes on him as she repeats the same words.</p>
<p>Seeing the couch sinking, it does not look like it was a dream or an illusion.</p>
<p>As he watched the figure for a while, Elria tilted her head with an uneasy expression.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Reid?”</p>
<p>“Ah, my ba ―― my apologies.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Why are you using honorifics?”</p>
<p>“I have to watch my tone when speaking to one from the noble house of Caldwen.”</p>
<p>In response, Elria&#8217;s anxiety deepened as she lowered her eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Perhaps… you don&#8217;t remember?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, have we met before?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>Elria quietly lowers her shoulders with a look of disappointment on her face.</p>
<p>It was a sad and unbearable feeling to witness.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Reid scratches his head and sighs.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Are you looking for a guy who was a ‘Hero’?”</p>
<p>“!”</p>
<p>The moment he uttered those words, Elria looked up quickly.</p>
<p>However, she immediately lowered her head.</p>
<p>“But&#8230; the Reid I know doesn&#8217;t talk like that…”</p>
<p>“The conversation is just going in circles.”</p>
<p>“You sounded so much like him now.”</p>
<p>“That’s because I am the guy you have just mentioned&#8230; and as the ‘Hero’ of Altein, I change my tone in response to the occasion and who I am speaking to.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Elria&#8217;s eyes began to sparkle again.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;So it’s you!”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Just to be sure, are you really the person I know?”</p>
<p>“Elria Caldwen. I hail from Vegalta, about 200 years old, enjoy reading, like to drink lukewarm milk tea, and often take a nap in the sun when tired.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t have any information other than your name and where you&#8217;re from to identify you…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Once again, Elria lowers her head apologetically.</p>
<p>But the truth is, not much was known about Elria in her previous life.</p>
<p>After all, they always met on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Although they had many exchanges, they did not know much about each other.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why ――</p>
<p>“How many battles have we had?”</p>
<p>“Six thousand three hundred and twenty-nine.”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t remember.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I know. I always remind you.”</p>
<p>The tension finally disappeared from Elria’s face.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m glad… that you were Reid.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were wet with tears, and she repeatedly nodded as she put her hands to her chest.</p>
<p>After looking at Elria, Reid exhaled deeply and sat on the couch.</p>
<p>“I never thought I would see you again like this.”</p>
<p>He meets his rival again, whom he thought was dead, a thousand years later.</p>
<p>Who would have envisioned such a situation?</p>
<p>“That said, how did you find me?”</p>
<p>“I was reincarnated, so I thought Reid might be here, too.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s amazing how you can find me without any solid evidence…”</p>
<p>“I am confident in my intuition.”</p>
<p>Elria proudly says, raising the corners of her mouth just a little.</p>
<p>But there was one word that bothered him.</p>
<p>“What is this &#8216;Reincarnation&#8217; you were just talking about?”</p>
<p>“To put it simply, it is inheriting all the memories and abilities from the previous life in the next life. To be precise, it is called &#8216;Reincarnation Magic’.”</p>
<p>“Oh? Does that mean you used that magic?”</p>
<p>“No, I did not.”</p>
<p>Elria shakes her head and then continues her explanation.</p>
<p>“In the first place, &#8216;Reincarnation Magic’ is a name that I gave to it on a provisional basis. In other words, it exists in theory, but I don&#8217;t know how to make it happen.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, I understand what you are trying to say.”</p>
<p>In other words, Elria knows what will happen if one were to use reincarnation magic but not the procedure or method for using it.</p>
<p>Although it was a little vague, that must be what Elria was trying to convey.</p>
<p>“To think that even the ‘Sage’ who created the magic doesn&#8217;t know how to use it.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;There are things that even I, the ‘Sage’, don&#8217;t understand.”</p>
<p>Elria puffed out her cheeks as if she was sulking.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was not Elria&#8217;s doing that the reincarnation happened.</p>
<p>Neither was it Reid’s doing, of course.</p>
<p>The two people who were called the ‘Hero’ and the ‘Sage’, were reincarnated in the same world a thousand years later.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a stretch to call it a coincidence ――</p>
<p>“&#8230;Well, it&#8217;s no use to think about something we don’t know, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re right.”</p>
<p>Elria summed up her conclusion in philosophical terms.</p>
<p>“There are too many things I don&#8217;t understand. I was also doing some research, but if it were the true reincarnation magic, I would look the same as in my previous life, but my appearance wasn&#8217;t all the same.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Didn&#8217;t you notice?”</p>
<p>At that moment, Elria began to stare at him.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that Reid&#8217;s intuition told him that if he could not answer her, he would be in trouble.</p>
<p>And so, he took another look at Elria&#8217;s appearance.</p>
<p>Her beautiful neat silvery white hair has not changed. And her deep blue eyes remain the same. She looks the same as before, about fifteen or sixteen years old.</p>
<p>Reid could not say anything about her physical appearance… because he had never looked at her this close before, but he remembered that her height was about average. He could tell she was a woman at a glance from the bulge in her chest and the slenderness of her arms and legs.</p>
<p>In other words, nothing has changed.</p>
<p>Perhaps noticing Reid&#8217;s obliviousness, Elria began to fiddle with her hair.</p>
<p>And then ―― finally, he noticed the change.</p>
<p>Her distinctive long ears, which she had in her previous life, had become the familiar round ears.</p>
<p>“Could it be that… you have been reincarnated as a human instead of an elf?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That&#8217;s why Reid and I have matching ears.”</p>
<p>“That’s not just me, but the whole human race.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiles wryly at Elria, who moves her hair to show her ears.</p>
<p>In other words, from now on, Elria will age and grow old, just like Reid.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it… I heard from the village chief that you&#8217;re a collateral descendant of the royal family, so are you someone important even in this world?”</p>
<p>“Yes, someone very important.”</p>
<p>“That’s so awesome…”</p>
<p>“Nn… One of the children I taught magic to was a member of the royal family, and she inherited my family name, so now it became a lineage of the &#8216;Sage&#8217;.”</p>
<p>“Oh? That&#8217;s really amazing.”</p>
<p>After all, today is a world where magic reigns supreme.</p>
<p>There are various legends and stories about the ‘Sage’, the progenitor of magic. So those who have inherited the name would have significant influence.</p>
<p>They are the result of Elria’s efforts to pass on the art of magic to future generations, so it is gratifying to see that the person in question is still in a strong position today.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;What about Reid?”</p>
<p>“Ah, me?”</p>
<p>“How do you live now?”</p>

<img src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/rhxs_vol1/RHXS_Vol1_05.jpeg">

<p>“I&#8217;m plowing the fields, chopping the wood, and hauling the peddler&#8217;s loads.&#8221;</p>
<p>“&#8230;Eh? Why?”</p>
<p>“Because… I can&#8217;t use magic.”</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Reid himself made an effort to use magic.</p>
<p>He learned the basics of modern magic from scratch and tried many things while being taught by his brother and sister, who were gifted with magic, but still, he could not activate the magic.</p>
<p>Even rudimentary magic that a child could invoke could not be activated.</p>
<p>“What were the results of your magic aptitude?”</p>
<p>“The one you would take when you turn twelve? If so, the moment I touched it, the device broke, and the people at the association got very angry with me.”</p>
<p>In this world, when a person turns twelve years old, they would be subjected to a magic aptitude test.</p>
<p>Suppose the amount of magic power calculated by the device exceeds a certain value. In that case, they are qualified to take the examination to become a mage, and if their magic power is of a high level, they can attend the magic academy.</p>
<p>Graduation from the academy paves the way to becoming an honorable ‘Mage’. However, in Reid&#8217;s case, that was not the problem. He could not activate even the simplest of magic, and anything with a built-in magic circuit would just break down.</p>
<p>And as expected, he broke the device during the magic aptitude test, resulting in a lengthy lecture from the officials, who informed him that he had no magic aptitude at all.</p>
<p>Thus, Reid was officially declared <em>‘Incompetent’</em>.</p>
<p>However, he was not bothered by it.</p>
<p>Rather than causing trouble for others by sticking to magic, he would rather live a life of plowing the fields or helping the villagers.</p>
<p>With that in mind, he led a leisurely life in the countryside ――</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Elria raised her eyebrows in frustration.</p>
<p>With a pout, she then says,</p>
<p>“But… Reid is a ‘Hero’, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s in the past…”</p>
<p>“Besides, Reid is as strong as I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>“That I won’t deny. But nowadays, magic is supreme, while melee weapons are treated as antiques or wall decorations, and you must become a mage to fight in the first place.”</p>
<p>The expression on Elria&#8217;s face gradually became sullen with every word spoken.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just how it is today.</p>
<p>People who cannot use magic are incompetent, and even if they have the strength to fight, they are not allowed to do so.</p>
<p>Not only their position but the world itself has changed so drastically that there is no way a single person can change anything.</p>
<p>However, Elria looked up after giving a slight nod.</p>
<p>“Hey, Reid ――”</p>
<p>And after Elria quietly called out Reid&#8217;s name ――</p>
<p>“―― I want you to marry me.”</p>
<p>She uttered those words.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Huh?”</p>
<p>“For now, Reid will be my fiancé.”</p>
<p>“Wait, don&#8217;t just make it a definite thing.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Elria started speaking of something ridiculous, but her expression was quite serious.</p>
<p>“If you are closely related to the Caldwen family, you can take the magic academy’s entrance examination, regardless of your magic aptitude. Reid can become a mage by showing your abilities there. Then you will be able to fight like in the old days. It&#8217;s a perfect plan!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;But isn&#8217;t that kind of cheating?”</p>
<p>“No, it&#8217;s not cheating.”</p>
<p>Elria interrupted him.</p>
<p>Apparently, she didn&#8217;t say it as a joke.</p>
<p>“Because… Reid is strong. Strong enough to fight me for more than fifty years. Not only that, but Reid was also called a &#8216;Hero&#8217;.”</p>
<p>Looking down, Elria talks about the Reid she once knew.</p>
<p>“Besides… I can’t accept the fact that nobody recognizes Reid just because you can&#8217;t use magic.”</p>
<p>Those were the words of his rival, whom he had fought for over fifty years.</p>
<p>The ‘Hero’ and the ‘Sage’ knew each other’s abilities better than anyone else.</p>
<p>And they recognized each other&#8217;s abilities.</p>
<p>That is probably why Elria made such a reckless proposal.</p>
<p>However, the current Reid is just an incompetent young man who cannot use magic living in the countryside.</p>
<p>In contrast, the current Elria is second only to the royal family in status and power.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, Elria’s name may be tarnished. So he could not accept such a reckless proposal.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m glad to hear that, but as for the proposal ――”</p>
<p>As Reid was about to reject the proposal ――</p>
<p>“―― Let&#8217;s settle who is stronger.”</p>
<p>Elria interrupted him and uttered the words they had exchanged once before.</p>
<p>It was a promise that could not be fulfilled in their previous life, and the only regret Reid himself had in his dying moments.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why he frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“&#8230;It&#8217;s cheating to say that now, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“It’s not cheating. Because I’m sure Reid feels the same way, too.”</p>
<p>With clear and pure eyes, Elria sees through Reid&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>The answer has already been decided.</p>
<p>After more than fifty years of fighting, their positions have changed.</p>
<p>A position in which he was called a ‘Hero’, and she was called a ‘Sage’, and either one of them losing could lead to the downfall of their respective country.</p>
<p>That is why… it has been nothing but draws.</p>
<p>The two have tried not to take each other seriously, even though they always fight earnestly in their battles.</p>
<p>But if wishes could be granted ――</p>
<p>“―― I won&#8217;t run or hide. I&#8217;ll always accept your challenge.”</p>
<p>As they had once made a promise to each other, Reid returned the same words to Elria.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After accepting Elria’s proposal, Reid had prepared only the bare minimum of luggage and was on his way to the royal capital with Elria.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I never thought it would come to this.”</p>
<p>Reid blurted out as he gazed at the view from the window of the magic vehicle.</p>
<p>Indeed, since his previous life, he has had feelings for Elria that were more than just enemies.</p>
<p>Even though they did not exchange anything other than small talk, they understood each other&#8217;s intentions and tried to avoid any unnecessary casualties in each other’s forces.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Reid thought they could have been good friends had they been in different positions.</p>
<p>For some reason, in the world a thousand years later, not only did their positions changed… they have now skipped the relationship phase of being friends. Reid has become engaged to his former rival.</p>
<p>And the person who made such a reckless proposal is none other than ――</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>While sitting opposite Reid, Elria has a tense expression on her face, to the point that her whole body is shaking.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hey, Elria.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Hey, Elria!”</p>
<p>“I-I can hear you!!”</p>
<p>In response to Reid’s call, Elria stuttered.</p>
<p>Then, with her face bright red, she casts her eyes downward again.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, you don&#8217;t have to apologize.”</p>
<p>Looking at Elria, who still has her eyes cast downwards, Reid scratches his head.</p>
<p>This situation was somewhat expected.</p>
<p>Even though they have only spoken to each other on the battlefield, they understood each other to a certain extent after more than fifty years of battles.</p>
<p>―― Elria is not good at socializing.</p>
<p>There was a time when elves were feared by humans as <em>‘beings that look like humans but are not’</em>, and they lived their lives avoiding any interactions with humans by building settlements alongside nature.</p>
<p>The reason why Elria decided to join the human society is not known. But still, it is difficult to change ideas that are rooted in one’s natural disposition due to the environment in which one is born.</p>
<p>As if to prove this point, stories about <em>‘the Sage is misanthropic and doesn&#8217;t often show herself’</em> had even reached Reid’s country.</p>
<p>However, from the looks of things, she probably just did not know how to interact with people.</p>
<p>That’s why Reid decided to talk to her.</p>
<p>“I have a question for you, Elria.”</p>
<p>“W-What is it that you want to ask?”</p>
<p>“Before that, please try not to stutter and put up with the embarrassment. Otherwise, this conversation will go on forever.”</p>
<p>After some desperate persuasion, Elria nodded her head, red as her face was.</p>
<p>“I told you I couldn&#8217;t use magic, but do you know why?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;The reasons why Reid can’t use magic?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Since you created magic, I thought you might know something about it.”</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Elria looks at him curiously.</p>
<p>“Mm… I think it’s probably because of Reid’s magic power.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;My magic power?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. It’s easier to understand by comparing magic power to water.”</p>
<p>While twirling her fingertips, Elria continues to explain.</p>
<p>“Ordinary magic power is like water, so if you pass them through a path called a magic circuit, they will flow. But Reid’s magic power is like stone, so it doesn’t flow in the first place, and if you try to force it through, the path itself will break down.”</p>
<p>“Ah… So that’s why the device broke during the magic aptitude test.”</p>
<p>Now that Reid recalls, that symptom only happened when he tried to use magic intentionally or to have the magic power flow through to the device. Otherwise, the magic vehicle Reid is riding in now would have been broken.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how that kind of magic power came to be, but the ‘Magic’ that I created cannot be used by Reid in the first place. If you wanted to, I would have to construct a special theoretical formula to match your magic power and create a new form of magic circuit from scratch, not the existing one.”</p>
<p>“Does that take a lot of time?”</p>
<p>“It took me a hundred years to form the basis of my magic theory.”</p>
<p>“So, by the time it’s done, I will be an old man again?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’ll be an old woman now that I’m a human.”</p>
<p>If even Elria, the founder of magic, took more than a hundred years to achieve it, it is safe to say that almost no one else can.</p>
<p>“Thank you. The mystery of 18 years was solved in an instant.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Reid, did you want to use magic?”</p>
<p>“How should I say this… I just wanted to know how it feels like to use magic, but if I can’t use it, then so be it.”</p>
<p>Reid wasn’t trying to force himself to be able to use magic. It was just a simple question of why he could not use it, and just being able to solve that would be a sufficient accomplishment.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Elria nodded her head repeatedly.</p>
<p>“Reid will be fine. Because you can’t defeat me with magic.”</p>
<p>“Oh? You’re that confident, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. When it comes to magic, I am second to none.”</p>
<p>Elria proudly puffs her chest out. From the looks of it, Reid was right to talk about magic. If the conversation continues at this rate, Elria will gradually get used to it.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking about it, Reid felt a slight tug on his clothes.</p>
<p>“What is it? What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Um, err…”</p>
<p>Elria’s gaze wanders, perhaps at a loss for words again.</p>
<p>Then, as if determined, she opened her mouth with trembling lips.</p>
<p>“Thank you for accepting my… engagement proposal.”</p>
<p>“That’s my line. Thank you for worrying about me.”</p>
<p>“But still… it was so sudden that I thought you might find it annoying…”</p>
<p>“I’m more confused than annoyed. You just skipped over the whole thing and asked me to marry you.”</p>
<p>“B-Because… I thought that I could fight Reid again… in that way!”</p>
<p>“Well… that’s certainly the only way to do it.”</p>
<p>Elria seems to have said it on the spur of the moment, but becoming the fiancé of the Caldwen family is the only way to change Reid’s current situation.</p>
<p>Because Reid cannot use magic, so naturally, he cannot take the entrance examination for the magic academy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his older brother and younger sister have achieved above-standard readings in the magic aptitude test and are currently attending the magic academy, but nobody would pay attention to a person from the countryside who is only slightly above average.</p>
<p>On top of that, it is now forbidden for anyone other than a mage to engage in combat.</p>
<p>Although magic is now widely used as a convenient technology that anyone can handle, it is also a dangerous technology that can harm others if handled incorrectly.</p>
<p>For this reason, except in emergencies or in times of crisis, anyone found to have engaged in combat who is not a qualified mage will be severely punished.</p>
<p>It may be possible to give priority to <em>‘settling the score’</em> without regard to everything, but it is impossible to seriously clash without being found out by others, and if a person in a position of power like Elria committed a crime, it would affect the future of the country.</p>
<p>In other words, it is best for Reid to become a mage in order to settle fairly with Elria without anyone interfering, and Reid, who cannot use magic, would need the backing of the Caldwen family by becoming Elria’s fiancé.</p>
<p>However… There are other reasons why Reid agreed to the engagement.</p>
<p>“At any rate, this makes it more convenient for me to look into this matter.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;This matter?”</p>
<p>“Both of us were reincarnated a thousand years later. It can’t be a coincidence, right?”</p>
<p>The two who were once called the ‘Hero’ and the ‘Sage’ are reincarnated in the same era.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is difficult to think of it as a coincidence when both are said to have memories of their previous life.</p>
<p>In that case ―― then there is a third party involved.</p>
<p>“If someone is involved in our reincarnation, we need to find out and make them spew out their purpose. Even if it were a coincidence, it wouldn’t hurt to look it up, and if I’m the only one with a different social status, then I’ll have to ask you to look into it. That would be too much of a burden for you.”</p>
<p>If the information is unknown even to Elria, it is likely to be kept secret not only from the public but also from the mages themselves.</p>
<p>In order to investigate such information in depth, status and position are essential, and Reid himself should have a certain level of standing.</p>
<p>In that sense, the proposal by Elria is undoubtedly the best choice.</p>
<p>There is no doubt about it, but ――</p>
<p>“Are you really sure about this?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about making me your fiancé. In our previous lives, we were enemies. Did you not think that I might kill you off?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t thought about it.”</p>
<p>“You should be a little more alarmed.”</p>
<p>“Because I know Reid wouldn’t do that.”</p>
<p>Elria puffs out her cheeks as if she is a little angry.</p>
<p>“Such a person would not bother to fight dutifully for more than fifty years.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Well, you’re right. I also trusted you for similar reasons.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;You trust me?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’d never have talked to you if I didn’t.”</p>
<p>After hearing Reid’s honest reply ――</p>
<p>“―― Thank you for trusting me.”</p>
<p>Elria smiled as she said that.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful smile.</p>
<p>An expression of heartfelt relief.</p>
<p>A smile that she had never shown in battle.</p>
<p>Seeing this new side of her, Reid could not help but return the smile.</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah. Thank you for trusting me, too.”</p>
<p>“Mm. Thank you.”</p>
<p>“This is going to enter a new pattern of endless loops…”</p>
<p>“W-Well then… I have some questions for you, too…”</p>
<p>Elria nodded her head and made the suggestion.</p>
<p>“I’d like to know what’s your favorite food, what you did when you weren’t on the battlefield, and what you’ve been doing since your reincarnation.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, well, it’s weird that we don’t know a thing about each other even though we’re engaged. So tell me about yourself, too.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes… What do you want to know?”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s your hobby?”</p>
<p>“Reading books.”</p>
<p>“What’s your favorite ――”</p>
<p>“Lukewarm milk tea.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;How do you usually spend your time?”</p>
<p>“Taking naps in the sun.”</p>
<p>“Those were the information you have told me previously…”</p>
<p>The information Reid asked for to verify her identity was connected in an unexpected way.</p>
<p>Now he has to think of a better question.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing else, it’s my turn now.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah. What do you want to know?”</p>
<p>“Well, then… I’d like to know about Reid’s hobby.”</p>
<p>“I spent most of my life on the battlefield before, and I still don’t have any hobbies now.”</p>
<p>“What’s your favorite food?”</p>
<p>“Anything edible.”</p>
<p>“How do you usually spend your time?”</p>
<p>“I just go about my day.”</p>
<p>“None of that information was of any substance…”</p>
<p>Elria’s shoulders slumped sadly as nothing had come of it. But she lightly squeezes her fist to inspire herself.</p>
<p>“T-Then next question! I have other questions!”</p>
<p>“Sure. There is still time before we reach the royal capital, so ask whatever you want.”</p>
<p>While watching Elria frantically think of questions, Reid waited for the next question.</p>
<p>As they ask each other more questions, they gradually get to know each other better.</p>
<p>It was unthinkable before, but now that they are not enemies, they can slowly get to know each other.</p>
<p>Enjoying this, Reid began to think of his next question for Elria.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>In the past, the country known as Vegalta was just one of the smaller countries on the continent.</p>
<p>Although they possessed a unique technology called sorcery, it was considered difficult for any combat application because it required tools and advanced preparation.</p>
<p>However, things changed drastically with the emergence of the ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>The ‘Magic Circuit’, which replaces all the tools and chanting required for the activation of magic, not only made it possible to cope with the rapidly changing war situation but also eliminated the gaps caused by chanting and advance preparation, thereby overcoming the challenges in close-quarters combat simultaneously.</p>
<p>Thus, Vegalta acquired the power to challenge the great Altein and won the long war that lasted more than a hundred years with ‘Magic’ that was created by the great ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>After that, Vegalta increased its national power by raising its standard of living to a level incomparable to other countries through magic technology, specializing in magic combat by making it mandatory for the soldiers to acquire magic skills, and ruled the entire continent with its overwhelming power.</p>
<p>And that is how ―― the ‘Vegalta Magic Kingdom’, came to be.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was a surprise to Reid, who knew Vegalta when it was just a small country.</p>
<p>“Haa… Things have really changed a lot.”</p>
<p>From the window of the magic vehicle, Reid looks out at the scenery of the royal capital.</p>
<p>At any rate, the royal capital of Vegalta is more developed than the great Altein, and magic technology can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Looking around, one can see glimpses of the magic technology being used. There are magic lamps that utilize underground magic veins, the water purification system that is activated by the magic generated by water currents, and the hardening magic that is applied to the well-maintained paths to prevent them from breaking down.</p>
<p>“When I was here before, it wasn’t that different from Altein.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Reid, you have been to Vegalta before?”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Elria tilts her head slightly.</p>
<p>Since Reid came to the royal capital of Vegalta after hearing the news of the Sage’s death, it was only natural that Elria did not know about it.</p>
<p>“Well, it was a long time ago. More importantly, are my stories being passed on to future generations?”</p>
<p>Hearing this, Elria casts her eyes downward.</p>
<p>“&#8230;It’s been a thousand years. So, many things have been adapted and passed down.”</p>
<p>“Oh? What do they have, for example?”</p>
<p>“I-I can’t tell you that…”</p>
<p>Elria shook her head vigorously.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, the stories about Reid that were passed down are not good. But that is not surprising. After all, from Vegalta’s point of view, Reid was seen as an enemy.</p>
<p>Just as the great Altein disappeared from history. History is written by the victors, so it is not possible to complain about how viciously the enemy was written.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you, but I’m sure it’s not as bad as what they said…”</p>
<p>Noticing Reid’s expression, Elria followed up by waving her hands. On the contrary, Reid began to wonder how it was passed down.</p>
<p>Just as he was thinking about it, a light knock sounded from the partitioned driver’s seat.</p>
<p>“Nn… We have arrived at my house.”</p>
<p>“My stomach started hurting just hearing that.”</p>
<p>After all, Reid is about to greet his fiancée’s parents.</p>
<p>He had deceived his mother and the village chief by saying, <em>“I have some affairs to do in the royal capital, so I’ll be going there,”</em> but as Elria’s fiancé, and is also allowed to take advantage of her family’s position as a Caldwen, Reid must explain the situation to her parents.</p>
<p>“Haa… I never did an engagement speech in my previous life…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Really?”</p>
<p>“I had turned down all marriage talks because I spent most of my life on the battlefield. That’s why I wasn’t going to start a family because I could die at any time…”</p>
<p>“Mm… Is that so?”</p>
<p>In contrast to Reid, whose shoulders dropped, Elria’s expression brightened a bit.</p>
<p>Moreover, for some reason, she held both hands lightly in a guts pose, and a tiny half-smile, too.</p>
<p>As Reid was blankly staring at her ――</p>
<p><strong>“―――― ELRIAAAAAAAAA!!”</strong></p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud voice echoed all around them.</p>
<p>A large man approached them from the mansion in a panicked frenzy. He looks to be in his mid-thirties, but the wrinkles indicate that he is probably older than he looks.</p>
<p>Seeing him, Elria steps down from the cabin of the magic vehicle.</p>
<p>“I’m home, Father.”</p>
<p>“I heard you went on another excursion alone!!”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“Good for you for being so honest!!”</p>
<p>“I made sure to leave a note this time and told people at the mansion.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful!! You’ve taken care of it so that we won’t have to worry!!”</p>
<p>“I think Father worries too much.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be helped! It is natural for a father to worry about his lovely daughter!! That’s why I always only think of Elria!”</p>
<p>Elria’s father was smiling broadly as they exchanged such conversation.</p>
<p>Reid had heard that the family was second only to the royal family, so he had imagined a sterner father figure, but Elria’s father seemed more like a pleasant and broad-minded person.</p>
<p>However, by the looks of things, it seems likely that they will at least listen to what Reid has to say, and more than anything, if it is a request from their daughter, Elria.</p>
<p>Just as he was being optimistic about that ――</p>
<p>“Also, I brought my fiancé.”</p>
<p>“Okay!! Rejected!!”</p>
<p>She was cut off immediately by a pleasant smile and vigor.</p>
<p>“I declare once again that I have no intention of letting Elria take a husband while I, Galleon Caldwen, am still breathing!!”</p>
<p>“But I’ve already brought him here.”</p>
<p>“What!? You have already brought him here!?”</p>
<p>“Yes, his name is Reid, and he is currently in the magic vehicle.”</p>
<p>As she says this, Elria points to Reid.</p>
<p>Since he could not just stay in the magic vehicle, Reid got out of the magic vehicle with resolution… Seeing that, Elria’s father, Galleon, smiled with a grin.</p>
<p>“So, you are Reid-kun!!”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes… That’s right…”</p>
<p>“I see!! Go home!!”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, but I can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Is that so! Then come on into the mansion!!”</p>
<p>“Thank you for being understanding.”</p>
<p>“Personally, I would never give my daughter to a man of unknown origin! But since I am not the head of the house, I cannot make decisions for the house of Caldwen!!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;You are not the head of the family?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The head of the house of Caldwen has been a woman for generations.”</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing my bewilderment, Elria added.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it was well known that the ‘Sage’ was a woman, so it would be natural for a woman to serve as the head of the family if they were to carry on the name.</p>
<p>In other words ――</p>
<p>“―― What’s all the fuss about?”</p>
<p>With a dignified voice, a woman walks slowly toward them.</p>
<p>She has the same silver hair as Elria.</p>
<p>However, her sharp eyes and stern demeanor are unlike Elria’s.</p>
<p>“Galleon, explain the details to me.”</p>
<p>“I heard that Elria has brought her fiancé!!”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then, please stay back because you are being too noisy.”</p>
<p>After giving a cold response to her husband, she turns her attention towards Reid.</p>
<p>“I am Alicia Caldwen, head of the Caldwen family.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I am sorry for the late introduction. My name is Reid Frieden.”</p>
<p>Alicia’s attitude did not change as Reid kneeled and bowed his head reverently.</p>
<p>She continues to look at Reid coldly as if she is assessing him.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I have never heard of your family name.”</p>
<p>“I come from a mountain village in the Arlieth region, and I am from a commoner family that has never received a title before. So, it is only natural that the head of the Caldwen family has not heard of it.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;For a commoner from the countryside, you seem to carry yourself well.”</p>
<p>“As a person who came to greet you, I have tried to exercise the minimum level of civility.”</p>
<p>At the very least, he bowed his head while trying not to be rude.</p>
<p>Then, as he waited for her next words, Alicia sighed quietly.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Elria.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mother.”</p>
<p>“He’s so much more level-headed than you, isn’t he?”</p>
<p>“Yes, isn’t he amazing?”</p>
<p>“Elria, I’ve made a sarcastic remark about you. I’m truly concerned about my daughter’s future.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>At the sight of Elria clapping her hands, Alicia heaved another sigh.</p>
<p>“So… you chose this young man as your fiancé?”</p>
<p>“Yes, because I finally found him.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Is that so.”</p>
<p>After such a short reply, Alicia extended her hand to Reid, who lowered his head.</p>
<p>“Please look up, and be at ease.”</p>
<p>“Oh… that would be great. Because I’m not used to it anyway.”</p>
<p>“I can see that in your mannerisms. But at least I could tell that you were trying to be respectful of my position through your words and actions. That’s the importance of etiquette.”</p>
<p>Alicia nodded softly after telling him so.</p>
<p>“It would be a disgrace to our family name if we turned away someone who has paid respect to Caldwen. First, let us welcome you as our guest.”</p>
<p>Without losing her stern demeanor, Alicia turns on her heel and heads for the mansion.</p>
<p>In other words, she seems to have at least recognized Reid as a ‘guest’.</p>
<p>That means they will at least listen to what Reid has to say ――</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Hey, Elria.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter, Reid?”</p>
<p>“Am I going to tell someone like that, <em>‘I&#8217;m getting engaged to your daughter to take advantage of her family status’</em>?”</p>
<p>“It depends on how you say it.”</p>
<p>“Do I have to do that&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Good luck, Reid.”</p>
<p>“You, too&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p>Elria clenches her fists to show her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Reid is sure that that enthusiasm of hers will probably never bear fruit.</p>
<p>With that in mind, he began walking towards the large mansion.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>The servants led them to an annex a short distance away from the mansion. Perhaps it was prepared for guests, but the size and structure of the annex did not pale in comparison to the main building, and it was undoubtedly a guest house to welcome distinguished families and nobles.</p>
<p>After being ushered into the reception room, Alicia had the servants leave.</p>
<p>“Now then… let’s have a talk again, shall we?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Before we do that, I was wondering if Elria and Galleon-san do not need to be present?”</p>
<p>“Those two are not suitable for this kind of situation. My husband is too loud and gets in the way of the proceedings, and my daughter is not very good at talking and explaining things, so I figured it would go more smoothly if we talked ourselves through it.”</p>
<p>Alicia tipped her teacup in a composed manner while giving a harsh assessment of the two.</p>
<p>However, the situation is already difficult. In addition to being the mother of his fiancée, Alicia is the head of a family with a power second only to the royal family. And now he has to say, <em>“Please approve my engagement to your daughter”. </em>It is no longer just awkward.</p>
<p>Perhaps sensing the situation, Alicia changed her attitude and tone.</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be alarmed. I just want to know what’s going on and how things came about, and I’m asking you as an equal.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Reid appears to be thinking about it. He then gave a deliberate sigh and nodded.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’ll take your word for it, then. I also believe we’re here to talk, and I&#8217;m not good at dealing with things like diplomacy.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;You say you’re not good at diplomacy, but you seem to have a way with words, though?”</p>
<p>Alicia stares at him with furrowed brows.</p>
<p>Reid is like an old man in spirit. Although he is not bad at these conversational diplomacies and dealings, in fact, he has a keen intuition to sniff them out.</p>
<p>“The reason we decided to get engaged was so that I could take advantage of the name and status of the Caldwen name.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;That was Elria’s idea, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You may ask Elria herself to confirm it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t need confirmation. Because you are <em>‘Reid’</em>.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>Alicia quietly lowered her eyes in response to Reid’s question.</p>
<p>“When she was a little girl, she said to me out of the blue, <em>‘I want to find someone called Reid Frieden’</em>.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;She has been looking for me for that long?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But when I asked her why, she just shook her head and wouldn’t answer, and she just said, <em>‘I’m sure he is here,’</em> so I just assumed it was a childlike delusion and didn’t take it seriously.”</p>
<p>She probably did not think that <em>‘Reid’</em> would really appear.</p>
<p>“To put it bluntly&#8230; that child was strange since birth. She was different from all the other children, not only in her talents, which surpassed all mages, but also as a person. She never cried, even when she was a baby, and she even gave me… her mother, a scared look.”</p>
<p>That was what Reid had been told by his mother, too. However, Elria was probably even worse than that.</p>
<p>Because of her previous life, she is not used to interacting with people, and now she wakes up in a world that is a thousand years in the future without knowing anyone.</p>
<p>Elria, who had always been shy, would have avoided her mother because of the memories of her previous life, even though she understood that they were her immediate family.</p>
<p>And so, she must have spent her life desperately in an unfamiliar environment. Even under such circumstances, Elria tried to find Reid, without knowing if he was really there. There is no basis for it. And yet ―― she did not give up and kept looking for Reid.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Is that so.”</p>
<p>Alicia’s expression softened slightly as Reid quietly returned the words upon hearing this fact.</p>
<p>“I’m telling you this first, if you’re that <em>‘Reid’</em>, then I’m willing to approve the engagement.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;You’re willing to leave your house in the hands of a man of unknown origin based on the words of Elria alone?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s the path she chose.”</p>
<p>With a smile on her face, Alicia continues,</p>
<p>“No matter how strange that child was… she is still my daughter. As a parent, it’s only natural to want her to seek her own happiness rather than make her unhappy by forcing her into an unwanted marriage in order to keep the family name alive, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Alicia spoke not as the head of the family but as a mother. She must have gone through unspeakable hardships to reach this decision.</p>
<p>A strange child who is born a genius but looks at her mother with frightened eyes. Alicia’s feelings as the mother of such a child must have been immeasurable. And being the head of a family with a status second only to the royal family, she must have faced intense scrutiny from both outside and within the family.</p>
<p>Even so, she decided to prioritize Elria’s happiness as her own daughter.</p>
<p>“So, what about you?”</p>
<p>Alicia looked straight at Reid as if testing him.</p>
<p>To belong to the Caldwen family means to live with Elria. That means they will be together until one of them dies.</p>
<p>However… that future is not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>If Reid only considered the battle with Elria, then there was never a need to become a mage. They could just fight without regard for their surroundings to fulfill the promise they once made.</p>
<p>As for the matter of finding out about their reincarnation, time and means will be limited, but by no means impossible.</p>
<p>It is certainly convenient for them, but it is not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>And yet ――</p>
<p>“―― She was my only equal.”</p>
<p>Smiling naturally, he recalls the exchanges they had on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Reid was on the battlefield, Elria would fly in or create new things to fight him, and when those failed, she would come up with new techniques and strategies again.</p>
<p>No sane person would have any affection for someone who is trying to kill each other. But neither Reid nor Elria was sane.</p>
<p>“We’ve been apart for a long time now. But just like Elria, who kept looking for me, I’ve also never forgotten about her.”</p>
<p>In the eighteen years since his reincarnation, he had never once forgotten Elria.</p>
<p>Even though he was living a different and more peaceful life than before in a world where magic had developed, he still thought of Elria’s image occasionally.</p>
<p>He wondered what she would think of this world, what she would say when she saw today&#8217;s magic, and whether she would live as peacefully as Reid if she were alive in this world.</p>
<p>If Elria lived in this world the same way ――</p>
<p>“―― I want to be with Elria.”</p>

<p>Smiling softly, Reid replied.</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Alicia nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I see. I’d give you a passing mark for the proposal.”</p>
<p>“That’s really strict.”</p>
<p>“Anyone can say the words, but it’s the actions and the results that count.”</p>
<p>After such harsh words, Alicia raises her fingers.</p>
<p>“There are three conditions for me to approve your engagement. For the first condition, I will leave you in charge of all matters concerning Elria.”</p>
<p>“Well, I think that’s a little too much.”</p>
<p>“That’s just how many problems she has&#8230; She will eventually inherit the name of Caldwen, but she’s a shy child who is not good at talking, nor is she good with her manners and other problems…”</p>
<p>Previously, Elria was allowed to behave freely because she was a ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>However, now that she is born into a distinguished family with status and history, she will be expected to behave accordingly in society.</p>
<p>“At least, with you by her side, she will be able to learn something from you.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure about that either.”</p>
<p>“Compared to Elria, you are doing fine.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t have that much faith in your daughter.”</p>
<p>“Well… you certainly looked old-fashioned, outdated even, but I don’t think it matters because you seem to make a good impression on people who take pride in being part of a distinguished family.”</p>
<p>“A person from a distinguished family shouldn’t say that&#8230;”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. We value our duty and pride as the one who inherits the name of the Sage, while other families just talk endlessly about their long and futile history.”</p>
<p>Alicia sighs, exasperated, as she rests her elbows on the table.</p>
<p>The first impression Reid had of her was that she’s a strict person, but it seems that her true nature is to be straightforward.</p>
<p>“The second condition is to attend the magic academy and become a qualified mage.”</p>
<p>“That’s our goal, so you don’t have to worry about it.”</p>
<p>“It’s not that simple, you know? The magic academy in the royal capital gathers outstanding mages from all over the continent who have been recognized for their talents. That’s why talent alone gets you nowhere, and those who can graduate quickly are the true geniuses.”</p>
<p>After changing her expression, Alicia raises her third finger.</p>
<p>“Third, you must prove yourself while you are in the academy. There are many people who want to be associated with a Caldwen, and there will certainly be people who will criticize you because of your family background. Show them your abilities and results to silence them.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;How exactly?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you just do this?”</p>
<p>Alicia rolled up her arm and clenched her fists. What a heroic statement.</p>
<p>“It is not only your knowledge of magic that would be tested at the academy, but also the techniques of magic combat against other people, and the ability to think and move according to the situation. She’s usually like that, but even those of us who have dealt with Elria in mock battles have had a hard time with her.”</p>
<p>“Yeah… I guess people are not always what they seem&#8230;”</p>
<p>Reid averted his eyes and returned the appropriate words.</p>
<p>After all, Elria has fought for more than fifty years in her previous life.</p>
<p>She was skilled not only in close-quarters combat but also in strategies using magic, and even Reid had memories of considerable hardship due to that. For Elria, a mock battle would be nothing more than a game.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sure it will be fine.”</p>
<p>“I have high hopes, too. After all, that child even approves of you.”</p>
<p>“Please leave that to me. I know a thing or two about magic combat.”</p>
<p>“That is very promising. So, what kind of magic do you use?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t use magic.”</p>
<p>As soon as Reid answered, Alicia’s expression froze.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Can you say that again?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I should correct myself. I can’t use magic.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t ask you to correct it.”</p>
<p>Alicia’s expression instantly turned grim.</p>
<p>And then ―― she sighed before turning to face the door.</p>
<p>“Galleon, come here for a minute.”</p>
<p>“<strong>OOOHHHHHHHHHHH!!</strong> You called me, Alicia?”</p>
<p>“Be quiet. You are being noisy.”</p>
<p>Alicia snapped, and Galleon came into the room with his huge body hunched over.</p>
<p>“Galleon, let’s see how good he is.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’m not a mage, so I shouldn’t be allowed to fight, right?”</p>
<p>“This annex is not only for guests but also a state-licensed magic training facility. In the facility, magic combat is permitted even for those who are not qualified mages, in exchange for a limit on the magic power output. We usually have mock battles with Elria here, too.”</p>
<p>In other words, it seems that they led Reid to the annex with the intention of seeing how good he was from the start.</p>
<p>Alicia then got up from her seat and turned on her heel.</p>
<p>“I’m going to go talk to Elria. Let him go if you think he is worthy enough to be admitted to the magic academy.”</p>
<p>“Yes!! Now, Reid-kun, let’s enjoy ourselves in the mock battle!!”</p>
<p>Galleon started to warm up his huge body. The sound of creaking and cracking could be heard.</p>
<p>“In general, mages fight at medium to long-range using magic, but in the case of close-quarters combat, using body strengthening magic and magic equipment are the bread and butter for mages!!”</p>
<p>The gauntlets on Galleon’s hands are ‘Magic Equipment’. They are optimized for mages to use magic.</p>
<p>“I will lend you my own magic equipment! Do you have any magic equipment that you would like to use!?”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the offer, but it’s okay because it’ll break when I use it.”</p>
<p>“Is that so!! Then you will just fight without one!!”</p>
<p>“I wish you would have said something like, <em>‘Let&#8217;s stop for safety reasons’</em>.”</p>
<p>As he answers, Reid lightly moves his arms and legs to check his physical condition.</p>
<p>It has been eighteen years since he has fought in a battle.</p>
<p>However, he had trained so that his body still remembers the movement.</p>
<p>“By the way, what are the conditions for winning?”</p>
<p>“Hmm! Then, if you can avoid all my attacks for one hour from now, you will win!! No matter how prepared you are, it will be difficult for you to land a blow on me!!”</p>
<p>With a confident look, Galleon grabbed his fists, signaling his eagerness to start the fight.</p>
<p>Galleon is also a son-in-law of the Caldwen family. Then there is no doubt that he is a very competent mage.</p>
<p>In other words ―― he is a perfect measure of modern mages’ ability.</p>
<p>“Then, after avoiding all attacks, I will make a blow, okay?”</p>
<p>“Oh!? If you can do that, I’ll give you the right to call me Daddy!!”</p>
<p>“Please let me just call you father-in-law.”</p>
<p>After answering, Reid looked at Galleon.</p>
<p>“Oh, and I would like to confirm one more thing ――”</p>
<p>Reid tells Galleon with a grin.</p>
<p>“―― Please don’t complain if I happen to destroy the whole building.”</p>
<p>It was the very same grin he used to have when he was called ―― the ‘Hero’, in the past.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Elria sat on a chair in her room in the main building, waiting for the time to pass. She then turns around when she hears a light knock on the door.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Reid, is that you?”</p>
<p>She called out, but the response she got was from someone else.</p>
<p>“It’s me. May I come in to talk to you?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Yes.”</p>
<p>Elria prompted.</p>
<p>Alicia quietly opened the door and entered the room.</p>
<p>“What happened to Reid?”</p>
<p>“Galleon is dealing with him now. And so, I thought I would hear from you again.”</p>
<p>With a smile, Alicia sat down on the sofa in the room.</p>
<p>Mimicking her mother, Elria also sat down on the opposite side, facing this sofa.</p>
<p>“I’m going to ask you again&#8230; Are you sure he’s the <em>‘Reid’</em> you’re talking about?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m sure of it. He is the <em>‘Reid’</em> I knew.”</p>
<p>She has never once forgotten about him.</p>
<p>Even after being reincarnated a thousand years later, she still thought of Reid every day.</p>
<p>And ―― at last, she was able to find him.</p>
<p>“I never thought you would actually find him.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yes, I was a little worried, too.”</p>
<p>There was no basis that Reid was reincarnated as Elria did. It was merely a ‘wish’ of hers. Having been reincarnated in a world a thousand years later and being alone again… she simply wished, <em>‘I wish he were here’,</em> like a spoiled child.</p>
<p>“But… Reid is really here.”</p>
<p>Elria could not help but smile as she recalled their reunion. The look of surprise on Reid’s face. It was the same as when they had first met. A time when they were neither the ‘Hero’ nor the ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>Seeing Elria’s smile, Alicia also smiled wryly.</p>
<p>“You really like him, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Yes.”</p>
<p>In response to Alicia’s words, Elria nodded softly.</p>
<p>“―― I like Reid.”</p>
<p>She speaks her mind with confidence. But later, cast her eyes downward to hide her face, which was getting bright red for having said that.</p>
<p>“Maybe, I like… him… I think?”</p>
<p>“Why are you gradually losing confidence?”</p>
<p>“Because… I never felt that way… before…!”</p>
<p>She taps her cheeks repeatedly as if to cool them.</p>
<p>After all, they had fought each other as enemies in their previous lives.</p>
<p>A strange person who always smiles with confidence and fights dutifully.</p>
<p>It was when she was on the verge of death that she realized that she ‘likes’ him.</p>
<p>Elria had devoted herself to the study and spread of magic. For this reason, she continued to overwork her body&#8230; until her consciousness gradually grew dim, and when she came to, she was in a world a thousand years in the future.</p>
<p>At that time, the first thing that came to mind was the figure of the ‘Hero’.</p>
<p>The figure who fought against old age, which is the fate of humans, and yet he wanted to settle the battle with her.</p>
<p>And that was why ―― Elria wished to see him again.</p>
<p>She wanted to see his smile again.</p>
<p>She wanted to have a good time with him again.</p>
<p>And if she could see him again ――</p>
<p>“―― I thought that this time I would be able to say I like him.”</p>
<p>A wish that could not be fulfilled in her previous life due to their positions and race.</p>
<p>Wanting to fulfill her wish, Elria clung to what little hope she had and kept looking for Reid, believing that he had been reincarnated.</p>
<p>Hearing Elria’s answer, Alicia tilted her head dubiously.</p>
<p>“&#8230;How can I say this, you two think alike.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Reid and I think alike?”</p>
<p>“It’s the way you talk about the present as if it were the past or the way you look at things in light of the past…”</p>
<p>“I-I guess I’m just not good at talking…”</p>
<p>“I know… Well, if you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>When Alicia stared at her, Elria waved her hand around to deceive her.</p>
<p>She has not told her parents about her own reincarnation.</p>
<p>At one point, she thought about telling her own parents or someone else that she knew.</p>
<p>However… She felt that if they knew about it, it would diminish the connection between Reid and her, so she somehow could not talk about it.</p>
<p>“&#8230;That’s because it’s our secret.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Then I won’t ask.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mm, thank you.”</p>
<p>Seeing Alicia smiling and stroking her head, Elria also naturally smiled back.</p>
<p>“So, you’ve already told him how you feel, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Eh?”</p>
<p>“He told me you two were getting engaged, so you told him that you like him, right?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>Thinking back, she did not seem to have told him.</p>
<p>Even during their reunion and when they got here, she did not tell him.</p>
<p>Seeing Elria starting to tremble, Alicia sighed as if she had guessed it.</p>
<p>“Haa… I knew you were shy and clumsy with words, but I can’t believe you couldn’t even tell him that…”</p>
<p>“N-No, it’s not what you think&#8230; I thought about it a lot, and the word ‘marriage’ came up first…!!”</p>
<p>She was not lying.</p>
<p>Being reunited with Reid made Elria’s thoughts spin more than at any other time in her life. It was probably the greatest speed of thought in the history of her life. And it was then she thought,<em> “I can solve all of Reid’s current situation by being engaged to him and using the Caldwen’s name and status”</em>.</p>
<p>As a result, her emotions could not keep up with her thoughts, and the process of telling him her feelings blew up.</p>
<p>“Besides… I wanted to see him smile&#8230;”</p>
<p>The smile he always showed her in battles.</p>
<p>He did not have that smile on his face when they met again.</p>
<p>A smile that looked somewhat incomplete, akin to resignation.</p>
<p>It was because she had figured that proposing the ‘engagement’ was a way to solve the problem and also used their past ‘promise’ to encourage him to go along with the idea.</p>
<p>That is just how much she wanted him to smile as he did then.</p>
<p>“Oh well… he’s such a good person to say something like that even in this kind of situation…”</p>
<p>“What did Reid say to you?”</p>
<p>When Elria tilted her head and asked, Alicia smiled with a satisfied look on her face.</p>
<p>“I can’t tell you that. Make sure you tell him your feelings and then ask him.”</p>
<p>“Eh…? What?”</p>
<p>Alicia giggles as she looks at the flustered Elria.</p>
<p>“This is getting interesting. I was going to stop the engagement if I got a disappointing result, but now it might be more interesting to approve it and let Galleon train him.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What are Father and Reid doing?”</p>
<p>“Well. I gave him a lot of conditions to approve the engagement. But he told me he couldn’t use magic, so now I’m having Galleon check on his abilities.”</p>
<p>……………</p>
<p>…………………</p>
<p>“Mother.”</p>
<p>“If you’re asking me to cut corners, I won’t listen, okay? With his family background and the inability to use magic, the eyes of people around you will be harsher, so he needs to be somewhat competent even if he can’t use magic ――”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not it.”</p>
<p>“Then speak up.”</p>
<p>“Well, to be clear ――”</p>
<p>The moment Elria was about to say something, a thunderous roar rang out from the direction of the annex.</p>
<p>And then, as if delayed, the crushing sound of the building collapsing could be heard.</p>
<p>“Father is in danger.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Huh?”</p>
<p>“I forgot to tell Mother, but Reid is very strong.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Wait, he can’t use magic, right?”</p>
<p>“He certainly can’t, but Reid doesn’t need to use magic in the first place.”</p>
<p>In the magic system created by Elria, Reid cannot use magic with his magic power.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is not wrong to say that Reid cannot use magic.</p>
<p>However, Reid has been fighting with Elria and ending in draws.</p>
<p>A person who simply cannot use magic would not be able to go toe-to-toe with Elria.</p>
<p>As for his strength, Elria can only describe it as ‘strong’.</p>
<p>“―― Reid is simply a ‘strong person’.”</p>
<p>Immediately after she said this, an explosion rang out near the room.</p>
<p>When Elria approached the window, a thick cloud of dust was rising in the air.</p>
<p>“―― Heyyy!! Can anyone hear me!?”</p>
<p>Reid’s voice can be heard through the dust cloud.</p>
<p>“Reid, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Elria, is that you!? Did you see Galleon-san!?”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Not this way, huh!? Damn it, even though I was going easy on him!!”</p>
<p>“What did Reid do?”</p>
<p>“Ahh!! I asked Galleon-san if I could destroy the building, and he told me to give it my all so I just punched him!!”</p>
<p>Alicia was dumbfounded, with her mouth open as she heard Reid’s screams.</p>
<p>As he said, Reid must have just punched Galleon.</p>
<p>With just that ―― Reid had survived the battlefield.</p>
<p>No cheap tricks or tactics were involved.</p>
<p>He may be human, but his physical abilities far exceed the norm for humans.</p>
<p>A simple yet ridiculous strength.</p>
<p>With a single swing of his fist, he has the monstrous strength to knock down magic and all beings.</p>
<p>With such absolute ‘strength’, Reid has forced everything to yield.</p>
<p>And that’s why ―― he was called a ‘Hero’ who has no equal.</p>
<p>“So, does Mother recognize Reid’s strength?”</p>
<p>Elria smiled at the dumbfounded Alicia.</p>
<p>The existence of the ‘Hero’ who was once evenly matched with the ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>And that’s why she was able to say it ――</p>
<p>“―― The man that I like is the &#8216;strongest&#8217;.”</p>
<p>Prouder than anyone else.</p>
<p>She smiled brilliantly as if to flaunt the ‘Hero’ that she had fallen in love with.</p>
