<h3>Chapter 5: The Man Who Became a Hero at the End</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the fateful morning came――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh no! Did I oversleep?!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I woke up, I realized that the alarm on my phone hadn’t gone off. In a panic, I picked up my smartphone from my bedside and found out that its battery had already dried out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was no wonder that the alarm didn&#8217;t go off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please, please, please, please! Still be morning, be morning, be morning!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While praying to God, I ran into the living room and checked the wall clock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was fifteen minutes before the school bell rang.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If I hurry up, I can just make it in time!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt so relieved&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had just been involved in a fight. On top of that, if I&#8217;m late, I felt like that combination would end up giving off the worst possible outcome ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this in mind, I knew it would not be long before my neck would be disconnected from my body!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, it was not actually the time to feel relieved!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly got dressed and left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ran through the school road at full speed, made my way into the entrance hall, changed into indoor shoes, and dashed with all my might to the principal&#8217;s office!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the principal&#8217;s office, there were all familiar faces with serious expressions standing around there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku, Akari, and Mashiro-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing me out of breath and running toward them, the three of them had rather relieved looks on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m relieved that Touma-kun is now here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was worried that you would voluntarily drop out of school when you didn’t show up. You haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, really. Go in without any worries.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I told the principal what had happened yesterday. I&#8217;m sure he will understand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no idea if I was going to be reprimanded once I went inside, but the three of them had done everything they could for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Knowing that I had three strong heartfelt friends on my side, I was very much relieved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just knowing that made me feel a little better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is the Principal&#8230; in there already?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He’s been waiting for you for about an hour now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uwaa. I had been keeping him waiting for so long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal&#8217;s goodwill toward me should be pretty non-existent now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I made him wait any longer, I had a feeling that I may be expelled from school the moment I walked into his office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a deep breath and calming myself down, I knocked on the heavy door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8211; Enter.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I received permission, I entered the room, feeling very tense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you quite late today? Did you oversleep on a day as important as this?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the principal who said so with a groaning voice from his seat on the leather sofa.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His stature was just as scary as a yakuza, with a body that would definitely suit someone who practiced judo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was at a level that would make anyone scream and run away the moment you encountered such a frightful figure on the road at night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn’t run away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deeply bowed my head with the utmost respect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I apologize to my best ability for being late!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. It seems that the vice principal only told you to go to the principal&#8217;s office before homeroom. I did expect a much later visit than normal, well, it&#8217;s still very much before the homeroom after all. For now, have a seat.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes, excuse me&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on the sofa as the principal peered across the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a rather luxurious sofa, but perhaps because of the tense atmosphere I found myself in, I couldn&#8217;t feel comfortable sitting in it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my anxiety reaching new peaks at every passing moment, the principal said, &#8220;Well then… Is it true that you were involved in a fight at Cosmoland?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes, it&#8217;s true&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, can you tell me how the fight started all in all? I&#8217;ve already heard about the incident from the teachers, but I&#8217;d like to hear your side of the story as well.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, I&#8230; no, eh, I, uh no, perhaps&#8230; me?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing to be anxious about. It&#8217;s fine to be just your usual self.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, sorry. Then I will take on your suggestion. Yesterday, I saw Shirasawa-san and Akamine-sensei being hit on by a party of two men at Cosmoland. But it was when they said something really rude to Shirasawa-san … that I really lost my cool. Right when they had caught hold of my collar and were about to punch me, I gave them a headbutt straight to the head.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So in short, you intervened out there to protect my daughters?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if not willing to miss even the slightest lie, he looked straight into my eyes for confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sharp glint in his eyes made me want to look away immediately, but I held back my impulses and nodded while staring right back at the principal’s eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true that I intervened. Of course, I had only intervened because I wanted to, and it&#8217;s not like I was pushed by the three girls to do so. So, if you&#8217;re going to punish someone, please let it be me and me alone.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I had no intention of punishing the three of them from the beginning. And from what I&#8217;ve heard, your actions seem like self-defense.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing his judgment of self-defense, I could see the light of hope at the end of the tunnel for a moment. However――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal gave me a stern look and my faint hope that I might be forgiven was forever crushed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whether it was in self-defense or not, the fact remains that you got into a fight outside of school. And then, acknowledging the precedent, you should definitely be expelled from our academy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Was there a student who went through the same thing as me in the past?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not exactly the same. To tell the truth, the two men you were engaged in a quarrel with were students who were enrolled at our school four years ago.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? They were past students of this very same academy?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. The two of them caused a violent incident during a fellowship excursion. I expelled them myself from our school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did the exact same thing they did &#8212; I got into a fight in Cosmoland on a fellowship excursion trip.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was following my precedents and the likelihood that I would be expelled from school was great.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even then &#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What leaked out of my mouth was such a careless line.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, being expelled from school was a great shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the shock didn&#8217;t make me faint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just that, as I was feeling kind of relieved, all sense of tension escaped my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My punishment has been decided, but Akari, Kohaku, and Mashiro-san wouldn’t be punished.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt sorry for the three people who tried to protect me from this very outcome, but&#8230; I didn’t regret what I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I hadn&#8217;t moved at that time, Mashiro-san might have been attacked with even worse words and she might have suffered a deep wound in her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the vice principal had seen Akari and Kohaku making moves to protect Mashiro-san and arguing with those pick-up artists, they might have been labeled as problem teachers and their teaching careers would have ended forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: This is what education teaches us&#8230; get yourself killed if someone comes to kill you. Just so that you aren’t killed socially. Hilarious. The very reason why generally no educated person is happy.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was able to protect the three by taking action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was going to be expelled from school, I was able to protect my beloved ex-girlfriends and friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There should be no regrets whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I apologize for causing such inconvenience this time!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Accepting the verdict of expulsion, I bowed my head deeply in reverence before exiting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You seem to be misunderstanding something over here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my head while still being puzzled by the words that suddenly came out from the principal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8220;A misunderstanding&#8230; like?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He nodded his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have no intention of expelling you.&#8221; Saying that, he smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Umm, then will I be forgiven with suspension?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t even be suspending you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Why is that?! Even though I did the same thing as the two who were expelled from the school previously&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is it the same thing? The two men I expelled picked up on a junior high school girl while shoving her boyfriend aside. Even though the police didn&#8217;t turn up at the scene at the time, I couldn&#8217;t let the violent students from my school go unnoticed. That&#8217;s why I gave them the most severe punishment that I could at that time from my end.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal’s originally grim face instead turned gentle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But on the other hand, you fought to protect the self-respect of your fellow students and teachers. Furthermore, it was the other party who pushed you into a fight, so they provoked you. It&#8217;s true that you got involved in a fight, so I can&#8217;t praise you out in the open. But, luckily it&#8217;s just you and me who are present in this room. So, taking this opportunity, I&#8217;d like to thank you for standing up and showing courage to protect the self-respect and honor of our teachers and students.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you telling me, I won’t be punished at all?!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And on top of that, I was getting thanked by the principal at that…?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“… Is it okay for me to continue coming to school?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, keep working hard on your studies.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart was filled with joy as he told me this with a smile on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes! Thank you! I will study hard so that I can graduate safely!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just when I declared this out loud that the door opened and three people rushed into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just heard you thank the principal right now! So, if you said thanks just now, it means that you are forgiven, correct?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a given that he&#8217;s forgiven. He&#8217;s done nothing wrong in the first place.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s strange to get expelled from school just for protecting us girls from bad people. I&#8217;m sure the principal also understood this as fact as well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: It’s just that we live in a world where such things can as well happen, like what happened to Karma-kun in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Assasination Classroom</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of them were looking at me with expectant eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal nodded majestically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He&#8217;s blameless. There&#8217;s nothing for you to worry about. So go to class. Soon &#8212;&#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as he was saying that, the school bell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of them left the principal&#8217;s office with big smiles on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll excuse myself too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait right there. Before you go, there&#8217;s one thing I need to confirm with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His face was even more serious than it was before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t help but look away instinctively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, my eyes settled on a Japanese sword hanging on the wall!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The episode I heard from Mashiro-san just the other day crossed my mind as a prophecy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">T-That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s an imitation sword, right? It wasn’t the real thing right?!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hou~. Are you also interested in Nihon-tou?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL notes: Nihon-tou = Katana]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he saw me staring at the sword, the principal said this in a rather delighted tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-17726" src="https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Chapter5Part2.jpeg?resize=355%2C495&#038;ssl=1" alt width="355" height="495" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Chapter5Part2.jpeg?resize=215%2C300&amp;ssl=1 215w, https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Chapter5Part2.jpeg?resize=734%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 734w, https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Chapter5Part2.jpeg?resize=768%2C1072&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Chapter5Part2.jpeg?resize=75%2C106&amp;ssl=1 75w, https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Motokano-Sensei-Chapter5Part2.jpeg?w=1022&amp;ssl=1 1022w" sizes="(max-width: 355px) 100vw, 355px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Well, I&#8217;m somewhat interested&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Specifically, more on how you’re planning on using it.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">After learning that I was dating Kohaku, you wouldn&#8217;t go and slash me with that, right?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I wanted to ask, but since it was a suicidal act, I decided to stop right there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, I asked, &#8220;Why are you keeping a sword in your office?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I used to practice kendo when I was a student. So when I look at the sword, I always feel firm and righteous. Of course, you could say that I kept it in the office because I love Nihon-tou in the first place. But for me, as a follower, I embrace the virtue that it brings with it. I keep it in my office as a reminder of all that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I see, so that was the reason behind it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that the whole incident earlier was just Mashiro-san&#8217;s own misunderstanding. As it turned out, he didn&#8217;t threaten the male teacher who made advances on Kohaku with that very sword.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Especially for the teacher who was courting my daughter with ill intentions, I showed him the blade of that up close.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;re seriously threatening me right now, sir!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, with that in mind, I&#8217;d like you to ask—&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal said it with the worst preface ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8220;Y-You&#8217;re not dating my daughter, are you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">HE IS ABSOLUTELY SUSPICIOUS OF ME!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">HE IS DEFINITELY SEEING ME WITH SUSPICIOUS EYES!</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no! Calm down me! If I faltered over here, it was like admitting that in the first place! Don’t be stupid!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Daughter? Which one?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Obviously, I’m talking about Mashiro! Don&#8217;t tell me, are you going out with Kohaku?!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That principal was grabbing hold of the Katana at this moment!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Obviously that&#8217;s UNTRUE! We only have a teacher-student relationship in the first place! Of course, I&#8217;m not dating Shirasawa-san as well!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to deny that to such a degree. Are my daughters not attractive?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Absolutely not! They are incredibly attractive! Incredibly cute!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal was happy. He let go of his hand from that sword in reaction to my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that right, isn&#8217;t that right? Both of them are my proud daughters whom I raised with the utmost care. I have no intentions of giving them to a man of whom I have no understanding about in the first place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL notes: The last line, in purity goes like this, I have no intention of giving my daughters to a man, whom I don&#8217;t even know is the bone of which horse in the first place. A Japanese idiom basically.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even then, the principal gritted his teeth in disgust as he continued, &#8220;There’s a chance that Mashiro is in love with a man with a loose character!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Shirasawa-san?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think that&#8217;s definitely a misunderstanding on the principal&#8217;s part&#8230; Mashiro-san seemed rather distrustful in general toward men. Furthermore, Mashiro-san to be in love with a man who flirted and has a loose character&#8230; isn&#8217;t that the exact opposite of her preference&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You probably haven&#8217;t seen it before, but Mashiro had such beautiful black hair before. It was to the degree that it wasn&#8217;t even strange for shampoo companies to ask for her to appear in commercials! But she dyed her hair blonde. I can&#8217;t help but think of it as an influence from a man who flirts and has a loose character!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Did you hear that from the person in question?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “No matter how many times I call her in the principal’s office and even ask her questions, she would always evade me, saying 『Well, I wonder if that is so?』I’m already just so worried sick about Mashiro right now…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I know why Mashiro-san dyed her hair blonde.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> It was presumably because she wanted to pull all the attention of the principal onto herself so that &#8212;- Kohaku would be able to escape the principal&#8217;s hawk-like scrutiny. By putting all the attention on herself, she was able to keep Kohaku out of trouble.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she might just be trying to be fashionable, but&#8230; if it was all as per my deductions, I think Mashiro-san was a really kind girl who wholeheartedly cared about her Elder Sister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;d be fine with a man with a strong sense of justice like you, but I&#8217;ll never accept a man who has a flirty and nonsensical character to deprive me of my pure Mashiro-chan!&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?! You mean it&#8217;s okay for me to go out with your daughter?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;WHO GAVE YOU THE CONSENT TO BE IN A ROMANTIC SITUATION WITH MY DAUGHTER PU****KKKKK! YOU FU***ERRRRRRR! EN GARDEEEEEEEE!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gy&#8211;AAAHHHHH!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Calm down already.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal, who was just about to swing his sword, suddenly returned to his senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something occurred to him just then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here I thought that I was going to die&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After coughing for a bit, the principal said, “Given the argument, I will allow you to go out with Mashiro for now. But I won’t allow you to go out with Kohaku. Because a teacher and a student aren’t allowed to be in a relationship, you see. Even though I don&#8217;t want to even imagine that yet, even if you’re planning to go out with Kohaku, I will have you hold your reins till you graduate. Obviously, given the predicament that you are in and that you’re in love with each other in the first place, I want to give you guys an opening.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my relationship with her was found out before graduation, I think I would be taken out without a doubt, huh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From now on, I had to pay close attention to our every meeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s the end of our discussion. From now, I have to go and deliver justice to those fools who dared to mock my pretty cutie angel. Excuse me then.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that he was planning to visit the homes of those pick-up b******s from now on. I was sure they feared the principal. I could already picture their crying faces when the principal would come over to confront them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, with this, I shall take my leave.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed my head and left the principal&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From now on&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wonder what will happen&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was safely freed from guilt and was feeling cheerful, but as the 3rd year class approached, anxiety began to well up in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I escaped expulsion and suspension this time, but then, it was true that I had used violence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that scene was witnessed by a first-year student &#8212; and if that story spread, everyone in the class might already be scared of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I was able to get away with it. From now on, I was going to maintain a perfect attendance record until the day of my graduation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to enjoy a happy school life and graduate while laughing and hanging out with everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was kind of scared of my classmates&#8217; reaction&#8230; but nothing good would happen if I were to run away from here now. I planned on coming to school every day with dignity!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking such thoughts, I arrived in front of the Class 3 door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to wipe away my uneasiness, I puffed out my chest and opened the door, and at that moment――</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O~h! Here comes the hero!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was greeted with the sound of applause. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What the h**l is going on?!</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">By hero, do you mean me?!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Men and women gathered around me as the captain of the volleyball club tapped me on my shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard from a junior! That you headbutted the pick-up b******s straight in their faces!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well done in protecting Shirasawa-sensei and Akamine-sensei right there!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nijino-kun is the boy hero!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s really cool!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;On top of that, Nijino-kun, you also protected Shirasawa-san, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I always thought you looked scary, but you were actually kind!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re really a hero!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With confused eyes, I saw everyone cheer for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t think that by protecting Takamine-sensei and Mashiro-san, I would end up becoming labeled as a hero and after being isolated for so long that I&#8217;d end up becoming a popular person instead!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While receiving the loud cheers of my classmates, I started having a good feeling about my future bright school life that would start from now on.</span></p>
