<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the book,『Ex-girlfriend wants to re-nurture love with me starting with a slightly naughty home visit.』 thank you very much for having this volume 1 here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think some people will read starting from the afterword, so I would like to introduce the contents of this work in such a way so as not to spoil the actual storyline in any way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the title suggests, this work is about a heroine who is a teacher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I debuted, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen many stories where the teacher was the main heroine, but as time went on, I think it was not such a rare storyline anymore, so I decided to make the teacher the ex-girlfriend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa Kohaku and Akamine Akari.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are two ex-girlfriends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And they both love their ex-boyfriend, Touma Nijino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What kind of days will Touma Nijino, a high school boy who reunites with his ex-girlfriends at school, be like &#8212;- I hope this excites you and makes you enjoy the story to the fullest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this, I will go to the Acknowledgments.</span></p>
