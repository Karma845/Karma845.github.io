<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 2</b></h1>


<p>A month has passed since the annex of the Caldwen estate was smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>During that time, many things happened.</p>
<p>First, Reid informed his mother and the village chief back home that he could not return for the time being because he was now officially engaged to the eldest daughter of the Caldwen family, Elria.</p>
<p>His mother’s response was,<em> “Oh, I see! It’s a prank, right!? I won’t be fooled, but I’m looking forward to seeing your father’s reaction when he gets back!!” </em>and,<em> “If you are going to stay in the royal capital, can you send me some souvenirs?”</em>.</p>
<p>The engagement was officially approved by the family head, Alicia.</p>
<p>In addition to the first set of conditions, he also received a mix of encouragement and resentment, saying, <em>“Go make a name for yourself so that you can make up for the fact that you destroyed the annex”</em>.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Galleon, who had been blown away in the aftermath of the beating, was found without incident and is now back to work as a mage after being treated with healing magic.</p>
<p><em>“You have got over the father-in-law wall!!,”</em> he said and laughed loudly, so it is fair to say that he approved of Reid, too.</p>
<p>In the past month, Reid has also made several other preparations ――</p>
<p>“―― Wow, that’s a hell of a crowd.”</p>
<p>He arrived in front of the academy, where the examination was held, and expressed his feelings.</p>
<p>Vegalta Royal Magic Academy.</p>
<p>It is the oldest and most magnificent educational institution specializing in magic on the continent.</p>
<p>There are many other Magic Academies scattered throughout the continent, but Vegalta Royal Magic Academy, which is considered the cradle of magic, is ranked the highest among them.</p>
<p>The most advanced magic technology has been introduced throughout the academy, a library of knowledge in various magic fields has been gathered, and active mages with various achievements are in charge of teaching.</p>
<p>Even just gaining admission to the academy is a splendid career achievement, and anyone who took the entrance examination may be given preferential treatment as someone with an adequate amount of magic power.</p>
<p>There are many people of different ages and appearances at the examination venue. Some were clearly over thirty, while others were children who appeared to be just twelve years old. The older ones were probably those who had studied at other academies before enrolling in the Royal Magic Academy.</p>
<p>There are also those who wear local clothes, some wearing unfamiliar ornaments and others wearing what appears to be foreign folk clothing, indicating that the Royal Magic Academy in Vegalta is a special place in the world of magic supremacy.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, Elria, you’re currently sixteen years old, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ll be sixteen this year.”</p>
<p>“Then why didn’t you enroll when you were twelve?”</p>
<p>“Because I was looking for Reid.”</p>
<p>“Well, thank you for your time.”</p>
<p>“And I also had to postpone it because of family matters.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What do you mean by family matters?”</p>
<p>“The princess was scheduled to enter the academy at the same time as me, and if I did enter at the same time, I would have taken first place in everything, so the king personally asked me to postpone my entrance to keep up the appearance of the royal family.”</p>
<p>“To get a personal request from the king, as expected of Elria…”</p>
<p>“Yes. The sweets they gave me as a gift were very delicious.”</p>
<p>Elria nodded her head as she spoke of her carefree thoughts.</p>
<p>Although the Caldwen family’s status is second only to the royal family, they still could not afford to disrespect the monarch’s face, so Alicia must have arranged for the enrolment to be postponed.</p>
<p>But that was not the only reason for postponing it ――</p>
<p>“So, Elria-san.”</p>
<p>“Hm…? What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“For how long are you going to stick behind me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Since arriving at the examination venue, Elria had been sticking behind Reid all the time.</p>
<p>She is carefully tugging at the hem of his clothes.</p>
<p>“Because&#8230; I feel like everyone is going to be looking at me&#8230;”</p>
<p>After answering, Elria shrinks back to hide.</p>
<p>In the past month, he has learned that Elria’s popularity is quite high.</p>
<p>Not only is she from the Caldwen family that has inherited the name of the Sage, but she is also a child full of talent in magic that is worthy of her name and is even called the reincarnation of the Sage by those around her.</p>
<p>In fact, she is the very person herself, but those involved in magic must be so interested in her that they call her the ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>And her appearance spurs the situation.</p>
<p>She has silver hair that shimmers gently in the sunlight, eyes the color of the deep sea that shine like jewels, and a face so well-featured that men and women of all ages would admire it.</p>
<p>And perhaps because of her slim and elegant body that would be the envy of any woman, her bosom, which, while not bosomy, certainly accentuates her femininity, stands out unintentionally.</p>
<p>When such a girl was walking around, everyone would involuntarily look at her.</p>
<p>However, for the shy Elria, the gazes of others are not something she is comfortable with.</p>
<p>As a result, she has been hiding behind Reid all the time.</p>
<p>“That’s why… I’m going to stick behind Reid like this…”</p>
<p>“It’s so hard to walk.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Would it be easier to walk if it’s a piggyback ride?”</p>
<p>“A piggyback ride would just attract more attention.”</p>
<p>Reid scratches his head and lets out a sigh as Elria clutches his clothes.</p>
<p>“They’re not really looking at you in a weird way, but it’s because you’re cute.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I am cute?”</p>
<p>Then, for the first time, Elria looked up, reacting with a twitch.</p>
<p>“Before, you were an elf, so you probably stood out, but now you’re just a regular human. So that’s what I mean when I say they are looking at you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Do you think so too, Reid?”</p>
<p>“Ah? This is not about me ――”</p>
<p>“It’s very important, so answer me.”</p>
<p>Elria tightens her grip on Reid’s clothes as she presses her lips together.</p>
<p>Not wanting to have his clothes torn, Reid told her honestly what he thought.</p>
<p>“Well… of course. I’d even want to brag about you to the people around me.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Thank you.”</p>
<p>After smiling, Elria let go of his clothes.</p>
<p>She then walks right next to Reid.</p>
<p>“In that case… I will make you proud.”</p>
<p>She looks up firmly with a smile.</p>
<p>After seeing Elria like that ――</p>
<p>“Then you can let go of my sleeves, too.”</p>
<p>“T-There’s still a lot of people around… so I’m going to use you as a lifeline&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Is it really that hard to be out in public?”</p>
<p>She starts walking around looking sharper than before, even though she is still holding on to Reid’s thin sleeve for her dear life.</p>
<p>It does not look good since she is still holding on to the sleeve, but it is not so bad, considering that it is a step forward.</p>
<p>“―― We’ll be conducting the practical examination shortly!! Those with a letter of introduction, please follow the instructions of nearby staff. General applicants, please gather at the place where the flag is raised!!”</p>
<p>A man, who is probably a staff member of the academy, shouts out, and the examinees start walking toward the designated area.</p>
<p>Following the instructions, Reid and Elria called out to a female staff member nearby.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, we were referred to by the Caldwen family…”</p>
<p>“Yes, may I see your letter of introduction?”</p>
<p>The female staff member nodded softly as Reid handed over the two letters of introduction he had received from Alicia.</p>
<p>“Elria Caldwen-sama and Reid Frieden-sama, right? I have verified your letters of introduction and will take you to the designated examination venue now.”</p>
<p>With a friendly smile, the female staff member leads the way.</p>
<p>“I never thought I would be able to guide the Caldwen family. Rumors have been circulating, especially about Elria-sama.”</p>
<p>“Mm… Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>Elria bowed awkwardly. As if like a wary small animal.</p>
<p>And now, the female staff member turns her attention to Reid.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… but I have not heard of Reid-sama’s family name, but I assume you are related to the Caldwen family?”</p>
<p>“Reid is my fiancé.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see, your fiancé…”</p>
<p>She spoke back vaguely, and then the staff member turned around vigorously.</p>
<p>“Elria-sama has a fiancé!?”</p>
<p>“Yes. We got engaged a month ago.”</p>
<p>“Then… congratulations, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Mm, thank you.”</p>
<p>Unlike earlier, Elria nodded her head in satisfaction.</p>
<p>“If I may ask, is Reid-sama from a distinguished family&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m just an extra, so please don’t mind me.”</p>
<p>“T-That’s just not possible! The whole country will be interested in a man who is engaged to Elria-sama, who is said to be the reincarnation of the Sage, you know!?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, that’s how it goes after all…”</p>
<p>Reid waved his hand with a fed-up expression as the female staff member approached him excitedly.</p>
<p>That reaction was expected.</p>
<p>His position as Elria’s fiancé attracts undeniable attention from others.</p>
<p>That is why Reid must show a result that is worthy of it.</p>
<p>In other words, it is not just a matter of passing the examination like usual ―― he has to show overwhelming ability.</p>
<p>“Haa&#8230; this is really depressing.”</p>
<p>“Everything will be fine. I believe in Reid.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your baseless words…”</p>
<p>Reid pats Elria on the head as she holds his hands and encourages him.</p>
<p>And so ―― another scene came into view.</p>
<p>“This will be the examination venue for our distinguished guests.”</p>
<p>It was a temporary lot outside the academy.</p>
<p>Facing away from the academy, some sort of device is set up.</p>
<p>“I hate to say this, but isn’t this a place a little too modest for distinguished guests?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to hear that… When it comes to guests who have been introduced to us, distinguished guests usually use magic that is so powerful and dangerous that we have to limit the damage through this method.”</p>
<p>The staff member bows her head apologetically with a wry smile.</p>
<p>Certainly, examinees would have to go all out to measure their abilities, and it is only natural that they have taken such measures to avoid the destruction of the equipment and damage to the academy.</p>
<p>“―― Yeah! Please be careful, a big one is coming!!”</p>
<p>A red-haired girl with a shrill and joyful voice said, far above them.</p>
<p>Right below her ―― is a huge black dragon.</p>
<p>Over the past thousand years, magic has developed in many different forms.</p>
<p>Not only does it create and shoot things like fire and ice out of thin air, as it did a thousand years ago, but their shapes can be changed into any desired form and be used as weapons, strengthening the mage’s own physical abilities and senses, there is also healing magic to enhance natural healing power and revive lost tissues.</p>
<p>And&#8230; the girl who rides the dragon is using magic called summoning magic.</p>
<p>Generally, it is a magic that involves enslaving magical beasts, which are usually considered Kaijus that attack humans, and summon them at will to engage in battle as servants. This magic is difficult to handle because it requires not only the caster&#8217;s magic power, but also the necessary qualifications recognized by the magical beast being enslaved.</p>
<p>However, the black dragon faithfully follows the girl without showing hostility toward her.</p>
<p>Perhaps noticing Reid’s gaze, the staff member added.</p>
<p>“Ah&#8230; She is Rufus Lailas-sama of the Serios Federation.”</p>
<p>“Serios Federation, you say… Are you talking about the country across the straits that lives in harmony with magical beasts?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The country is composed of seven Chief of State specializing in summoning magic, and is a country based on merit and talent, where superiority is determined by the magical beasts that have been enslaved.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;But then, why did she end up at the magic academy in Vegalta?”</p>
<p>“Well, even though the disputes with other countries have long since ceased… it is a great honor for a country to produce great mages, and if they can produce results at Vegalta Royal Magic Academy, the cradle of magic, they would have an advantage in cross-national relations.”</p>
<p>“In other words, it’s like a proxy war between countries?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. The king of Vegalta also recommends a magic competition between nations from the aspect of ‘promoting the development of magic’, and has promised to provide many benefits to the country where the top graduate belongs to. That is why influential people from other countries who have made a name for themselves and royalty from other countries who are talented in magic also wish to enroll in our magic academy.”</p>
<p>This is a world where magic reigns supreme.</p>
<p>This is true not only for Vegalta but for other countries as well, not only for the benefits in diplomatic relations that the king of Vegalta has promised but also for the advantage that mages from their own country can have an advantage over other countries by producing results.</p>
<p>“Rufus-sama is also related to one of the seven Chief of State of the Serios Federation and is widely known as the &lt;&lt;Dragon Princess&gt;&gt; because she is able to handle all four dragons that are the symbols of her country, the ‘Guardian Dragons’.”</p>
<p>“Heh&#8230; that’s quite amazing.”</p>
<p>Looking at the giant jet-black dragon in the distance, he expressed his thoughts.</p>
<p>At that moment… Elria unexpectedly pulled his sleeve. Moreover, for some reason, she seems to be a little grumpy.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I can use summoning magic, too.”</p>
<p>“Ah&#8230; Well, that’s only natural for you.”</p>
<p>“I can use many other kinds of magic, too.”</p>
<p>“Ah… Show me something really spectacular next time.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll show you something truly spectacular.”</p>
<p>Elria’s eyes were unusually motivated. It seems to have ignited her fighting spirit, but she must have remembered something from her old fighting days.</p>
<p>After such an exchange, the staff member from earlier led them to their designated position.</p>
<p>“Now then, please cast your magic toward the device placed over there.”</p>
<p>Pointing to a device visible in the distance, the staff member continued to explain.</p>
<p>“The device has multiple layers of protection and barrier magic attached to it. The result will be decided based on how much of that magic you can destroy within the time limit.”</p>
<p>“Does it matter what method is used to destroy that protection?”</p>
<p>“No, any method is acceptable. Basically, many would just use simple magic, but some people used the method of dismantling the magic itself by reversing it. That being said, the latter is a rare case, because it requires a deep knowledge of magic in general.”</p>
<p>In other words, it’s to, <em>“Hit them with everything you got”</em>.</p>
<p>“I will be the judge. Who would like to go first?”</p>
<p>“Then let’s start with me.”</p>
<p>With that, Elria took a step forward.</p>
<p>Then ―― she picked up the wand that was on her waist.</p>
<p>“―――― <strong>Deploy</strong>.”</p>
<p>In response to her soft voice, the wand in her hand changed shape. It then became a staff as tall as Elria. The tip began to have rings circling around a deep sea-colored jewel in the center, shining faintly.</p>
<p>It is a magic tool that is made for Elria.</p>
<p>“This time, I want to show Reid something good, so ――”</p>
<p>Lightly handling the huge staff, Elria looked at the device in the distance and then,</p>
<p>“―― I will cast magic that’s a little stronger.”</p>
<p>Such a muffled whisper.</p>
<p>As if to drown out her voice, a huge pillar of flame soared high into the sky.</p>
<p>The red pillar of flame turned the clear sky into a red lotus color as it engulfed the surrounding atmosphere with a thunderous roar similar to that of oxygen burning and exploding.</p>
<p>And now&#8230; there was not a shadow or figure left at the center of the explosion.</p>
<p>The surrounding area has turned to scorched earth, and the smoldering red flames continue to scorch the ground.</p>
<p>The sight left everyone speechless.</p>
<p>Seeing the overwhelming power, everyone understood the meaning of that word.</p>

<img src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/rhxs_vol1/RHXS_Vol1_07.jpeg">

<p><em>‘Sage’.</em></p>
<p>A great being who stands at the pinnacle of mages, she is worthy of being called as such.</p>
<p>However, she turns around with a nonchalant expression on her face.</p>
<p>“How was it, Reid?”</p>
<p>“It was a lot more flashy than before.”</p>
<p>“Because Reid wanted to see it. But I made sure to disable all the protection and barrier magic just before I unleashed, so it wouldn’t lower the power of the magic.”</p>
<p>“That’s amazing. It’s like the strongest set of greed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I tried a little harder.”</p>
<p>Elria stares at Reid with a slight blush on her cheeks. Perhaps she wants to be praised.</p>
<p>As he patted Elria on the head to reward her for her efforts, the staff member who had been paralyzed with shock after witnessing the scene called out to him.</p>
<p>“H-How can you look so calm after seeing that&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, well, I’m used to seeing that.”</p>
<p>“That magic is equivalent to the highest level of magic, the tenth tier, you know!? I’ve never seen anyone other than those who are registered as special rank mages using it!!”</p>
<p>said the staff member with a mixture of excitement and awe in her voice.</p>
<p>However, it was something that Reid had seen many times.</p>
<p>In her previous life, Elria used not only the magic from earlier but more powerful and battle-oriented magic with fewer gaps. She used a wide range of magic, not only on Reid personally but also for strategic purposes. Compared to that, it was probably more modest.</p>
<p>“More importantly, what are you going to do with that, Elria?”</p>
<p>“That?”</p>
<p>“That scorched ground over there.”</p>
<p>Reid pointed to the ground that was being scorched by fire.</p>
<p>The pillar of flame created by the magic has vanished, but the fire damage brought about by it is still scorching the ground.</p>
<p>“&#8230;It’s beautiful, I guess?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t asking for opinions…”</p>
<p>“Well, now I’ll use a different kind of magic to put out the fire.”</p>
<p>“The result is going to be a great flood. Oh well, I’ll handle it.”</p>
<p>In the stead of Elria, Reid steps forward.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, what would my evaluation be if I put that out?”</p>
<p>“Eh? Ah, yes, err&#8230; since that fire was created by magic, it would require magic of the same tier to offset it, so you would be evaluated to be on par with Elria-sama&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Ahh, then that would do it.”</p>
<p>Reid readies his fist as he gazes into a sea of blazing fire.</p>
<p>At that moment ―― the sensation of something gushing out was born inside his body.</p>
<p>The feeling as if one’s own body has switched to something else.</p>
<p>“―――― <strong>Ha!!</strong>”</p>
<p>The moment Reid swung his fist with a short breath ――</p>
<p>The pressure of his punch instantly erased the red flames that were encroaching on his vision.</p>
<p>With a sound that shook the air and the ground, the red flames were smashed and extinguished by the blow, and the aftermath of the blow cratered the ground.</p>
<p>And so… the red color that was in sight vanished, and a devastated land of mixed black and brown spread out in front of them.</p>
<p>“Phew&#8230; it’s been a long time since I’ve blown off Elria’s magic.”</p>
<p>“It was a good punch just like old times.”</p>
<p>“But still, it doesn’t feel right&#8230; I used to use weapons and armor.”</p>
<p>“It’s still good enough. Reid is strong, after all.”</p>
<p>As she says this, Elria stretches her body to put her hand on Reid’s head.</p>
<p>It looked very painful, so Reid thought that he would lower his head next time.</p>
<p>As they were having such an exchange ――</p>
<p>“Um… may I have a word with you two?”</p>
<p>The staff member trembled and showed the communication magic tool in her hand.</p>
<p>“The headmaster… wants me to bring in the people who had caused a ruckus here.”</p>
<p>The staff member who told them this was on the verge of tears.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Guided by a completely frightened staff member, Reid and Elria were ushered into the headmaster’s office.</p>
<p>“―― Please hold back your power in the academy.”</p>
<p>said the headmaster while burying herself in a luxurious chair.</p>
<p>“First, Elria Caldwen.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I have heard from the king of Vegalta that you have an extraordinary talent in the field of magic, and I have seen your abilities all the way here in my office.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“But it&#8217;s too strong that someone might die, so could you please make sure that you only use up to fifth tier magic while you are in the academy? If you don’t comply, you will be expelled.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Yes.”</p>
<p>After receiving the scolding, Elria lowers her head.</p>
<p>The headmaster then turned her gaze to Reid.</p>
<p>“Next, Reid Frieden.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I don’t really know about you. So, what are you?”</p>
<p>“Headmaster, I don&#8217;t understand your question.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m having trouble comprehending your very existence.”</p>
<p>The headmaster&#8217;s expression is distorted as she says this. She then sighed deeply before speaking.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been the headmaster of Vegalta Royal Magic Academy for nearly one hundred years now. Even so, I&#8217;ve never seen someone like you before.”</p>
<p>The headmaster ―― Elise Rummel, announced while wagging her characteristic long ears.</p>
<p>“Haaaa… I knew there might be something about Elria-kun, but I didn&#8217;t expect the other one to be nonstandard as well&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to let you get away with just that!”</p>
<p>Elise pointed, her ears twitching with anger. However, it was not scary looking at all.</p>
<p>At any rate ―― Elise is an elf who is said to be immortal. She looks to be about twelve years old, and due to her petite figure, she seems to be completely buried in the chair rather than sitting on it.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Reid whispers to Elria next to him.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Hey, Elria.”</p>
<p>“Mm, what&#8217;s the matter?”</p>
<p>“I knew that elves are immortal&#8230; but isn&#8217;t that headmaster younger than you?”</p>
<p>“Elves basically stop aging at around fifteen to twenty years of age, so they can look quite different. It is not surprising that there are those who look smaller than me.”</p>
<p>“In other words&#8230; the headmaster stopped growing before she stopped aging…?”</p>
<p>“Sadly, that is the fate of the elves.”</p>
<p>“Hey, did you guys just call me small!?”</p>
<p>Elise was banging on her desk, perhaps in response to the particular word.</p>
<p>The sight of her banging on the desk and her bouncing golden hair in two knots looked every bit like a child throwing a tantrum.</p>
<p>Satisfied after a round of desk banging, Elise sighs and buries herself in the chair.</p>
<p>“So, Reid-kun… The thing you did, that wasn’t magic, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, since I can&#8217;t use magic.”</p>
<p>“Then what was that?”</p>
<p>“It was just a punch.”</p>
<p>“You don’t make any sense…!!”</p>
<p>Elise said in a sad voice as she held her head.</p>
<p>For a little girl, she worries a lot.</p>
<p>“Anyway, can you go easy on that thing of yours&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can do that.”</p>
<p>“Then can you also hold back your power in the academy&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“Would that be a problem?”</p>
<p>“Of course, it would be a problem!!”</p>
<p>“I have been ordered by the Caldwen family to produce reasonable results due to the fact that I can’t use magic. I can cut corners, but I must avoid a situation where my engagement to Elria is called off.”</p>
<p>Among the conditions he has exchanged with Alicia is to show others that he is overwhelmingly capable of making them recognize him. It would be undesirable to lose the opportunity due to that.</p>
<p>That is why Elise also had a troubled look on her face.</p>
<p>“Alicia told me about the situation. So, since I was informed of the situation beforehand, I am certain that the responsibility lies with me for underestimating you.”</p>
<p>After saying this, Elise nodded her head in a composed manner.</p>
<p>“Then… how about we lift the restrictions only during the examination?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;So you don&#8217;t mind if I use it as long as it affects my evaluation?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right. I usually don&#8217;t mind if it&#8217;s a little, but please don&#8217;t go overboard like what you did earlier. If you destroy the venerable magic academy, I’ll be so mad.”</p>
<p>“You are very honest with yourself.”</p>
<p>“Because it&#8217;s mentally tough to be angry at someone when you&#8217;re over a hundred years old&#8230;”</p>
<p>Elise stared into the void with distant eyes as she honestly expressed her thoughts.</p>
<p>What a little girl with sad eyes.</p>
<p>“Even so… I never thought I would hear the names <em>‘Elria’</em> and <em>‘Reid’</em> at the same time.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you probably don&#8217;t know about it, because it&#8217;s only passed down among us elves, and I only heard a little bit about it from my grandfather.”</p>
<p>When Elise answered with a smile, Elria raised her hand quickly in panic.</p>
<p>“H-Headmaster!”</p>
<p>“What? What&#8217;s the matter, Elria?”</p>
<p>“T-Today… is a beautiful day, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yeah, it was dyed bright red just now, though?”</p>
<p>But her conversational skills were too poor to do anything.</p>
<p>While Elria flustered and panicked, Reid asked for details again.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Why is my name being passed down among the elves?”</p>
<p>“Well, not you exactly, but a man who was called ‘Hero’ a thousand years ago. His actions at the time of the death of the ‘Sage’ have been passed down among us elves.”</p>
<p>Elria had said something similar before.</p>
<p>The story of the ‘Hero’ is also passed down, but after a thousand years, it has been embellished to the point that it has become something else.</p>
<p>“What exactly was the story about?”</p>
<p>“W-What? You don&#8217;t have to look at me with such a serious expression on your face…”</p>
<p>“No, I was just curious when I heard there was a guy with the same name as me.”</p>
<p>No matter how unscrupulous things are being conveyed, the little information that is left after the death also counts. In that case, there is no harm in knowing.</p>
<p>“Hmm… It’s not going to be interesting for a boy like you, though?”</p>
<p>“Well, but I would still like to hear about it.”</p>
<p>“Since you insist, I will tell you ――”</p>
<p>Then, with a troublesome expression on her face, Elise continued ――</p>
<p>“―― It was a story about the ‘Hero’ who was in love with the ‘Sage’.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;In love?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“Who was in love with who?”</p>
<p>“The person who was called the ‘Hero’ was in love with the elf who was called the ‘Sage’. I heard this story from my grandfather when I was a child, and it&#8217;s the kind of story that every girl dreams of!”</p>
<p>Elise began to speak excitedly.</p>
<p>“The ‘Hero’ was an enemy of the ‘Sage’, but they wished for peace. The two of them had been fighting each other for more than fifty years to prevent any serious damage to their forces.”</p>
<p>“Oh… Is that so…”</p>
<p>“But during the battle, the ‘Sage’ got sick and died first. Upon receiving the news, the ‘Hero’ invaded the royal capital all by himself!!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, that&#8217;s amazing, isn&#8217;t it?”</p>
<p>“Moreover! Even though he was mortally wounded, the reason he went to the royal capital was to bid farewell to the ‘Sage’!! He was so cool!!”</p>
<p>Elise was speaking enthusiastically, her eyes already shining like a young maiden.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Reid could not help but look at Elria.</p>
<p>He saw the figure of Elria, who was looking away. And even her ears were bright red.</p>
<p>“At the time, elves were kept at a distance from humans, but the ‘Hero’ seemed to treat the ‘Sage’ as an equal, even though she was an elf! That&#8217;s why we elves are living together with humans now!”</p>
<p>“That was&#8230; something good, wasn&#8217;t it?”</p>
<p>“Well, as a fellow elf, I envy the ‘Sage’ as well! Even though they were enemies, they actually cared about each other that much!! In the end, the ‘Sage’ could not hear out the thoughts of the ‘Hero’, but I&#8217;m sure she would be happy to hear them!!”</p>
<p>Reid looked at the <em>‘Sage’</em> who was listening to the story.</p>
<p>She was trembling, looking at the floor in an attempt to hide her red face, and looked like she was seconds away from exploding with shame.</p>
<p>“There are many stories among the elves that are based on this legend ――”</p>
<p>“Headmaster, thank you very much for sharing them with us. I&#8217;m sorry, but Elria doesn&#8217;t seem to be feeling well, so may we take our leave?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? She is indeed bright red in the face… Is she alright?”</p>
<p>“She is fine, it&#8217;s just that she has a tendency to blush.”</p>
<p>“I see. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m going to say now, so please ask the staff nearby to join the other students. Also, please be sure to strictly adhere to the ability restrictions, okay?”</p>
<p>“I understand. We will excuse ourselves now.”</p>
<p>After bowing to Elise, Reid and Elria hurried out of the headmaster&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Shortly after closing the door, Reid sighs deeply.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I see. That certainly didn&#8217;t sound so bad.”</p>
<p>“Yeah&#8230; I don’t know why, but the story about the ‘Hero’ became so popular that it was passed down among the elves… t-that… w-we were in love.”</p>
<p>As she speaks, Elria slaps her own cheeks.</p>
<p>“I thought maybe it was a mistake or someone else&#8217;s creation… so I didn&#8217;t tell you because I thought it might make Reid feel unpleasant.”</p>
<p>Indeed, at the time, Elria had already passed away.</p>
<p>As she did not know the sequence of events, it cannot be helped that she did not understand why the ‘Hero’ had become so popular among the elves and would think that it was an embellished or a manufactured love story between the ‘Hero’ and the ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>However, only Reid knows about the actual events that happened.</p>
<p>Reid rushed there upon hearing the news of Elria&#8217;s death. He invaded enemy territory alone and went on a rampage, then lost his life after reaching Elria with wounds all over his body. But who would have thought it would be passed down as a love story?</p>
<p>“It was a mistake, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>With an apologetic look, Elria gets teary-eyed.</p>
<p>Seeing Elria like that&#8230; Reid scratched his head roughly.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a mistake.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Eh?”</p>
<p>“The story that has been passed down among the elves is something that actually happened.”</p>
<p>“T-That means… you came to see me when I died?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“You came alone and got yourself all battered?”</p>
<p>“No matter what, I had to get to the royal capital, I couldn&#8217;t just kill the disciples you raised. So I had a hard time getting beaten up one-sidedly.”</p>
<p>“T-Then&#8230;!”</p>
<p>Elria looks straight at Reid, blushing even more than before.</p>
<p>“What was Reid trying to tell me at the time?”</p>
<p>asked Elria, clutching his sleeve so as not to let Reid escape.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m really curious to know what Reid said at the end, because the story I read ended with the ‘Hero’ trying to say something…!”</p>
<p>Perhaps his last words did not reach anyone&#8217;s ears as Reid had used up all his strength then.</p>
<p>And so ――</p>
<p>“&#8230;I didn&#8217;t say anything.”</p>
<p>“B-But! I&#8217;ve read in other books that you were going to say something!!”</p>
<p>“I just felt like flapping my mouth like a fish gasping for air.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t get in that kind of mood right before you die&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t believe it myself as well.”</p>
<p>“S-So, what were you going to say!? What did Reid wanted to say to me!?”</p>
<p>“Look, more importantly, we should find the staff and join the others.”</p>
<p>Dragging Elria, who clung to his arm, Reid searched for the staff member to evade her questions.</p>
<p>He said those last words because he thought he would never see her again.</p>
<p>However, they were able to meet each other again.</p>
<p>In that case ―― there will be an opportunity to tell her eventually.</p>
<p>With that in mind, Reid smiled as he walked down the corridor.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>When they stopped a nearby staff member and asked for guidance, they were told that the other successful applicants were already waiting in the classroom. Reid and Elria were then led to their assigned classroom.</p>
<p>And the moment they opened the classroom door ――</p>
<p>“―― It’s Elria-sama!”</p>
<p>Someone spoke her name, and all the successful applicants in the classroom began to stir.</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the classroom, a crowd gathered around Elria.</p>
<p>“We saw your magic at the examination venue!”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve always heard a lot about Elria-sama, but I never thought that you could already cast tenth tier magic, you are truly worthy of succeeding in the name of the ‘Sage’!!”</p>
<p>“I was also watching from afar! The crimson-red hellfire rising to the heavens! I was truly amazed by your power that has already surpassed many other mages!”</p>
<p>Everyone praised Elria.</p>
<p>In response to that, Elria ――</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;! ……!!”</p>
<p>She was in a pinch.</p>
<p>Even if Elria tried to speak, she could only move her head left and right as they flooded her with questions.</p>
<p>And as a result of that ――</p>
<p>“R-Reid is… better than me…!”</p>
<p>Out of desperation, Elria nervously pointed at Reid.</p>
<p>At that moment, the students gathered around her turned their heads.</p>
<p>“Oh! We also saw your amazing feat! To have dispelled Elria-sama’s tenth tier magic, you must be quite skilled, too!!”</p>
<p>“I apologize for being impolite… but I have never seen you before and I don&#8217;t even know your name. So, could you tell me your name and which family you hail from&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“If you were accompanying Elria-sama, does that mean you have a connection to the Caldwen family!? And are you also avoiding public appearances like Elria-sama in order to conceal your abilities!?”</p>
<p>The students bombarded Reid with questions.</p>
<p>In response, Reid greeted them with a smile.</p>
<p>“First of all, I am deeply honoured by your words. My name is Reid Frieden and I will become a member of the Caldwen family.”</p>
<p>“Frieden… This is the first time I’ve heard of the family name. Are you from another country…?”</p>
<p>“Unlike all of you who are nobles, I am just a commoner. Because of this, I am often prejudiced as a student of magic… However, I am deeply impressed by everyone&#8217;s straightforwardness in praising me, regardless of their biases.”</p>
<p>“N-No… It&#8217;s only natural to evaluate someone based on their abilities!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yeah. Just like how the great ‘Sage’ was evaluated regardless of her elven origin. We, as students of magic, must have the generosity to accept those with abilities, regardless of their background.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that Reid was a commoner, some people around him showed complicated expressions, but he maintained his courteous attitude towards everyone and avoided causing any antipathy.</p>
<p>In any era, there will always be differences in social status.</p>
<p>Even when he was a ‘Hero’, he had been given the position of &#8216;General’ based on his various military achievements, but there were many who called Reid a lowborn and despised him for it.</p>
<p>That’s why he is accustomed to dealing with such people.</p>
<p>However, some of them can be rather troublesome to deal with ――</p>
<p>“―― Ha! I doubt he really has any ability.”</p>
<p>With that kind of remark, the crowd around Reid gradually dispersed to reveal the perpetrator.</p>
<p>It was a young man with curly red hair.</p>
<p>He appeared to be around Reid’s age, and he had a group of similarly aged boys following him like attendants.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that a mere commoner has dispelled a tenth tier magic? I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not stupid enough to believe that, and you don&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re that strong.”</p>
<p>The red-haired young man then casts his contemptuous gaze on Reid.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Reid lowered his head with a forced smile.</p>
<p>“Faregh-sama, son of the Welminan family. It is only natural that someone as talented as you would have harsh criticism and opinions about me.”</p>
<p>In the month leading up to his enrollment, Reid had been told by Alicia about not only the Caldwen family, but also the royal family of Vegalta and other influential families in the country.</p>
<p>One of those families was the Welminan family.</p>
<p>Like the royal family and the Caldwen family, the Welminan family is one of the oldest families in Vegalta and is regarded as a venerable family that has produced excellent mages for generations.</p>
<p>They have made exceptionally distinguished achievements in magic combat and subjugation of magical beasts, and because of their unwavering loyalty to the country, they have been granted the personal title of ‘Magic Knight’ by the king.</p>
<p>In particular, Faregh is blessed with a remarkable aptitude and magic power. It is said that he is a genius who would have received a lot of attention if it had not been for the presence of Elria.</p>
<p>However, being born into a family with status and honor, possessing exceptional talent beyond others, and being elevated by the people around him, can cause a person to become distorted.</p>
<p>As Alicia severely criticized, <em>“He became a helpless, egoistic bastard who lives to screw with others.”</em>.</p>
<p>“In the first place, how can a commoner like you have any connection to the Caldwen family? That is an insult to the distinguished families that have long protected Vegalta!”</p>
<p>“If you find my background unclear and suspicious, please be rest assured that you can ask the head of the family, Alicia, for confirmation. She will be able to verify me.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s not the point!! I don&#8217;t know what the Caldwen family is up to, but I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s unthinkable that someone of low birth like you would be able to enroll into this academy!!”</p>
<p>“However, I have been judged to have exceeded the standards in the written and practical examinations required by the academy, and have also received approval from the headmaster, Elise. Besides, the academy’s principle is that those talented in magic should pursue the magic created by the Sage regardless of social status ――”</p>
<p>“Tch… don&#8217;t go around sounding like those detestable old geezers!”</p>
<p>Showing signs of exasperation, Faregh raised his voice.</p>
<p>However, it can be said that the outcome has been decided by this point.</p>
<p>Those who responded in an attempt to have a dialogue and those who ranted and raved with their emotions. It is clear how the people around them will perceive the scene.</p>
<p>“Faregh-sama&#8230; let’s just stop here&#8230;”</p>
<p>“If you stir things up with the Caldwens, it will also affect the main family of Welminan ――”</p>
<p>“Be quiet! Are you going to give me your opinion, too!?”</p>
<p>He lashes out at his attendants, who admonished him, in a rage that bordered on abomination. It is no wonder that Alicia criticized him for his arrogance.</p>
<p>“Anyway! Even if he is related to Caldwen, he must be a servant sent to take care of the Caldwen family’s lady!! So, why should I speak properly to him ――”</p>
<p>“I apologize for the late introduction, but I am Elria Caldwen’s fiancé.”</p>
<p>“―― I’m sure he can&#8217;t&#8230; say anything… anyway…”</p>
<p>As Faregh’s words gradually faded, so did the surrounding chatter.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of this, Reid turned towards Elria with a smile.</p>
<p>“Shall we sit down and listen to the teacher&#8217;s explanation, Elria?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes&#8230;!”</p>
<p>Reid showed off by taking Elria&#8217;s hand and heading towards empty seats.</p>
<p>Needless to say, screams came from behind them afterward.</p>
<p>“Elria-sama is engaged!?”</p>
<p>“The Elria-sama, who was rumored to show no interest in anything other than magic!?”</p>
<p>“I even heard that she only spoke to people outside her family a few times a year!!”</p>
<p>The main focus now lies on Elria.</p>
<p>Ignoring the commotion in the classroom, Reid makes his way to the seats with fewer people.</p>
<p>“Oh my, I&#8217;m happy to see that look of bewilderment on his face.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I had forgotten that Reid had a bad personality since it&#8217;s been a while.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say such scandalous things. Those who become conceited and get carried away can cause situations where they even kill their allies. So isn&#8217;t it better to make the first move?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I feel like I understand why the soldiers in Reid&#8217;s country were so obedient to your orders.”</p>
<p>Elria stares at Reid, who is in a good mood.</p>
<p>However, Alicia also told Reid,<em> “As a member of the same distinguished families, I feel ashamed. So when you get the chance, you should beat his guts back into shape.”</em>.</p>
<p>Just then, Elria&#8217;s gaze suddenly turned downwards.</p>
<p>“What&#8217;s the matter?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;my hand.”</p>
<p>“Oh&#8230; I’m sorry, did it hurt because I grabbed it too hard?”</p>
<p>“Mm… it doesn&#8217;t hurt. I’m okay.”</p>
<p>While Elria smiled a little, she exerted a little strength in the hand she held.</p>
<p>As Reid tilted his head in confusion ―― a voice called out to them suddenly from the side.</p>
<p>“―― Um, if you&#8217;re looking for seats, how about here?”</p>
<p>It was a young man with light brown hair and a pair of glasses.</p>
<p>The young man adjusted his glasses as he looked at Reid and Elria.</p>
<p>In response, Reid took his seat.</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you for the invitation.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t mind. I was bored anyway because there was nobody around me.”</p>
<p>With a self-deprecating laugh, the young man looked around at the empty surroundings.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the peculiar atmosphere the young man gives off, there was nobody around. He then extended his hand toward Reid.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m Wiesel Blanche. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Blanche?”</p>
<p>As soon as Elria hears the name, she tilts her head slightly.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I&#8217;ve heard of that name before.”</p>
<p>“You might remember my family name. My family are magic equipment engineers and the magic equipment that Lady Caldwen uses is made by my sister.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing his words, Elria quickly bowed her head with a flustered look.</p>
<p>“P-Please tell your sister that I&#8217;m using it with great care&#8230;”</p>
<p>“She will be very happy to hear that. I remember my sister was overjoyed when she was commissioned to make the magic equipment for Lady Caldwen, who is often referred to as the reincarnation of the Sage.”</p>
<p>After nodding, Wiesel turned his almond eyes towards Reid.</p>
<p>“By the way&#8230; should I call you Sir Frieden?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just call me whatever you want. Even though I&#8217;m associated with the Caldwen family, I&#8217;m originally a commoner from the countryside, so I don&#8217;t feel comfortable with honorifics.”</p>
<p>“In that case, please do the same for me, too. I grew up surrounded by crude people with a craftsman&#8217;s temperament, so I&#8217;m not good at using formal language.”</p>
<p>“U-Um… y-you can use my name, too…!”</p>
<p>“I see. I&#8217;ll call you Lady Elria then.”</p>
<p>Perhaps catching the conversation&#8217;s path, Elria nodded and decided to join in on the conversation, for she is very active when it comes to magic-related topics.</p>
<p>“But… why did a magic equipment engineer take the examination to become a mage?”</p>
<p>The Vegalta Royal Magic Academy has classes not only for mages but also for other magic-related professions.</p>
<p>The classes are divided so that the students can learn specialized knowledge in each field, such as ‘magic equipment engineer’ who makes and adjusts the magic equipment used by mages, and ‘magic craftsman’ who engraves magic circuits on parts and ornaments used in the magic equipment.</p>
<p>In other words, Wiesel would normally belong to the magic equipment engineer’s class.</p>
<p>To Elria&#8217;s question, Wiesel nodded and answered,</p>
<p>“I am a pragmatist. My goal is to understand what mages must have and don’t need in their magic equipment in their activities&#8230; and by observing not only myself but also those who actually use the magic equipment and make magic equipment that is much more practical.”</p>
<p>“In other words… even though you are a magic equipment engineer, you become a mage for the sake of research?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s a motive that some people find objectionable.”</p>
<p>The ability to become a mage depends on the magic power and talent one is born with.</p>
<p>Many people give up the path of a mage and become a magic equipment engineer or a magic craftsman because they do not have enough magic power to meet the standard criteria.</p>
<p>From their perspective, what Wiesel is doing may seem like an indulgence.</p>
<p>“It doesn&#8217;t matter. Making good magic equipment is also in line with the academy’s philosophy of ‘pursuing and developing magic’. Anyone who complains just doesn’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I think what&#8217;s important is having a proper learning attitude.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I&#8217;m supposed to be older, but your words sound strangely meaningful.”</p>
<p>said Wiesel with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Speaking of which, I heard that Reid dispelled the tenth tier magic that Lady Elria cast&#8230;”</p>
<p>In general, the strength of magic is rated on a scale of one to ten.</p>
<p>They are established not by the type of magic but by the scale, speed, mass, strength, power, and so on. The magic that Elria cast was tenth tier magic, which is the highest of them all.</p>
<p>However, since the evaluation is only based on an established framework, it would be difficult to even evaluate the magic that Elria used in her previous life.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m interested in tenth tier magic, but I&#8217;m more interested in Reid who dispelled it. If you don&#8217;t mind, could you show me your magic equipment?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don&#8217;t have any magic equipment.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t use any magic equipment because it breaks when I use it.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t be ridiculous. Magic equipment is designed to withstand all kinds of magic, with physical resistance and magic power load reduction through the craftsman&#8217;s engravings. It&#8217;s not something that easily breaks.”</p>
<p>“Reid’s magic power is special, which causes all the magic circuits and engravings to break.”</p>
<p>As Elria added a commentary, Wiesel rubbed his chin curiously. He then repositioned his glasses and took out a rod-shaped object from his waist.</p>
<p>“Then, try breaking this.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure about that…?”</p>
<p>“I have spare magic equipment. If the magic equipment can be destroyed by some factor or under certain conditions, it is something that I, as a magic equipment engineer, should know about.”</p>
<p>Wiesel presents the magic equipment to Reid with a serious look on his face. Although his appearance and tone of voice give the impression of him being cool-headed, he seems to have a tendency to get a little passionate when it comes to magic equipment.</p>
<p>“By the way, this magic equipment is custom-made by me. It was designed not only for versatility, but also for continuous use and durability, so that it can be tested on a variety of people ――”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>While Wiesel was explaining, Reid casually bent and broke the magic equipment.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, Wiesel&#8217;s glasses cracked.</p>
<p>“It was supposed… to be a masterpiece…!!”</p>
<p>“I warned you!!”</p>
<p>“Oh… I’m just a little upset that you broke it so easily…!!”</p>
<p>Wiesel fixed his cracked glasses and took the broken magic equipment with trembling hands.</p>
<p>After observing it for a while, he turned to Elria.</p>
<p>“As someone knowledgeable about magic itself, how do you see it, Lady Elria?”</p>
<p>“Mm… roughly speaking, I think Reid&#8217;s magic power doesn’t meet the standards of magic.”</p>
<p>“I see, from the perspective of magic formula and magic circuit, that would be the case.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;How do you think about it?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I don&#8217;t know. Lady Elria&#8217;s theory seems to be correct in terms of breaking the protection that was applied to the magic equipment, but it doesn&#8217;t necessarily connect to physically breaking the magic equipment itself.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Wiesel looked at the magic equipment that had been crushed in his hand.</p>
<p>“Without analyzing it and observing how it is destroyed multiple times, it is impossible to speculate, let alone draw a conclusion. To be honest, it&#8217;s a complete unknown.”</p>
<p>After expressing his thoughts, Wiesel asked Reid a question.</p>
<p>“Reid… how did you get this magic power?”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Reid gave a troubled smile ――</p>
<p>“―― Well, I have no idea. It was so long ago that I&#8217;ve forgotten.”</p>
<p>In fact, he does not know why or how it came to be. He has had this body ever since he can remember. So that was the only answer Reid could give.</p>
<p>More importantly ――</p>
<p>“So, why are you listening to our conversation from behind?”</p>
<p>Reid turned around and asked. At that moment, a painful banging sound was heard from behind.</p>
<p>“―― Ouch!! Why is this desk so hard!?”</p>
<p>Reid took a peek and saw a little girl rolling around on the floor, holding her head.</p>
<p>As she swept the floor with her fluffy golden hair, she noticed Reid&#8217;s gaze and widened her eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>“Ah! I-I-I… I’m not someone weird, o-okay?”</p>
<p>“We will turn you over to security if you don&#8217;t speak properly.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry! My name is Millis Lambat, and I am seventeen years old! I come from a small village in Noaberg, and my only friends were sheep because there were no other people my age around! I&#8217;ve been admitted as a scholarship student, but I&#8217;m struggling to make human friends!!”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll leave the judgment to Elria.”</p>
<p>“I like her enthusiasm.”</p>
<p>“She&#8217;s been promoted from suspicious person to classmate due to her positive attitude.”</p>
<p>“Yayyy!! Thank you so much! I stayed up all night thinking about my self-introduction!”</p>
<p>Thanks to the kindness of Elria, the little girl who called herself Millis, was pumping her fist up to the ceiling with tears in her eyes. Reid felt like crying, thinking she had spent all night thinking about that self-introduction.</p>
<p>“So, why were you eavesdropping on our conversation?”</p>
<p>“Uh, hehe&#8230; I thought the other people here might be hard to approach for conversation, so I was quietly listening in to see if there was anyone that I could easily talk to&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Well, instead of hiding and listening in on us, you could have just approached us normally&#8230;”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s impossible, isn&#8217;t it!? Everyone in the class is talking about things like, <em>‘Thank you very much for the social party the other day~’,</em> or <em>‘Did you have a good harvest this year in your territory~’,</em> you know!? How am I supposed to join in on that conversation!?”</p>
<p>“Just say something like, <em>‘There were so many sheep this year to the point that many shearing shears were broken~’</em>.”</p>
<p>“You are thinking like it’s someone else’s problem, so you said that! Is that what you’re saying!?”</p>
<p>Millis was banging on the desk, on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>But in fact, it was understandable that Millis felt that way.</p>
<p>Even though mages are based on merit, there are still differences in social class and background.</p>
<p>Those who aspired to become a mage were often from wealthy families that could afford it, families that had inherited magic power for generations, or those who had grown up in environments where they could learn about magic in detail and had access to mentors.</p>
<p>That’s why the academy has introduced a scholarship student program to avoid overlooking talented people. Still, it is undeniable that they tend to be isolated from the people around them because they live in a different world.</p>
<p>Moreover, some people do not take kindly to those who aspire to become a mage just because they have ‘talent’, without having a particularly good family background.</p>
<p>This was evident in Faregh’s attitude earlier and in the other students&#8217; reactions, so it was easy to imagine how they would respond to Millis.</p>
<p>“By the way, I heard that Reid is also from the countryside!”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t put me in the middle of nowhere like Noaberg.”</p>
<p>“Eh!? So where is Reid-san from?”</p>
<p>“Oh? I&#8217;m from Arlieth.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the middle of nowhere too, then! There’s nothing but forests, mountains, and rivers!!”</p>
<p>“If you are going to say that, then Noaberg has nothing but mountains.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe! We have a specialty called alpine snowmelt!!”</p>
<p>“We have fine lumber and orange groves.”</p>
<p>“No, no! We also have like… um, sheep, you know…!?”</p>
<p>“You only got sheep and water as the specialties&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m just a girl from the countryside where the only things I can offer are wool and delicious water. But I&#8217;ll definitely end up being alone at this rate, so please be my friend as a fellow countryman&#8230;!!”</p>
<p>Perhaps she was feeling lonely, or maybe she did not want to miss out on someone she had finally found and could talk to, Millis threw away her pride and prostrated on the ground. It was a pathetic sight to behold.</p>
<p>However, seeing her like that, Elria slowly leaves her seat. She then reaches out her hand to Millis.</p>
<p>“Then, I will be your friend.”</p>
<p>“Eh…? E-Elria-sama&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Can’t I?”</p>
<p>“T-That’s not it! I&#8217;m incredibly grateful and overjoyed! It&#8217;s like winning the Triple Crowns!!”</p>
<p>Taking Elria&#8217;s hand, Millis shakes it happily.</p>
<p>Seeing those two, Reid and Wiesel exchange a wry smile.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m Wiesel. Please treat me as a friend would, Lady Millis.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m Reid, as you already know. Nice to meet you as fellow countrymen.”</p>
<p>“Yes! Wiesel, Reid-san, thank you very much for becoming my friends!!”</p>
<p>With a cheerful smile, she also shook hands with Reid and Wiesel.</p>
<p>At that moment, Reid suddenly noticed that Elria was smiling.</p>
<p>“Still, it’s unusual for you to be the one to reach out first.”</p>
<p>“Mm… I just remembered something from the past.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Something from the past?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I told you before. When the child who inherited the name of Caldwen wanted to become my apprentice, she begged like that, too.”</p>
<p>Elria looks at Millis with gentle eyes as if nostalgic for the past.</p>
<p>“So I thought this might be a chance encounter, too.”</p>
<p>“Well, why not. There&#8217;s no doubt she&#8217;s fascinating, that&#8217;s for sure.”</p>
<p>“Yes, fascinating. I especially like her introduction.”</p>
<p>“You really like it, huh…”</p>
<p>“And her unique choice of words is also highly appreciated.”</p>
<p>Something must have hit the spot for Elria, who was praising Millis with a delighted expression. So it seems that her ‘all-night’ efforts were not in vain.</p>
<p>“I also thought they looked very much alike.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Are you talking about your apprentice?”</p>
<p>“Err&#8230; the dog she had.”</p>
<p>“Ohh&#8230; I see what you&#8217;re saying.”</p>
<p>Once again, Reid and Elria looked at Millis.</p>
<p>“Yay, I did it!! I now have three human friends! This is a historic achievement in my personal history of making friends with humans!!”</p>
<p>Millis was overjoyed to have made some friends, and her joyous behavior was just like that of a puppy playing in the yard on a sunny day.</p>
<p>“Well then, everyone! Once again, nice to meet you all ―― Wait, eh? Why are you all looking at me like that? And why is Elria-sama patting my head!?”</p>
<p>“Because your hair looked so fluffy and comfortable.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is! I&#8217;m proud of my hair, which has survived the battle where my grandfather almost mistakenly sheared me along with the sheep while I was napping with them!!”</p>
<p>“Yes, it feels really good.”</p>
<p>To Millis, who held out her head with a strangely enthusiastic and confident expression, Elria stroked it as if she was enjoying the feel of it.</p>
<p>If Millis had a tail, it would surely be wagging vigorously from side to side.</p>

<img src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/rhxs_vol1/RHXS_Vol1_08.jpeg">

<p>After a while, a staff member from the academy came to the classroom where the students were gathered.</p>
<p>First, the students were congratulated on their admission and were told that the mage who would be in charge of teaching them would explain the details of their unit outline at a later date.</p>
<p>The staff member also explained that while enrolled in the academy, they will live in the student dormitory attached to the academy.</p>
<p>A detailed explanation of life at the academy was given, such as that the students are free to spend their holidays as they please. However, a separate application is required to return to their home country or any other distant destination.</p>
<p>The staff member then led the students to the student dormitory ――</p>
<p>The moment they saw the room assignments, Reid and Elria froze at the same time.</p>
<p>“Elria.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>
<p>“It seems like we&#8217;re going to be in the same room.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Usually, they separate male and female students for this kind of thing, right?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>
<p>“I wonder what we&#8217;re having for dinner tonight.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>
<p>Elria&#8217;s thoughts had come to a complete halt. She had become like an idiot who could only nod her head in a daze.</p>
<p>With no other choice, Reid calls out to a nearby staff member.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, but Elria and I are in the same room…”</p>
<p>“What? Yes, I was informed by the headmaster that you two are engaged…”</p>
<p>The staff member tilts his head in confusion, wondering what the problem is.</p>
<p>“There are also nobles who are engaged or married when they enter our academy, and in such cases, we usually arrange for them to share a room unless there are special circumstances&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I see, that makes sense…”</p>
<p>If their relationship is more than an engagement, rumors about their relationship will spread, and if rumors about them being unhappy together began to circulate, it could tarnish the reputation of both of their families.</p>
<p>In that case, it would be better to stay in the same room from the beginning.</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for your explanation. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me.”</p>
<p>After quickly ending the conversation, Reid headed for Elria, who was waiting for him.</p>
<p>“W-Was it a mistake…?”</p>
<p>“No, it wasn’t a mistake. It seems like they have a policy of putting engaged students in the same room.”</p>
<p>“Mm… I&#8217;d feel safer with Reid than with anyone else, so it’s fine.”</p>
<p>With that, Elria breathes a sigh of relief. From the looks of it, she didn’t seem to dislike the idea of sharing a room with Reid.</p>
<p>“Well, let&#8217;s just go put our stuff in the room for now.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah…”</p>
<p>While looking at the key and the map given to them, they headed toward the assigned room.</p>
<p>The two found the room they were looking for and entered to check it out. It seems a little cramped since they have been living in the Caldwen family mansion until just recently, but there is more than enough space for two people to live together. The room is equipped with toilet and bath facilities and a complete set of magic tools for heating and cooling and other miscellaneous cooking-related magic tools.</p>
<p>However, a dining hall for meals and a large bathhouse are attached to the dormitory. In addition, the academy hired people to collect and wash clothes, so nobles who relied on servants would hardly have the opportunity to use them.</p>
<p>Next, they entered the bedroom and looked around. The bedroom is well furnished with a wardrobe and a dressing table.</p>
<p>However ―― there is only one bed.</p>
<p>After staring at the bed for a while, Reid nodded greatly.</p>
<p>“I see. Well, it&#8217;s spacious enough, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah… I think it will be fine for the two of us to sleep together.”</p>
<p>“Just to make sure, are you okay with sleeping in the same bed?”</p>
<p>“I-It… it won’t be an issue!”</p>
<p>For some reason, Elria spoke in a respectful tone.</p>
<p>“Reid, are you okay with sleeping with me&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t mind. I&#8217;ll sleep like a log when I go to bed anyway.”</p>
<p>“I… I might toss and turn while asleep.”</p>
<p>“You have a small build, so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d wake up even if you bumped into me.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Also, I&#8217;m not a morning person.”</p>
<p>“I will wake you up.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;And sometimes I become lethargic when I wake up.”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re troublesome, even when you&#8217;re sleeping.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Elria looks down to hide her embarrassed face. She has had some brooding expression since just now, probably because she thought sleeping in the same bed would cause him a lot of trouble.</p>
<p>“But&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to be alone, so I want to sleep together with Reid&#8230;”</p>
<p>Looking up at Reid, Elria purses her lips.</p>
<p>Seeing Elria’s face, Reid patted her head lightly with a wry smile.</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry about it. We&#8217;re going to be living together from now on, so if you don&#8217;t say anything about things that bother you or things you&#8217;re not good at, you&#8217;ll end up getting more tired. If it comes to that, it&#8217;s better for me to know.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. So go ahead and tell me anything you want.”</p>
<p>“Okay… then let’s make a promise.”</p>
<p>With that, Elria held out her pinky finger.</p>
<p>“Reid should do the same, too. Please don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know if you need anything.”</p>
<p>“Yes. No holds barred.”</p>
<p>When their pinky fingers intertwined, Elria finally smiled.</p>
<p>“Well, we can talk about other details over dinner.”</p>
<p>“Mm… then, shall we go to the dining hall?”</p>
<p>“No, there&#8217;s a chance someone might hear us, and it could affect Caldwen&#8217;s reputation… so, let’s just make our own dinner in the room for today.”</p>
<p>Reid headed for the kitchen and checked the contents of the refrigerated magic tool and the cooking utensils. Not only drinks but all kinds of ingredients were available in the refrigerated magic tool. They were probably restocked during room cleaning.</p>
<p>As Reid was thinking about this, Elria suddenly crouched down next to him.</p>
<p>“Reid, can you cook?”</p>
<p>“Well, if it&#8217;s something simple. I sometimes cooked when I was camping out.”</p>
<p>“Mm… that makes me nostalgic.”</p>
<p>Elria nodded, perhaps remembering the old days.</p>
<p>“I used to hunt and eat rabbits when I found them on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you were like that, too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. In the beginning, I was treated as a weak sorcerer, not a mage, and was treated not so differently from an ordinary soldier, so I ate a lot of fruits, nuts, and wildflowers.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s certainly true. If we tried to boil water, the smoke would give away our position to enemy soldiers, so instead of water, I would squeeze fruits to rehydrate.”</p>
<p>“I know, right!! It was delicious, but if you spilled the juice, your clothes would get very dirty.”</p>
<p>“Oh, the military uniform in your country was white… Mine was black so the stains weren&#8217;t as noticeable, but there were times when I didn&#8217;t notice the stains from the juice, and you found out where I was by smelling it…”</p>
<p>“I remember that! I was downwind, so I could smell it!”</p>
<p>As they reminisced, Elria became excited and joined in on the conversation.</p>
<p>While talking, Reid continued with the preparations&#8230; Elria drew closer as if to snuggle up to him.</p>
<p>“Since we&#8217;re here, why don&#8217;t we have a simple meal like we used to? Like meat with just salt sprinkled on it, or vegetables boiled in water.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Are we really going to eat that now?”</p>
<p>“It might taste better with the nostalgia factor. Besides, I can help with that, too.”</p>
<p>Elria deftly tied up her hair, rolled up her sleeves, and took out a knife.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll cut the vegetables.”</p>
<p>“Okay. I&#8217;ll start boiling the meat.”</p>
<p>“Mm, I&#8217;ll leave the seasoning to you.”</p>
<p>“I remember back then we just sprinkled salt on everything.”</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;After fighting and coming back exhausted, something salty tasted really good.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they chatted casually, the two of them stood in the kitchen and continued with the cooking.</p>
<p>At that moment, Elria muttered,</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;This may be the first time I&#8217;ve cooked with someone since I was a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>“That would be when you were living in the elf village, right?”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I remember my mother praising me a little at the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria continued to gently chop the vegetables with a matter-of-fact face.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230; other than that, I wasn&#8217;t really praised for anything else.&#8221;</p>
<p>While stopping her hands, Elria mumbled as if confessing her innermost thoughts.</p>
<p>Looking at her, Reid lightly placed his hand on Elria&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;But your name is still being praised even after a thousand years have passed, so you must have been really respected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your mother knew that, I’m sure she would have praised you, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Elria replied with a short word, a small smile appeared on her lips.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was a common story. Those who are called geniuses are not understood by others. Because they see and think differently, it is considered heretical to others. They reject what they do not understand and try to ostracize it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just like ――</p>
<p>&#8220;What were you like as a child, Reid?&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria looks straight into Reid with her deep sea-colored eyes.</p>
<p>After gazing into those eyes for a while, Reid lightly shakes his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It was a long time ago, and all I remember is being alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>While staring at the cooker, Reid vaguely recalls some memories.</p>
<p>&#8220;My body has become too strong now, but when I was a kid, I was weak. I used to get sick and stay in bed all the time, which really irritated my parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>He does not resent his parents for that now. Because he understands that it was simply the way things were back then.</p>
<p>Reid&#8217;s birthplace, Altein, was a country where the gap between the rich and the poor was severe. Also, because they were constantly fighting to expand their territory, it was customary for many children born in impoverished, rural villages like Reid&#8217;s to leave the village and become a soldier.</p>
<p>However, Reid, who was physically weak, had no chance of becoming a soldier. His mother, on the other hand, was in a situation where she felt obligated to care for him. As the situation continued… Reid eventually reached a turning point.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was frustrated, so I decided to somehow make my body strong. Whenever I recovered from a fever, I would exercise and train my body. Then, I would get sick again, and my parents would give me unpleasant looks&#8230; I repeated that kind of thing over and over again, and that&#8217;s how I became who I am now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you became physically strong like you are now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I was overjoyed like crazy. Not only could I run around outside like the other kids, but I could also become stronger than anyone else in the village.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not just a sense of oppression of not being able to do the obvious. Being able to finally meet his mother&#8217;s expectations, which had been troubling him, was also a big factor.</p>
<p>His mother had only expressed complaints about Reid, but for Reid, who was still young, she was still his mother regardless. Reid believed without a doubt that if he became stronger than anyone else, he would receive praise.</p>
<p>&#8220;But ―― I became too strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strength he obtained was not limited to the children of his age group. Despite being only seven years old, Reid had become stronger than any adult in the village. Seeing such a young Reid, the villagers unanimously said, ‘<em>Reid is not a human child, but a monster&#8217;s child.’</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, Reid was disliked by the villagers, and his mother, who was accused of giving birth to a monster, became more hostile towards Reid and began to see him not as her own child but as a ‘monster’. She then handed Reid over to the mercenary group that was passing through, as if driving him away.</p>
<p>At first, the members of the mercenary group sympathized with Reid&#8217;s circumstances as a child and treated him kindly, angry at his mother and the village people for their cruel treatment.</p>
<p>However, it was only for a short time.</p>
<p>After seeing Reid, a child, overwhelming enemy soldiers with brutal violence and always returning alive from dangerous battlefields, even those in the mercenary group who had considered him a comrade began to call him a ‘monster’&#8230; and eventually, no one approached him.</p>
<p>&#8220;After leaving the village, I continued to work as a mercenary, hoping that there might be others like me, but in the end, there was not a single one, and I became known as a ‘Hero’ for my war exploits. Life is truly unpredictable.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is just one of the common stories.</p>
<p>To be superior to others means to be outside the framework of being human.</p>
<p>And so, the two of them had fallen out of the big picture.</p>
<p>As Elria was viewed as a genius with outstanding intelligence, Reid became an outcast due to being the strongest human. It could be said that it was an ironic story that the two of them were praised as the ‘Hero’ and ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>Thinking that way, Reid smiled with self-derision, but then ――</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Hey, what are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm… It&#8217;s nothing to worry about&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria, who had finished cutting the vegetables, was leaning over.</p>
<p>Seeing her like that, Reid recalled the time he took the examination and leaned forward slightly. Elria then put her hand on his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reid is amazing.&#8221;</p>

<img src="https://athenatls.com/wp-content/gallery/rhxs_vol1/RHXS_Vol1_09.jpeg" >

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s gotten into you all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you praised me earlier, I&#8217;m returning the favor by praising you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she said that, Elria continued to gently stroke Reid&#8217;s head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s really nice to be praised by someone. But Reid has been alone for so long that you haven’t realized that yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, with a kind smile, she spoke again ――</p>
<p>&#8220;―― But now, you&#8217;re not alone because I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes, she admonished him.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I want to praise Reid a lot when you do your best from now on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, I&#8217;m more like an older sister to Reid because of my age, so I think I&#8217;m the right person for the job.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re younger than me, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s after I was reincarnated. If you include my previous life, I&#8217;m definitely the older sister.&#8221;</p>
<p>Elria puffed out her chest proudly. But despite her chest, her facial features and behavior were clearly far from the atmosphere of an ‘older sister’.</p>
<p>However ――</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for praising me, big sis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll praise you a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they exchanged such a conversation, the two of them stroked each other&#8217;s heads.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After finishing dinner, the two of them briefly discussed their future plans. However, the only thing they really talked about was how to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>Basically, Elria took priority in using the bathroom, mainly with the reason of changing clothes and because Reid thought, <em>“You&#8217;re shy around people, so you&#8217;ll be more relaxed in the bathroom where there isn&#8217;t anyone watching.”.</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Okay&#8230; I guess that&#8217;s all we need to talk about for our daily lives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, thank you for today.&#8221;</p>
<p>After finishing their discussion about the future, Reid flopped onto the bed. They had both already bathed and changed into their sleepwear, so they could go to sleep at any time.</p>
<p>Elria’s memories of Reid were mostly of him in armor, and she had only seen him in his everyday attire at the Caldwen estate, so seeing him in just a shirt and pants for their room wear was quite refreshing.</p>
<p>As Elria gazed absentmindedly at him, she noticed Reid&#8217;s gaze was on her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm&#8230; what&#8217;s the matter, Reid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s just something that&#8217;s been bothering me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing that, Elria looked around to check her own appearance, looking down at her calming green-colored dress and the thin cardigan that she wore over it. However, she could not find anything strange.</p>
<p>Noticing Elria&#8217;s confusion, Reid pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why have you been holding onto the pillow since earlier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Just because?&#8221;</p>
<p>Holding the pillow with both hands, Elria tilted her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always hold something when I sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, so it helps you sleep better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Holding something makes me feel safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the battlefield, she always slept while hugging her staff, her constant companion, so it had become an unconscious habit to hold something while sleeping.</p>
<p>Even when she spent time in the mansion, she held a stuffed animal while sleeping, but she could not bring it with her this time, so she was using a pillow instead.</p>
<p>However, Reid, who had been watching her, handed her his own pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, use mine. It&#8217;s better to use a proper pillow when sleeping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But what about you, Reid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I use my arm as a pillow, so having a real pillow actually makes it harder for me to sleep. If it bothers you, I&#8217;ll go buy one on my day off, so don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, I understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smiling, Reid interlocked his hands behind his head.</p>
<p>On the battlefield, he had a rough and uncouth image, but now that they were spending time together, she noticed that he had a surprisingly delicate and considerate side to him. He even suggested the idea of the bathroom after understanding her personality.</p>
<p>She felt a little sorry for making him worry, but she was happy to learn about Reid&#8217;s good qualities that she did not know before. If she had the chance, she would secretly brag to someone about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to sleep now, so I&#8217;ll leave the lights to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>After watching Elria wave her hand, Reid closed his eyes quietly. And soon&#8230; the sound of him sleeping could be heard. Probably not even a minute had passed.</p>
<p>Reid had slept on the battlefield many times, so his body was capable of sleeping as soon as it demanded rest.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>Elria stared at Reid&#8217;s sleeping face for a while.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>She then approached Reid.</p>
<p>Reid was already in a deep sleep, showing no signs of waking up. She leaned in closer than usual and peered at Reid&#8217;s sleeping face.</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;~~~~!”</p>
<p>However, her face gradually grew hot, so she pulled back. Feeling guilty for doing something wrong, she slapped her cheeks as a warning.</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230; someday, I have to tell him properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since the night she talked to Alicia about their engagement, Elria had set one goal for herself. And that is to confess her feelings to Reid. To tell him that she loves him without feeling embarrassed and to look him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>After Reid had become a mage and achieved the goal of ‘settling the score’ that they made in their previous life, and after finding out the cause of their reincarnation&#8230; there would be no reason for him to stay by Elria&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>That is why she had to tell him properly. She had to say that she wanted him to stay by her side forever.</p>
<p>However ――</p>
<p>“~~~~!”</p>
<p>Her face grew hot just by looking at him, so Elria shook her head. She hated herself for it, but it was just her nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Even if it&#8217;s just a little bit, it counts in making progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>Encouraging herself, Elria clenched her fist tightly.</p>
<p>While having such thoughts, she suddenly remembered something from the past.</p>
<p>Back when magic was not even recognized yet, and Elria was not even called a ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>It was when Elria first met Reid.</p>

<p><em>&#8220;You&#8217;re using something incredibly powerful, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Reid said that with a smile to Elria, who was his enemy.</p>
<p>Even though they were in a position to kill each other as enemies, Reid had an innocent, childlike smile on his face.</p>
<p>Elria had poured her knowledge, wisdom, and painstaking effort into creating magic, a technological skill. However, even her own mother, let alone those around her, dismissed it as something ‘useless’.</p>
<p>Reid was the first person to appreciate her work and praise her for it. He understood her, even though nobody else did, and she fell in love with him unconsciously from that moment on.</p>
<p>That’s why Elria continued to strive for improvement after that. She wanted to be praised with the same words and smile the next time they met.</p>
<p>Thanks to Reid, Elria became known as a ‘Sage’.</p>
<p>A person much like herself but stronger and more amazing than herself. He was the hero who saved Elria from her loneliness.</p>
<p>That’s why ――</p>

<p>“―― Reid is truly amazing.”</p>

<p>While staring at her personal ‘Hero’, Elria smiled and praised him.</p>
