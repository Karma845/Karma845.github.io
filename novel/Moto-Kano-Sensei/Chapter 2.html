<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 2: Secretly Getting Ahead</b></h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good morning, Touma-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the front door to find Kohaku standing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UWAA?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That surprised me… I didn&#8217;t expect Kohaku to be here. Even though she promised she wouldn’t ‘try to get ahead’ to Akari yesterday…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I can’t be sure of this yet. There might be a good reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d give you a good-bye kiss.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">ISN’T SHE REALLY TRYING TO GET AHEAD?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We shouldn&#8217;t kiss.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m tempted to kiss Kohaku, but… I don&#8217;t think we should kiss. That kind of thing is what you do between lovers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yeah. I know. I was just kidding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really? I’m pretty sure you were seriously going to kiss me if I accepted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then what are you doing here? …If you&#8217;re planning to go to school with me, that’s impossible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku is the center of attention. Whether we commute to school by train or by car, if I go to school with Kohaku, students will see us and ask, &#8220;Do those two have a special relationship?” They will look at us with suspicion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s not right for a teacher and a student to go to school together. As I promised yesterday, I&#8217;ll try not to be too close to Touma-kun in public.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then Kohaku grabbed my hand. Her soft hand is holding mine and I can feel my heart pound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t remember Kohaku being this aggressive. Kohaku was shy and never said she wanted to kiss me, even jokingly. And I was always the one asking to hold hands…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she&#8217;s become a bit naughty in the time I haven&#8217;t seen her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now that it&#8217;s just the two of us, it&#8217;s okay if we get along a little bit, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps this ‘get along’ has an erotic meaning. I get nervous when I think so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s just the two of us, but it&#8217;s not a good idea to get along outside, is it? Look, Akari might come here too, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku&#8217;s here, so it&#8217;s not surprising if Akari is thinking the same thing. If she saw Kohaku wooing me, they would start arguing again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It’s fine. Let’s go somewhere where no one will see. …Will you follow me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku asked me anxiously, as if she was afraid that I would reject her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How can I say no to a woman I like when she’s making a face like this? Besides, Kohaku had come to see me even at the risk of being discovered by Akari. I can feel that she really loves me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. I want to talk to Kohaku too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Kohaku&#8217;s face lit up with happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got into the elevator with Kohaku and we were taken to the underground parking lot where we stopped in front of a minivan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The black-painted minivan is quite intimidating. It looks as if a scary older guy might come out of it at any moment, and there is no image of a petite, pretty woman like Kohaku driving it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is this Kohaku&#8217;s car?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. I really wanted a minicar. But my father told me to buy a bigger car so that I wouldn&#8217;t feel cramped.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we were dating, I was told that Kohaku&#8217;s father was a very cautious man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a strict curfew, so we couldn&#8217;t go out on long-distance dates. Also, he would often call Kohaku during our dates, and I would hold my breath every time he called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the anxious and restrictive uncle found out that Kohaku was dating a guy, he might even sneak up on him. And if he found out that the guy was five years younger than her, he would surely object to her relationship–Amber thought so and decided to keep our relationship a secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Kohaku&#8217;s decision to go to a university far away from here was to get away from her father..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In her early years of college, she would sneak back home and go on overnight dates with me, but… We spent more time not seeing each other than we did when we lived in our local area, and as a result, we broke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How could that Uncle allow you to live alone?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a reasonable distance from Kohaku&#8217;s parents&#8217; house, but it’s not impossible to get there. In fact, Kohaku&#8217;s sister goes there every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He was against it at first, but in the end he allowed it. If it had been any other school, I don&#8217;t think he would have allowed me to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Any other school?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, she nodded,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My father, he&#8217;s our principal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Seriously?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The principal, who has a reputation for being strict and once expelled a student, who was crying and apologizing, without question, is Kohaku&#8217;s father?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that’s the case, if my relationship with Kohaku comes to light, won’t I be sentenced to death and expelled from school?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">N-No, let&#8217;s think positively here! Kohaku knows more than anyone how scary her father can be. Under his supervision, she will behave as a normal teacher. He will never find out about the relationship!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I reassured myself and got into the back seat of the minivan. The interior of the minivan was quite spacious with the aroma of sweet aromatic herbicides wafting through the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s so spacious!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s going to get cramped sooner or later.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku sat down next to me and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It means I&#8217;m going to have a lot of Touma-kun’s babies. Let&#8217;s make a volleyball team!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Would you have preferred a soccer team?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I meant! And a soccer team would be over-capacity!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You’re right. How about we buy a bus?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well I guess buses are expensive after all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried about the price! I&#8217;m just puzzled by this sudden talk about future planning!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s better to decide on these things early.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s true, but… I hate to say this, but I haven&#8217;t decided to get back together with Kohaku…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Squeezing me, Kohaku wrapped her arms around mine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could feel something soft pressed against my arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thrilled by the sensation of the touch for the first time in a while, and Kohaku smiled at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Touma-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, thanks.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about you, Touma-kun? Do you like me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I like you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;More than Akamine-sensei?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I like you two just as much.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her honestly. I don&#8217;t feel comfortable saying this to her face, but I don&#8217;t want to give her any satisfaction from lying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku gave me a glimpse of a sad face, but soon her face became beaming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Why are you thanking me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You still like me even after I rejected you so horribly. I&#8217;m happy just to be able to chat with you like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">But</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, she said with a determined look,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I won&#8217;t lose to Akamine-sensei for sure. By the time you graduate, I&#8217;ll make you like me even more than you like Akamine-sensei. Will you get back together with me then?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ll get back together with Kohaku then without hesitation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I promised, Kohaku beamed happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to get back together with you, Touma-kun&#8211;Ah, that’s right!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku clapped her hands as if she remembered something and took out a bento box from her bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was going to give this to you, Touma-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You went to the trouble of making this for me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. I put a lot of your favorite dishes in it, so I hope you won&#8217;t leave any leftovers…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t leave any. I really like Kohaku&#8217;s cooking.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were asked what I would like to eat on the last day of my life, I would answer &#8216;Kohaku&#8217;s home-cooked meal&#8217; without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I&#8217;ve been eating convenience store lunches all my life. My father and mother were both workaholics and carefree, and on top of that, they were lazy cooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still cannot forget the shock and awe I felt when I met Kohaku in the spring of my first year in junior high school and had a home-cooked meal with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell in love with Kohaku not only because of the delicious taste, but also because of the way she cooked for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cooked for me at my house on weekdays, and on weekends, she would bring bentos with her to our dates.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since she went off to college, I haven&#8217;t had as many opportunities to eat home-cooked meals as I used to, but for me, Kohaku&#8217;s cooking is the taste of home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I’m glad. I&#8217;ll cook for you every day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. Please!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thought of being able to eat Kohaku&#8217;s home-cooked meal every day like in the past filled me with joy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What should I do with the box?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll pick it up after school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. Call me before you do just in case.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had Kohaku and Akari unblock my number yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my lunch bag in my bag,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;d better get to school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Before that… Can I give you a good-bye kiss?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku joked again. But… The mood is different from before. Her eyes are feverish and moist, her cheeks are flushed, and even her voice is seductive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My ex-girlfriend, who exudes a mature sexiness, is making me nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No, we shouldn’t kiss. We&#8217;re student and teacher.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just the two of us now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I&#8217;d like to kiss her too. But once I do, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to stop myself. If kissing becomes a routine, we’ll run the risk of someone seeing us. Even though we are in love with each other, we are not back together, and we should avoid doing things lovers would do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku seemed to understand and,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then… What about fondling my b***s?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t understand at all!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to fondle it, though! I really want to! But no! I can&#8217;t! We&#8217;re not lovers!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But–I can’t say, ‘No way am I going to fondle them,&#8217; because Kohaku&#8217;s face was bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly held my hand, begged me to kiss her, and even tried to make me fondle her b***s… I thought she had become erotic after not seeing her for a while, but that’s not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku is just holding back her embarrassment. She&#8217;s just trying to act brave and aggressive to get back together with me, whom she loves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t say no to a woman I like after she has done so much for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, it&#8217;s just the two of us. I can&#8217;t fondle her b***s every day, but I have to fondle her at least once for the sake of Kohaku who mustered her courage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Are you really okay with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yeah. I want you to touch me like you used to. Ah, but… It&#8217;s been a while since last time, so don&#8217;t hurt me, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku bit her lower lip as if to suppress her embarrassment, and her body became stiff with nervousness. To such ex-girlfriend, I reached out to her chest and–</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Pockpock</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, a knock came from the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Akari was staring at us through the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UWAAAA!!!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly pulled my hand away. “What’s wrong?” Kohaku said and followed my gaze, before noticing Akari. Beckoned by Akari, we got out of the car.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari glared at Kohaku and,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shirasawa-sensei… You’re trying to get ahead?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wasn’t trying to get ahead. I was just handing Touma-kun his bento.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In that case, I will start making him a bento tomorrow. It’s the duty of a school nurse to take care of the students’ health.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, please leave the bento making to me, the home economics teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither party is willing to compromise. It’s unlikely that this argument will ever be settled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to decide who&#8217;s in charge of cooking. I&#8217;ll be happy to eat it if you both cook for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But… Won’t you get a stomach ache if you eat that much food?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t let Touma push himself too hard…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I have confidence in the size of my stomach. I can eat as much as I want, so don&#8217;t hesitate to cook for me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku looked happy at my words. Akari, on the other hand, looked somewhat uneasy, but still nodded her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After quelling the argument, I left the parking lot with the two of them seeing me off.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fourth period that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were supposed to have a physical fitness test on the field, but due to rain, we had to play volleyball in the gymnasium.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The team we are playing now has the ace and captain of the volleyball team, and the boys are excited to see the high-level game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of all this, I’m sitting on the corner, thinking about something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My problem is my ex-girlfriends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku and Akari are ready to get back together with me, and I love them both. But I can&#8217;t go out with them because I love them both equally. And since I can&#8217;t have a two-timing relationship, I have to choose either one of them…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Should I get back together with Kohaku, my first girlfriend?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or should I get back together with Akari, the last person I dated?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What should I do…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8211;Watch out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bang! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a powerful blow was delivered to my face, and a sharp pain shot up to my nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I’m sorry, Nijino-kun! My serve went off the rails…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy who hit me with the ball apologized to me. The girls who were playing on the other court are looking at me with concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No, don&#8217;t worry about it. It was my fault for being absent minded…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My classmate, who had been scared by my intimidating demeanor and hitting me with a ball, looked relieved when I forgave him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I can use this as an opportunity to dispel the scary image of myself, it would be a great success.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Whoa! Nijino-kun, blood! Blood!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What–Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Liquid spilled from my nose. When I rubbed it with the back of my hand, I found that it was covered with blood. While I was holding the nosebleed with my hand, the gym teacher came to me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nijino, are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. It’s only a nosebleed. Can I go to the bathroom?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I stuff toilet paper up my nose, it will eventually stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind if you go to the bathroom, but why don&#8217;t you have Akamine-sensei check it out?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m pretty nervous having close contact with Akari on school grounds, but… She will surely behave as a teacher when she&#8217;s at school, right? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deciding to follow his words, I left the gym.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I visited the infirmary, I found only Akari in the room. Akari was sitting on the chair at the desk, looking over some papers. When she turned around and looked at me,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ara</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said with a dignified face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank God. She seems to act as a teacher properly. It&#8217;s just the two of us now, but I have to act as a student too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I got hit in the face with a ball and my nose started bleeding. Do you have a tissue?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Use as many as you like.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I received a box of tissues and sat down in a pipe chair. I roll up the tissue, stuff it up my nose, and wash my hands to remove the blood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Have you finished stopping the bleeding?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Then come here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari stood by the bed and beckoned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have a bad feeling about this. She’s not going to start doing something erotic in bed, is she?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;re going to do a procedure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If it&#8217;s a procedure, I&#8217;ve already done it…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not enough. Come here quickly. If you can&#8217;t move, I&#8217;ll move the bed over there.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari is strong. And she&#8217;s not the joking type. She&#8217;s already grabbing the foot of the bed, and can really carry the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, she would refrain from doing anything erotic at school. Here, I decided to follow Akari’s instructions quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was heading to the bed, Akari opened the futon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Go to bed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But it&#8217;s just a nosebleed…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t underestimate it just because it&#8217;s a nosebleed. You need to rest until the bleeding stops.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I understand.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deciding to abide by the school nurse&#8217;s decision, I took off my jacket and lay down on the bed. Then, Akari closed the partition curtain and came to bed with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s doing something erotic!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sleeping with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can see that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And here&#8217;s a hug.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why the hug?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hugging promotes a sense of security. Anxiety can make a disease worse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Rather, you&#8217;re making me nervous! I really think you should get away now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her with an informal tone, Akari lowered her well-shaped eyebrows and her eyes shook with sadness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t like sleeping with me anymore?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-No, it&#8217;s not like that…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love sleeping with Akari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I look back on my memories of our relationship, I remember sleeping with her at every opportunity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the most memorable moments is when we went to a hot spring resort during the winter holiday in our first year of dating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went to an outdoor hot spring, I saw Akari naked for the first time, and we made out in the futon after a hot bath. We didn&#8217;t just sleep together, but embraced each other like we were just born. I still clearly remember the softness and warmth of Akari&#8217;s skin at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, how about the hug? Do you like hugs too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Yeah. I love it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first time Akari hugged me was on the day of the funeral of a distant relative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was in a corner of the funeral hall, fretting because I couldn&#8217;t get over the sorrow of my lost love, when Akari hugged me anxiously and comforted me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I was in the third year of junior high school and Akari was in her second year of college. Even if someone was crying, I wouldn’t hug a junior high school boy whom I’ve only met for the first time. But Akari couldn&#8217;t leave me alone and comforted me with hugs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I explained that the reason for my fretting was not because I had lost a relative, but because I was heartbroken, she invited me out to play as a distraction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I thought to myself. I wondered what if I had a sister like this. From that day on, I came to adore Akari as my older sister, and she took care of me like a younger brother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We played together often, she took me to the aquarium and the zoo, and I fell in love with her the moment she, who was always so dignified, showed me her smiling face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after the day we became lovers, Akari began to show me her different face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became the only person she could talk to honestly about her problems, as she had been raised by two respected parents, a doctor and a teacher, and she didn’t want to disappoint them. Whenever Akari had a problem, she would hug me and ask to be pampered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So maybe–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Something on your mind?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I probed her, she shivered and trembled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;How could you tell?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s because I like Akari. I can tell when there&#8217;s something wrong with a girl I like. If you’re having troubles, don&#8217;t hesitate to tell me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Is that okay? Even though I&#8217;m not Touma’s girlfriend… I won’t bother you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You’re not a bother. Even though Akari’s my ex-girlfriend, there&#8217;s no lie or falsehood in my feelings for her. If a girl I like is in trouble, it&#8217;s natural to want to help her, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, Akari saved me when I was depressed because of my broken heart. I don&#8217;t mean to thank her for what she did back then, but I have no intention of abandoning Akari.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari gazed at me with slitted eyes and confided in a faint voice,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The home-cooked meal I had yesterday from Shirasawa-sensei was delicious. It&#8217;s hard not to like someone who cooks such delicious food… Compared to that, I can&#8217;t cook.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Akari is a terrible cook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was treated to a home-cooked meal while we were dating, but it was undercooked, smelled fishy, seasoned uniquely, and served in a messy manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ate it all in front of Akari, but I had to fight a stomach ache afterwards–Akari then apologized to me profusely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to cooking, Akari has a lot of other things she isn’t good at, such as cleaning, washing, and sewing. She is the complete opposite of Kohaku, who is extremely skilled in housework.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She even has a complex about it, and she was depressed when I praised Kohaku&#8217;s cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to make lunch for Touma. It&#8217;s obvious that Touma will get a stomach ache and I won&#8217;t be able to beat Shirasawa-sensei&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be discouraged. We all have our strengths and weaknesses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I&#8217;m not good at anything…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. Akari is a good driver and a good singer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I’m not as good as Shirasawa-sensei. Now that you and Shirasawa-sensei have found out that you two still like each other, I won’t be a choice, won’t I…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that’s not true.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Will you get back together with me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s… I can’t say anything yet… But I love Akari as much as I love Kohaku. The moment I saw her smile, I fell in love with her. So don&#8217;t look so sad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I consoled her with sincere feelings, Akari beamed with happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Touma… I love you too. That rotten thieving ca–… I won’t let her have you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You almost said rotten thieving cat, didn’t you?! You blended ‘rotten’ and ‘thieving cat,’ didn’t you?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m worried about her hostility towards Kohaku and that they&#8217;ll argue every time they see each other…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8211;Excuse me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart immediately tightened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who&#8217;s here?! If they see me here like this, they’ll misunderstand!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What do we do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;C-C-Calm down. I-I-I’ll do something about this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks really shaken up and doesn&#8217;t look like she can manage it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to fret, don&#8217;t even ask me to sleep with you in the first place…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t apologize. I don&#8217;t blame you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The truth is, you shouldn&#8217;t lie down when your nose is bleeding.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not something you should apologize for now, is it? Is that how distraught you are? I wonder if she can respond calmly in such a situation&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me, Akamine-sensei? Are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? This voice, could it be…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that Kohaku?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You’re right. If it’s Shirasawa-sensei, I will be able to handle it no problem.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari suddenly became very confident.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a steel mentality. And of course, even if Kohaku finds out about this, Akari won&#8217;t be exempted from the job, but there&#8217;s nothing good about being found out, is there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I have no choice but to leave this situation to Akari. If Kohaku finds out that Akari and I are together, she&#8217;ll think we&#8217;ve been seeing each other. I have to hide in here and erase my presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaving me on the bed, Akari stepped out from behind the curtains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Akamine-sensei, so you&#8217;re here. Why were you in bed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t feeling very well, so I was having a nap.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Were you two sleeping together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I was sleeping alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Alone? …Then what’s this smell?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s perfume.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It smells like Touma-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku&#8217;s sense of smell is scary!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t smell anything like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can tell. Don&#8217;t underestimate the sense of smell of a home economics teacher. …Sniff sniff. I knew it, I can smell Touma-kun. Akamine-sensei… You slept with Touma-kun, didn&#8217;t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did you admit that?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a whoosh, the curtains were thrown open and Kohaku appeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Did you do naughty things with Akamine-sensei?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d do that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But, Touma-kun, your nose is bleeding…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t get excited and got a nosebleed. I just got hit in the face by a volleyball.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku withdrew her suspicious eyes and looked worried.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Are you okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. The pain is gone now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku exhaled reassuringly, looked at Akari, and said in an accusing tone,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sleeping together is not fair. Aren’t you trying to get ahead of me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I’m not trying to get ahead. Me sleeping with him was for the purpose of ‘taking care of an injured person.’ If I am to be blamed for this, then Shirasawa-sensei’s case with the bento should be blamed as well.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-That may be so, but… Sleeping together is not fair. I also want to sleep with Touma-kun, so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku stared at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun… Will you sleep with me today?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Instead of sleeping with Shirasawa-sensei, you should sleep with me. I&#8217;m a better snuggler than her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not true. I&#8217;m a better snuggler than you. When we were dating, I even slept naked with Touma-kun. At that time, he looked so comfortable.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma slept with me too. We held each other naked, and Touma looked really comfortable.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku and Akari reminisced about their naughty memories with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything superior about the two of us sleeping together, but if I don&#8217;t let them sleep with me for now, they&#8217;re likely to continue arguing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, how about the three of us sleep together next Saturday?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my suggestion, the two of them suddenly stopped arguing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Sleep together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma. Are you serious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am. Just the three of us. Is that okay with you two?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course~.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s fine with me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both said with happy faces. Then, as the conversation came to a close, Akari recalled,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, why is Shirasawa-sensei in the infirmary?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m here to get some bandages.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kohaku, are you hurt?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mhmm. I have a cooking class in the fifth period, so I decided to have it ready in case one of the students got hurt by a knife.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why couldn&#8217;t you wait until lunchtime?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari, who was interrupted, sounded unhappy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought lunch break would be a busy time to get ready for class. Now that I think about it, my sixth sense may have kicked in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku seemed somewhat proud that she was able to stop Akari from sleeping with me. Akari looked frustrated, but took a bandage from the cupboard and handed it to Kohaku.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku received the bandage, and,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How long are you going to stay in the infirmary, Touma-kun?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s time I go back to the gym.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve stayed a little too long. When I pulled out the tissue stuffed in my nose, the nosebleed had completely stopped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I left the two of them and went back to the gym.</span></p>

I lied immediately. Although she is her sister, she seemed unable to figure out her own sister&#8217;s cooking just by looking at the starters/side dishes.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.295;margin-top: 0pt;margin-bottom: 8pt"><span style="font-size: 12pt;background-color: transparent;font-weight: 400;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;text-decoration: none;vertical-align: baseline">&#8220;I told you yesterday as well.

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That night. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was watching a drama, I heard the sound of the door&#8217;s intercom ring. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was waiting for you! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly headed to the entrance and opened the door. As I thought, it was Kohaku standing there. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was looking forward to it because she said she would make me dinner too while collecting those lunch boxes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;m late.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she entered the house, Kohaku apologized. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m just glad that you made it. Were you not tired of working overtime?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. It&#8217;s not overtime but my sister&#8230; Mashiro-chan had come to hang out.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shirasawa-san was here? I didn&#8217;t notice her at all. Is she gone?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san knows I&#8217;m her (her elder sister&#8217;s) neighbor. If Kohaku was seen entering my house, it would be revealed that our relationship was not of the usual kind. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not worried about that. I sent her to the station properly.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Then you&#8217;re fine. By the way, does Shirasawa-san come over quite often?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, I have to be careful to not neglect caution. If the timing of Shirasawa-san entering and leaving Kohaku&#8217;s house and the timing of Akari coming to our house collide with one another, our relationship will be revealed instantly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s about two or three times a week&#8230; Should I not invite her to my home?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was wise to keep Shirasawa-san away to hide the relationship with me. &#8230;but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to lose contact with Shirasawa-san just because of me. It&#8217;s nice that you invited her. Moreover, don&#8217;t you like your little sister a lot?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. We&#8217;ve been together ever since we were little. When it was decided that I could live alone after becoming a college student, we cried together.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you like her so much, why did you leave home? Even if this place is not that far away, it is not a distance that can be easily covered.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku looks a little melancholic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When I am at my parents&#8217; house, I was bound by my father, I feel suffocated&#8230; More than half of the chat with Mashiro-chan was about dad&#8217;s complaints&#8230; I was told to visit the principal&#8217;s office every day during lunch break. And when I went, I was asked, &#8220;Are you not being approached by a man?&#8221; or like, &#8220;Did you get a boyfriend?&#8221; as if trying to dig till the roots to find a leaf.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was startled. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The father of the Shirasawa sisters is the principal of the school. He has the reputation of being severely strict. Moreover, he loves his daughters a lot. And for that reason, he is probably always on the lookout if her daughter gets a lover. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if they both get a lover, then even without them arguing, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a lover,&#8221; he will still be able to see through the lie with their slight changes in expression. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please, I beg of you, don&#8217;t break your image as a teacher in front of the principal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. I will try my best to not see my father at school. Although, I don&#8217;t think I am being called by my father for any such reason. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m being suspicious, either. He probably doesn&#8217;t, even in his wildest dream, think that I am going out with a student with the premise of getting married.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let alone marriage, we are not even dating in the first place.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But, one day, I will have to introduce you too. That &#8216;this person is my fiancée.'&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;re not engaged yet, by the way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I denied those two statements in quick succession. But Kohaku didn&#8217;t back off. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll just make you like me even more so that you would want to get engaged to me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku took the apron out of the bag. And with a lot of enthusiasm, she brought out the apron I gave her on her birthday when we were still dating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;ve been taking care of that for such a long time. I feel really happy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so&#8230; As expected from a home economics teacher. The apron looks even prettier now. The cuteness is five times over. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my gaze, Kohaku smiled back. The cuteness is further increased by five times. As I thought, Kohaku&#8217;s smile is adorable. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you like my apron?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I love it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you like it so much, you can even take a picture for your smartphone wallpaper.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku took the ball in her hand and made a pose. It&#8217;s so cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that. Even though I want to, I can&#8217;t let anyone find out about us. I&#8217;ll just burn it in my memory.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, if that is so&#8230; How about I wear a naked apron?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why the Naked Apron!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because it will get burnt deeper into your memory&#8230;? It&#8217;s embarrassing, but&#8230; If Touma-kun wants, it&#8217;s okay. I will do it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It will undoubtedly be a part of my memories that will never be erased in this lifetime. But the naked apron appearance is terrible for a different reason. I don&#8217;t think my mental fortitude would be able to hold its ground against my instinct, and I might do something horrible to Kohaku. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you dress up like that, you&#8217;ll catch a cold. I wouldn&#8217;t be able to forgive myself if Kohaku were to catch a cold because of me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun, you&#8217;re kind. I love you. But what about Touma-kun? Do you also love me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Obviously, I love you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku&#8217;s cheeks loosened in happiness as she went to cook right away. I sat on my chair and waited for the dish&#8217;s completion while watching the drama&#8217;s continuation. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for waiting~.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku brought the food. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">salad udon</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">pork shogayaki</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL note: Pork shogayaki (&#8220;buta no shogayaki&#8221;) is a dish in Japanese cuisine. Shoga means ginger, and yaki means grill or fry. It can also be made with beef, but the pork version is so much more popular that the term &#8220;shogayaki&#8221; generally refers only to pork in Japan. It is the second most popular Japanese pork dish after tonkatsu. Shogayaki is a common addition to bento boxes, as it can be eaten cold. However, it is more commonly served hot with rice and shredded cabbage. *copied from Jisho]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was raining outside but it was hot and humid as well so I wanted to eat a refreshing dish. As expected of my ex-girlfriend. We&#8217;ve only been together for two years, but she already understands my thoughts well. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. It looks really delicious.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The salad udon was beautifully colored with mini tomatoes and lettuce which looked delicious. There was also an appetizing aroma rising from the shogayaki. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But why am I the only one having it? What about Kohaku&#8217;s share?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not hungry. I actually ate earlier with Mashiro-chan.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Then, I will eat without hesitation.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230; Can I feed you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems she wanted to feed me by doing &#8220;Ahn,&#8221; huh. She even prepared food for me; well, that sort of thing can be easily granted. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is hard to &#8220;Aa~hn&#8221; with udon&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How about you feed me that shogayaki.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku nodded happily as I handed over the chopsticks. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She picked up a piece of pork shogayaki, cooled it down with fu, fu, and&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Here, a~hn.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A~hmm.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chewed and chewed. The flavor of shogayaki came out good, and it is very delicious. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How is it? Good?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. Hey~, can I also have some?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So in the end, you decided to eat too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;After hearing Touma-kun&#8217;s praise, I also started wanting to eat this. A~hn a~hn.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She opened her mouth like a chick bird asking to be fed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chewed and chewed. The flavor of shogayaki came out good, and it is very delicious. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How is it? Good?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. Hey~, can I also have some?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So in the end, you decided to eat too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;After hearing Touma-kun&#8217;s praise, I also started wanting to eat this. A~hn a~hn.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She opened her mouth like a chick bird asking to be fed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I let her eat all of the shogayaki, Kohaku&#8217;s face became entranced. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We did an indirect kiss, didn&#8217;t we&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, now that you say that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t your heart thump on that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, as expected, there’s not much from an indirect kiss.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see&#8230; We have done a lot of ecchi things after all, right? Do you still remember the day we first kissed?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, I remember. It was during the first date we had at home in our first month of relationship, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems I was correct, as Kohaku smiled happily, &#8220;You remembered that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When I entered Touma-kun&#8217;s room, you suddenly went and kissed me. I was astonished at that time, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I really wanted to kiss Kohaku badly, I did not know the proper timing because it was my first time after all. It has only been a month since our relationship started. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since Kohaku and I were already pretty deep, it may have been unlikely to be able to kiss for the rest of my life if I did not act from my side. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I decided, &#8220;I’ll kiss Kohaku when she comes over to the house next time,&#8221; and invited Kohaku to the room, kissing her immediately. It was indeed a surprise kiss, but Kohaku happily accepted it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In addition, Touma-kun didn&#8217;t just kiss, but also touched my chest along with that&#8230; I became really nervous wondering whether you were going to go all the way like that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I’m sorry if I scared you&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not because I was scared of doing it. Rather, I was not wearing a cute underwear then, so I didn&#8217;t want it to be seen. But now, it&#8217;s not the case.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Kohaku stared at me with a feverish gaze. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s cute underwear this time.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being hit with plenty of s*x appeal, my heart began to strike an early bell. I suddenly imagined Kohaku&#8217;s underwear appearance as my line of sight was automatically drawn to her chest. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Do you want to make love?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why does it come to that!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can tell just from looking at your eyes. After all, your eyes have the gaze of someone who wants to make love. If you want, Touma-kun, I&#8217;ll let you do it, you know.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku blushed as she tried to seduce me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku is too shy to say such a thing. She must have gathered a lot of courage in doing so. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I love Kohaku. If she’s trying this hard to seduce me, I want to at least respond to her courage&#8230; But it&#8217;s wrong to cross the line if we are not dating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t make love with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Then, is it okay if we could just sleep together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: the term used here is &#8216;Soine&#8217;. It means: Co-sleeping or Sleeping together. Co-sleeping is a practice in which babies and young children sleep close to one or both parents, as opposed to in a separate room. It is standard practice in many parts of the world, and is practiced by a significant minority in countries where cribs are also used. Bed-sharing, a practice in which babies and young children sleep in the same bed with one or both parents, is a subset of co-sleeping. Co-bedding refers to infants (typically twins or higher-order multiples) sharing the same bed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Copied from Jisho.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Didn&#8217;t we promise to do that every Saturday?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, but&#8230; I want to practice sleeping with you, so I won’t lose to Akamine.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari would probably be angry if she found out about this, but fortunately, we are alone right now. Even for Kohaku, who invited me with such courage, I want to respond to her with what she asked for. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. I will sleep with you, Kohaku.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yay, I did it! Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku smiled happily. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I finished eating the udon and washed the dishes with Kohaku. By the time I finished cleaning up, two and a half hours had passed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We need to go to bed now. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will go to bed after taking a bath. Kohaku will&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have taken a bath. I entered along with Mashiro-chan earlier.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that was why she had the smell of shampoo lingering from her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that your pajamas?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No~. It might get dirty if I cooked in my pajamas, so I changed into simple clothes beforehand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to sleep in that dress, isn&#8217;t it? You can get dressed in your pajamas and come after an hour.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;m looking forward to sleeping with Touma-kun.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku made a cute voice play before leaving my room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In preparation for any chance that might occur, I cleaned every single nook and cranny of my body. Afterwards, I came out of the bath and I headed to my bedroom. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was putting some citric spray on the bed and preparing a cushion that could be a better replacement for my existing pillow, the intercom rang. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;re already here? Aren&#8217;t you early? I wonder if that means you couldn&#8217;t wait to sleep with me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of the intercom echoed again. When I went to the entrance and opened the door, a beautiful woman in a jersey stood there. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Akari. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scent of shampoo drifted from her long black hair as if she came right after taking a bath. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230; I have a premonition of an upcoming </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shuraba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL note: Shuraba basically defines as a fight over something they both party desire and doesn&#8217;t want to let go. Here though, it defines it as a fight between two girlfriends over a boy. My own interpretation. It&#8217;s a little different from Jisho, I guess.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is something wrong?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haven&#8217;t you seen my message?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Message?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari nodded. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I called you but didn&#8217;t get any answer, so I sent a message. But even so, I couldn&#8217;t get a reply, so I came here to see if something was wrong&#8230; Perhaps&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari glanced inside the house quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought that you might be making love with Shirasawa-sensei.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It— obviously, that can’t be right. Kohaku is not even at home. See, there are no shoes in front of the door as proof, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then&#8230; Why didn&#8217;t you answer the phone? Did you lose your love for me&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her uneasy face, I gently hugged Akari. I patted her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t lose my love for you. I wouldn&#8217;t do such a thing if I didn&#8217;t like you, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Touma, I lub you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. I love you too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I whispered so softly right in her ears while hugging, Akari smiled happily. Seeing that she has regained her good mood, I felt relieved. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t answer the phone because I was in the bath. So, what do you want to say?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wanted to practice sleeping with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL notes: Sleeping here and probably in this whole incident is &#8216;Soine&#8217;]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The premonition hit. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of my ex-girlfriends, they really think alike. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it continues like this, it will end up as a double booking&#8230; But both of them hope for me to get back with them, and they are doing their best for that outcome. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they both want to have a relationship with me again and are trying so hard for it… In that case, I must thoughtfully respond to them. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than thinking of preventing them from going to the path of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">shuraba</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I need to increase the time I spend with them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL notes: Shuraba means death match kind of thing.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By doing so, I should be able to see which time, Kohaku&#8217;s or Akari&#8217;s, is the time I hold more important and dear to me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;To tell the truth, Kohaku is also coming to sleep with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari made an uneasy face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Are you going to sleep with Shirasawa-sensei?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll sleep with both of you together. I can&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;To tell the truth, Kohaku is also coming to sleep with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari made an uneasy face. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Are you going to sleep with Shirasawa-sensei?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll sleep with both of you together. I can&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Honestly, it would be nice to be alone with Touma-kun&#8230; But I can&#8217;t bother you. Besides, I&#8217;m happy just to be able to sleep with you, Touma-kun.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Akari got convinced, Kohaku came out from the next room. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as she saw Akari&#8217;s face here, I had an uneasy cloud occur on me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Touma-kun, are you going to sleep with Akamine-sensei?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I talked earlier with Akari about this. I&#8217;m thinking of sleeping altogether, is that all right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Yeah. If Touma-kun wants to do that, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku nodded. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she doesn&#8217;t want to be a bother to me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I entered the house with my ex-girlfriends and headed to the bedroom as fast as possible. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s go to bed quickly before they start another round of argument.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well. Do you want to go to bed already?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please wait before turning off the lights. I need to take off my clothes first.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why do you need to take it off!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m always sleeping in my underwear. It&#8217;s hard to sleep if I keep my jersey on.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When we were dating, you slept in your jersey normally&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My sleep style has changed in the past year. &#8230;can&#8217;t I?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is kind of uncomfortable for me to see her sleep in her underwear, but we will be hidden under the blanket after all. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. You can take it off.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After giving my permission, Akari took off her jersey. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wore a s**y underwear underneath. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bra cup was torn vertically, and cherry-colored protrusions were peeking through those cracks. From that, Kohaku and I were stunned, and when she was about to put her hand to take off her pants―</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Stop! Akamine-san! Stop right there!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku wailed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you wearing such ecchi underwear!? It is not an underwear becoming of a teacher!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari raised her eyebrows. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please do not talk badly about the underwear that Touma-kun gifted me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Heh!? Touma-kun did&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a fact. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we were still dating, I found a s**y underwear in an online mail order, and I bought it thinking it would suit Akari. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought, not even in my wildest dreams, that I would be reunited with this in such a situation&#8230; Before Kohaku, it was indeed awkward. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun, did you present the naughty underwear to Akamine-san?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Did that freak you out?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No~. I&#8217;m not freaked out. I already knew that Touma-kun was a pervert. But, you never gave me such a thing&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I presented Kohaku with an apron, right~?&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s true, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you use common sense, wearing an apron rather than a s**y underwear should make her happier. Yet Kohaku had a sorrowful face. Even though there is nothing that bad to be sad about&#8230; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can I take it off already?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari went on to take off her pants. If the top was like this, the bottom would be something outrageous as well. If she were to continuously show me that, I wouldn&#8217;t even be able to get a wink of sleep because of too much excitement. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t take it off. Get dressed properly. Otherwise, there will be no more co-sleeping.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, I understand&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari looked sorry, but she wore her jersey correctly. Turning off the lights in the room, we all dove into the bed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then they clung to my arms, pressed my chest immediately, and talked to me as if begging. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun, turn this way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please, Touma-kun. Look at me and sleep.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you choose one, you will make the other sad. In the end, I will have to choose one&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I sleep on my back.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And for today, I decided on neither. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then they started arguing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In fact, I was supposed to be sleeping with Touma-kun alone&#8230; Why didn&#8217;t you wait until Saturday?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s my line. You were the one who promised not to take any head start, so why did you break it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Akamine-san was about to take a head start, so I took one first. Akamine-sensei is wearing such underwear&#8230; Weren’t you going to do it with Touma-kun?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Should I have?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t! Touma-kun is going to be with me! I can make him feel better than you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, Touma-kun is determined to like me more than anyone. Isn&#8217;t that right, Touma-kun?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re not, are you? You want to be with me more than Akamine-sensei, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;  Guhu~&#8230;  Guhu~&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since it was remarkably hard to answer, I went to sleep like a Tanuki.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL note: I guess raccoon sleeps fast?] </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Are you already asleep? You&#8217;re actually awake, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s probably the latter&#8230; But it would be cruel to wake him up if he really fell asleep.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Let&#8217;s call it a night too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They stopped arguing, holding me tightly in their arms, and began to sleep. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuu~. Finally, I can calm down. I&#8217;m happy to be able to sleep with them, but I might get insomnia every day if this continues. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, they&#8217;ll both want to come to my house every day to stop the other from taking a head-start&#8230; I guess I&#8217;ll just cancel the co-sleeping as an every Saturday night event and make it a once-in-a-month event. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let alone sleeping together, we shouldn&#8217;t have even met each other in the first place&#8230; Well, as long as they are at home, our relationship should not come to light. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or so I used to think at that time, however―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two days later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun, can you spare me a minute?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the morning homeroom started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I was fiddling with my smartphone alone in the classroom, and then Shirasawa-san called out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, yeah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two days later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Touma-kun, can you spare me a minute?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before the morning homeroom started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I was fiddling with my smartphone alone in the classroom, and then Shirasawa-san called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, yeah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shirasawa-san and I went out to the corridor, proceeded up the stairs leading to the roof, and stopped right in front of the door that separated the rooftop and the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she purposely brought me to such a deserted place, she must want to discuss something confidential.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, Shirasawa-san has a serious look on her face. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be small talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What was she going to talk about? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t tell me… Did she find out about my relationship with Kohaku?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m extremely careful regarding that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been less than a week since I met Kohaku again so there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d be found out that quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, what did you want to talk about?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually, Onee-chan has been acting strange lately.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that the topic of discussion that was brought up was about Kohaku, I got taken aback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pretending to be calm so as not to get discovered. I saw the change in her expression and asked back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shirasawa-sensei acting strange? Did she catch a cold? If so, why not take her to Akamine-sensei instead of asking me — or perhaps take her to the hospital?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. That&#8217;s not what I am trying to say&#8230; Well, since you&#8217;re a boy, maybe you won&#8217;t understand this expression&#8230; Onee-chan, you see, has the face of a maiden in love.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL note: here expression means the way of speaking]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh, heh, now I see. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that means— I&#8217;m totally being seen as someone suspicious!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What should I do… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was being extremely careful so as not to be discovered. Still, I didn&#8217;t expect her to become skeptical after watching Kohaku&#8217;s change in expression&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But we&#8211;well, I think we got lucky with this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to her, we will be able to take the appropriate measures.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You mistook the person you should talk to, Shirasawa-san!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sorry for your worry, Shirasawa-san. But I&#8217;ll be guiding you to think that it was all your misunderstanding to begin with!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hee, did she have such a face? I didn&#8217;t even notice! Isn&#8217;t that just your misunderstanding?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It cannot be a misunderstanding. Onee-chan, she has the exact same face as she had before.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Same face? Does that mean Shirasawa-sensei had a boyfriend in the past? Have you seen him?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked with enthusiasm while stopping the cold sweat dripping from my back. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen him. However, there is no doubt that Onee-chan had a boyfriend. All my classmates with a boyfriend made the same face as my sister then.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, I see. Shirasawa-san does look at people&#8217;s faces carefully.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like getting hired as a detective will suit her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Onee-chan began showing the face of a maiden in love from about Monday. But in terms of the range of action of Onee-chan, the place of encounter is quite limited. If it&#8217;s the time from when she moved in, I think she fell in love with a guy who lives in the same apartment as her.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From such a small amount of information, she&#8217;s already about to find out who her sister&#8217;s ex-boyfriend was!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm. This is troublesome. To think that she was suspicious to this degree. If she has discovered this much, convincing her that it is a misunderstanding is practically impossible. On the contrary, if we try to force it down that route, she may become even more suspicious&#8230; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By raising our alert level another notch, I&#8217;ll have a word with Kohaku so that our relationship doesn&#8217;t come to light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-I see. Sensei has someone she likes&#8230; Wait, why are you talking about that with me?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t tell me… Are you already suspicious of me and you&#8217;re now devising a plan to trick me in? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about my sister because she has no eyes for men.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. The guy that Onee-chan dated before was just the worst. That b*****d, how dare he make Onee-chan sad&#8230; If he ever shows up in front of me, I will punish him by cutting him into 100 pieces right on the spot.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy is right here in front of you, though&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, Shirasawa-san, you definitely think that I was the one who dumped Kohaku in the first place, don&#8217;t you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m actually on the side of being dumped, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, usually, the side that gets dumped is sad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess it can&#8217;t be helped that Shirasawa-san misunderstood this case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, in short, you&#8217;re saying that Shirasawa-sensei might be getting deceived by some bad man, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s what it is. So, if you see Onee-chan bringing a man into her room, please let me know. I will find out whether that person is suitable for Onee-chan or not in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that was why you consulted with me, as someone who lives next door to Kohaku?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll tell you when I see someone like that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thanks a ton. Do you have your smartphone with you right now?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, yeah. I have it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my smartphone and exchanged contact information with Shirasawa-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All&#8217;s good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had the wallpaper of Kohaku in her apron dress, she would have torn me into 100 pieces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Don&#8217;t tell anyone else about this. If you tell someone about it and it reaches my father&#8217;s ears—the principal, he might really just cut that person to death with a sword.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh!? He&#8217;ll cut him to death!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me!? The principal!? With a sword in this day and age!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, I see. Since you&#8217;re a transfer student, you don&#8217;t know about it. During the teaching practice, a male teacher tried messing with my sister. So, when my father found out about it, he grabbed an imitation sword from the principal&#8217;s office, went into the staff room, and did all sorts of things to that teacher.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What sorts of things!? Don&#8217;t skip those pieces of information! It&#8217;s extremely important!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And after that, any teacher who might even think of messing with my Onee-chan ceased to exist.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By ceased to exist, you don&#8217;t mean&#8230; from this world!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a pretty interesting episode but&#8230; It’s too damn scary, so I better not ask her about it any further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All right. I just have to make sure that I am not found out as her ex-boyfriend!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This story will be a secret between Shirasawa-san and me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Making a vow from the bottom of our hearts, we headed back to our classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I couldn&#8217;t concentrate in class for the whole day. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As school ended, I quickly returned home and contacted Kohaku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I want to talk about an important topic related to our future. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Call me when you&#8217;re done with your work.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Message sent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I changed into my loungewear, I heard an electronic sound. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at my smartphone, I had already received a reply from Kohaku.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Don&#8217;t tell me, a proposal!?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[When I said an important discussion, I never meant that!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Sorry. Was it a surprise? ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[As I am saying, it&#8217;s different! ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;re interpreting it too positively. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I&#8217;m also responsible for writing in a slightly suggestive tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[What type of important discussion?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[It&#8217;s really important, so I&#8217;ll discuss it after meeting with you in person. Do you have any plans after school today?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Shirasawa-san happens to see her smartphone, it would be better not to keep it as a smartphone record. Well, we have already talked about &#8216;proposing,&#8217; I think it&#8217;s already too late&#8230; However, it is still better to discuss this critical topic. Therefore, it would be great if we could meet personally and talk about it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she sensed something ominous from my writing, as I didn’t get any reply from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few minutes, a photo was sent along with the message:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Today, I want to do perverted stuff with Touma-kun.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a picture of her cleavage exposed from in between her bra. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was looking at it from the screen, its softness was somehow transmitted to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I focused my attention on those photos, a panchira photo appeared this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL note: Panchira photo – Underpants photo]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The skirt was lifted up, with her private part wholly exposed. Gawking at that dream-like photo, the region between the thighs and underpants, my pounding heart accelerated!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no time to get h***y.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;No matter how extreme the photo you send me, I won&#8217;t do anything naughty.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I did, but I still won&#8217;t do anything naughty.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Really? Did it arouse you more than when you saw Akamine-sensei&#8217;s underwear?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Oh, so that was why you sent me those obscene pictures? </span></p>
<p><span>Even though you are a shy person, to begin with, you don&#8217;t need to force yourself to compete.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I felt just as h***y as that time. By the way, you are at home right now, I presume?&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m at school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Are you taking selfies at school? Think about the location, damnit!</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;What would you do if someone were to see you!&#8221; </span></p>


<p><span>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s okay. </span></p>
<p><span>It&#8217;s a women&#8217;s private restroom, after all.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Even so, don&#8217;t let your guard down. Anyway, I have something important to talk  to you about, so let me know when you get home.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Understood,&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span>A stamp is sent. </span></p>


<p><span>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</span></p>


<p><span>An hour later, a message arrived again.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m back. Mashiro-chan isn&#8217;t coming today, so why don&#8217;t you come over to my place?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve been invited to Kohaku&#8217;s house. </span></p>

<p><span>I guess she wants to monopolize me in her house without getting disturbed by Akari. </span></p>

<p><span>I&#8217;m going to talk about something important. </span></p>

<p><span>We can talk more calmly if it’s just the two of us. </span></p>

<p><span>Should I go to Kohaku&#8217;s House?</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;All right. I’m coming over right now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>After finishing the exchange, I immediately left the house. </span></p>
<p><span>When I pressed the intercom for Room 503, the door opened as if it had been waiting for me, and Kohaku appeared.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Welcome. Come in, come in.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Sorry to bother you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I placed my shoes in the shoe rack and went into the bedroom of the house as I was guided. The bedroom had a sweet aroma and was decorated with white furniture. It was as if cleanliness drifted to every corner. </span></p>

<p><span>When I sat on the bed, for the time being, Kohaku sat next to me, snuggled up, and entangled her arms further. My arms sunk into her plump chest. </span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s important?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Calm down and listen. Actually, Shirasawa-san is suspicious.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;&#8230; Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku moved away in shock. Probably understanding what my words&#8217; meant, anxiety gradually grew on her face. </span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Mashiro-chan, has she noticed the relationship between Touma-kun and me?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;No, she hasn&#8217;t found out yet. But she got the hint that Kohaku is in love with someone.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I told Kohaku what Shirasawa-san said to me this morning.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;That&#8217;s why, if you want to continue your teaching profession, you have to stop getting involved with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>And then she finally broke out in a severe tone.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see you anymore&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku’s voice grew tearful as she talked. Large drops of tears started to spill out of her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span>It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve seen Kohaku&#8217;s tears, and seeing that, I started freaking out.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t cry! It&#8217;s not like I hate Kohaku! I&#8217;m just worried about your future&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to think about a future without Touma-kun&#8230; I love Touma-kun. I really love you a lot&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Of course, I love you too! I love you too, Kohaku! So please stop crying!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Isn’t it wrong that two people who love one another are denied to meet&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s definitely wrong.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I want to chat with Touma-kun&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;That&#8217;s, of course. I also want to chat! Yeah, then let&#8217;s do this. We can talk to one another by phone every day.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I want to talk face to face&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Wha&#8230; Okay, I understand. Then let&#8217;s talk directly, face-to-face! It&#8217;s all okay. As long as we&#8217;re careful about Shirasawa-san not finding out about it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>After desperately soothing her, Kohaku&#8217;s expression finally softened.</span></p>

<p><span>Wiping her tears, she looked at me with her feverish eyes,</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I want to talk while we bathe.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Yeah! Got it! Let&#8217;s have a long chat in the bath today!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I accepted. </span></p>

<p><span>It&#8217;s a shameful act between a teacher and a student but&#8230; It can&#8217;t be helped. </span></p>

<p><span>If I refuse, Kohaku will start crying again because of me.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Ehehe, I&#8217;m happy. Touma-kun, I love you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku, who is in a good mood, headed straight to the bathroom. </span></p>

<p><span>And as soon as she entered the dressing room, Kohaku started by removing her clothes.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>She took off her blouse and skirt and went into the bathroom wearing only her underwear.</span></p>

<p><span>It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen Kohaku in only her underwear. </span></p>
<p><span>She was attractive back then, and she&#8217;s still pretty beautiful now.</span></p>

<p><span>But unlike that time, Kohaku is now utterly skinny.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Kohaku, you have grown thin.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Hearing my words, Kohaku gave me a beaming smile.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll keep this body style for Touma-kun&#8217;s sake!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>She seems to have taken it as a compliment.</span></p>

<p><span>Well, I won&#8217;t deny that Kohaku&#8217;s body looked attractive, but I just said what I thought. I did not compliment her.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to force yourself in this style.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>She asked in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span>I can understand Kohaku&#8217;s confusion. </span></p>

<p><span>In general, the word&#8221;fat&#8221; is considered a derogatory term while &#8220;thin&#8221; is considered a compliment. Therefore, her usual reaction seems to be happiness whenever she loses weight.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Because an unreasonable diet is poisonous to your body. I want Kohaku to stay healthy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>When we first started dating, she was chubby. However, when I entered college and we started a long-distance relationship, she would lose weight every time we met.</span></p>

<p><span>I didn&#8217;t lose weight; I looked healthy even, so I didn&#8217;t worry about myself. However&#8230; I grew concerned whenever I saw Kohaku getting thinner, like a different person every time I met her after a long-time. </span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not a diet. The stress of not seeing Touma-kun made it difficult for me to eat, and eventually, I just lost weight.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Then, are you sure you&#8217;re eating properly now?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;&#8230; But you said &#8216;maintain the style&#8217; just now, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>And she also said, &#8220;For Touma-kun&#8217;s sake.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>If it takes a lot of diets to maintain this style— and if she thinks it&#8217;s for me and not for herself— then, I need to stop her immediately.</span></p>

<p><span>Perhaps sensing what was going on in my mind, Kohaku made a gloomy face. </span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy about Touma-kun&#8217;s feelings, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to gain weight anymore. I’m already short&#8230; and if I gain weight, I won’t be able to win against Akamine-sensei&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span> Perhaps sensing what was going on in my mind, Kohaku made a gloomy face.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy about Touma-kun’s feelings, but&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to gain weight anymore. I&#8217;m already short&#8230; and if I gain weight, I won&#8217;t be able to win against Akamine-sensei&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>In fact, Akari has a style that can even be mistaken as a model by the entire world. On the other hand, Kohaku was petite and baby-faced, which was the complete opposite of Akari.</span></p>

<p><span>However&#8211;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t fall in love with Kohaku because of your looks. I fell in love with Kohaku&#8217;s homely personality. No matter what style Kohaku has, I won&#8217;t hate you. Or are you scared of being berated as you were in the past?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I met Kohaku at a station platform.</span></p>
<p><span>At that time, she was being told terrible things by some guys wearing the same uniform as her.</span></p>

<p><span>Things like, &#8216;I&#8217;ll take the calories for you, so treat me to juice,&#8217; or like, &#8216;Start running from home to school. It will help you lose weight&#8230;&#8217; </span></p>

<p><span>She was bombarded with words that made her bowels boil just by remembering them.</span></p>
<p><span>She was being bullied.</span></p>

<p><span>So I stepped in to help.</span></p>

<p><span>I was in the first year of junior high school at the time, but I looked like an ugly senior high school student. When I ran over there while yelling, the bullies freaked out and ran away.</span></p>

<p><span>That was supposed to be a one-off relationship with Kohaku. </span></p>

<p><span>However, Kohaku wasn&#8217;t scared of my looks; she even thanked me. </span></p>
<p><span>During that same time, my stomach rumbled, and she said that she would like to treat me to her homemade food in return.</span></p>

<p><span>I remember being quite confused because I didn&#8217;t think a woman whom I had never met before would serve me food.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>When Kohaku saw me perplexed; giving out a melancholic look, she said, &#8220;It must have been a nuisance&#8230;&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span>Hearing this, I immediately replied, &#8220;I will eat.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku&#8217;s home-cooked food were out of this world. </span></p>
<p><span>It was so delicious that I inadvertently ate it all and said,</span></p>

<p><span>“―The person who gets to eat this home-cooked meal every day will certainly be the happiest in the world.”</span></p>

<p><span>From that day on, Kohaku and I frequently met up with each other and became friends.</span></p>
<p><span>At some point, we fell in love with one another, and that&#8217;s how we came to the present.</span></p>


<p><span>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m not scared. As long as Touma-kun is here, I don&#8217;t care what other people think. Besides&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku smiled.</span></p>


<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not overdoing it. I&#8217;m trying to eat a well-balanced diet and refrain from sweets, so I&#8217;m actually healthier than before&#8230; But if Touma-kun wants me to gain weight, I will gladly gain weight.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I just want you to remain healthy, not fat. You look just as cute now as you did back then.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku’s eyes turned moist.</span></p>

<p><span>The tears this time were of gratitude, not of sadness. </span></p>
<p><span>She smiled happily.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;The only person who liked me for who I am was Touma-kun&#8230; The others didn&#8217;t even look at me until I lost weight&#8230; They looked at me as someone fat and sneered at me. But&#8230; Touma-kun was the only one who really liked me&#8230; That&#8217;s why I love Touma-kun.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m honored to have a girl like Kohaku fall in love with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;We both love each other reciprocatively. Let&#8217;s definitely get married to each other. Then I will cook delicious food for you every day. And when we have children, we can bring a lunch box to our picnic.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I can&#8217;t promise to marry you because I have mutual feelings with Akari as well, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I know, but I&#8217;ll definitely make you choose me!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>It was right when Kohaku shouted out enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span>A noise resounded from the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Onee-chan. I&#8217;m here to hang out.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I heard Shirasawa-san&#8217;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span>I thought my heart would stop.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Why, Shirasawa-san&#8230; Why is she able to unlock it&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I gave her the keys so that she could come and go at any time.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;But just now, you were asking to take a bath with me, right!? Let&#8217;s be more vigilant&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;She always contacted me before she came, so I let my guard down&#8230; Why did she suddenly come when earlier, she said she wouldn&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a surprise investigation?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I&#8217;m sure she came to find out if her sister was flirting with a man.</span></p>

<p><span>Whatever the purpose, staying here any longer is a bad idea. </span></p>
<p><span>If it was the living room, it was still fine, but if someone sees Kohaku half-naked in her dressing room, there would be no excuse.</span></p>

<p><span>I have to get out of here at once!</span></p>

<p><span>But if I leave the dressing room, I will undoubtedly run into Shirasawa-san&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Touma-kun, hide in the bathroom.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;That seems to be our only way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I went to the bathroom with my clothes on. I entered the empty bathtub, got down on all fours, and closed the lid. </span></p>

<p><span>Since the closing was done from the inside, it was impossible to close it completely. Thus, there was still a tiny gap left.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Onee-chan, you were here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Shirasawa-san came to the dressing room.</span></p>

<p><span>I can&#8217;t make any noise anymore.</span></p>
<p><span>I can only pray that she won&#8217;t step into the bathroom and peep through that open gap.</span></p>

<p><span>Please, Kohaku. </span></p>
<p><span>Please somehow guide Shirasawa-san to her separate room! </span></p>
<p><span>Please let her return home if possible!</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Were you about to take a bath?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Uh, yeah. That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I heard you were talking with someone just earlier. Is there anyone in the bathroom?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m just talking to myself. There&#8217;s no one in the bathroom. Here&#8217;s the proof.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Clap and the sound of the half-folded bathroom door opening. </span></p>
<p><span>My heart is pounding, but I can&#8217;t let my breathing sound rough.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;See? But Mashiro-chan, what happened to you all of a sudden? You said you won&#8217;t be visiting me today&#8230; Ah, I get it. You&#8217;re hungry, aren&#8217;t you? Let&#8217;s go to the living room!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;We can eat later. Instead, why don&#8217;t we take a bath together?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Eh!? bath!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;It suddenly rained, and I got a little wet. &#8230; We can&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Okay~&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Obviously, it&#8217;s not okay!</span></p>

<p><span>I understand that you can&#8217;t leave your sister alone dripping in water, but if she comes in here, she&#8217;ll find out!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;We can eat later. Instead, why don&#8217;t we take a bath together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b id="docs-internal-guid-e0287838-7fff-fca8-26cc-227deeae208d" style="font-weight: normal"> </b></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Eh!? bath!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;It suddenly rained, and I got a little wet. &#8230; We can&#8217;t?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Okay~&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Obviously, it&#8217;s not okay!</span></p>

<p><span>I understand that you can&#8217;t leave your sister alone dripping in water, but if she comes in here, she&#8217;ll find out!</span></p>

<p><span>But I can&#8217;t put on a tsukkomi like  that right now, so I kept holding my breath. </span></p>
<p><span>I heard the rustling of clothes and then the sound of the door opening—</span></p>

<p><span>&#8230; I could see Shirasawa-san through the crack in the bathtub lid.</span></p>

<p><span>She was wearing her birth suit.</span></p>
<p><span>Her b*****s were modest, but the shape came out very beautiful. </span></p>
<p><span>She is probably what you would call a Binyu.</span></p>
<p><span>[TL notes: So, Binyu pertains to well-shaped attractive-shaped charming chests.]</span></p>

<p><span>Her belly was toned and her buttocks were small. Her overall figure was indeed child-like. </span></p>

<p><span>But because I saw her- a classmate&#8217;s naked figure, it was super erotic no matter how young she looked. </span></p>

<p><span>Even though I shouldn&#8217;t be watching, I kept staring like I was devouring the scene.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Now then, shall we head out soon?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>Kohaku said as soon as she came into the bathroom.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Huh? Why? Even though we just came in.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;W—well, that&#8217;s right. You need to wash your body properly. Mashiro-chan&#8217;s class today had a physical test class after all.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Yeah. I got too worked up and sweated a lot.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Shirasawa-san fanned her face with her hands. </span></p>
<p><span>It was a little childish gesture.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Even though their tone was almost the same, she looked younger when in front of Kohaku.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Rather&#8230; Onee-chan is sweating a lot too. Is it really that hot in here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;This is called cold sweat.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Why do you have cold sweat?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Just—Just somehow!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;… Onee-chan, are you hiding something from me?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I—I&#8217;m not hiding anything! Truly!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Is that so? Well, whatever. Onee-chan, do you wanna clean yourself first? Should I go into the bathtub and wait there?</span></p>

<p><span>&#8216;Nyu,&#8217; and a finger came in from the gap of the lid! </span></p>
<p><span>Ahhh, those fingers!</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;No! the bathtub is!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Hiya~n!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Getting hugged by Kohaku from behind, Shirasawa-san pulled her hand away.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Onee-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Since Mashiro-chan looked so cute, I just felt like hugging you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Is that so? Then, there&#8217;s the return! Gyu~n&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I stared hard at those two beautiful sisters who hugged each other naked. While I had my heart beating for two different reasons, Shirasawa-san stopped the embrace and said,</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;So why can&#8217;t I go into the bathtub?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku flinched as she still pursued her.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;That&#8217;s because&#8230; The hot water hasn&#8217;t entered yet.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s put it in.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>A sound was heard, and consequently, hot water gurgled out from the hole in the bathtub.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;He&#8217;s going to drown!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Whoa!? What&#8217;s wrong, Onee-chan? By drowning, who were you pertaining to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Uh, that. It&#8217;s nothing at all. Looks like it was a misunderstanding on my part.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku immediately retracted her previous statement.</span></p>

<p><span>She seems to have decided that it was preferable to her trying to check the bathtub, but over here, my life will really be in danger if this continues.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>Even if I try to pull the plug out of the bathtub, the sound might get me caught&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span>The time limit is less than ten minutes. </span></p>
<p><span>Please do something and get Shirasawa-san out of here before the bathtub gets filled with hot water!</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s wash ourselves by then. Let&#8217;s start with Mashiro-chan.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>As the sound of the shower echoed, Shirasawa-san washed her hair. </span></p>
<p><span>While feeling the danger of my life, I looked at Shirasawa-san&#8217;s side and her side chest through the opening of the bathtub lid.</span></p>

<p><span>I never thought the day would come when I would see my classmates&#8217; bathing scenes live. </span></p>
<p><span>What kind of face should I make when talking to Shirasawa-san from tomorrow onwards? </span></p>
<p><span>Just by looking at her face, I could lose my footing in confusion.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Onee-chan, you can also wash your hair now. I&#8217;m going to soak myself in the bathtub.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Shirasawa-san said after washing off the shampoo.</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Well, the hot water hasn&#8217;t accumulated just yet! Besides that, I have to rinse it before we use it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Eh. Rinsing it is fine; it seems like a pain to dry it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;That&#8217;s no good; you must take care of your hair properly. After coloring your hair blonde, you might have already gotten your hair somewhat damaged. Why did you dye it even though it is so beautiful?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Just because. It&#8217;s the fashion trend nowadays.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Even if you don&#8217;t become fashionable like that, Mashiro-chan is already cute… Didn&#8217;t you get confessed already?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been confessed by anyone. Rather the same applies to you Onee-chan, don&#8217;t you have a boyfriend?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Huh!? Boyfriend!? I don&#8217;t have a boyfriend! Why are you even asking me that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m just curious about it. If there&#8217;s none, then it&#8217;s fine. ―Only if there&#8217;s none, though.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;No, I—Rather than that, does Mashiro-chan have a crush on someone? Or maybe someone you are curious about?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have a crush on anyone. But I do have someone I am curious about.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Is that so? My student?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;Yeah. Do you know someone called Nijino-kun?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>[Tl note: I guess I need to change when she speaks of Touma, as Nijino]</span></p>


<p><span>Kohaku coughs. </span></p>
<p><span>Even I was about to cough as well. But I somehow controlled it.</span></p>

<p><span>Shirasawa-san was interested in me!? But why? I don&#8217;t think I did something to make her increase her favorability towards me.</span></p>


<p><span>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t that the guy you showed around the school that time? How did you come to like him?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like I started to like him. However, unlike the other boys, Nijino-kun isn&#8217;t eyeing Onee-chan. He only looks at me for who I am whenever he talks to me&#8230; I hate other boys. Still, somehow, I thought Nijino-kun is kinda normal.&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span>Oh, so that&#8217;s how it was. I&#8217;m glad. Now, if Shirasawa-san also fell in love with me all the more, it would have caused a bloodbath between fellow sisters.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Fuu~uun. So that&#8217;s how it is. You are curious about that guy. Hmmm. Heee.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>She is definitely jealous&#8230;!</span></p>

<p><span>Will it go towards becoming a carnage just like this?</span></p>

<p><span>But keep it down, Kohaku. If you say something like &#8220;I won&#8217;t give Touma-kun to you&#8221; over here, your feelings for me will be exposed.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Are you going to confess to that kid?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do that. Like I said earlier, I don&#8217;t really like him. It&#8217;s only till the extent of &#8216;It&#8217;s okay to be friends with him.'&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I see. I&#8217;ll wash the back for you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>Knowing that she didn&#8217;t intend to confess to me, Kohaku&#8217;s mood instantly improved. After washing Shirasawa-san&#8217;s body clean, Kohaku clapped her hands.</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s get up.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Huh? But what about you, Onee-chan? Aren&#8217;t you yet to bathe?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Onee-chan will go in later and have a good long one. Rather, let&#8217;s eat now, shall we? Your Onee-chan will show you her honed skills!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;Un. I&#8217;m really looking forward to Onee-chan&#8217;s homemade meal!&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span>As Shirasawa-san left the bathroom,</span></p>

<p><span>Kohaku stopped the water and said in a small voice,</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;… Still alive?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;… Alive.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. I don&#8217;t want to be a widow at my age.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span>I&#8217;m not married, though.</span></p>


<p><span>&#8220;Be quiet until Mashiro-chan returns.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span>I can&#8217;t sneak away while they&#8217;re eating. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p><span>I&#8217;m soaking wet up to my thighs, so the hallway will get wet. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr">
<p><span>Just in case, it would be better not to even get out of the bathtub.</span></p>

<p><span>I unplugged the sink in the bathtub and waited there for nearly another two hours.</span></p>
