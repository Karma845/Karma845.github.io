<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Spring break of my third year in junior high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That day, I was surrounded by happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I could go on a date with my girlfriend, Shirasawa Kohaku!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku was a college student five years older than me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We used to date every day, but it had become difficult for us to see each other since Kohaku went away for college.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, for the first time in a while, we were able to go on a date, and I was spreading an aura of happiness, but–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Kohaku looked unhappy even though we had not had a full date in three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I had created an ideal date in my own way, but maybe it wasn&#8217;t enough for a college girl. Although it may be hard to say, if it was boring, I would’ve liked her to tell me honestly. I&#8217;d make more effort for the next date.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;How was the date?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It was fun. Really… It was really fun…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku said happily. She didn’t seem to be lying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. I had fun, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I was mistaken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason she looked so gloomy was because she was sad the date was over. It meant that she enjoyed today&#8217;s date so much that she felt sad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll make the next date even more fun! And for that I need to save up my allowance!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, we were at the station, waiting for the train to arrive. I felt sad to think that we were about to say goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to hug her before we part. And then I want to kiss her. &#8230;But Kohaku is very shy. She won&#8217;t let me kiss her unless it&#8217;s just the two of us, like in my room or a private room at karaoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Touma-kun… I want you to give me one last kiss…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like she read my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to be more interested in kissing me than the embarrassment of kissing me in public. Naturally, I couldn&#8217;t say no and kissed Kohaku on the lips. I kissed her soft lips as if I was biting them, and then put my tongue inside her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku stretched out her tongue and twirled it around mine. As our lips were lapping greedily against each other&#8217;s, and our tongues entwined as if to confirm our love without a care that we were being seen–an announcement echoed through the platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled my lips away from hers with regret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku looked very bitter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…My kisses, were they that bad?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last time I kissed you, your face was melting with happiness. …Maybe I wasn’t as good as I was because it had been three months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let’s break up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kohaku suddenly and abruptly cut in with a thoughtful expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">W-What did you say? Did you say break up? Why are you breaking up with me? It&#8217;s a joke, right? Yes, yes, I&#8217;m sure it is!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I… I have someone else I like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was puzzled and confused, and Kohaku followed up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked too serious for it to be a joke…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;A-Are you serious?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t say this as a joke.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-This is a lie, right? Who&#8217;s the guy you like? Is it someone I know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s… Sorry, I can&#8217;t tell you. Forget about me and be happy. Goodbye…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After telling me this as I stood there stunned, Kohaku got on the train and disappeared from my sight.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day two years later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surrounded by happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I could go on a date with my girlfriend, Akamine Akari!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari was a college student five years older than me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She lived in the neighboring prefecture, so it wasn’t easy to see her, but she would come to see me and we would have a date once every half a month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We hadn’t been able to see each other recently, perhaps because she was busy with job hunting, but we had been frequently making contact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other day, she asked me out on a date for the first time in a while, and I gladly agreed. From that day to this moment, I&#8217;d been very happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this was a date. I couldn&#8217;t be the only one having fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, in order to make Akari happy, I challenged her to a crane game and got a stuffed animal for her, who liked cute and cuddly things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Here you go.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I presented it coolly as a gift.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was cool to do that. After all, I got it in one try!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been going to the arcade for a while and had worked on my skills for this day. It cost me quite a bit of money, but it was a small price to pay to see Akari&#8217;s smiling face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, Akari, show me your beautiful smile!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Touma… I’m happy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari said with a gloomy face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Wait a minute? I&#8217;ve seen this face before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">N-No, no, no. This isn’t true, is it? I&#8217;m doing great with Akari! …Well, I thought I was doing well with Kohaku until she broke up with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was that, and this is this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s date went well. Akari and I have been getting along without any fights. There’s no way she’s going to ask for a break up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Touma. Will you give me one last kiss?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…What? Isn&#8217;t this the same as two years ago? I wonder if that word is going to come out of Akari&#8217;s mouth after this?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">N-No, I’m just thinking too much!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And by last, I assume she meant ‘at the end of the date’!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, my God. She’s so cute that she’s asking for a kiss in an arcade!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kissed Akari on the mouth while trying to calm myself down. I placed my tongue between her lips and wrapped my own tongue around hers, which was warm and soft.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time I pulled my lips away from hers, her face was blushing. It seemed that I was able to satisfy her. I hadn&#8217;t kissed her for a while, but I was relieved to have done so successfully–or so I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We’re done…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akari cut in with a pained look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So you too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why?! Why do you want to break up with me? What&#8217;s wrong with me? We&#8217;ve been getting along so well until today!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wh-Why did you say we’re over?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I have another person I like.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Who&#8217;s the guy you like? If you have a picture, can you show it to me? I&#8217;ll make myself better looking than him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible. Goodbye Touma. I won&#8217;t contact you again…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was devastated with despair, and Akari left me those final words–&#8230;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">◆ ◆ ◆</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;I leapt out of bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning sun shines through the window, and I could hear birds chirping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wiped the sweat off my face and sighed deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A nightmare…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like watching two depressing movies in a row.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this was just a nightmare, I would have been relieved that it was just a dream, but it all happened for real.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a fact that Kohaku dumped me in the spring of my third year in junior high school and Akari dumped me in the spring of my second year in high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven’t seen their faces since then. And I haven’t spoken to them. This is because they rejected my calls…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Just why did I get dumped…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked myself, but I have some idea of the reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the age difference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were five years older than me, and both of them should be working adults by now. It&#8217;s not surprising that their values no longer match that of a small boy like me, and that they were having a hard time in the relationship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still–just because I know the reason doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m over it. I went to bed in shock for the first month after the breakup, and I still haven&#8217;t gotten over the heartbreak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But… Worrying about it won’t do me anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">New love will solve love problems–I learned this when I went out with Akari after being dumped by Kohaku.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I want to have a girlfriend, but… The problem is that I still love Kohaku and Akari, so I&#8217;m not attracted to any other girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if I can find a new girlfriend at this rate…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah! It’s already this late!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not good, not good! I&#8217;m almost late for the first day of school. I quickly got myself ready and headed down the street to school–</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, I was reunited with two of my ex-girlfriends who are now teachers.</span></p>
