<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Inside the Dungeon</h3>

<p>"Ohhhh..."</p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
I stepped into the cave-like dungeon at the foot of the mountain -- grassland
spread in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is a forest in the distance and even a river running through it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
looked up and saw a beautiful sky that seemed bluer than the outside.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though we were inside a cave, I couldn't help but be amazed at the grassland as
far as the eye could see.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(It's
a dungeon with a different atmosphere than Naraku.......)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
my mind, I compare it to the dungeon we're currently based in.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Naraku
is basically a cave, and no matter how far underground you go, there are no
grasslands, volcanoes, or glaciers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Most
of the dungeons I entered during my days in the Race Union are also cave-type
dungeons. So it is a refreshing surprise to see a grassy plain spreading out
like the outside world when I'm entering this dungeon.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
are several types of dungeons. Some are caves like Naraku, some are grasslands
like this one that is no different from the outside world, and some are
intricate labyrinths.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
fact, it's a mystery even to experts, and there's even a tendency among
researchers to assume that it's created by the Evil God's power.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
you can see, there are several types of dungeons.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-sama."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
other adventurers will come. Let's move quickly."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu,
who is standing behind, called out to me, and I started walking.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
started moving so as not to get in the way of the adventurers coming after us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
continue walking towards a secluded place - a forest that can be seen in the
distance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold,
who is walking in front of us, also looked around with interest.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
really big. It's probably bigger than the city."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Probably.
However, during my days in the Race Union, I heard that it was a great dungeon
where you could easily earn money and get treasure chests. But seeing ...... is
much different than hearing. With such a large area, outdoor equipment will be
necessary. Still, on the other hand, if we stay inside the dungeon for a
certain period and kill monsters, we can get materials and magic stones at once.
We can spend less time going in and out, which will increase our chances of
coming across a treasure chest."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
chose this dungeon because it is far away from the city where I had stayed
during my Race Union days. Less chance of meeting people who would recognize
me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
thought it would be easy to raise my rank because of its good reputation among
adventurers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
when I actually came to this place, I realized that it is a dungeon that
required outdoor equipment. ......</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-sama,
would you like to change the location?</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
calls out to me from behind.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
entering the dungeon, she takes her hand off my shoulder. She keeps a slight
distance from me, looking behind and around us carefully.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Since
we were not far from the dungeon entrance, we could see other adventurers here
and there. No one knows when monsters would attack them, so even though they
were paying attention to us, none of them tried to overhear our conversation.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
shook my head at Nemumu's question.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
was surprised to see how big each floor is, but that's it. It doesn't change
what we're going to do.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Our
goal is to raise our adventurer rank to a higher level and obtain information.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">All
we have to do is defeat monsters and raise our rank.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">What
we need to do is still the same.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Besides,
this dungeon is fresh and interesting. Since this is a good opportunity, why
don't we stay here for a while to raise our adventurer rank?</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hahahahaha!
It's true. Usually, everywhere we look is nothing but rocks.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But
I like it because it's a dungeon ruled by Dark-sama."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
had only ever been in cave-type dungeons. This dungeon has grasslands, forests,
and rivers inside. So honestly, it feels fresh and interesting to me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
and Nemumu agree with me, and we will raise our adventurer rank in this
dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
walk lightly as if we are on a picnic.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre6">☆</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>





<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">We
arrived at the forest without being attacked by any particular monster.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">We
proceeded further into the forest to avoid being seen.</span></p>





<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......,
monsters 100 meters around, no sign of people."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"R,
Detect, R, Silent, SR, Magic Interference released."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not that I don't believe in Nemumu, but just to be safe, I use the
"Infinity Gacha" card to check my surroundings.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
confirming that there is no one around, I use "Silent" to keep my
voice from leaking out. I also use "Magical Interference" to block or
make it impossible for any surveillance by magic or any other means.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
securing the safety, we proceed to the next action.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"So
let's just find the stairs on this level and go to the second level."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord, do we have to kill the monsters on this level?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
easier to raise our adventurer rank by killing monsters on the second, or the
third, level than by killing monsters on the first level, right?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Then
I'll do my best to find the stairs on this level!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu's
eyes sparkled as she thought, "It's my turn," and I let out a small
chuckle and waved my hand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
if this level is large, with her 5000 LV, Nemumu can find the stair within an
hour.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
even with her power, it would take around an hour.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It is
a waste of time, so I use the "Infinite Gacha" card to locate the
stair location, so we can go there immediately.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
had come all the way to the depths of the secluded forest for this reason.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu,
sorry to burst your excitement, but I'm going to find the stair with the
'Infinite Gacha' card, SSR Clairvoyant."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
sorry I've got too excited......."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"There's
no need to apologize. I'm glad to see you're so motivated."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......Dark-sama!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
was so happy to be praised by me. Her face is blushing red, her eyes moist, and
her body is trembling.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Ignoring
her, Gold peeked at my hand curiously.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hoo,
I've never seen that card before. So you will use it to find the stairs on this
level?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is another useful card. I'm really amazed at how many cards the Lord has. As
expected from my Lord! Hahahahahahaha!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It
is convenient, but it also has a lot of limitations. So it's not that great."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Yes,
it's called SSR Clairvoyance......"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
SSR Clairvoyance is a card that allows the user to find and see things in the
distance that they desire. But it can't see things that the user doesn't know
about, or that are too far away, or where the conditions are unknown."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
Gold's laugh loudly, I imitated him and shrugged my shoulders.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
that, I use the card.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'll
use it now. "Release 'Clairvoyant'!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
imagine the stairs and use the "SSR Clairvoyance".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though my eyes are closed, I can see a remote area far away from the forest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
viewpoint automatically moves forward. I discover a staircase in the depths of
a cave hollowed out of a mountain surface.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
the same time, the clairvoyant card disappeared from my hand.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Okay,
I've found the location."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
explained to Gold and Nemumu the location of the stairs to the 2nd level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
explained to them that if they went straight into the depths of this forest, we
would find a cave hollowed out of the mountain surface.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Luckily,
it's so easy to find. Let's move quickly to the second level then."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
glad that it's easy to find. <span>If we used the same method as
when we came somewhere near this city, it would only need a moment!</span></span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
is quite a distance from my former hometown to this city.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Normally,
we would have to travel down the river and take a carriage for a couple of
months to get there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
with the combination of the "SSR, Existence Concealment" and
"SR, Flight" cards, we can quickly travel through the air to this
city without being seen.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
way, we can literally move to the first level stairs in a single leap.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You've
calculated the distance to the forest as well, haven't you? As expected from
Dark-sama! You've got a great eye for detail!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you, Nemumu. Now let's get moving."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
nice to be praised, but honestly, it still makes me feel embarrassed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
if to disguise my embarrassment, I immediately use the card.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"SSR,
Concealment of Existence, SR, Flight, released!</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">First,
"SSR, Existence Concealment" to hide our existence.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
makes us unrecognizable to the five senses, magical powers, and magic items.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">SR,
Flight, is a card that literally allows you to fly for 24 hours.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
card allows me to fly for 24 hours a day, and when I say the word
"fly" in my mind, my body will softly rise into the sky.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Once
I have gained some altitude, by imagining the direction, I can fly toward that
direction.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Great
view, it's really a great view! My Lord's power is truly amazing. No earthly
being will ever be able to see such a view!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
hate to agree with Gold, but you'd have to be a bird, or even a dragon, to
enjoy this view. It's really a good thing we were summoned by Dark-sama."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
alone made it worth to come to the surface world---- even though we are now inside
a dungeon. We're really grateful we were summoned by Dark-sama."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
glad you're both happy. Now, let's move on to the stairs to the second level."</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
hearing Gold and Nemumu's replies, I led the way and fly in front of them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
continued to fly towards our destination while looking at the adventurers
walking on the ground below us, fighting monsters, and the magnificent scenery
of rivers, forests, and mountains.</span></p></div>
