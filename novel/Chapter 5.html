<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Get a juicy knowledge with cheat! ~(Me) VS Goblin Edition~ ①</h3>

<p>&#8211;When I still in the tutorial &#8230;. &#8230;. On that day, I could only look at Cordelia who is hurt and just stood on that spot.</p>
<p>The Horde of Goblins attacked my village because they wanted food supply and they purely attacking for food&#8230;. I guess that the reason.</p>
<p>&#8230;.But.</p>
<p>The oracle decided the &#8216;Hero&#8217; already and the chosen one is Cordelia</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, she was 12 years old at that time.</p>
<p>Indeed, when her aptitude as &#8216;Hero&#8217;, her growth is absurdly like a monster.</p>
<p>Compared to normal people, her status at that time is certainly amazing.</p>
<p>But, before her full-fledge growth status at the prime time, she is still 12 years old girl.</p>
<p>As for her ability at that point, even the those middle-aged veteran who seems to be wearing &#8216;Kuda&#8217; in his glorious past while in Adventurer&#8217;s guild is still somewhat useless. [TN: idk what is Kuda in this line, when i googling what the meaning of it in japanese terms, what i found is pipe fox, or pipe cigarette, this is pipe fox http://blog-imgs-56.fc2.com/2/6/c/26chieko/002520_000303_1321095864.jpg]
<p>I think the number of goblin exceeded 1000&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;probably.</p>
<p>Their number is too great</p>
<p>Even adults pushed everything to her the &#8216;Hero&#8217; who is stand in front line.</p>
<p>To put it simply, they (adults/villagers) just trembling and holed up themself in the village curch.</p>
<p>Even all the enemies is regarded as small fish &#8230;. yep,the goblins.</p>
<p>A lot of people (villager) are involved in protecting the village&#8230;&#8230; and they are fighting back with a hoe, and swing the hoe in full force. If they supporting Cordelia&#8230;. maybe they have been able to drove out those goblins with the strength of the whole village.</p>
<p>-but, they didn&#8217;t choose that option.</p>
<p>And they entrusted everything to 12-years old girl who is just receieved title as &#8216;Hero&#8217; from Oracle.</p>
<p>Then, in the middle of dead bodies, she worked while struggling like a lion with the sword wich the blade is spilled in bloods and oil. [TN: Oil?]
<p>With her physical ability, Cordelia could escape from the army of goblins.</p>
<p>But, she didn&#8217;t do that.</p>
<p>In the alley of building, at the back is a wall.</p>
<p>Foolishly, she is&#8230;.. pushed back violently from the chain of attack, because, she is protecting the trembling boy behind her.</p>
<p>-and, because that boy&#8230;she can&#8217;t escape or run away</p>
<p>Even if he is crying, no one comes to help.</p>
<p>There is impossible to fight back.</p>
<p>However, Cordelia gets hurt in front of that boy.</p>
<p>She repeatedly looked at that boy and said-</p>
<p>&#8220;Lute! are you alright?! It&#8217;s okay&#8230; because I&#8217;m here- kuh..! I will clean up all of those guys&#8230;guh! Please call me out loud&#8230; if something happened to you&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cordelia herself is bleeded from her whole body and her face was pale.</p>
<p>And I&#8230;. uninjured.</p>
<p>To be honest, that was&#8230;. the most hard time i had.</p>
<p>Yes, I am&#8230;.. not even helping her, even in the battlefield&#8230;&#8230; in the first place.</p>
<p>At that time, for the first time I learned the sin of my powerlessness.</p>
<p>Countless of slashing attack.</p>
<p>And thus, a tragedy.</p>
<p>Returning the vermillion of Cordelia&#8217;s red hair become more red from her own blood and their&#8217;s. (maybe goblin bloods)</p>
<p>After all, we are outnumbered.</p>
<p>Finally Cordelia run out of stamina, and she were on one knee.</p>
<p>The goblins who surround us come with the sharp siege and scorching torch.</p>
<p>She was fighting with goblins in the last moment, and finally reached her limit.</p>
<p>She receive the goblin&#8217;s spear attack.</p>
<p>Then&#8230; Her right hand, receiving a deep wound and still survive until her end of life, after that she fell down on the spot.</p>
<p>So I thought I was killed afterward</p>
<p>But- a single dragon appeared.</p>
<p>And then I and Cordelia seemed to be helped by that dragon.</p>
<p>This is, the end of that story.</p>
<p>Then, this time&#8230;. when the dragon helped me, the dragon supposed to take me to the dragon village.</p>
<p>So, I have to trace as much as possible to remember from the previous history.</p>
<p>Strangely/Oddly, I have the power force to drove away the horde of goblins to help out Cordelia&#8230;.. maybe the dragon wouldn&#8217;t come out this time.[TN: is this the story before chapter 1 or what? isn&#8217;t previously he is already dead once again and reincarnated again?]
<p>&#8211; I admit it, this is extremely troublesome.</p>
<p>So, what i do this time is&#8230;.. pretending to be late to escape and fleed because that raid of goblins.</p>
<p>And I wandered into alley that surrounded by building.</p>
<p>Then, Cordelia appeared with her crimson hair swaying as my condition in a pinch while being surrounded by goblins.</p>
<p>The event from previous time was exactly same as this time that is called repeating time</p>
<p>The horde of goblins is approaching, and Cordelia cleans up with great momentum.</p>
<p>However, she isn&#8217;t used to battle, she gradually out of stamina and MP without thinking allocation of her own pace.{TN: in other words with one word &#8220;Noob&#8221;, like me though *sniff]
<p>Now, It&#8217;s my verocious duty time.</p>
<p>-Too much waste of movement. Honestly, I&#8217;ve already used to strengthen my physical ability. Unlike Cordelia, my MP is infinite&#8230;.. at least I saving it (his power) if anything like marathon of battle like this event happened.</p>
<p>Although they make me cornered, I can&#8217;t help Cordelia.</p>
<p>Because, she won&#8217;t die even i didn&#8217;t help her.</p>
<p>Yeah, although she got some wound, she won&#8217;t die.</p>
<p>It is more bothering me if she repeatedly got more scar.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kyaa&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>The goblin&#8217;s spear head grazing Cordelia&#8217;s cheek.</p>
<p>Cordelia screamed when she is bleeding lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;YOU BASTAAAAARD!!!&#8221; [TN: sorry i can&#8217;t hold back to use that word, RAW: 「このおおおおおっ！！」</p>
<p>The goblin&#8217;s stomach slashed by sword.</p>
<p>The goblin who realized it&#8217;s guts flowing out from their own stomach is fell down on the spot.</p>
<p>She slashed her sword.</p>
<p>Another goblin collapsed.</p>
<p>She slashed her sword.</p>
<p>Yet another goblin collapsed.</p>
<p>She slashed her sword.</p>
<p>One more goblin collapsed, and an arrow flying toward her from behind.</p>
<p>She avoid it but it graze her, another scar is carved on her skin.</p>
<p>How long has it been since the battle began.</p>
<p>Having wounds all over her&#8217;s body since last time.</p>
<p>And her breath is quite rough, she asked me while saw the situation at the alley&#8217;s corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lute!? You&#8217;re alive!? It&#8217;s allright&#8230; because I&#8217;m here! I&#8217;ll clean up all of them now&#8230;.! If you need help&#8230; just call me okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>So she is, as I though, bloods dripped from her whole body.</p>
<p>And exactly like the last time, I am stil unharmed</p>
<p>Then- innumerable slash and scourge are received.</p>
<p>Cordelia&#8217;s crimson hair become more intense blood coloured from the many of goblin&#8217;s bloods.</p>
<p>At least her stamina&#8230;.no, to be more precise her MP is running out.</p>
<p>In the symptom of MP depletion, she is unable to battle and on one knee.</p>
<p>The goblins surrounding her and close the escape route.</p>
<p>If she keep the situation as it is, while Cordelia is still holding back the pain from her wound____ the dragon appeared after a few minutes.</p>
<p>So, I bit my lips and desperate enough to endure the sight.</p>
<p>-Its fine enough.</p>
<p>Now and in this place, I change the history drastically.</p>
<p>Cordelia&#8217;s wound is not so deep. but the amount of her blood has come out is quite a lot&#8230;.. There is impossible to save her.</p>
<p>Well, That is fine.</p>
<p>There is one goblin jump out from the front and a bit sland to the righ side of Cordelia.</p>
<p>That is&#8230;.. what I think.</p>
<p>Yes, I won&#8217;t forget that- the scar on the left side of Cordelia that remains same as the prevous time that damaged her appearance.</p>
<p>There is the taste of blood as I bit my lips.<br />
-its fine as it is. As long as Cordelia doesn&#8217;t die.</p>
<p>But&#8230; I think.<br />
The attack&#8230; that scratches at this time&#8230;.. the scratches of major injuries that she will receive &#8211; the one that she care about when in the future its become old wounds.</p>
<p>She only can only stand on with her one foot and one knee.</p>
<p>To think of her who is struggling for being abandoned by the other villager while she keep fighting out.</p>
<p>Being arbitrary Hero, the upstarter&#8230;.who struggling to survive.</p>
<p>And now, who won&#8217;t be able to move due to bleeding and out of MP.</p>
<p>When I think so, her back is like saying it can&#8217;t take this burden anymore and can&#8217;t get up.</p>
<p>-Well of course, its natural for 12 years old girl who have that kind of weight. (responsibility as &#8220;Hero&#8221; maybe?)</p>
<p>For what purpose when I ask myself that I thought &#8216;I would become strong&#8217;.</p>
<p>To become wannabe &#8216;Hero&#8217;?</p>
<p>-Certainly to be it.</p>
<p>To become a member party of Hero led by Cordelia?</p>
<p>&#8211; Certainly there will also be that.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not it. That is not what I really want. That&#8217;s not it.</p>
<p>What I really want to &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8211; Standing next to her, to build an equal relationship&#8230;.with her, so I can protect her.</p>
<p>When i Noticed it, my body move by it self.</p>
<p>&#8211; Skill: Enhance physical ability</p>
<p>&#8211; Skill: Physical resistance</p>
<p>&#8211; Skill: Shadow steps</p>
<p>What is the purpose of polished my strength? For this moment?</p>
<p>-Isn&#8217;t it? Lute McLain&#8230;. No, Iijima Ryuuto!</p>
<p>-Ah, whatever.</p>
<p>I had a bitter smile against my own question.</p>
<p>And I was grasping the head of the goblin trying to attack Cordelia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you little&#8230;. what the hell are you want to do to her with that smelly hand, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>as I said that while I doing body blow from the side of that goblin&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>That goblin gushed out gastric droll while it shrilling voice like &#8220;Gugya-&#8221;</p>
<p>-Oops, I did it.</p>
<p>But, isn&#8217;t that good to do it?</p>
<p>The dragon won&#8217;t show up, if I clean up this flock of goblins here.</p>
<p>However, if I let Cordelia cry here &#8211; It is a good example how insufficient my stand point for her.</p>
<p>-That&#8217;s why, its fine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cordelia&#8230;.. Well done, to do this alone so far&#8230;. now, leave it all up to me.&#8221;[TN: insert &#8220;Butterfly and Hurricanes&#8221; by Muse as bgm]
<p>&#8220;Lute&#8230;? To let&#8230;.fighting those goblins, but you are just&#8230;.a villager?&#8221;</p>
<p>And I took the sword used by Cordelia.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, I&#8217;m just a villager.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please just run away from here, Lute! It&#8217;s okay! You can just leave me here! Please, you must get away from here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&#8221;<br />
&#8220;But, you are a villager-&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a villager, but its not an ordinary villager&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;.?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am &#8211; the strongest villager on this land&#8221;</p>
<p>I stare at the surrounding goblins.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t let every one of them escape from here, okay? So&#8230; I heard about you a while ago&#8230; that we are equal at strength?&#8221;<br />
I hold the sword.</p>
<p>Pack group of goblins in front of me&#8230;roughly around 500 goblins.</p>
<p>If it was the former me, I could only sit down and shake in fear.</p>
<p>But, the present me is different.<br />
The 2nd time&#8230;.. for 12 years is not a joke.</p>
<p>-I don&#8217;t feel like losing even by surprise attack.<br />
And behind me is Cordfelia that she can&#8217;t even move&#8230;&#8230;Now the position is reversed here.<br />
I lifted my voice while facing those goblins.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Come on&#8230;.. Bring it on!&#8221;</p>
