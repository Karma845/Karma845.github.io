<h3>Chapter 5: Determination 1</h3>

<p>I don't remember how I managed to get back home after that.</p>

<p>Just I wake up, I was lying on my own bed.</p>

<p>&quot;...Morning, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Through the gap in the curtains, I could see the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>I looked at the clock on the shelf by my pillow and it was already 9 o'clock.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm late... Should I just skip today?&quot;</p>

<p>I got up from bed and went on my smartphone from the table. I received a message from Haruno, saying &quot;Are you skipping school today? Ayana-chan isn't here either.&quot;</p>

<p>...It seems Hoshimiya is also absent. That's to be expected. Given the situation last night. She will probably be absent for a while.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's parents committed suicide. Why did they do it?</p>

<p>It's because they killed my family.</p>

<p>No, saying they killed them wouldn't be accurate.</p>

<p>It was traffic accident.</p>

<p>Even though I knew that, I can't organize my feelings.</p>

<p>But that doesn't mean I hold any grudges against Hoshimiya...</p>

<p>&quot;What the hell... Damn.&quot;</p>

<p>Can something like this really happen?</p>

<p>I thought things will go well with Hoshimiya. After I resolve the stalker issue.</p>

<p>But I can remember it vividly now. The moment the accident happened.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya and her parents stepping out of the car...</p>

<p>And the fading sense of emptiness. It felt like my heart had been ripped out, leaving me with a hollow feeling.</p>

<p>It was a sensation of emptiness inside my body. A feeling I haven't experienced in a long time...</p>

<p>&quot;Living is such a hassle.&quot;</p>

<p>I lay back on the bed again and closed my eyes. I didn't want to think about anything.</p>

<p>As if rejecting the current reality, I let my consciousness sink into the world of dreams.</p>

<p>My mind and my body already reached their limits.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;... So tired.&quot;</p>

<p>When I woke up, it was already around noon. Even in this situation, I felt hungry. I wanted to eat something.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if there's anything...&quot;</p>

<p>I got up from bed and left the bedroom, heading towards the kitchen where the refrigerator was.</p>

<p>&quot;...Nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>The refrigerator was empty. For some reason, there was only an expired tube of wasabi sitting there.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, I don't even care anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>I became apathetic towards everything. I returned to the bedroom and collapse myself onto the bed.</p>

<p>As I blankly stared at the ceiling, I suddenly remembered Hoshimiya's innocent smiling face.</p>

<p>&quot;...Ah, damn it. What the hell?&quot;</p>

<p>Tears started overflowing. The tears I shed after a long time felt incredibly hot, and it seemed like my cheeks were getting burned.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Always... It's always like this. Everytime the things go well, there's always something preventing it.</p>

<p>Fate, or whatever you call it, doesn't allow me to walk a smooth and happy path.</p>

<p>&quot;My life is really shitty, huh.&quot;</p>

<p>When Haruno rejected me, I still had the energy to do something reckless.</p>

<p>But now... I don't even have the energy to think about wanting to die.</p>

<p>&quot;What is Hoshimiya doing right now...?&quot;</p>

<p>She was crying so much, surely she's still going through a difficult time...</p>

<p>*Ding-dong.*</p>

<p>The doorbell rang. But I don't care.</p>

<p>I decided to close my eyes and go to sleep...</p>

<p>*Ding-dong.*</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>My intuition says it's Haruno.</p>

<p>But it's lunchtime now, means she's in school...</p>

<p>&quot;Should I go?&quot;</p>

<p>I felt exhaustion all over my body, but I sluggishly got up and headed towards the entrance.</p>

<p>As I slowly opened the door...</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Riku-chan! Your bedhead is incredible... Good morning, I guess?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Haruno?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it's me! Haruno, your precious childhood friend, has come to play!&quot;</p>

<p>The presence of her bright smile, like sun is always right there.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, isn't it school time now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I snuck out. It's my first time skipping school... hehe.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno playfully acted dumb with her cheerful demeanor.</p>

<p>Normally, she would be too adorable, and I would be utterly smitten, but now I couldn't feel anything.</p>

<p>&quot;...Why?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it obvious?&quot;</p>

<p>Laughing, Haruno looked at me with eyes that seemed to say, 'Don't you really know?'</p>

<p>&quot;To meet my dear childhood friend... to see the person I love.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno said that with a gentle, slightly wistful smile.</p>

<p>She shouldn't know what happened between me and Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>Even so, she must have sensed that something had happened, given that I was absent from school without saying anything. So, this is what it means to have a childhood friend, huh....</p>

<p>&quot;Just so you know, I did send a message saying I would come from now on... but you didn't saw it, didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah, my bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, no need to apologize. I came here without considering Riku-chan's situation.&quot;</p>

<p>No, she came because she was worried about me.</p>

<p>Haruno has a serious personality and would never skip school just for her own convenience.</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>I suddenly noticed the supermarket bag that Haruno was holding. Inside were various ingredients, it seemed.</p>

<p>Noticing my gaze, Haruno lightly lifted the supermarket bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this? Since it's you, Riku-chan, you probably haven't eaten anything, right? I'll show off my cooking skills and make something for us!&quot;</p>

<p>With a self-assured smile, she huffed and puffed, showing her determination. It seemed like she knew everything in advance...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the cooking utensils had gathered dust as they had never been used before. There's no way I would cook.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear, it turned out like this after all, Haha. You're a boy who can't live alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm managing just fine. I've survived this long without dying.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's because I've been inviting you to have dinner regularly. And until recently, you were taken care of by Ayana-chan, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>What does she mean by &quot;I see&quot;? Haruno seemed to have sensed something from my silent response, as she briefly showed a serious expression before quickly returning to her smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan, wait in the room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmn..&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded and headed to the dining area and sat on the chair. Without thinking about anything, I watched Haruno put on an apron over her uniform. Me, someone who had no interest in housework, I had no idea what she was doing, but it seemed like she's pretty skillfull in preparing ingredients for cooking.</p>

<p>However, it's somehow... like the ideal I had in the past.</p>

<p>I had dreamed of becoming a family with Haruno.</p>

<p>If it could become a reality, would it be like this?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for the meal.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was delicious.&quot;</p>

<p>What Haruno made for us was oyakodon. It had a fluffy and creamy egg, tender and savory chicken, and the crispness of the onions added a nice touch. Eating delicious food enriches one's life.</p>

<p>Despite my listless feeling earlier, I was starting to become a little more positive.</p>

<p>I looked up and noticed that Haruno, sitting across from me, had a happy smile on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;You seem happy about something...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I am. Because Riku-chan always eats with such an appetizing expression. It makes me feel accomplished as a cook.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Your food always tastes delicious, Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad to hear that, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a casual conversation. Yet, those simple words managed to heal my heart.</p>

<p>However, the unavoidable truth remained.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, what is it, Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you know about Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno had been looking at me with a gentle expression, but suddenly, her face tightened.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me. Did you know about Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan... Did you remember the accident?&quot;</p>

<p>From her phrasing, it seemed that Haruno was aware of my memory situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. The person's who's responsible of that accident were Hoshimiya's parents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...No way. So it was really Ayana-chan's parents!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno who's shock. She lowered her head, unsure of how to react.</p>

<p>&quot;You didn't know about Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had my suspicions. I didn't remember the name, but when I saw the same last name, I thought it might be related... So initially, I tried to keep you away from Ayana-chan as much as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But then, when I saw Ayana-chan treating you like any other person, I concluded that it must be a different Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>I understood after hearing her explanation.</p>

<p>At the beginning of my involvement with Hoshimiya, Haruno insisted that &quot;Ayana-chan was off-limits to me&quot; without revealing her reasons. However, she eventually accepted the idea of me being with Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hoshimiya doesn't remember the accident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...To be more precise, Hoshimiya's parents committed suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Wait, wait a moment, Riku-chan. Tell me what happened between Ayana-chan and you.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno who's even got more shock, I revealed everything that had happened the previous night.</p>

<p>Upon hearing the whole story, Haruno remained silent, her lips trembling.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the situation. It's really an incredible coincidence, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just can't understand anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno remained wordless, her mouth closed tightly.</p>

<p>Not knowing what to say, Haruno seemed lost in the midst of this painful silence.</p>

<p>Then, as if struck by an idea, I spoke lightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno... I... I like you. I want to be in a relationship with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;....Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno seemed surprised by the sudden confession, her eyes blinking rapidly.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be with you, Haruno. I want us to be a family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, well, um...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to live here with me. I want you by my side forever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;C-Calm down, Riku-chan. It's so sudden...&quot;</p>

<p>I stood up from my chair, approached the bewildered Haruno, and firmly grasped her shoulders, pouring out my feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;I've liked you for a long time. It might sound weird, but I've always thought about you and followed you with my eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was really painful when people said they only saw us as childhood friends. You're the only one for me, and if I'm rejected by you... then this world would lose all its meaning for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But now... there's Ayana-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That Hoshimiya is the source of my pain!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>An intense feeling surged up from the depths of my being, reaching the back of my throat.</p>

<p>Tears overflowed from my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's right... Haruno was right. I like Hoshimiya! But you know what? Hoshimiya's presence is what torments me! Whenever I remember Hoshimiya... the moment my family was hit by a car... the thought of Hoshimiya's parents...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan... But you're worried about Ayana-chan, aren't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am worried, of course I am! Because I love her... But I don't care about it anymore! Hoshimiya... she's the beginning of it all!&quot;</p>

<p>I poured out everything in a choked voice mixed with sobs.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno... please be with me! I realize now that you're the only one for me... I don't want to look at anyone else anymore!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>My grip on Haruno's shoulders tightened involuntarily.</p>

<p>But Haruno didn't show any signs of pain and looked straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno... you... you love me too, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to be by my side forever. I'll do anything for you... and let's get married someday, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno would accept everything about me.</p>

<p>That's how it's been all along.</p>

<p>She says she loves me and worries about me, even coming to my house.</p>

<p>Me and Haruno together...</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>Why is Haruno not saying anything?</p>

<p>Why won't she respond?</p>

<p>Why is she wearing such a dark and troubled expression...!</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;I'm gonna be rejected again.</p>

<p>Just like back then, I'm gonna be rejected.</p>

<p>A confession I was so sure would succeed, yet will not.</p>

<p>Once again, I'm being rejected...</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>In the midst of my heart being squeezed, Haruno's attitude suddenly changes&mdash;a bright smile, like the sun, appears on her face as she opens her mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine, let's date.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to be happy, Riku-chan. But you know, if I see you talking to other girls... I'll definitely get jealous. I can be a troublesome girl like that, is that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, it's more than okay. Besides, I don't talk to any other girls except you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I see. That's right.&quot;</p>

<p>For a moment, Haruno seemed like she wanted to say something, but she laughed cheerfully and said, &quot;Ahaha.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, I want to be with you forever.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine. If Riku-chan wishes for it... I'll be by your side.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, with a loving smile on her face, gently strokes my cheek.</p>

<p>Ah, finally. My wish finally come true.</p>

<p>So many things have happened in this past month.</p>

<p>But the feelings I've held since we were in kids finally accomplished something.</p>

<p>Just like before, we will continue to walk in our own world, just the two of us&#9472;&#9472;.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>I wake up feeling unusually restless.</p>

<p>I see the familiar ceiling and realize that I'm in my own bed.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Someone is clinging to my body, pressing against me with strong force.</p>

<p>That must be the cause of my restlessness. Even without seeing their face, I know who it is.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, it's morning already.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm... Riku-chan...?&quot;</p>

<p>As Haruno slowly lifts her head, a sweet and tangy refreshing scent wafts through the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's eyes are still sleepy. Her words is still not clear. She's still half-asleep.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, well... I think I mentioned this the day before yesterday, but if you're going to cling to me, please do it a little more gently. It's a bit suffocating.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, we used to sleep like this when we were little, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not true. I only remember holding hands while sleeping.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Riku-chan, you used to hold me after falling asleep. It feels really nice, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>With a carefree smile, Haruno snuggles her head against my chest, preparing to fall asleep again.</p>

<p>...The sense of closeness has become quite intense. It's a bit late to realize that now.</p>

<p>It has been two weeks since I started dating Haruno. We have begun living together in my house.</p>

<p>Of course, we have received permission from Haruno's parents.</p>

<p>&quot;...But Haruno, we have school today too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What 'oh, right'... We'll be late--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We still have time. Just five more minutes...&quot;</p>

<p>As I try to sit up, Haruno pushes me back with her weight.</p>

<p>She clings to me with all her might, like a cute little creature seeking for affection.</p>

<p>Five more minutes... Glancing at the clock, we still have plenty of time.</p>

<p>Five minutes, I guess I can immerse myself with her a little bit.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, hurry up! We're going to be late for school!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it your fault... repeating 'just five more minutes' four times.&quot;</p>

<p>In the peaceful town, Haruno and I were in hurry, running towards to school.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>I suddenly stopped in my tracks. Is that a girl from another class?</p>

<p>I spotted a pair of girls who looked like typical gal, leisurely walking on the sidewalk across the road. They have the essence of true strength, accepting their laziness while with walking confident.</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>The word &quot;Gal&quot; reminded me of Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya hasn't come to school yet. Summer vacation is just a few days away...</p>

<p>According to the homeroom teacher, there are &quot;family circumstances&quot; involved, but no one really knows the truth.</p>

<p>There are rumors that she might drop out of school like this...</p>

<p>........I wonder how Hoshimiya is doing.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan! What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, who noticed me standing still, dashed back towards me.</p>

<p>&quot;You should stay behind me properly, Okay!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you looking at... Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's gaze captured the attention of the gals. Cold light flickered in her large eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, looking at boys from the morning, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What's with that weird way of saying it...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's no big deal. You're free to look at whoever you wants. It's also your freedom to overlook this cute childhood friend and gaze at other girls, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Let's go to school. Hold hands this time so we don't get separated.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno tightly gripped my right hand and started walking towards the school.</p>

<p>My childhood friend is full of jealousy....</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Inside the school, Haruno's behavior becomes more reserved. It seems she cares about the people around her.</p>

<p>Sitting at my desk, I watched Haruno happily chatting with her female friends.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>In contrast to Haruno, there was Kana.</p>

<p>Kana, who was always with Hoshimiya, had been spending time alone lately.</p>

<p>Even if someone talked to her, she seemed absent-minded. She was probably worried about Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>The other day, Kana called me and we went to the back of the school building to tell her about the situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Anything is fine. Just tell me something about Ayana. You must know something, right?&quot;</p>

<p>At that moment, I couldn't say anything. I didn't feel like speaking up.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kana pressed for answers, but Haruno appeared and forcibly drove her away.</p>

<p>Since then, Kana hasn't approached me to talk.</p>

<p>&quot;...This is fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya and I should keep our distance. We shouldn't get involved.</p>

<p>Above all, I deeply love my current life.</p>

<p>Having Haruno by my side always, a life where I only look at Haruno. This is what I wished for...</p>

<p>&quot;...I wished for it...&quot;</p>

<p>I push down the urge to ask something, deep into my heart and told my myself, 'It's fine.'</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After school, Haruno said, &quot;There's a place I want to stop by on the way home,&quot; and quietly took my hand as we followed along. The place we arrived at was a crepe stand in a plaza near the station.</p>

<p>This place... It's where Hoshimiya and I came before...</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, we've never had crepes together, right? I heard about this place from Morimoto-san, and I've been wanting to come here with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Looking at Haruno as she happily spoke with a bright smile, it seemed she didn't know that it was the place where Hoshimiya and I had been before.</p>

<p>We ordered our crepes and received them.</p>

<p>As we walked on the way back, eating our crepes, Haruno poked my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;I want a bite of Riku-chan's crepe~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Here you go.&quot;</p>

<p>Without any particular reason to refuse, I offered my crepe to her.</p>

<p>Haruno happily took a bite and with a genuinely content expression, she said, &quot;Oishiii~&quot; as if it slipped out of her mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you can have a bite of my crepe too.&quot;</p>

<p>This time, Haruno offered me her crepe, so I accepted without hesitation.</p>

<p>Unintentionally, I ended up eating from the portion that Haruno had already taken a bite of, but it was a fair exchange.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go to the game center next?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Why the game center...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You like it, don't you, Riku-chan? Aren't you in the mood today?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno asked with a hint of anxiety, and without much thought, I said, &quot;Let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>There wasn't any deep meaning behind it, but I hesitated for some reason.</p>

<p>Without noticing my hesitation, Haruno walked ahead while eating her crepe.</p>

<p>Haruno occasionally stop and turn around to make sure I was following her.</p>

<p>And if, by any chance, there was more distance between us than she expected...</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you mustn't stray too far from me. Shall we hold hands?&quot;</p>

<p>With a gentle smile, she reached out her hand.</p>

<p>&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>We arrived at the game center and casually wandered around, choosing games that caught our eye and playing them.</p>

<p>Rather than playing the games themselves, we enjoyed our time together at the arcade.</p>

<p>I'm sure Haruno felt the same way. It was evident that she cherished our time together.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan. Let's play that next!&quot;</p>

<p>Amidst the noise in the arcade, Haruno pointed her finger towards... air hockey.</p>

<p>For a split second, my heart raced.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, yeah... It's nothing. Sure, let's play.&quot;</p>

<p>I took my position and inserted a coin into the slot. The puck came out, and the game began.</p>

<p>Without anything particularly special happening, Haruno and I enjoyed playing air hockey.</p>

<p>Every time the puck collided with the wall, a loud sound effect played from the machine, and when the puck entered Haruno's goal, she let out a cute scream, saying, &quot;Wah!&quot;...</p>

<p>The current score was 9-2. The winner would be the first to reach 10 points, and I had 9. It was quite a one-sided match.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan! The game isn't over yet! I'll win with the next point!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's pretty impossible according to the rules!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno seemed to struggle with air hockey compared to Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>...At that time, Hoshimiya was truly vibrant.</p>

<p>--'I'm the Air Hockey Queen by the neighborhood kids, you know!'</p>

<p>...Looking back, being called the Air Hockey Queen was so cheesy.</p>

<p>&quot;Chance!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>I let my guard down. The puck hit by Haruno collided with the side walls at high speed, reflecting back without giving me a chance to react... and with a loud noise, it entered my goal.</p>

<p>&quot;I did it! I got a point!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno innocently celebrated like a child. That sight... overlapped with Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>Ah, this is bad. I shouldn't be thinking about Hoshimiya while I'm with Haruno. How terrible of me.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the overflowing emotions couldn't be stopped...</p>

<p>&quot;Guh... Ugh...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>The intense emotions surged up, passing through my throat and reaching my eyes.</p>

<p>In an attempt to hide my emotions, I hunched over and placed my hands on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan!? Are you so shocked that I scored a point against you?! I'm sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No... That's not it...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.....I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno came closer to me and gently stroked my back.</p>

<p>There was no doubt. My childhood friend understood.</p>

<p>Because she understood, I realized just how terrible my current actions are.</p>

<p>Despite that, Haruno still spoke to me, leaning in to offer comfort.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, Riku-chan. I'm here for you. I promise I won't let you go through difficult times anymore...&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>I kept listening to the sound of the shower echoing in the bathroom.</p>

<p>Without washing my body, I sat on bath chair, thinking about today's events.</p>

<p>Especially the incident at the game center, I made Haruno worry. That wasn't good.</p>

<p>&quot;I should forget about Hoshimiya...&quot;</p>

<p>Originally, it was a relationship that I shouldn't have been involved in.</p>

<p>Because of various coincidences, Hoshimiya was pushed to the point where she couldn't come to school.</p>

<p>What I should do now is forget about Hoshimiya and focus on my life with Haruno.</p>

<p>While I was thinking about such things, I heard the sound of the bathroom door being opened from behind. I turned around, thinking &quot;Could it be?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan! Let's take a bath together!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, who had undressed, stepped into the bathroom with a cheerful attitude.</p>

<p>It was the first time Haruno had barged into the bath like this.</p>

<p>Well, even though she's undressed, she's wearing an orange swimsuit...</p>

<p>If she come here naked, I'm would definitely passed out.</p>

<p>Just the bikini alone put a strain on my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;It's almost summer vacation, right? I bought a new swimsuit to go to the beach with you. So, how is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's, it's adorable. Extremely cute.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? That's great! I wanted Riku-chan to be happy, so I chose it while getting advice from my friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno let out a smile as if she was relieved.</p>

<p>With her appearance and what she said, everything about her felt incredibly adorable.</p>

<p>I found myself gazing at Haruno's figure in her swimsuit.</p>

<p>The first thing that came to mind was... her chest has gotten bigger&mdash;something quite manly.</p>

<p>I'm not a pervert who can determine the cup size just by looking. In our first year of high school, they were slightly smaller than average, but now they seem slightly bigger than average. Maybe Haruno's shorter height makes her chest size stand out even more.</p>

<p>Despite her petite frame, she has a healthy waistline, and her legs with just the balance of fat and muscle makes my heart skip a beat.</p>

<p>To put it mildly, it's erotic.</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe. Riku-chan, you're completely captivated by me.&quot;</p>

<p>While exuding happiness, Haruno wore a mischievous grin.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno... Your chest has gotten bigger, hasn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it has. Lately, it suddenly started growing... Riku-chan, do you prefer big or small?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, most guys prefer big ones. But it's not like they dislike small ones either. Assuming that they love both big and small, most guys prefer the bigger ones.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, Riku-chan, which one do you prefer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Bigger the better.&quot;</p>

<p>It was an immediate response. I rambled on about various things, but in the end, I chose the bigger ones. Can't beat the instincts of a man.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Riku-chan, you like the bigger ones... Well, I guess that's good.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno nodded with satisfaction as she looked at her own chest. At least she seemed to be satisfied with my answer.</p>

<p>As I pondered what to do next, Haruno picked up the bath chair that was placed in the corner of the bathroom and came over to sit next to me, side by side.</p>

<p>To avoid having our lower bodies in close proximity, I gently turned my body to the side.</p>

<p>&quot;... Haruno, when you get too close like this... I start to become aware of various things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Weren't you aware until now? I... have been aware of it all along.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;..!&quot;</p>

<p>I was hit with a counterattack that far exceeded my imagination.</p>

<p>Its power was equivalent to a single punch that would blow off my head.</p>

<p>&quot;S-So... Haruno? When you say 'aware,' you mean... in an erotic sense.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yep.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno said it nonchalantly. This is bad.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm aware, but I made a promise with my mom. We're supposed to have a healthy relationship.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see. If that's the case, then it can't be helped...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you know, Riku-chan, if you wish for it... I think it's okay to break the promise with my mom.&quot; (TL: I guess nothing happens in the past weeks....)</p>

<p>&quot;....&quot;</p>

<p>My sanity was brutally murdered.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/embed0013_HD.jpg">

<p>Haruno who's aware on my anxiety, continued talking.</p>

<p>&quot;Actually... I might have been waiting for this to happen...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>My head exploded at Haruno's slightly embarrassed words. What is this?</p>

<p>Well, Haruno has always been proactive since we were young. There were plenty of instances of physical contact, and she always tried to capture my attention.</p>

<p>Although it might sound strange, her current words and actions don't feel out of place. Besides, we're in a romantic relationship now...</p>

<p>&quot;...Let's wait until after high school for that kind of thing.&quot;</p>

<p>I forcefully pushed away the fluffy daydream that surfaced in my mind and spoke as if squeezing the words from my throat.</p>

<p>Of course, I also wanted to do such things with Haruno, but when the moment actually arrives, I hesitate a bit. Am I just a coward?</p>

<p>&quot;We'll wait until after high school... If that's what Riku-chan says, I'll endure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, Riku-chan, let's wash each other's bodies like we used to when we were little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wash each other's bodies... Well, we've both grown in various ways, so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? I meant washing each other's backs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What were you imagining, Riku-chan? Pervert~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuh...!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno laughed merrily, rolling with amusement. I could only blush in embarrassment and I couldn't come up with any excuses.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>This is a dream... I know it's a dream.</p>

<p>The stage is a cityscape. Cars are driving on the road, and people are walking on the sidewalks. A perfectly normal scene.</p>

<p>Like a ghost, I stopped to tie shoelace, and I gazed at my middle school self.</p>

<p>&quot;Onii-chan, I'll go ahead!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's how it should be, my dear sister. When your older brother stops, it's your duty as a sister to wait.&quot;</p>

<p>...I'm speaking in a strange manner. Probably influenced by some anime character.</p>

<p>Moreover, my younger sister, walking ahead of me, stucking her tongue and ignored me with a &quot;I dooon't caaaare.&quot;</p>

<p>My mother and father walked happily with my sister, chuckling together.</p>

<p>The 'me' who doesn't know what will happen casually started tying my shoelace.</p>

<p>And just as I finished tying my shoelace and stood up to start walking...</p>

<p>A car sped into my parents and sister.</p>

<p>My family members flew away like a joke, as if they were light objects, not resembling the mass of humans.</p>

<p>In the lingering time that felt like eternity, my family fell to the ground.</p>

<p>Completely motionless.</p>

<p>The surroundings began to grow noisy.</p>

<p>From the car, Hoshimiya's parents and Hoshimiya herself stepped out...</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... Ugh!&quot;</p>

<p>I jolted upright as if I was push. In an instant, my consciousness snapped back to reality.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>The room was pitch black with the lights turned off. Time-wise, it felt like the late night hours.</p>

<p>As I woke up in bed, I noticed that cold sweat was pouring out from all over my body.</p>

<p>The pajamas I was wearing clung to my skin uncomfortably.</p>

<p>&quot;...Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, who was sleeping right next to me, woke up and sat up, speaking to me.</p>

<p>&quot;You had that dream again, didn't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Every night, I was plagued by nightmares. It must be because my memories had returned.</p>

<p>&quot;Come here, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno exuded a gentle aura like that of a mother and opened her arms, inviting me.</p>

<p>Without saying anything, I gently buried my face in Haruno's chest.</p>

<p>In response, she embraced me, enveloping me in her warmth, and gradually, even I could feel my emotions calming down.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's go back to sleep like this, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>Lying down while still embraced by Haruno, I closed my eyes slowly.</p>

<p>Without thinking about anything, I surrendered myself to this comforting warmth...</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;Is this really okay?</p>

<p>Ignoring the question, I fell asleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Summer vacation begins without any particular events. I spend my time with Haruno everyday whether on school or in home.</p>

<p>For me, peaceful days where nothing changes, is something special....</p>

<p>And part of that special thing, is that I haven't seen Hoshimiya even once.</p>

<p>In the end, Hoshimiya didn't come to school until summer vacation.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, what should I do now?&quot;</p>

<p>Being alone for the first time in a while, I lie down on the sofa in the living room and I absentmindedly gaze at the ceiling.</p>

<p>It's currently evening. Haruno went home because her mother called her, so I'm left with nothing to do. Well, she'll come back later on, though...</p>

<p>When I'm alone, I inevitably start thinking about various things. Mostly in negative way.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>I thought about getting some ice cream and headed to the freezer.</p>

<p>There were frozen foods, but no ice cream.</p>

<p>&quot;Should I go buy some...&quot;</p>

<p>I grabbed my wallet and decided to go to the convenience store.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>I bought several random cup of ice creams and left the nearby convenience store.</p>

<p>The moment I stepped outside, a wave of heat engulfed my entire body. Even in evening, outside is still hot as usual.</p>

<p>I came in a casual outfit, wearing a shirt and shorts, but I could still feel the heat.</p>

<p>The people passing by in the town were also dressed in outfits that exposed their skin.</p>

<p>&quot;...The ice cream is melting.&quot;</p>

<p>I bought some for Haruno too. I should go back before it melts.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to start walking....</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Kuromine, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Coincidently, I ran into Kana. Judging by her loose attire that looks like loungewear, she must have come outside to buy ice cream in convenience store.</p>

<p>&quot;It feels refreshing, doesn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seeing you in something other than your school uniform.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, it's kinda creepy. I've thought this before, but you're surprisingly straightforward, Kuromine. And you casually call me by my name too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My bad, I don't know your last name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if that's the case, I guess it can't be helped, jerk... Wait, seriously, you don't know my last name?&quot;</p>

<p>Kana, with a surprised and astonished expression, asked me, and I silently nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see, huh. Well, fair enough. I also... don't know your last name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, earlier you said 'Kuromine,' right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Did you mishear me? I said 'Riku'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're incredibly competitive... If you don't mind, could you tell me your last name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Absolutely not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If it's come to this, I won't tell you, no matter what. Actually, I don't want to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>Completely offended, Kana crossed her arms and turned her face away from me, with a dismissive &quot;Hmph.&quot; She seems to have stronger-willed than Haruno or Hoshimiya...</p>

<p>Deciding that the conversation was over, I tried to pass by Kana and head back home.</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on a second.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Stopped in my tracks by her call, I turned around.</p>

<p>Kana was looking at me with a serious expression.</p>

<p>&quot;After this... Can we talk for a bit?&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>I accepted Kana's invitation and we arrived at a nearby small park.</p>

<p>There was no one else here, so it was a perfect environment for conversation.</p>

<p>...I hope we can wrap up this discussion quickly. If it drags on, my ice cream will melt.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's sit here.&quot;</p>

<p>I sat down on the bench as Kana told me to.</p>

<p>Keeping a slight distance, Kana also took a seat next to me.</p>

<p>&quot;What are we going to talk about? Just so you know, I'm not sharing my ice cream.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't need it and I don't really care about that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's about Ayana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>I felt a tight grip on my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromi&#9472;&#9472; Riku, you're not in-touch with Ayana anymore?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. I just wanted to know what happened between you two... even if it's just what happened to Ayana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... You're really the worst.&quot;</p>

<p>Realizing that she couldn't get any information out of me, Kana frowned and let out a complaint.</p>

<p>I didn't want to talk about it. I wanted to forget.</p>

<p>&quot;...The other day, I went to Ayana's house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>I listened attentively as Kana began speaking in a calm voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana did come out for a bit, but she was really a mess... She had been crying all the time, her eyes were bloodshot... Her hair was all tangled and messy...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She always smile when she's listening to my stories, but she's definitely forcing herself to laugh at that time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What... are you trying to say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...That night, I stayed over at Ayana's house. And while she was sleeping... she kept apologizing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>I listen quietly to Kana's words, hearing it, I just can't help to not believe her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Kuromine-kun, I'm sorry, Kuromine-kun, I'm sorry...&quot; She kept apologizing to you over and over again, tears streaming down her face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.......&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, what happened? Why's Ayana suffering so much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you have a fight with Ayana? Did you reject her, just to start dating Harukaze?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not it!&quot;</p>

<p>I unintentionally raised my voice and denied it.</p>

<p>Kana flinched and trembled for a moment, but she quickly regained her composure and continued the conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana won't answer when I ask her what happened. ...I mean, it's like a complete mess...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Regarding to this, it's not something I can just blabber to others...&quot; I explained.</p>

<p>&quot;.....I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Both Kana and I averted our gaze from each other's faces and looked down, staring at the ground in silence.</p>

<p>Several seconds of silence passed, Kana spoke up.</p>

<p>&quot;...Ayana moved.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the countryside. She said she's staying at a house belonging to someone her grandmother knows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's planning to quit school during the summer break.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>I swallowed hard quietly, and hide my concern.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know anything. What happened to Ayana. But, you know, does Ayana really need to suffer like this?&quot; Kana spoke calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know the details. But right now, you're the only one who can save Ayana, right, Riku?&quot;</p>

<p>Kana looked straight into my eyes and spoke with conviction.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't... do anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't need to do anything. Just be with Ayana's side, that's enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Until Ayana became like this, she always talked about you. She complained about you lacking sensitivity or being sloppy, or saying strange things...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just complaining.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she also said this. Spending time with Kuromine-kun is fun. She said it with the biggest smile on her face.&quot; Kana continue. &quot;On the next Saturday, I'm going by train to the place where Ayana currently lives.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...And what is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want you to come too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's important to talk to Ayana properly. I don't know what happened, but things can't stay like this.&quot;</p>

<p>Kana said something, but it didn't reach my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, I've already informed Ayana about my visit, so it's up to you to&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Enough!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm tired of it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>My emotions erupted uncontrollably, and I stood up and yelled.</p>

<p>Kana widened her eyes, but I couldn't stop myself.</p>

<p>&quot;I just... want to live happily, peacefully... I don't want to get hurt anymore! I don't want to get hurt anymore...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand that, but&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you understand?! You don't know anything! How much... how much I've...!&quot;</p>

<p>Unable to bear it any longer, tears spilled from my eyes. Memories of the past flooded back in an instant.</p>

<p>Suddenly losing my family&#9472; being supported by Haruno&#9472; being rejected by Haruno&#9472; saving Hoshimiya from a convenience store robber&#9472; being supported by Hoshimiya&#9472; confronting Haruno&#9472; saving Hoshimiya from a stalker&#9472; starting a relationship with Hoshimiya, only to&#9472;!</p>

<p>I just want to live a normal, peaceful life...</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry... I'm undoubtedly the worst for pushing you like this... But still, let me say this much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're the only one who can save Ayana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.......&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you understand what I mean by that?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't want to understand.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for saying all that. I'm going to Ayana's place. I don't think I can do anything... Well, I'll just go visit as a friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll let you know the train schedule just in case. It's 6:40 in the morning. I'll be waiting at the station...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm not going.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Kana gave a short reply, glanced at my eyes once, then stood up from the bench and started walking, facing away from me. She left the park without ever looking back.</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>'You're the only one who can save Hoshimiya.'</p>

<p>&quot;I knew that from the beginning.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After parting ways with Kana, I returned home and found myself lying on the sofa, staring at the ceiling without doing anything. Even when Haruno came back, I continued to gaze intently at the ceiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, what's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riiikuuu-chan! Boo!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;Ack!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno jumped onto my body from my chest...! The sofa creaked faintly because of the impact.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, hey~. Even though you have such a cute little sister like me, why do you keep staring at the ceiling?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, in a strangely clingy manner, sprawled on top of me and asked while pressing against my body.</p>

<p>...This is getting dangerously close. Haruno's face is right there, filling up my entire field of vision, and her weight is pushing against me.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, as a guy, it's nice, but it's overwhelming my self-control, so please stop.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? I think it's okay for self-control to fly out the window.&quot;</p>

<p>Grinning mischievously, Haruno flashed a smile that I had seen a few times before.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, are you struggling and feeling miserable again?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not good. You know, I always want Riku-chan to have happy thoughts. If there's anything I can do, I'll do it for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's eyes were filled with determination.</p>

<p>I felt like she could make anything happen if it was my wish.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall I try guessing what Riku-chan is struggling with?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's about Ayana-chan, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Mmn.&quot; I nodded.</p>

<p>As expected, she sees right through everything. I can't compete with my childhood friend.</p>

<p>Haruno slowly lifted herself up and sat back on the sofa.</p>

<p>I followed suit and sat back on the sofa as well.</p>

<p>&quot;Sometimes... I find myself thinking about Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean Ayana-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm worried. Hoshimiya is still going through a difficult time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The one suffering the most is Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>I neither denied nor affirmed it. Surely, Hoshimiya is going through as much pain as I am.</p>

<p>No, she's probably going through even more pain than me.</p>

<p>I have Haruno, a kind childhood friend who supports my life.</p>

<p>But does Hoshimiya have someone who can be there for her to that extent?</p>

<p>Even though she has a friend like Kana, the fact that she hasn't told Kana about what happened in her past means there's a significant psychological distance between them.</p>

<p>And there's also Hoshimiya's own personality.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya... feel sense of guilt. Basing about she dreams about me, apologizing.</p>

<p>Her parents killed someone in an accident, and then they both committed suicide... She's always trapped in guilt...</p>

<p>Does anyone have such a painful life?</p>

<p>&quot;...I know what I should do.&quot;</p>

<p>I just need to convey one thing: that I don't hold any resentment towards Hoshimiya. That alone should offer some consolation to her heart.</p>

<p>Of course, in reality, I haven't completely come to terms with that accident. But I understand that it was an &quot;accident.&quot;</p>

<p>There are no perpetrators in this world.</p>

<p>When I think of Hoshimiya, I recall painful memories. That's the truth. That's why I can't help but think that Hoshimiya is going through even more pain than I am.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, do you still like Ayana-chan? What do you want for your future with Ayana-chan? What do you want to do from now on?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno asked me calmly. Of course the answer's already been decide before.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to live with Hoshimiya... I want to protect her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno fell into silence, and a sense of stillness settled in. It was then that I finally understood what I had said.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry, Haruno! It's different! I like you, Haruno...!&quot; (TL: What a pathetic guy...)</p>

<p>My previous statement seemed disappoint Haruno while being in a relationship with me.</p>

<p>However, Haruno give me a gentle smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, I feel like I finally heard Riku-chan's true feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........I'm sorry. But, um... to truly understand and be there for Hoshimiya, I think maybe only I can do that. There's no one else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, You should to go to Ayana-chan place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........I don't want to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, but... I'm scared. Just scared. Something else might happen again. Something unpredictable...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to feel pain. I don't want my heart to be disturbed. I just want to live in peace... peacefully.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno quietly continued to listen to my words pouring out.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to be by your side. I don't want to be separated from you. I can't live without you, Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not true, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a lie...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about when you were with Ayana-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>I've relied on Haruno since we were little, but when I was with Hoshimiya, I felt like I could be my normal self.</p>

<p>I had occasionally thought about Haruno, but it wasn't as desperate as it is now.</p>

<p>&quot;When you were with Ayana-chan... I believe that you were able to be with yourself,&quot; Haruno said with a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't respond to Haruno's words.</p>

<p>As I remained silent, Haruno suddenly embraced me.</p>

<p>It was a tight embrace, as if our bodies were merging into one... a strong, tight embrace.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, Riku-chan. Really, I love you. I love you so much it hurts. Just talking to other girls makes me jealous, and I can't even imagine you being with anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, you know, even so, your happiness is the most important to me... Riku-chan, follow your heart... You should go to Ayana-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno lifted her face and looked into my eyes. She had a gentle smile, but... she was crying.</p>

<p>Multiple streaks of water seemed to float on Haruno's cheeks.</p>

<p>And in a voice that trembled ever so slightly, as if suppressing a sob, she continued speaking.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you're trapped with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not true... I love you, Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, thank you. I'm really happy. I love you too, Riku-chan... That's why I want you to see a broader world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A broader world...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, fly out of this cage. I know you'll be fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>With each word, tears overflowed from Haruno's eyes. It meant our parting, and Haruno understood that more than anyone else.</p>

<p>&quot;If, by any chance, you get tired and can't reach the place you're aiming for... you can come back. To the place where your childhood friends is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;......!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just like you said, only Ayana-chan can stay stand by your side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno... Haruno...!&quot;</p>

<p>The pain of knowing that my childhood friend, Haruno, genuinely cares for me was overwhelming.</p>

<p>Even though Haruno is possessive and jealous to the point of self-awareness...</p>

<p>She still considers only my happiness.</p>

<p>Despite how painful it is for her, the tears won't stop flowing...!</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you don't have to worry about me. Soar freely and proudly through the sky.&quot; Haruno continue. &quot;Freedom...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure they gave you the name 'Ri-ku,' with the meaning of soaring through the sky.&quot; (TL: &#20955; - Rin or Ri means dignified. &#31354; - sora or kuu means sky)</p>

<p>&quot;.....&quot;</p>

<p>I had never thought about the meaning of my name. I had never asked my parents about it.</p>

<p>Ah, even so, I wonder what my parents would think if they saw me now...</p>

<p>My sister would probably stick her tongue out at me and make fun of me.</p>

<p>&quot;But you'll be fine, Riku-chan... You can live without me. Because you've finally found something you want to do for yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... Mm....!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, if you cry that much... it'll ruin your handsome face, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>It seems like I was crying. I hadn't realized it.</p>

<p>I vaguely felt my cheeks getting warm, but...</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno... you're crying too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine. Crying is a normal thing when you've had your heart broken.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. Haha.&quot;</p>

<p>Even with a tear-streaked face, Haruno still managed to put a bright smile.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>The conversation settled, and the atmosphere became relaxed. We sat side by side on the sofa, enjoying the quiet moment without saying a word.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um, yeah. I actually thought that I couldn't compete with Ayana-chan,&quot; Haruno suddenly said.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just wait a moment,&quot; she said and went to the bedroom. She returned holding a book in her right hand.</p>

<p>Oh no... It was the erotic book I received from Mondo-san! Why!? I had hidden it under the bed!</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Haruno-sama?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's... an erotic book,&quot; Haruno said, narrowing her eyes as she stared at the cover.</p>

<p>By the way, the cover of the erotic book depicted a gal who looked exactly like Ayana.</p>

<p>&quot;This girl looks just like Ayana-chan,&quot; Haruno remarked.</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you're such a lively boy~&quot; she teased.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, sit properly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, um...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's too early for you to see this kind of thing. So, I'll give you a little lecture until the end,&quot; Haruno said, smiling playfully.</p>
