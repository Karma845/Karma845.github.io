<h3>Chapter 3: Turning Point</h3>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, thank you for everything up until now. Um, you don't have to... stay in this house anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What are you talking about? The stalker is still...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For these past three weeks, the stalker never showed up, right? It seems like I misunderstood.&quot;</p>

<p>Two days after resolving the incident with Haruno, Saturday morning came, but the atmosphere of Hoshimiya is kinda strange, leaving no logical reason why.</p>

<p>No, recently Hoshimiya seemed absent-minded or lost in thought about something.</p>

<p>She would wake up later than me and accidentally drop and break dishes...</p>

<p>I was worried that something might be wrong, and now this.</p>

<p>&quot;...There might really be a stalker, right? Shouldn't we keep an eye on things a little longer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How long are we going to keep watching? Forever? Until we graduate high school?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... until your parents come back or something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know when that will be.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Did I do something wrong?</p>

<p>Not too long ago - specifically, 'before' Haruno came to this house - Hoshimiya seems like she was enjoying our life together.</p>

<p>But now she's trying to sending me away. I can't understand this change.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... Hoshimiya's parents, aren't they supposed to come back in a year?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, yeah... that's right.&quot;</p>

<p>She seems quite uncertain. It's an unusual reaction for Hoshimiya, who loves her parents.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, I'll stay in this house a little longer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not good. I think Kuromine-kun should go back to your own home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you trying to send me home? Recently, you really want me to stay here right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, if you think about it calmly, it's not a good situation, right? A guy and a girl who aren't even dating, living under the same roof...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think it's a little late for you to say that now...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Argh! I'm telling you, it's fine! If there's no stalker, there's no need for you to be here, right?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Unusually, Hoshimiya raised her voice to me and expressed her emotions openly. Which makes me feel bit scared.</p>

<p>&quot;We still don't know if there's a stalker or not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, the fact that they haven't shown up even once is proof, isn't it? Besides, I don't think I'm attractive enough to be stalked...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're evaluation is getting on my nerves. Until I can be certain there's no stalker, I will stay in this house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Why do you care about me so much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I'm worried.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I see. But, um, what about Harukaze-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno? Right now, Haruno has nothing to do with this, doesn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The other day... you made up with her, right? So, I thought... maybe you two are dating...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's voice trailed off, but I managed to catch her words until the end.</p>

<p>...I see, that's what she means. Hoshimiya is concerned about me and Haruno.</p>

<p>&quot;Just so you know, Haruno and I are not dating.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You're not? Even though you have mutual feelings?&quot;</p>

<p>I haven't explained to Hoshimiya what I talked about with Haruno.</p>

<p>Yet, it seems like she knows that Haruno and I have mutual feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... well, we're not dating...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya stared into my eyes as she asked, but I didn't know how to answer.</p>

<p>The reason why Haruno and I aren't dating.</p>

<p>That's because... because I, Kuromine Riku also likes Hoshimiya Ayana...</p>

<p>...I can't say something like that.</p>

<p>&quot;For my sake?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're not dating Harukaze-san for my sake right...? That's why you're staying in this house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's a little different.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why? The person you like is Harukaze-san, right? So I think you shouldn't go to other girls...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm genuinely worried about you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Could it be, Kuromine-kun... do you... l-l... like me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya asked with blush and shaky voice.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes wide, because of surprise. Her intuition was unexpected.</p>

<p>&quot;If you like me, I think it's fine... but you like Harukaze-san, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well... that's...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In that case, let me ask... who you like, Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It's none of your business!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is! It's unfair if I'm the only one being asked all these questions! You should also tell me who you likes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I don't get it! I still can't understand what you're saying, Kuromine-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll ask again, though... Hoshimiya... you... do you like me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?! N-No way!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, who shouted loudly, shook her head in a flustered manner.</p>

<p>If Hoshimiya's crush is me, then I would be in a mutual affection situation with both beautiful girls.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm actually dense, you know, really... Do you... like me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What are you talking about, Kuromine-kun?! Your imagination is too wild!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Hoshimiya, you're nice to me! You're especially kind compared to me than other guys!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's a misunderstanding! Just because I'm nice to you, it doesn't mean anything... You're just a typical unpopular boy who misunderstands things!&quot; (TL:Ouch!)</p>

<p>&quot;&#8213;&#8213;Guuhuuh!&quot;</p>

<p>I felt like I had been hit with a loud and flashy bomb.</p>

<p>But, well, you know... like when she picked up my eraser or lent me her handkerchief, or when she greeted me... doesn't that imply some interest?</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, do you not like me...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't like you. So please don't worry about me... go to Harukaze-san's place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hoshimiya, you save my life before and... well...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if that's the case, it might be a bit of a nuisance to have you sticking around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8213;&#8213;Nuisance!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And besides, Kuromine-kun, you're sloppy... You say strange things that embarrass me, and you casually grab my underwear...&quot;</p>

<p>The sins about me just keep coming!</p>

<p>Could it be that instead of Hoshimiya liking me, it's actually the opposite...</p>

<p>&quot;A-Actually... I, I hate... hate you, Kuromine-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>&#8213;&#8213;What?!</p>

<p>Hate... She hates me.</p>

<p>I was shocked to the point of almost coughing up blood.</p>

<p>But still...</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay if you hate me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay if you hate me. I'm just worried about you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you hate me, I want to protect you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#8213;&#8213;Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>Who she likes or dislikes doesn't matter. I'm just genuinely concerned about her well-being.</p>

<p>If her safety is guaranteed by me not being around, then I won't hesitate to do so.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun... for you to care about me so much... Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, who seemed to be moved and teary-eyed, accidentally bumped her foot into the mini table. As a result, her smartphone, which was placed at the edge of the table, fell with force and bounced across the carpet, ending up going under the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, Let me take it back.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya gets down on the floor to search under the bed... Uh-oh! Under the bed is not a good place!</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, wait! It's&#8213;&#8213;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh? Besides the smartphone, there's something else... a book?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful, Hoshimiya! That's not a book, it's a cockroach!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eek! ...Wait, that can't be, right? Is this your book, Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>Saying so, Hoshimiya drags out the smartphone and a book from under the bed.</p>

<p>And as she gazes at the cover of the book&#8213;&#8213;her face quickly turns bright red!</p>

<p>&quot;T-This... This is... an erotic book!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right! It's an erotic book!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And moreover, this girl... she looks just like me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right! She looks just like you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you so confident about it?! Pervert!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait! Mondo-san forcely give that to me! It's not my fault!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you should have disposed of it or put it in Chisato-san's mailbox!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're silent! Why did you hide it under my bed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hiding erotic books under beds... that's the usual thing to do, for guys....&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's absurd! Kuromine-kun, absurd! Hiding erotic books under a girl's bed!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya becomes agitated, but it seems she's actually interested in the erotic book.</p>

<p>She sneakily glances at the cover.</p>

<p>To regain control of the situation, I clear my throat and explained it to her calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;Um... Well, that's the situation. I'll continue to rely on you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And?&quot;</p>

<p>&#8213;&#8213;Get out!!&quot;</p>

<p>....Expected. (TL: &#8230;&#8230;&#12391;&#12377;&#12424;&#12397;&#12540;&#12290;)</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Morning in classroom is noisy as always. There's not a single person like me who is dispirited.</p>

<p>In the corner of the classroom, a lone male student was prostrated on his desk, emitting a negative aura.</p>

<p>Yep, it's me.</p>

<p>&quot;...This is tough.&quot;</p>

<p>Being told Hoshimiya hates me and even told me to leave, and she even found out the erotic books I hide.</p>

<p>Well, if there's really no stalkers, then logically, I don't need to live in that apartment as Hoshimiya said.</p>

<p>In other words, the reason I'm feeling down is simply due to my own feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;So, it means I want to be with Hoshimiya...&quot;</p>

<p>Muttering to myself somehow, I immediately felt someone's presence right next to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you seem down. What happened?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>I lifted my head and confirmed Haruno's face. She had her usual lovely and bright smile.</p>

<p>Ah, my heart filled with negativity is being healed...!</p>

<p>&quot;Did something happen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was kicked out of Hoshimiya's house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? You should apologize to Ayana-chan quickly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop assuming it's my fault... Well, maybe it is my fault, but...&quot;</p>

<p>I tell Haruno what happened with Hoshimiya on Saturday. Haruno nods as she listens attentively.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, that's a pretty important matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it is. If the stalker wasn't a misunderstanding...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You still have those erotic books, right? Let me check.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is that what this is about? The erotic books don't matter.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not good! It's still too early for you, Riku-chan! If you're really concerned about that, then I'll...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's cheeks turn red, and she embarrassingly says something strange, so I respond calmly.</p>

<p>Honestly, I do want to do those things with Haruno. I sometimes think about it, but not right now.</p>

<p>&quot;You have a face that shows no motivation at all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess so.&quot;</p>

<p>Being told that she dislikes me might have affected me quite a lot.</p>

<p>When she said that, I responded with a cheesy line like, &quot;Even if you hate me, I want to protect Hoshimiya,&quot; but in reality, it caused serious cringe to my heart.</p>

<p>I wonder what Hoshimiya is doing, I turn my face towards the center of the classroom.</p>

<p>They were still happily talking, just like usual.</p>

<p>They don't seem to care about me at all.</p>

<p>&quot;Is she really hated me...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, even if it's because of the stalker, if Ayana-chan says it's just her imagination, isn't that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't need to work so hard just because you're disliked.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Hoshimiya saved my life...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That lifesaver of yours saying you already did enough right?&quot;</p>

<p>That was true. Any further persistence from me would just become a bother.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, I'm a little... angry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really grateful to Ayana-chan. She saved you, Riku-chan... But I can't accept what happened this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I thought Ayana-chan liked you too. I wonder why did she said that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It might be a lie. Maybe Hoshimiya said she hates me to keep her distance from me and from you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, what's your plan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you've worked so hard even while getting hurt. I also ended up hurting you... So, I want to protect you in return.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot; Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want you to suffer anymore or get hurt, Riku-chan. I know that Ayana-chan is the reason you're here right now. But, you see, Ayana-chan is hurting you... I can't forgive that.&quot;</p>

<p>A faint trace of anger seeps into Haruno's expression. It means she genuinely cares about me.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, I...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't have to struggle anymore. We've reached a conclusion.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;conclusion...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My relationship with Ayana-chan is over. So... well, maybe... can we start over?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Start over?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. You and I, we've been childhood friends for a long time, right? Like back then... no, this time, as lovers... I want to be by your side, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Though her words were a little shy, Haruno's desire came across clearly.</p>

<p>I inadvertently find myself at a loss for words.</p>

<p>As I contemplate what to say, the chime rings, signaling start of the class. So the noisy students starts returning to their seats.</p>

<p>Haruno is no exception, but she says one last thing to me before leaving.</p>

<p>&quot;I know Riku-chan more than anyone else, and I love Riku-chan more than anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>With a small voice that only I could hear, Haruno said and quickly returned to her seat.</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>Those were the words I had always wanted to hear. If she had said them when I confessed, my heart would have stopped from overwhelming joy.</p>

<p>&quot;............I haven't really been trying hard, have I?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno said that I had been trying hard.</p>

<p>...That's not true.</p>

<p>I have always been supported by Haruno.</p>

<p>After being rejected by Haruno, I was supported by Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>In other words, I was just living the days being healed by Haruno and Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>I haven't been able to repay them for anything yet.</p>

<p>&quot;But it's come to an end, huh... Maybe Haruno is right.&quot;</p>

<p>Originally, Hoshimiya and I would never have had any connection.</p>

<p>We wouldn't have had a chance to talk... even though we were in the same class.</p>

<p>&quot;Just returning to the usual daily life...&quot;</p>

<p>No, it's not the usual daily life. It's a life where I can be with Haruno, the ideal person I've always wanted to be with.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>During lunch break, I spend time as usual with Kana. Though there's something lingering in my heart, I pretend to be calm and engage in casual conversation. However, as I do so, I catch sight of Kuromine-kun and Harukaze-san leaving the classroom together. The piece of bread I was about to put in my mouth stops halfway.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayane, is it okay? Your boyfriend went with another girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like... we're dating or anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? It hasn't even been a month right? And don't you like Kuromine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like...!&quot;</p>

<p>Something wells up from deep within my chest, and I desperately take a big bite of the bread, stuffing it into my mouth. It's like I'm eating out of desperation.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Ayane...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is fine...!&quot;</p>

<p>I felt like crying.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>After school. Normally, Hoshimiya would invite me with a &quot;Let's go home,&quot; but...</p>

<p>&quot;Kana, let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about Kuromine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine now.&quot;</p>

<p>Kana who is confused, Hoshimiya take her arm with her and left the classroom quickly.</p>

<p>It seems like our connection has truly been severed. Is this Hoshimiya desire?.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, let's go home together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, with a natural smile, kindly invites me.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, this is my &quot;normal&quot;.</p>

<p>Before I confessed to Haruno, it was a daily activity of her to invite me to walk home together like this.</p>

<p>In other words, my daily life has simply returned.</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>I feel someone's gaze and scan the classroom. Several male students were looking at me.</p>

<p>&quot;That bastard Kuromine, he switched from Harukaze to Hoshimiya, and now he's back again to Harukaze!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the two most popular girls in the school...!!&quot;</p>

<p>...This is bad. I can't offer any explanation, and I even think it's bad myself.</p>

<p>I take Haruno's hand and hurriedly leave the school, as if running away.</p>

<p>And as we go home something happen.</p>

<p>&quot;It's been a while since we walked home together, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, walking beside me, said in a cheerful voice that sounded full of energy.</p>

<p>Even from her smiling expression, I could sense her innocent feeling of &quot;I'm happy!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Riku-chan... I want to hold hands with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're still not officially dating, though?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then... let's hold hands as childhood friends! Like we used to when we were little!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're high school students now, you know? If we hold hands in a place like this, we'll stand out.&quot;</p>

<p>I do want to hold hands with Haruno, but we're walking on the school commute route.</p>

<p>There are some students around who are on their way home. Especially since Haruno is cute, she stands out a lot.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mind standing out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Haruno, hey. Are you aware that you're popular?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I guess you are... Wait, what?!&quot;</p>

<p>I inadvertently stop walking and gaze at Haruno's face.</p>

<p>Haruno also stops and wears a slightly guilty expression.</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well... you see... I've been confessed to several times...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, um... How many times?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If we're talking about since entering high school... maybe around ten times, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What a realistically high number...!&quot;</p>

<p>Well, if she received that many confessions, of course she'll think &quot;I'm popular&quot;.</p>

<p>And Haruno said, &quot;If we're talking about since entering high school...&quot; If we include middle school, it seems like an astonishing number.</p>

<p>BTW, as you guess, I have never been confessed to even once before.</p>

<p>I'll proudly boast it as grand total of 0 confessions...!!</p>

<p>&quot;You've never dated anyone, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I didn't really understand romantic feelings, so I turned them down. My friends suggested that I try dating someone just to see... but I couldn't bring myself to do it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. Because I like you, Riku-chan. I didn't realize it was my first love inside me, but my feelings for you haven't changed.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno said that with a clear and refreshed expression. It made my heart skip a beat.</p>

<p>&quot;You must have received a lot of confessions too, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, um... Yeah, well... I don't really remember how many times, to be honest.&quot;</p>

<p>Not remembering is natural. After all, I've never been confessed to.</p>

<p>&quot;But still. Despite that, you didn't date anyone and confessed to me. I'm really happy about that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing Haruno with a genuinely happy expression and a slight smile, I feel a sense of guilt. My heart aches.</p>

<p>Why do guys have to be showy? Lately, it feels like I've been telling nothing but lies.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, um... I'll be waiting, so...&quot;</p>

<p>Blushing, Haruno lowers her head in embarrassment.</p>

<p>There's an atmosphere as if she's expecting something sweet and sour.</p>

<p>I can sense it intuitively. She's waiting for a confession.</p>

<p>Haruno said she's waiting for my answer.</p>

<p>If I confess to Haruno, I can finally grasp the life I've been dreaming of.</p>

<p>The goal is after the bridge. It's a distance I can immediately reach.</p>

<p>Following my feelings, I open my mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a little longer, please wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;O-Okay... I understand.&quot;</p>

<p>Huh?</p>

<p>I was supposed to say, &quot;I love you, please go out with me&quot;... right?</p>

<p>Ah, I see. There's something unfinished.</p>

<p>Perhaps my unfinished job with Hoshimiya is stopping me.</p>

<p>I'll quickly resolve this tonight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>I know that Hoshimiya is not at the convenience store tonight. While we we're living together, I memorize Hoshimiya's shift.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh welcome Riku-chan. Ayana-chan isn't here.&quot;</p>

<p>I had some business with the owner, so I came to the convenience store after 10 p.m. After confirming that there were no customers inside, I approached the owner who was at the cash register.</p>

<p>&quot;I came today not for Hoshimiya, but because I have something to discuss with the owner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, Riku-chan. While I am indeed beautiful, but flirtation is not good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>................</p>

<p>&quot;Previously, you proposed that I, should work here, right? I apologize, but I have to decline.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh dear, how unfortunate. But I'm glad you told me.&quot;</p>

<p>This was my unfinished business. The owner might have said it without much thought, but I wanted to give a formal response.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan, don't you want to work with Ayana-chan?&quot; The owner asked.</p>

<p>&quot;......Maybe Hoshimiya doesn't want to work with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>The owner seemed to have sensed that something was going on between me and Hoshimiya, so she didn't pursue it any further.</p>

<p>However, she starts talking about Hoshimiya quietly, which is rare for her.</p>

<p>&quot;During the weekend the other day... Ayana-chan had a really lonely expression on her face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A lonely expression, you say?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Sometimes she would look lonely, and other times she would look like she's about to cry... Oh, yes, to the point where customers were worried about her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That was the face of someone filled with regret. Regret that will haunt them for the rest of their life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know what happened between the two of you... Riku-chan, make sure you have no regrets.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's Riku-kun. It's rare to meet you in a place like this.&quot;</p>

<p>After listening to the owner, Intending to go home, I saw Mado-san walking towards me, so I stopped my bike and faced her.</p>

<p>&quot;Mondo-san... Is it okay for you to be out so late?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not something for a minor like you should be saying. I'm on my way back from a drinking party. Riku-kun, do you not need to go back to Ayana-chan's house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There must be something happen after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>She immediately seen me through.</p>

<p>&quot;Is your house close from here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's about a three-hour distance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not close at all. It's late at night when you'll reach home. If you want, would you like to stay at my place?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll decline. I think I can find something to eat somewhere.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, I won't make a move on a minor. But... Are you really okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. Bye then...&quot;</p>

<p>I mounted my bicycle again and started riding.</p>

<p>And before I left Mondo-san alone, "I went to Ayana-chan's house on Saturday afternoon."</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>I abruptly hit the brakes and stopped the bicycle and inadvertently listen to Mondo-san's words.</p>

<p>&quot;The moment I pressed the intercom, Ayana-chan opened the door with incredible force and had such a happy expression. But as soon as she saw my face, she looked disappointed, as if I was a letdown.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think Ayana-chan was expecting someone to come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know who's that someone is though. So, young delinquent, go back home already. The people who cares about you will be sad if something happens to you.&quot;</p>

<p>Mondo-san said her words with a serious tone and walked away, turning her back to me.</p>

<p>What's with that? She's acting mature all of the sudden.</p>

<p>I watched Mondo-san's back until she's gone with darkness and I could do nothing but to stand there.</p>
