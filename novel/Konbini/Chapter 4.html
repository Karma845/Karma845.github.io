<h3>Chapter 4: Truth</h3>

<p>&quot;Oh, one of my panties is missing... Did it get blown away again?&quot;</p>

<p>After going home from school, I noticed that one of my panties hanged on balcony was missing. And it was one of my favorites...</p>

<p>&quot;Well, there's nothing I can do about it.&quot;</p>

<p>If Kuromine-kun were here, he would probably make a big fuss saying, &quot;That stalker appeared!&quot;</p>

<p>Just imagining that made me smile a little.</p>

<p>After taking in the laundry, I looked around the room, now empty with only me in it.</p>

<p>Until a few days ago, there would be boys' clothes scattered around and messy boys lounging around. But now, it has become just an ordinary girl's room.</p>

<p>...It used to be the norm before Kuromine-kun came.</p>

<p>A cold wind seems to pass through my heart, leaving behind a sense of loneliness.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, my eyes were drawn to the folded futon in the corner of the room. It was Kuromine-kun's futon.</p>

<p>With a hint of hesitation, I unfolded the folded futon and arranged the pillow.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>After a brief moment of hesitation... I laid down on Kuromine-kun's futon.</p>

<p>I rested my head on the pillow and pulled the comforter over my head...</p>

<p>&quot;...Kuromine-kun's scent...&quot;</p>

<p>I feel like a pervert... Even though I think it's weird, I can't stop myself.</p>

<p>It has been a few days since I kicked Kuromine-kun out of the house.</p>

<p>I thought I would quickly get used to living alone, but once you've experienced living with someone you love, you can't get used to being completely alone.</p>

<p>&quot;...I wonder if Kuromine-kun is getting along with Harukaze-san.&quot;</p>

<p>They're always together at school.</p>

<p>Harukaze-san talks to Kuromine-kun with such a happy expression.</p>

<p>But Kuromine-kun is concerned about me. I even said I hate him... How cruel.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm the worst....&quot;</p>

<p>Without resisting the gentle drowsiness that came over me, I slowly closed my eyes.</p>

<p>I had no awareness of falling asleep, and suddenly I woke up.</p>

<p>Thinking it couldn't be true, I checked the time on my phone next to the pillow... I was running out of time for work.</p>

<p>I have to leave now or I won't make it!</p>

<p>&quot;I-I have to hurry!&quot;</p>

<p>I locked the door as I rushed out of the house and headed towards my bicycle.</p>

<p>And so, as I got on my bicycle and was about to start riding... I felt something off with the tires.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! It's flat! Are you kidding me?&quot;</p>

<p>The rear tire was completely deflated. What a series of misfortunes...</p>

<p>&quot;Looks like I'm definitely going to be late... Sigh.&quot;</p>

<p>&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;Owner, I'll be leaving first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Ayana-chan, good work. It's already dark outside, but are you going to be okay?&quot;</p>

<p>After finishing my shift, it was a little past 10 p.m.</p>

<p>I stood facing the owner, who was stationed at the cash register.</p>

<p>There were no customers in sight inside the shop. It's usually quiet with fewer customers around this time.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be fine, Owner. I'm not a child, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not what I meant... You see, about that stalker. Isn't Riku-chan coming today as well?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun won't come anymore. The stalker was just my imagination...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... You came on foot today, right? It's dangerous for a girl to be alone in this dark mountain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be okay! Even if some weirdo tries to attack me, I'll run and escape!&quot;</p>

<p>Despite my words, I put on a bright smile, showing confidence in my athletic abilities.</p>

<p>However, the owner's worried expression didn't change, even after seeing me like that.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan, I can give you a ride in my car.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's okay. I'm truly fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... If anything happens, make sure to run away and call the police, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're exaggerating, Owner. I will be fine. Well then, good work for today.&quot;</p>

<p>I lightly bowed to the owner and left the shop.</p>

<p>The area around the convenience store was still bright with the lights inside.</p>

<p>However, as I continued down the mountain road, the convenience store lights gradually disappeared, and darkness enveloped me. Suddenly, I felt a surge of fear.</p>

<p>As I got curious, I peeked over the guardrail next to me, then I notice it's getting wider. I swallowed my spit.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe... I'm becoming more sensitive.&quot;</p>

<p>In an attempt to distract myself, I took out my smartphone.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Kana is inviting me.&quot;</p>

<p>With no streetlights and only moonlight illuminating the mountain road, my smartphone was the only source of comfort for me at that moment.</p>

<p>&quot;Next Saturday, huh? I have work that time...&quot;</p>

<p>Apologizing in my thoughts, I declined Kana's invitation.</p>

<p>After replying to my other friends, I continued walking for about ten minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>I thought I faintly heard footsteps behind me, different from my own.</p>

<p>I couldn't help but slowly turn around.</p>

<p>In the distance, a vague figure of a person emerged in the darkness.</p>

<p>Judging by the atmosphere... a man, perhaps?</p>

<p>As I stopped walking, the person also stopped.</p>

<p>&quot;I-It's just a coincidence, right?&quot;</p>

<p>I convinced myself that this person must have their own reasons for walking on this mountain road.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I started walking again.</p>

<p>But.... *Pat Pat Pat Pat*</p>

<p>Those footsteps were clearly speeding up, getting closer to me.</p>

<p>Unable to bear it, I abruptly turned around.</p>

<p>I couldn't see his face or clothing because of darkness. However, he is definitely closer to me compared before.</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>A cold sensation ran through my entire body, and the pounding sound of my heart echoed throughout.</p>

<p>That person was definitely knows me.</p>

<p>Whenever I stopped, he also stopped as well...</p>

<p>N-No, wait.</p>

<p>It doesn't necessarily mean it's a stalker right?</p>

<p>It could be just a coincidence, right?</p>

<p>With that thought in mind, I started picking up my pace and hurried ahead.</p>

<p>It would take about twenty more minutes to get through this mountain road. If I were to be attacked, I wouldn't be able to escape.</p>

<p>Driven by fear, I started walking faster, but the footsteps behind me were getting closer.</p>

<p>-I'm s-scared.</p>

<p>Was it not just my imagination? There's really a stalker?</p>

<p>Come to think of it, strange things happened today.</p>

<p>My underwear went missing, and my bike had a flat tire...</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>I tripped and fell, my feet getting tangled up. Reflexively, I placed my hands on the ground, and a sharp pain shot through my palms.</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>The footsteps were getting closer, sounding closer and closer.</p>

<p>I knew that the man was right behind me.</p>

<p>I was too scared to turn around.</p>

<p>-Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>The voice I wanted to hear the most came from behind me, encouraging me to turn around.</p>

<p>And there he was... It was indeed Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;Well... Kuromine-kun, explain yourself properly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was just secretly following you, that's all. Do you have a problem with that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I do! It's scary to have someone tailing you on a mountain road like that!&quot;</p>

<p>I brought Kuromine-kun back with me and gave him serious lecture while sitting on his knees.</p>

<p>&quot;J-just leave me alone already. You're bothering me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yet you're smirking a little bit while saying that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;--Huh? This, um, it's not--&quot;</p>

<p>I immediately covered my mouth with my hand. (TL: F*ck this is too cute.)</p>

<p>Now that it he pointed it out, it did feel like I've been smirk...ing!</p>

<p>Though Kuromine-kun said that in weird tone but, he must be really worried about me...</p>

<p>Well, his approach was really annoying, though...!</p>

<p>&quot;I heard it from Owner and Monmon-san. They said you were feeling lonely without me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I wasn't... And I don't know what you heard, but isn't it normal to keep that kind of thing a secret?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you still think I'm the type to keep secrets?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't think so. Kuromine-kun, you're the type to speak your mind immediately.&quot;</p>

<p>A slight sense of murderous intent rose within me as I said that to Kuromine-kun, who responded with a calm face.</p>

<p>Why did I fall in love with this kind of boy?</p>

<p>Since that night when Kuromine-kun saved me from the robbery, it felt like I'm only thinking about him. I didn't really expected that kind of encounter.</p>

<p>...Starting from that unforgettable event, I listened to Kuromine-kun's past.</p>

<p>He would say some inquiring things, but surprisingly, he had a delicate side too... He had kindness in considering others and genuinely tried to protect me...</p>

<p>Because I love Kuromine-kun like that, I want him to be happy with Harukaze-san.</p>

<p>I don't want him to spend time on someone like me...</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, go home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't need to worry about me. Stay by Harukaze-san's side properly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;.... You're still troubled being by that stalker right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not troubled, and the stalker thing is just my imagination. Now that you mention it, the current stalker is you, Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun looked sad and bowed his head dejectedly. His emotions were still easy to read...</p>

<p>&quot;Next time, if you do something like this, I'll be really angry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm... sorry...&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun stood up and walked away slowly, leaving this house.</p>

<p>Now, I was alone in the room, and again indescribable emptiness filled my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;...Wait, Isn't my tone so harsh? But with Kuromine-kun, it has to be that way...&quot;</p>

<p>No matter how much time passes, as long as Kuromine-kun is worried about me, he can't date Harukaze-san.</p>

<p>He has this strange sense of responsibility, or rather, he's rigid in his sense of duty...</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, is it okay to let Kuromine-kun go home at this hour? Maybe it's better to let him stay overnight at least for tonight...&quot;</p>

<p>Just as I was about to chase after Kuromine-kun, my eyes caught sight of a family photo placed on the desk.</p>

<p>Suicide... Kuromine... Parents.</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>A sharp pain shot through my head, so I instinctively looked away.</p>

<p>Some kind of image flashed in my mind but quickly disappeared.</p>

<p>&quot;I... I'm forgetting something...?&quot;</p>

<p>As I tried to recall this forgotten something, the doorbell rang. It must be Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>Because of the late hour, he must have come here with a hesitant expression, saying, 'My bad, Hoshimiya. Can you let me stay just for tonight?'</p>

<p>'Well, it can't be helped, Kuromine-kun.'</p>

<p>Since it's only for tonight, I'll let him stay, saying those words.</p>

<p>I hurriedly made my way to the entrance and opened the door... but I was taken aback.</p>

<p>&quot;Um... huh?&quot;</p>

<p>The person standing behind the opened door wasn't Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>The man appeared to be in his thirties, wearing a black tracksuit from top to bottom. He had a plump physique, messy hair, and a slightly chubby face.</p>

<p>&quot;...Don't mess with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan, why are you ignoring me?&quot;</p>

<p>As he said that, the man stuck his hand into his pants pocket and pulled out a folded knife, revealing a sharp blade.</p>

<p>&quot;Eh...?&quot;</p>

<p>The man had pulled out a knife.</p>

<p>I recognized it as a fact, but I was unable to grasp the reality, leaving me dumbfounded.</p>

<p>I didn't even have time to to think properly because I'm scared.</p>

<p>&quot;--!&quot;</p>

<p>The man forcefully shoved me with his shoulder.</p>

<p>Unable to resist the impact, I fell backward from my buttocks.</p>

<p>A dull pain radiated from my backside as I hit the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't mess with me... Damn it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A-Ah...&quot;</p>

<p>The man who had entered the entrance locked the door.</p>

<p>Finally realizing the reality before me, I realized it immediately. &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;I'm in danger.</p>

<p>He firmly grabbed onto my hair, preventing my escape. &quot;F*ck, stop!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-it hurts!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You... You were flirting with that disgusting man!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking abou--&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't finished the sentence. As he put unfamiliar weight on my back,</p>

<p>&quot;I can't... breath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's your fault, Ayana-chan...! You flaunted it in front of me, being all lovey-dovey with that bastard...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're... wrong...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't forgive you. I absolutely won't forgive you...!&quot;</p>

<p>The man, panting heavily, grabbed my shoulder and forcefully pulled me towards him.</p>

<p>He flipped me over, leaving me lying on my back.</p>

<p>&quot;I've liked you for a long time...! I noticed you first, Ayana-chan...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop... Please...&quot;</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by unimaginable fear, all I could do was look up at the man's face.</p>

<p>He towered over me, straddling me, completely depriving me of my freedom.</p>

<p>&quot;I was actually planning to approach you on that mountain path... I even punctured your bicycle tire... But that guy showed up... Hehe...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... He&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;...!&quot;</p>

<p>His face consumed by desire, was enough to make me tremble in fear.</p>

<p>&quot;Flashy outfits are nice, but plain ones are also good... Actually, the plain ones are the real Ayana-chan, right? I love observing people... I understand those things, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh... Ahh...!&quot;</p>

<p>I flailed my limbs, trying to resist, but the man showed me the knife, saying, &quot;If you try to escape, I'll stab you...&quot; The sheer terror froze my mind, rendering me unable to think.</p>

<p>&quot;So... Did you... already sleep with that bastard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What... What are you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? You haven't yet? Hehe, seriously?&quot;</p>

<p>The man was gleeful. I could sense an immense desire directed towards me, and I felt my face grow pale. I couldn't think clearly due to the overwhelming fear.</p>

<p>&quot;If you try to run, I'll stab you... So just behave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No... No...&quot;</p>

<p>The man grabbed both of my shoulders and exerted pressure. When I tried to resist by shaking my body, he responded with anger, not bothering to hide his irritation.</p>

<p>&quot;F*ck... Stop it! Just behave! I'll f*cking stab you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hiii...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll... I'll be gentle, you know? I like you, Ayana-chan... Can you accept these feelings?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really... I can't take this anymore... Please... *Sniff*... Ugh...!&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, tears started flowing from my eyes, drop by drop. Overwhelmed by the unbearable fear, my rationality was swallowed, and all I could do was tremble and beg for mercy.</p>

<p>&quot;P-Please... Stop... I'm sorry... Sniff...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Crying Ayana-chan is cute too, you know? Hehe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Please forgive me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... I can't stand being a guy who's easily disregarded. You're living together with such an unremarkable guy...!&quot;</p>

<p>The enraged man reached for my shirt, trying to lift it up.</p>

<p>Understanding what he intended to do, I resisted, screaming and trying to push his hand away.</p>

<p>&quot;No... No! I really can't!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up! It's all your fault! You belong to me, Ayana...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No... No... Please... Someone, help... Kuromine-kun...!&quot;</p>

<p>Is this... divine punishment?</p>

<p>A punishment for pushing away Kuromine-kun, who genuinely worried about me...</p>

<p>Unable to resist any longer, all I could do was look up at the man who had helped me.</p>

<p>...What a vile and filthy expression he has on his face.</p>

<p>I'm sure if I resist, he'll stab me with the knife.</p>

<p>If only I had been more honest with Kuromine-kun, this wouldn't have happened...</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, Ayana-chan has finally become obedient. You've finally accepted me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>The gleeful man tried to lift up my shirt.</p>

<p>In response, I felt my own heart sinking into the depths of darkness.</p>

<p>This is the divine punishment for rejecting Kuromine-kun...</p>

<p>Ah...</p>

<p>...At least, I wanted to tell Kuromine-kun that I loved him...</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, mind if I join in?&quot;</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;Huh?</p>

<p>An out-of-place and utterly foolish voice of a third party could be heard.</p>

<p>The man also turned around in surprise, and then Kuromine-kun fiercely punch his face...!</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh!&quot;</p>

<p>The impact was tremendous, causing the man to be flung lightly and slide off my body.</p>

<p>He dropped the knife and held his face in pain.</p>

<p>I couldn't understand what had just happened.</p>

<p>Yet, there was a glimmer of hope.</p>

<p>I slowly raised my body and directed my gaze towards the person standing in front of me.</p>

<p>Standing there was indeed Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, I came to return the spare key... Is this guy, by any chance, a stalker?&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun, gripping the spare key tightly in his right hand, spoke with a nonchalant attitude reminding me when he confronted the robber.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/embed0012_HD.jpg">

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;Guh... That hurts...&quot;</p>

<p>The man&mdash;presumably the stalker&mdash;had been punched in the nose, and he was grimacing while holding his nose in pain.</p>

<p>It seemed to be quite painful, and judging from his appearance, it seems like he can't get up immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun glanced at the stalker in silence, then picked up the folding knife that had fallen to the floor and folded the blade before putting it in his pocket.</p>

<p>Afterward, he approached me and bent down to meet my gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Why are you apologizing to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I wasn't there when you needed me.&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun was genuinely apologizing. He twisted his face with a look of regret, expressing a complex mix of emotions that seemed to include anger and sadness.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like that... Even though I pushed you away... you still came for me!&quot;</p>

<p>My heart change just with the fact that Kuromine-kun come to save me. That alone was enough to satisfy me.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's escape quickly. Can you stand?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'll manage somehow...&quot;</p>

<p>While the stalker was in pain and suffering, I stood up with Kuromine-kun's support.</p>

<p>Suddenly, when I looked at Kuromine-kun's face, I noticed that his expression had changed to a normal one.</p>

<p>Unnaturally normal expression...</p>

<p>As we headed towards the entrance, just as we were about to reach for the doorknob...</p>

<p>&quot;Don't mess with me! You...!&quot;</p>

<p>An angry voice came from behind, and I turned around.</p>

<p>The stalker stood up, leaning against the wall in the corridor, and pulled out a folding knife from his coat pocket.</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;He had another one!</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I've heard about it before. There are more people who carry knives with them than you'd imagine in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan... even though you accepted me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It didn't seem that way. It was forced, wasn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because Ayana-chan betrayed my expectations! Bringing you, a pathetic guy into this room!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is he referring to me as the pathetic guy?&quot; Kuromine-kun muttered.</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun, yes it's you, I thought.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll stab you, damn it! If I get serious... I won't hesitate to stab someone!&quot;</p>

<p>&#9472;A dark madness swirled him.</p>

<p>The stalker's eyes were bloodshot, and the hand holding the knife was trembling with excessive force. I was too scared, and my eyes started to well up with tears.</p>

<p>But the boy right next to me...</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... You'll definitely stab me. You're the type who would actually do it, seriously,&quot; Kuromine-kun calmly stated the truth and continued his words.</p>

<p>&quot;Comparing you the middle-aged man in the past robbery, you lack rationality in your eyes. Just looking at you, it's clear that you're a selfish person who only thinks about yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You have no idea what you're talking about!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm a similar kind of person, so I understand somewhat. I feel a sense of familiarity. You and I are both has dangerous side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm not dangerous! I just want Ayana-chan to accept me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand that feeling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't say things so casually&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Holding selfish ideals for someone you love, and when those ideals are betrayed, you feel disappointed and lose control selfishly... I'm exactly the same.&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun is overlapping himself with the stalker. Even though they're completely different...</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, run away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But... W-What about you, Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... It's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you saying&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop talking with 'MY' Ayana-chan!&quot;</p>

<p>With a mad rage, the stalker swing the knife and charged at Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>Normally, one would become too scared to do anything with knife. But without hesitation, Kuromine-kun reached into his pocket and pulled out the folding knife and casually toss it at the stalker.</p>

<p>&quot;..!&quot;</p>

<p>The stalker flinched and momentarily paused in his tracks.</p>

<p>Seizing that momentary opening, Kuromine-kun stepped forward &#9472;&#9472;</p>

<p>&quot;Huah!&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun struck the stalker's face with full force, sending him flying!</p>

<p>The stalker fell backward, seemingly bewildered, as he stared at Kuromine-kun, unable to comprehend what had just happened.</p>

<p>&quot;I can empathize with you. But hurting Hoshimiya is a different matter. I absolutely won't forgive it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-You...!&quot;</p>

<p>Kuromine-kun punched the stalker's face again but the stalker tried to get up, but Kuromine-kun mount him over and raised his fist.</p>

<p>&quot;What were you planning to do to Hoshimiya? Huh... you bastard.&quot;</p>

<p>Despite his composed choice of words, Kuromine-kun delivered a powerful blow to the stalker's face.</p>

<p>The excessively violent scene frightened me, and I covered my face with both hands.</p>

<p>However, my ears informed me of the current situation.</p>

<p>The dull sound of a punch landing, and the stalker's voice, crushed as if begging for forgiveness...</p>

<p>Then, the sounds ceased. I finally mustered the courage to look, and there was Kuromine-kun, holding the knife, raised above him.</p>

<p>&quot;No, you can't! Kuromine-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>I immediately sensed his intentions and instinctively threw myself at Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya... Let go of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No! That's really not okay! Calm down!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am calm. Yeah, surprisingly calm... So it's okay, let go of me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not okay at all!&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, I realized that Kuromine-kun was quietly consumed by rage.</p>

<p>He was bottling up his anger inside, without outwardly expressing it.</p>

<p>It felt more terrifying than someone who would just shout in anger.</p>

<p>Yet, despite that terror, there was something even more...</p>

<p>&quot;I... don't want it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Don't want it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want the person I love to be unhappy... That's why I don't want it!&quot; I scream.</p>

<p>&quot;...I see.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you do that... you will be unhappy!&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't even know what I was yelling. I just let out my feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;...Even though you said you hated me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you! I love you so much! That's why... stop this already, please!&quot;</p>

<p>Desperately clinging to Kuromine-kun's body to restrain him, I felt his strength slowly leaving him.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun... Please don't become someone who hurts others.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;... I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>In a weak voice, Kuromine-kun replied and quietly placed the knife on the floor.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;It's been a while since I wore this tracksuit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I think it's been the day when Kuromine-kun first came to this house.&quot;</p>

<p>After finishing our baths and changing into pajamas, Hoshimiya and I talked while I glanced at the tracksuit I was wearing. It belonged to Hoshimiya's father.</p>

<p>Perhaps it felt a little nostalgic because it symbolized the time I spent with Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;It's already 1 o'clock...&quot;</p>

<p>I murmured as I looked at the floral-patterned clock on the table.</p>

<p>After confronting the stalker, we naturally decided to contact the police... But that's when things became difficult. We were asked numerous detailed questions, repeatedly questioned about the same things... When they asked for a guardian to be present, I thought it would be a hassle.</p>

<p>My guardians would be my grandparents, but they live far away in the countryside and prefer to keep their distance from me.</p>

<p>Well, since it's late, the police agreed to talk to them over the phone.</p>

<p>And before we knew it, it was already late at night.</p>

<p>I had expected Hoshimiya's parents to rush back home, but surprisingly, it was Mondo-san who arrived. Apparently, she had been in a neighboring prefecture on business and appeared covered in an astonishing amount of sweat. She must have been really worried.</p>

<p>I may be imagining things, but Hoshimiya seemed to be in pain, clutching her head whenever her parents were mentioned.</p>

<p>Having been released from the police, I was now free and decided to stay overnight at Hoshimiya's house.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>An indescribable silence dominated the room.</p>

<p>As Hoshimiya sat on the bed, I nervously took a seat on the floor.</p>

<p>No, it wasn't just me who couldn't calm down.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya also seemed uncomfortable, turning her face away and twirling her hair with her index finger.</p>

<p>Her cheeks were slightly flushed, probably from the bath.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a sharp pain surged through my right fist.</p>

<p>&quot;Ow!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun!? What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, my right hand suddenly started hurting!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Show me!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, in a state of panic, quickly got off the bed and came down to where I was.</p>

<p>She sat down on the spot and gently lifted up my right hand with both hands to examine it.</p>

<p>&quot;How is it?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;It's turning red.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... Is that all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry. I can't tell even if I look at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I don't think it's broken. I'm always training, so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You train, huh...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You never know what will happen in life, right? I'm training to be able to protect Haruno at any time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...You really love Harukaze-san... Hahaha.&quot;</p>

<p>It felt like she was forcing a smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah...&quot;</p>

<p>The two of us stared at my right hand up close.</p>

<p>Naturally, our faces were also getting closer. Hoshimiya's blushing face was right in front of me.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Before I could ask what she was apologizing for, Hoshimiya hugged me.</p>

<p>&quot;Just for now... Just for now, it's okay...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, what are you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I was going to hold back. I knew that you and Harukaze-san had mutual feelings... I knew there was no room for me... And I knew that you genuinely liked Harukaze-san...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wanted you to be happy as soon as possible, Kuromine-kun... That's why I tried to step back and let you go to Harukaze-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I see.&quot;</p>

<p>I listened to Hoshimiya's words.</p>

<p>&quot;But you know, I couldn't forget about you. Even when you weren't around... I ended up sleeping with your futon... I couldn't say anything... I couldn't say anything, but I understand those feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>No words could come out... I couldn't say anything, but I understood.</p>

<p>&quot;No matter how much distance I tried to put between us, I couldn't forget about you... And you saved me from the stalker... I can't take it anymore... I can't bear it anymore...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, I love you... I love you, really.&quot;</p>

<p>She held me tightly and whispered &quot;I love you&quot; repeatedly.</p>

<p>When someone expresses their feelings with such passion, there is no choice but to make a decision as well.</p>

<p>&quot;...There's a proper reason why I didn't go out with Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For my sake, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's not it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I... love Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Seemingly unable to comprehend what I said, Hoshimiya lifted her head and looked into my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I want Hoshimiya to be happier than anyone else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-That means...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To put it more clearly, I want to be by your side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By... my side...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's cheeks flushed, and she repeated my words, seemingly chewing on them.</p>

<p>&quot;Fr-From now on... I want to live with Hoshimiya in this house... I mean that.&quot;</p>

<p>Due to excessive nervousness, my words got stuck.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seemed like my feelings had reached Hoshimiya firmly...</p>

<p>&quot;S-So, that means... a confession?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>I nodded silently. I couldn't put it into words.</p>

<p>&quot;You want to... be in a relationship with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And being in a relationship means... becoming lovers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And as lovers, it means we have a special connection--&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong? You've been saying the same thing since earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well... um...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya averted her gaze from me and awkwardly fumbled with her mouth.</p>

<p>Did her innocent side activate at this moment?</p>

<p>&quot;What about Harukaze-san... Is she okay with it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right now, Haruno doesn't matter. This is about us.&quot;</p>

<p>And besides, I'm afraid of leaving Hoshimiya alone. She seems like a person who attracts misfortune.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A predisposition for misfortune... W-Well, that may be true.&quot;</p>

<p>Getting robbed and a stalker within a month... Not many people can be struck by such misfortune.</p>

<p>I recalled the saying, bad luck comes in threes.</p>

<p>&quot;But it's not just because I want to be with Hoshimiya myself... I want to protect you,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Pr-Protect me...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, um... Kuromine-kun, you also can't do without me, right? You're a mess... I used to wake you up every morning and make meals for you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I can't do that without Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;R-Really...&quot;</p>

<p>To the point where her face turned as red as steam, I spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;I love Hoshimiya... Please go out with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it... okay for me? I mean, I'm not like Harukaze-san...&quot;</p>

<p>To Hoshimiya, who took a self-deprecating attitude, I shook my head from side to side, determined not to let her finish.</p>

<p>&quot;As I said before, Haruno doesn't matter. I'll say it again... Please go out with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;K-Kuromine-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... want to hear your answer,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Um... Th-Then, um... yes. Y-Yes, please take care of me...!&quot; Hoshimiya replied in a barely audible voice.</p>

<p>&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>&quot;So, um, what should we do... Ahaha.&quot;</p>

<p>Just one minute after we started dating.</p>

<p>We looked at each other, exchanging glances and feeling confused about what to do.</p>

<p>For the time being, I decided to close the distance and sat down next to Hoshimiya on the bed.</p>

<p>&quot;W-Waah. Kuromine-kun, what are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I just sat down normally. Why are you so flustered?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm not flustered or anything...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're clearly flustered. And you even avoided eye contact with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya fell silent. I was also a bit perplexed.</p>

<p>We're officially dating now. That's good. Will anything change from how it has been until now?</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, is there something you want to do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, not really... How about you, Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to do something like looking at erotic books with Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're so straightforward! It's surprising how straightforward you are!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you not want to do something like looking at erotic books?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why can you say something like that with a straight face? I can't understand!&quot; Hoshimiya exclaimed.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you want to do it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, I think we should get to know each other more before that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku Kuromine, 16 years old, right-handed, no favorite or disliked subjects, no particular hobbies&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, wait! That's not what I meant! And besides, you keep saying 'none' for everything!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think we don't really know much about each other's lives and what we've been through.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... We haven't really talked about our pasts, have we?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to know more about you, Riku, on a deeper level. And in return, I want you to know more about me.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon hearing that, I decided to talk about myself. But there's nothing particularly special about me. Well, except for the accident that caused me to lose my family, my life has been fairly ordinary. I've been solely focused on being with Haruno and not paying attention to anyone else.</p>

<p>As I continued, I noticed that Hoshimiya had a kind expression on her face. I felt that she was being considerate, so I ended the conversation there.</p>

<p>&quot;I want to hear Hoshimiya's story this time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's about me, right? Okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After hearing Hoshimiya's story, let's do something like in an erotic book.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I said it's too soon! In the first month, let's start with calling each other by name... And for the next three months, we can hold hands...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's too slow. Just holding hands even after four months...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B-But... It's embarrassing, and I need to mentally prepare myself!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. I'll let Hoshimiya set the pace.&quot;</p>

<p>To be honest, the desire to do something like in an erotic book was just a joke. I thought Hoshimiya would panic and refuse, so I said it in a teasing manner. I don't have the courage for that either. Well, it's true that as a teenage boy, I'm truly curious about it...!</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, what should we talk about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, can I ask you something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure. But if it's a weird question, I'll get mad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a normal question. Hoshimiya, were you a plain girl in middle school?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, could you stop using the term 'plain girl'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, I got it. Did you have a high school debut?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah. I think I started becoming like I am now after entering high school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So it was from high school. In that photo, Hoshimiya had black hair and looked quiet, right?&quot;</p>

<p>I point my finger at the photo frame placed on the table. In that photo, there's Hoshimiya's parents and what seems to be a middle school-aged Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you remember what triggered your high school debut?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not sure, I don't remember well. I think I wanted to break away from my previous self... or something like that?&quot;</p>

<p>She used a strong expression, 'wanted to break away from my previous self'&mdash;that caught me off guard.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, I'd like you to tell me about your parents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My dad and mom are really, really kind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can tell. It came through when I saw the photo.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right? But they could be overprotective. If I just fell down, they would panic and call an ambulance!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, that must have been tough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Especially when I was in elementary school, I loved playing outside, so I think I worried them a lot.&quot;</p>

<p>She seems to be reminiscing happily, and her voice reflects that.</p>

<p>They must be wonderful memories.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, and we used to loved travelling.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Travelling?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, travelling. My dad loves cars, you know? So, on holidays, the three of us would get in the car and visit various tourist spots. And even after I became a middle school student, we still went to travel... to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, this is strange. I remember my elementary school memories, but from midway through middle school, my memories become vague...&quot;</p>

<p>Something seems off. Hoshimiya suddenly looks distressed, clutching her head. It's clear that something is wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Hoshimiya. Don't force yourself. If you don't want to talk about it, it's fine...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, it's not that... Something, something feels like it's coming back...!&quot;</p>

<p>Is it a headache? Hoshimiya grimaces in pain.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as if pulling out her own memories, she starts to speak intermittently.</p>

<p>&quot;When I was in first year of middle school, we went out to celebrate... and in the summer of my second year, we went on travel... I remember, on the way back... Ahh...!&quot;</p>

<p>It was sudden.</p>

<p>As if struck by some kind of shock...</p>

<p>&quot;No... Noooooo!!&quot;</p>

<p>An indescribable scream, not even resembling a cry of despair, escapes from Hoshimiya's mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;No... Noooo!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya! What's wrong!&quot;</p>

<p>I can only be bewildered by this sudden turn of events.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya screams and cries like she's gone insane, thrashing about on the bed, clutching her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Why... Whyyyy!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, pull yourself together!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nooo!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;!&quot;</p>

<p>I tried to reach out to Hoshimiya as she thrashed around, but she's thrashing my arm forcefully.</p>

<p>What... What is happening!</p>

<p>*Ding-dong.*</p>

<p>The doorbell rings.</p>

<p>But right now, I can't afford to move away from Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>*Ding-dong.*</p>

<p>It rings again.</p>

<p>*Ding-dong. Ding-dong.*</p>

<p>*Ding-ding-ding-ding-dong.*</p>

<p>&quot;Shut up!&quot;</p>

<p>I understand the frustration, but they're ringing it too much!</p>

<p>...Wait, this continuous doorbell ringing feels familiar. It's Mondo-san!</p>

<p>I hesitate as I look at the crying Hoshimiya, but I rush towards the entrance.</p>

<p>And when I open the door...</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mondo-sa&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>She pushes me aside and rushes into the room, without even taking off her shoes.</p>

<p>&quot;What... What's going on...&quot;</p>

<p>I close the door and quickly make my way to Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, Ayana-chan, it's okay.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why... Whyyyyyyyy!!&quot;</p>

<p>What is she screaming about?</p>

<p>Hoshimiya is crouched on the bed, bent forward, crying and screaming as if rejecting something.</p>

<p>Mondo-san, while gently speaking, tried to embrace Hoshimiya, who was in that state.</p>

<p>&quot;But, Mondo-san, is this...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but please leave!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can't do anything right now, Riku-kun! I'll explain it later, so go outside!&quot;</p>

<p>Until now, Mondo-san had appeared as a careless adult.</p>

<p>However, the Mondo-san in front of me emitted an intense determination, staring at me with the utmost seriousness.</p>

<p>&quot;No! Ayana-chan, it's okay. I'm here for you.&quot;</p>

<p>Mondo-san comforted Hoshimiya gently, even though she was being scratched.</p>

<p>...There's nothing I can do in this situation.</p>

<p>For now, I decided to follow Mondo-san's order and leave Hoshimiya's house.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p> &quot;What... is happening?&quot;</p>

<p>Leaning against the handrail in the corridor, I gaze up at the night sky, which is completely covered in clouds.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's terrifying scream still echoes inside the room.</p>

<p>The stalking issue was resolved, and we just confirmed our feelings for each other...</p>

<p>It was supposed to be our beginning...</p>

<p>&quot;...The screaming has stopped.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, a quiet night arrives.</p>

<p>Just as I turn around, the door opens, and Mondo-san appears.</p>

<p>Numerous scratch marks run across both arms with a faint trace of blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, sorry, Riku-kun. Sorry for suddenly kicking you out,&quot; Mondo-san says with a smirk, as if nothing had happened earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, what about Hoshimiya...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's fine, she fell asleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>What I want to ask isn't about that.</p>

<p>Mondo-san must understand that.</p>

<p>She ponder, resting my chin her hand, wondering how to explain everything.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know something, Mondo-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I know. This is my third time seeing Ayana-chan like that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Three times...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's been a while, so I let my guard down a bit. By any chance, did you talk about past stories? About cars... or suicide...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;About my parents and travelling...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm... If it was just that, it would have been fine... Maybe something happened, and her memories started to come back.&quot;</p>

<p>What is she talking about? Mondo-san is muttering to herself, lost in thought.</p>

<p>&quot;Mondo-san, please explain it to me so that I can understand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Are you sure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What... confirmation are you talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you ask, there's no turning back, you know? Your insight against Ayana-chan will undoubtedly change.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not a joke, this is serious and heavy question. What does resolve even mean?</p>

<p>I don't understand. I don't understand, but...</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me... please.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess so. It's normal to ask, right?&quot;</p>

<p>And then, Mondo-san looks into my eyes and utters something unbelievable.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan's parents... they committed suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>The night breeze gently brushes against my skin, sending a chill throughout my body.</p>

<p>The silence of the late night made words crystal clear in my ears</p>

<p>&quot;That can't be... It's a lie, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a lie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But... Hoshimiya was talking as if her parents were still alive. She said they were away on a business trip...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Memory alteration... that's what it is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When humans go through extremely painful events beyond their capacity to bear, they conveniently rewrite their memories.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But even so...!&quot;</p>

<p>Just a while ago, she was speaking so happily about her memories with her parents. The memories seemed filled with joy.</p>

<p>Seeing my dissatisfaction, Mondo-san looks up at the cloudy night sky and begins to speak quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan's parents died by suicide, about three years ago. It was when Ayana-chan was in her second year of middle school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would they commit suicide...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Various reasons can be considered, but the biggest one is probably guilt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guilt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. On the way back from a travelling... they caused a car accident.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>My heart jumps heavily in my chest.</p>

<p>&quot;The other party involved in the accident... what happened to them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They passed away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>It was the response I had expected.</p>

<p>Seeing me fall into silence, Mondo-san continues the conversation with a heavy expression on her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan's parents faced negative feedback from it, they were looked down upon by the neighborhood... And it seems, Ayana-chan also experienced bullying.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That... is understandable, I suppose...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan's parents were originally known for being kind and sincere. They were loved by the neighbors and relatives. Of course, I admired them too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, regarding the relationship between you and Hoshimiya...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, we're cousins. Well, we never really had a chance to meet each other. I think it was the first time we actually met after Ayana-chan's parents passed away.&quot;</p>

<p>"Although Ayana-chan didn't notice it." Mondo-san adds.</p>

<p>&quot;Going back to the topic, because Ayana-chan's parents had a good reputation, the decline in their credibility after the accident was severe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Ayana-chan's parents were truly good people, in the sense that they couldn't overlook the misfortune and pain of others. They were actively involved in volunteer activities, it seems. So, I suppose... they couldn't bear the fact that they took someone else's life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And so, they chose suicide... leaving Hoshimiya behind?&quot;</p>

<p>Mondo-san nods silently.</p>

<p>I-I can't believe this.</p>

<p>While it's true that the situation was harsh, to take their own lives leaving their daughter behind...</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan saw it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Saw... what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her own parents hanging themselves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;..!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When Ayana-chan came home from school and went to the living room... they were already...&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps imagining that scene, Mondo-san frowned.</p>

<p>Surely, Hoshimiya must have experienced an unimaginable shock.</p>

<p>To the extent of altering her own memories, to preserve her sanity.</p>

<p>&quot;After that, Ayana-chan ended up living with her grandparents, but it was apparently extremely difficult for her... She either remained withdrawn or went on rampages like earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Is that so?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Her grandparents house was filled with things related to her parents. The smell of the house, seeing her grandparents... it reminded her of her parents, I heard.&quot;</p>

<p>Mondo-san continues.</p>

<p>"Gradually, Ayana-chan started to recover. It was as if nothing had happened."</p>

<p>&quot;She... altered her memories, didn't she?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Yep. In Ayana-chan's mind, her parents are on a business trip. However, there were still moments when she would remember them. Especially when she saw things related to her parents.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like photos and jerseys, were they okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At first, they weren't. But as time went by, the memory alteration progressed, I suppose. She became able to accept certain things to some extent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;However, seeing her grandparents would remind her of her parents, and she couldn't live a normal life anymore... That's why Ayana-chan decided to live alone. She chose a high school in a place away from her hometown. That way, it fits with the setting of her parents being on a business trip, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Also... even if Ayana-chan causes a commotion in the apartment, I can take responsibility as the landlord. Well, it's just me and Ayana-chan living here though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... Huh? Mondo-san is the landlord?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right. Didn't I tell you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You didn't. Mondo-san, I've lost count of how many times You've surprised me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan and I never had a chance to meet face-to-face right? Ayana-chan parents didn't associate to me either. That's why there will be no chance of remembering them to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As a guardian, you're suitable...&quot;</p>

<p>I have no way of knowing the exact details of the exchange that took place, but Mondo-san had decided to take care of Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>Looking back, on the day Mondo-san and I first met, she was repeatedly ringing the doorbell. As soon as I opened the door, she shouted, 'Ayana-chan!'...</p>

<p>Mondo-san was not just a weird erotic manga artist.</p>

<p>&quot;The real Ayana-chan is not like a gyaru.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know. It's only her appearance, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In middle school, even her appearance was pretty reserved. This is just my speculation, but that change in image was probably a form of self-defense. An act to protect her own heart... though it sounds strange to say it that way.&quot;</p>

<p>Mondo-san let out a wry smile and then changed to a serious expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan was protecting her own heart by falsifying her memories and changing her appearance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, that's how it was...&quot;</p>

<p>Knowing Hoshimiya's past, I was at a loss for words.</p>

<p>I didn't know how to react.</p>

<p>No, looking back now, there were several incidents where I could have realized this.</p>

<p>First, the day when Hoshimiya and I first met...</p>

<p>When I mentioned that I wanted to commit suicide, Hoshimiya cried excessively.</p>

<p>Perhaps unconsciously, she might have been reminded of her parents.</p>

<p>Moreover, I just noticed that her first-person pronoun had changed.</p>

<p>Right after she was attacked by the convenience store robber, she used 'watashi' (formal 'I'), but when in school she switched to 'atashi' (informal 'I'). Did a glimpse of her true self leak out when facing a extreme fear?</p>

<p>There were other instances as well. When Hoshimiya was asleep, she would sometimes mutter &quot;otousan&quot; (father) and &quot;okaasan&quot; (mother) while crying. Knowing this, I can understand that it was because of those reasons.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, what about the victims? Did any of their family members survive?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't ask for their names, but it was a family of four. A husband, wife, a middle school boy, and an elementary school girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As far as I've heard the only one who survived was middle school boy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, maybe I can't really call that survived. I don't think I could endure... being the only one to survive.&quot;</p>

<p>Mondo-san's words sound distant.</p>

<p>What is this feeling? My heart rate suddenly starts racing.</p>

<p>Even though it's this cold, my body starts to sweat.</p>

<p><em>'Hey, Riku-chan. Do you remember anything about last name Hoshimiya?'</em></p>

<p>Why am I suddenly recalling Haruno's words now?</p>

<p>At that time, I replied, <em>'Well, she's a classmate.... Isn't it?'</em></p>

<p>...Huh?</p>

<p>I can't believe I only remembered her because she was a classmate.</p>

<p>I have no interest in any other girls except for Haruno.</p>

<p>To the point where I can't even remember their names.</p>

<p>For example, Kana, Hoshimiya's friend.</p>

<p>I still don't know Kana's last name, and I only call her Kana because Haruno referred to her that way.</p>

<p>I have such little interest in girls other than Haruno.</p>

<p>So how did I remember &quot;Ayana Hoshimiya&quot;?</p>

<p>She stands out, I admit that but, Kana is the same.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I unconsciously remembered only Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>...No, if I go beyond remembering, what if I actually knew?</p>

<p>What if the memories I had locked away in the depths of my brain were overflowing from my unconscious?</p>

<p>Just as Hoshimiya was altering her memories, what if I was doing the same?</p>

<p>The only things I remember from middle school are the everyday moments with Haruno and the moment my family was hit.</p>

<p>...That's was all?</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong, Riku-kun? You look pale.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Vivid memories were reappearing and mental images is playing in my head as if I were there.</p>

<p>--I stopped walking to tie my shoelaces.</p>

<p>--And the moment I looked up, a car crashed into my parents and my sister just a few steps ahead of me.</p>

<p>--Amidst the uproar of screams from the surroundings, three people emerged in the car, their faces pale.</p>

<p>--Two kind-looking adults and a plain girl. The three of them had pale faces.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>My head feels like it's about to split open. Yet, the haze clouding my memories is gradually clearing on its own.</p>

<p>The two adults in the photograph placed in Hoshimiya's room...</p>

<p>...were a married couple.</p>

<p>And the plain girl was Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh, aaahhh!&quot;</p>

<p>I leaned against the wall in the corridor and slumped down.</p>

<p>Ah, so that's what it was.</p>

<p>The source of the unease I felt when I saw the photograph... is because of this.</p>

<p>As the haze of my memories cleared, a surge of suppressed emotions erupted from the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>That moment...</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun! Pull yourself together!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun?&quot;</p>
