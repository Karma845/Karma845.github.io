<h3>Chapter 1: Reunion 1</h3>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;I can't take this anymore, I want to die.</p>

<p>Spring of my second year in high school.</p>

<p>I, Kuromine Riku, confessed to my childhood friend whom I had been close to since I was young&#9472;&#9472;and was shockingly rejected me.</p>

<p>Can you believe it? When we were in elementary school, we used to take baths together and sleep holding hands in the same bed. Even in middle school and high school, we didn't take baths together anymore, but we used to go to school together.</p>

<p>We were always together, and people often treated us like a couple.</p>

<p>By this point, anyone would be convinced of mutual feelings, right? At least, I was convinced.</p>

<p>That's why I confessed to my childhood friend, coinciding with entering the second year of high school...</p>

<p>But what was the result?</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry. Riku-chan, I actually only see you as a childhood friend not as opposite sex.&quot;</p>

<p>What the hell! What's up with that! Not seeing me as the opposite sex, what's that about!</p>

<p>I had been thinking about various things, you know!</p>

<p>After we started dating, we would go to various places holding hands and...</p>

<p>Both of us were nervous, but we will had our first experiences together...</p>

<p>I had all sorts of imaginations, like getting married, becoming a couple, and having children in the future!</p>

<p>And yet... what happened? Not seeing me as the opposite sex, what's up with that?</p>

<p>Am I an amphibian? A non-human creature?</p>

<p>Urgh.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't take it anymore, I can't find any reason to live.&quot;</p>

<p>I really liked my childhood friend. I thought we had mutual feelings.</p>

<p>I thought it was a battle I would win, but instead, I lost before even fighting.</p>

<p>Seppuku, seppuku~ (suicide)</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care anymore. Screw m life.&quot;</p>

<p>I want to escape from this painful feeling.</p>

<p>I have decided to &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; commit suicide.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The current time is 9 PM.</p>

<p>Looking for a place to commit suicide without being found by anyone, I rode my bike towards the mountains.</p>

<p>It's a three-hour distance from home. I don't plan on going back. Goodbye.</p>

<p>I desperately climbed the paved mountain road, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>The surroundings were dark, and I couldn't see properly. I only had the bike's light to rely on.</p>

<p>&quot;Damn, I'm thirsty... and dying.&quot;</p>

<p>I pedaled the bike like a fool, as my sweat was dripping. Every cell in my body was for craving water.</p>

<p>Is there any vending machine somewhere around here...?</p>

<p>As I continued riding my bike, I saw a light in the distance.</p>

<p>That's... a convenience store.</p>

<p>There's a convenience store in the middle of the mountains. Well, that's relief.</p>

<p>It's like a person stranded in a desert discovering an oasis. (TL: A place where you can find safety and sustenance.)</p>

<p>Feeling excited, I decided to go on the convenience store.</p>

<p>There were no cars parked in the parking lot. There was only one bike parked in the corner.</p>

<p>At this time, I guess no one comes to the convenience store in the mountains. It's far from residential areas.</p>

<p>I parked my bike and headed towards the convenience store.</p>

<p>Passing through the automatic doors, a pleasant cold air pierced through my body. Ah, this is making me alive.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome!&quot;</p>

<p>I made eye contact with the girl at the cash register... She seems kind of plain.</p>

<p>She had messy brown hair and large glasses that made it hard to see her face.</p>

<p>It's a bit rude to say, but she seemed like the type who would quietly sit in the corner of the classroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Gah! Uh...!&quot;</p>

<p>What's happening? Suddenly, I started feeling a sharp pain in my stomach!</p>

<p>&quot;Um, excuse me. Can I use the restroom...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>I quickly rushed to the restroom, barely making it in time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Phew, that feels better.</p>

<p>It was an intense battle that lasted nearly twenty minutes, but I managed to emerge victorious.</p>

<p>&quot;...Wait, what am I doing?&quot;</p>

<p>I came to the mountains with the intention of committing suicide, and yet here I am at the convenience store, seeking hydration...</p>

<p>Rejected by my childhood friend, and now I'm going cycling?</p>

<p>Ah, this is getting worse. I'm starting to feel like I want to die when I think about being rejected by my childhood friend.</p>

<p>It's like becoming indifferent and apathetic towards everything... My emotions are fading away.</p>

<p>Let's quickly buy a drink and go find a place to commit suicide.</p>

<p>After leaving the restroom and washing my hands, I headed towards the drink corner.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey! Hurry up and give me the money! Or I'll kill you!&quot;</p>

<p>I heard a rough voice. What's going on?</p>

<p>I had a sports drink in one hand as I made my way to the cash register.</p>

<p>There, I saw a chubby man wearing a knit hat, holding a knife to the unassuming store clerk. Oh, a convenience store robbery, huh?</p>

<p>&quot;Hurry up and give me the money!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eek... Ah, aah... Sniff... Hiccup...&quot;</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by fear, the store clerk started sobbing. With trembling hands, she desperately tried to operate the cash register and retrieve the money. All she had in her hand were all coins though.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, um... this is all I have...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?! That's everything, all of it! What can I do just f*cking coins?! Use some common sense! At times like this, you should be handing me a thousand yen bill or something! Think logically, damn it!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry! *sob*...&quot;</p>

<p>The store clerk, bombarded with the man's angry voice, finally started crying uncontrollably.</p>

<p>Oh well, she looks pitiful. I wonder when it will be my turn.</p>

<p>I've been standing behind the man for a while now, but what should I do in this situation?</p>

<p>And in the next moment, the man suddenly turned around and looked at me.</p>

<p>Reflexively, I lowered my head.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, hello.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello... huh? Are you stupid?!&quot;</p>

<p>The man's surprised voice echoed through the store. Jeez, he's so loud. My ears hurt.</p>

<p>&quot;Wh-what's up with that loud voice. Huh?!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Loud? You... Whaaat?! What's your deal, where did you come from?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm taking a sh*t. I was in the restroom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The restroom... I'm not talking about that! Do you understand the situation?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do understand. You're robbing the convenience store, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You knew it, and yet you're so calm! Are you a member of the special forces or something?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm just a male high school student looking for a place to commit suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dark Secret!&quot;</p>

<p>This old man seems to be quite energetic.</p>

<p>I'm about to commit suicide, you know? I wish he would be a little more restrained.</p>

<p>The store clerk is crying too.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, you little brat! Are you mocking me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're looking down on me because I can't kill people!&quot; Said as the furious old man approaches me with his knife.</p>

<p>In the past, I would have been so scared that I would wet myself, but in this current state of my negativity, I couldn't think of anything other than 'I'm being threatened with a knife.'</p>

<p>&quot;I'll kill you, kid!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...If you want to?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huuuh?&quot;</p>

<p>The old man utters a rather foolish voice.</p>

<p>&quot;No, go ahead and kill me. I said it earlier. I'm looking for a place to die.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No way, man! It's not that easy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I lost my family in a car accident, and even my childhood friend, who was my only emotional support, rejected me... I've become so tired of life...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... Seriously?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you're going to do it, do it quickly. And after you kill me, don't lay a finger on the store clerk, alright? If you harm the store clerk, I'll curse and kill you, old man.&quot;</p>

<p>Is this the last act of kindness I can do, protecting a plain clerk?</p>

<p>I gaze at the old man's face and boldly declare,</p>

<p>&quot;Come! Kill me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuh, ah... Aah!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kill me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guh, ugh... It's impossible for me!&quot;</p>

<p>With that shout, the old man drops his knife and runs out of the convenience store.</p>

<p>...Damn it. I thought it would save me the trouble of finding a place to commit suicide.</p>

<p>Feeling disappointed, I place the sports drink on the counter.</p>

<p>*...Sniff... Sniff...*</p>

<p>&quot;Um, excuse me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You..re... Kuromine-kun... right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm surprised. The plain clerk just mentioned my name.</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, I'm... Hoshimiya Ayana... same class as you.. but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya Ayana is a cute gal in the same class as me.</p>

<p>She has a ponytail with brown hair, a beautifully made-up face, and an outstanding figure that can immediately catch the attention of mens. She has a flawless personality, always bright and cheerful, and kind to everyone. She often shows a lovely smile even in classroom.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya Ayana, who is considered to be one of the most popular girls in the school, is actually stylish gyaru.</p>

<p>In other words, she's like the embodiment of popularity.</p>

<p>...No way, it's gotta be a lie.</p>

<p>The plain girl in front of me doesn't look anything like Starlight Ayana. (TL: Hoshi - Star, Miya - Shine)</p>

<p>So I decided to take a closer look.</p>

<p>Her messy brown hair and glasses make it hard to tell, but there is definitely a resemblance in her features.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, sorry to ask, but... could you stay until the manager comes?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's, um... the rules... I think they'll ask me a lot of questions...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sigh... Fine, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>It's a hassle, but there's no way I can inconvenience Hoshimiya like this.</p>

<<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/embed0006_HD.jpg" alt="embed0006-HD" border="0"></a>

<p>So I reluctantly nod in agreement.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I explained the situation to the store manager who arrived, and now it was time to involve the police.</p>

<p>Since it was almost 10 PM, we decided to discuss the details on another day.</p>

<p>By the way, I kept quiet about coming to the mountains to commit suicide.</p>

<p>However, the surveillance camera footage showed me confidently confronting the man with the knife, and the police and the store manager questioned me about it.</p>

<p>At first, I considered explaining everything, but I judged that it would definitely become troublesome. So, I simply said I pretended to be brave because I was scared' and left it at that.</p>

<p>They were skeptical adults, but in the end, they came to trust my words.</p>

<p>Although, I was scolded seriously with &quot;Don't do something dangerous!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're amazing, Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I was suddenly praised. Curiously I had, I looked at Hoshimiya's face next to me.</p>

<p>...She had a face that looked pathetic after crying.</p>

<p>Right now, we were in a corner of the convenience store parking lot, a small area where bicycles parked.</p>

<p>The cool breeze characteristic of the mountains gently brushed against our skin. The surroundings were pitch dark. The dazzling light emanating from the convenience store illuminated Hoshimiya's profile, creating shadows.</p>

<p>&quot;You saw through the convenience store robber's fear and improvised by pretending to be a suicide volunteer, right? Your courage is amazing. I didn't know you're also smart.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's pure eyes sparkled as she directed a gaze of admiration towards me.</p>

<p>Ah, so Hoshimiya was also deceived like the police.</p>

<p>She has a beautiful heart despite being a gal. No, now she's Messy Megane-chan.</p>

<p>&quot;I lied about everything I told the adults. I really intended to commit suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told the convenience store robber as well, but it's true that my family died in a traffic accident, and it's true that my childhood friend rejected me. That's why I came here to commit suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>It was back in my chuunibyou days, I think. It happened when the four of us, my parents, sister, and I, were walking in the town.</p>

<p>As my shoelaces came untied, I stopped and called out to my parents and sister who were walking ahead of me&mdash;then a car crashed into them. It's an unforgettable scene that I will remember for the rest of my life.</p>

<p>A sight of people being blown away all at once is not something to be seen. It's something I don't want to see anymore.</p>

<p>&quot;That's the story. Goodbye, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>I straddled my bicycle and was about to start pedaling... when she suddenly grabbed my arm.</p>

<p>Then I looked at Hoshimiya, startled. It took my breath away.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya Ayana&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;was crying.</p>

<p>Tears flowed uncontrollably as she sobbed and cried out.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshi...miya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was really... really tough, right? Losing your family... being rejected by someone you love... *sniff*&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sure I wouldn't have been able to endure it. Because, you know... just imagining it... *sniff*... ughhh...!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya even more cried in front of me, like a young child, unable to even speak properly.</p>

<p>&quot;You're amazing, Kuromine-kun... You've really... worked so hard... to keep living...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>It wasn't just empty comforting. She was saying it sincerely. Hoshimiya was earnestly expressing her thoughts to me.</p>

<p>Her overflowing tears were the strongest evidence of that.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm... I'm sorry. My life has been peaceful... I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for you... but still, I don't want you to die... *sniff*&quot;</p>

<p>I could feel the strength in Hoshimiya's hand gripping my arm.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, for now, please let me go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... I know it's selfish of me... but, Kuromine-kun... please, *sniff* I want you to live... &quot;</p>

<p>What a strange feeling it was.</p>

<p>The cheerful and kind gal in our class had transformed into a plain girl, crying and worrying about me. It felt like a small, warm flame had ignited in the depths of my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun... *hic*... *sniff*&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright... I got it. I will do what you said...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Re-really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I promise.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, with an anxious expression, confirmed my words, and I nodded deeply.</p>

<p>If I were to commit suicide now, Hoshimiya would be devastated beyond more.</p>

<p>To be honest, I came to the mountain with the intention of not caring about what happens to others. But seeing Hoshimiya's tear-stained face, it change my mind...</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, you're surprisingly a crybaby, huh? You were crying during the robbery too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, of course I'd cry! I was really scared!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya started sobbing again. It's my fault.</p>

<p>Being threatened by a robber with a knife is naturally terrifying experience.</p>

<p>However, Hoshimiya is a girl, all alone in this place. It must have been a traumatic experience for her.</p>

<p>&quot;Well... I'm glad you're safe, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Same to you... *sniff*&quot;</p>

<p>She sniffled, finally letting go of my arm.</p>

<p>Come to think of it... Besides my childhood friend, this is the first time someone of the opposite sex has touched me.</p>

<p>&quot;Is your house nearby around here, Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it's about a 15-minute bike ride from here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it far from school?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is. But I take the train, so it's not that bothersome. Is your house nearby too, Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. I rode my bike for three hours to get here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, w-why!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because I came here to die!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously! That's nothing to be proud of! Ah... *sniff*... *hic*&quot;</p>

<p>Emotions surged up again, and tears started flowing from her eyes.</p>

<p>I'm really sorry. I shouldn't have said that so casually.</p>

<p>Should I kneel down and apologize? Or perform seppuku... No, that would be counterproductive.</p>

<p>...But she really cries a lot, huh?</p>

<p>Hoshimiya was always a cheerful and kind gal in class. I never imagined her as someone who would cry so much.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, Hoshimiya. I promise I won't commit suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I promise.&quot;</p>

<p>I looked into Hoshimiya's eyes and earnestly reassured her.</p>

<p>Seeming satisfied with my words, she let out a sigh of relief.</p>

<p>&quot;It must be tough for you to ride back for three hours now... Do you live with someone? Maybe they can come and pick you up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's unfortunate, but I live alone. By the way, I don't even have enough money to call a taxi. I only have five yen left.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... That's tough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not that tough, you know. Meeting you like this... It means we have a connection. Just like the five yen.&quot; (TL: five yen means fate in japanese.)</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, you're funny, Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya smiled genuinely. Despite saying it myself, was it really that funny?</p>

<p>It wasn't clever at all. In fact, it would have been more amusing to be insulted with 'That's kinda plain.'</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, if you want, would you like to come to my place?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>It was an unexpected proposal, and a silly voice slipped out.</p>

<p>&quot;I live alone too, so there's nothing to worry about.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, there definitely are things to worry about, right?</p>

<p>A young man and woman living under the same roof, just the two of them.</p>

<p>I tried to convey that thought through my gaze, but Hoshimiya had a refreshed expression on her face after crying. Ah, I see. She doesn't see me as the opposite sex.</p>

<p>Ah, I've heard that from my childhood friend too, damn it. Inevitable descent into darkness.</p>

<p>If I had a nuclear bomb switch in my hands, I would press it without hesitation.</p>

<p>&quot;...Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing. Yeah, let me stay over tonight.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay. Oh, but let me clean up the room first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Got it. Feel free to clean up as much as you want.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not that messy as you think, really!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya pouted lightly and sent me a slightly reproachful look. She's so cute.</p>

<p>I followed Hoshimiya, who started pedaling her bicycle. I chased after her on my own bicycle.</p>

<p>And like this, the me who had planned to commit suicide ended up staying at Hoshimiya's house.</p>

<p>And now, I realize. If I had gone through with the suicide, I might have burdened my childhood friend with an incredible weight. In every sense, Hoshimiya might have saved me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>Slowing down, Hoshimiya turned back. With a little embarrassment, I expressed my gratitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, thanks!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haha, no need to thank me. I should be the one thanking you for saving me from the robber.&quot;</p>

<p>If that's the case, Hoshimiya, you saved my life.</p>

<p>It was because I saw your earnest, tear-filled face that it change my heart. But──</p>

<p>...I'm probably pushover than I thought.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;The house where Hoshimiya lives in is a two-story wooden apartment. The walls are discolored and give off a worn-out atmosphere. It doesn't seem like a house where a gal would live. That's what I thought, but the current Hoshimiya isn't a gal. From any angle, she appears to be a completely flawless plain girl. It's amazing how much people can change, and it fills me with a sense of wonder.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Over here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I parked my bicycle and followed Hoshimiya way up to the rusty stairs.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's room was at the far right on the second floor. She lives here alone.</p>

<p>&quot;Why does Hoshimiya live alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? Well, you see, my mother went with my father on a business trip.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. So you've stayed behind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, but I friends too. But it seems she won't be coming back after about a year.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Still, it must be lonely.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, but I know we'll be able to meet again someday...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya said in a subdued voice, looking down. Perhaps she remembered my situation.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry too much. As you can see, I'm doing fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's something someone who was about to kill themselves would say, you know...&quot;</p>

<p>It's troublesome to be told such things. Humans always live based on their current mood and vibe.</p>

<p>However, in my case, the range of fluctuations might be a bit larger.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, don't people often say that about you? That you may seem quiet on the outside but your personality is a bit different?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, not at all. The evaluation I receive from those around me is that I'm a serious and plain male student in both appearance and personality. I think Hoshimiya feels the same way.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, it's fine if you play mean a little.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess you really can't tell until you actually talk to someone. I thought Kuromine-kun couldn't talk to people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's really mean. I normally get hurt also, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, sorry, sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya bows her head with a mischievous smile on her face.</p>

<p>Depending on the situation, it might be annoying, but Hoshimiya had a charm that made her seem cute.</p>

<p>This light atmosphere is a bit gal-like.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm back.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya opens the door and steps into the entrance. Of course, it's pitch dark inside and no one is there.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry for intruding.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya responds with a gentle smile. It makes me slightly nervous.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Kuromine-kun. Can you wait in the entrance for a bit?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya takes off her shoes at the entrance, passes through the kitchen, opens the door, and enters the room. She must be cleaning. It looks like a one-room apartment. The kitchen is right next to the entrance. There's a door leading to the bathroom and toilet. The room Hoshimiya entered is probably the space where she spends her daily life.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry for the wait.&quot;</p>

<p>Before long, Hoshimiya returns. Her face is clearly visible in the room's light, but there are clear traces of tears on her cheeks....Maybe she has not realize it on her own face.</p>

<p>&quot;Please, come in.&quot;</p>

<p>Guided by Hoshimiya, I enter the room, glancing past the kitchen. It's a girlish room with a pink theme. It's about the size of eight tatami mats. The floor is not flooring but tatami mats, although they have been covered with a carpet to give it a more Western-style look. The curtains and bed are a light pink color that is not too flashy, and the closet by the wall is spotlessly white. The arrangement of the furniture, including the desk, is cleverly done to make the room feel spacious despite its size.</p>

<p>&quot;............?&quot;</p>

<p>My attention is caught by a certain point. It's a family photo placed on the desk.</p>

<p>It shows a kind-looking couple and a middle school-aged Hoshimiya with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>...Hoshimiya looked plain back then too. Her hair was also black.</p>

<p>Could it be that Hoshimiya is someone who debuted in high school?</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>What is this uneasiness? Something in my mind is throbbing.</p>

<p>&quot;What? Is my room... strange?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not strange, but it has a fruity scent. I see, so this is Hoshimiya's scent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think that's something normal people wouldn't even think of saying.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's sharp gaze from her narrowed eyes pierces my face.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you really okay with me staying over?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about your boyfriend? I think this could cause problem...&quot;</p>

<p>Upon hearing that, Hoshimiya frantically shakes her head.</p>

<p>&quot;N-No! I don't have a boyfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Hasn't anyone confessed to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, nothing! Confessions and all that...&quot;</p>

<p>From her surprised denial, it doesn't seem like she's lying.</p>

<p>I can't believe it. Someone like Hoshimiya must have been born under a star that will make her popular with opposite sex.</p>

<p>Or rather, she should be popular. I may have zero friends, but I've heard the rumors about Hoshimiya multiple times.</p>

<p>At the very least, it's a fact that several guys have tried to confess to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever had a guy in this room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never. You're the first one, actually...&quot;</p>

<p>When she says that, I become even more conscious.</p>

<p>...Am I the only guy who has entered Hoshimiya's house? I feel a slight sense of being a special.</p>

<p>&quot;It's surprising that even though you're a gal, you don't invite guys.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does it have anything to do with being a gal? That sounds kind of biased.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But the Hoshimiya at school looks like someone, who enjoys playing around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm just fashionable. I'm pursuing cuteness in my own way.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya retorts with a pouting expression. It seems she has absolutely no experience with guys.</p>

<p>&quot;It might be meddling, but it's better not to easily invite guys into your house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why... because... you might get attacked...., sexually.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya didn't seem to understand the meaning of my words, and I could see her eyes blinking behind her glasses. However, she quickly understood&#9472;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What are you saying!? pervert!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I didn't mean 'me' specifically&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just so you know, I didn't invite you to my house with that intention! Stop it, okay?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, with a sharp look in her eyes, tightly embraces her own body as if to protect herself.... This is bad, I gave her bad impression.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>>

<p>After the thrilling event of taking a shower at another girl's house, I changed my clothes into navy blue jersey that belonged to Hoshimiya's father. Surprisingly, it smells good. It doesn't have that old man smell. It has a lingering scent as if it had been stored deep inside in a drawer. 'Perhaps with a hint of mold?'</p>

<p>According to Hoshimiya, it seems that her father's jersey got mixed up with the belongings during the move.</p>

<p>Gratefully, I decided to borrow it for tonight.</p>

<p>After drying my head, I return back to the room where Hoshimiya is.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for the bath.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Well then, I'll go in too.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya casually said that without any hesitation and headed towards the bathroom.</p>

<p>...Wait, the bath? She's going to take a bath?</p>

<p>It's only natural to take a bath, but there's a guy here. Moreover, I'm not her boyfriend or anything.</p>

<p>We're just classmates who haven't even had a conversation before.</p>

<p>*Shhh...* Before long, I could hear the sound of the shower.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Is she not conscious of me as the opposite sex, or does she trust me... Probably neither.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it, when I was still kid, I've been told, &quot;Riku-chan, you're cute like little puppy!&quot; Maybe I'm not recognized as a human being.</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;I've got it!&quot;</p>

<p>If I'm being seen as a dog rather than a human, then it shouldn't be a problem for me to enter the bath where Hoshimiya is right? (TL: This idiot gives me chuckle haha.)</p>

<p>Surely, I won't be petted and praised saying, &quot;Aww, how cute!&quot; No, I'll probably just get punched and get arrested by the police afterwards.</p>

<p>*Ding-dong.*</p>

<p>The sound of the intercom echoes in the room. A visitor at this hour?</p>

<p>&quot;What should I do...&quot;</p>

<p>Is it okay for me to answer? It could be someone acquainted with Hoshimiya, and that would be troublesome. But ignoring it isn't an option either. Should I go and call Hoshimiya?</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, that's impossible. I can't go to where a girl is bathing.&quot;</p>

<p>*Ding-dong.*</p>

<p>It rings again. Sorry, please come back another time.</p>

<p>There's nothing I can do in my current situation.</p>

<p>*Ding-dong. Ding-dong. Ding-ding-ding-dong.*</p>

<p>*Beep-beep. Beep-beep-beep-beep.*</p>

<p>&quot;This is getting annoying!&quot;</p>

<p>They keep ringing it incessantly! Damn it, I guess I have no choice but to answer.</p>

<p>With determination, I head towards the entrance and slowly open the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan! &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;Who?&quot;</p>

<p>There stood a woman with unkempt, long and messy hair. Dark circles under her eyes were so prominent that she looked like a clown. Judging by her appearance, she seemed to be slightly past college age, maybe? She was wearing an oversized shirt and shorts, like loungewear. Overall, she had an unhealthy vibe, but her facial features were beautifully arranged, so one could call her pretty.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm Kuromine Riku.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is Ayana-chan's room, but... Oh, could you be her boyfriend?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'm not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then who? Wait, a suspicious person?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do I look suspicious? I mean, even though I have this harmless appearance? I'm a classmate of her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>

<p>The mysterious woman examines me from head to toe with a somewhat suspicious gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a classmate, huh? Why are you in a girl's room at this hour?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm actually running away from home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Running away?&quot;</p>

<p>I involuntarily tell a lie. Once it's gotten to this point, I have no choice but to continue.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. I had a big fight with my family... I got desperate and ended up coming to the mountains. Then I happened to meet Hoshimiya at a convenience store, and she let me stay at her place.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ohh, Ayana-chan is still such a kind person. She's not cautious enough, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...So, are you two going to do it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>The mysterious woman smirks.</p>

<p>&quot;You know right? When a young man and woman are under the same roof... It's only natural that something would happen, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It seems like your character suddenly changed.&quot;</p>

<p>The mysterious woman smirks. She gives off a perverted vibe... No, it's too early to jump to conclusions.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, my name is Mondo Chiharu. I'm erotic manga artist as profession.&quot;</p>

<p>She proudly announces it. Well, it's wonderful to take pride in your own work.</p>

<p>&quot;Feel free to call me 'Monmon-chan.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Does it sound like a dirty meaning, or is it just my imagination?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Are you saying that Monmon-chan, the erotic manga artist, is moaning and groaning? Oh my, Riku-kun, you're naughty~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please go home.&quot;</p>

<p>Mondo, because of her name, Monmon. And an erotic manga artist... Yeah, this is bad. In various ways.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, hey, I have a little something to discuss with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you're doing 'it,' could you lean against the wall as much as possible? I'm in the room next door, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh... What do you mean by 'it'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That means&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go home.&quot;</p>

<p>At the mention of &quot;it,&quot; I understood everything. I regret not realizing it from the beginning.</p>

<p>Oh no, this person is stronger than a convenience store robber...!!</p>

<p>&quot;A story of pure love between a runaway boy and a gal living under the same roof. And in the end... Oh, whoops, I got an idea. Sorry, Riku-kun, I'm going home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What on earth did you even come here for...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? I heard Ayana-chan's scream after a long time, so I came to check on her. Jyaa nee~&quot;</p>

<p>With a casual wave of her hand, Mondo Chiharu disappeared into the next room. She's quite the unpredictable person, like a storm.</p>

<p>To think that she can easily manipulate me, who subdued a convenience store robber head-on...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;That must have been an quite experience. Chiharu-san is quite an eccentric person, isn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not just eccentric, she's out of this world. She left me a strong impact in that short time.&quot;</p>

<p>As Hoshimiya finished bathing, she chuckled and laugh.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya was now wearing a pink pajama. The traces of tears that had been clinging to her cheeks had disappeared, and her hair, thoroughly dried with a hairdryer, shone and reflected the light.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because there was no longer a messy feeling, she looked like quite beauty right now.</p>

<p>Not wearing glasses might also make a big difference. Hoshimiya's well-defined facial features were clearly visible.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry. You were probably uncomfortable being mistaken for my boyfriend, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really, but I was just bit surprised,&quot;</p>

<p>However, I didn't tell anything about what we, Mondo-san and I talked about.</p>

<p>&quot;Now then, Kuromine-kun,&quot; Hoshimiya began.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, Hoshimiya-san,&quot; Kuromine replied, both of them assuming a more formal posture. Hoshimiya sat on the bed, cross-legged, while Kuromine knelt on the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Where will you... sleep?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can sleep in the entrance, it's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, that won't do. You need to sleep in a proper place, or else your body will get sore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, what should we do? Should we sleep together on this bed?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............S-Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously!?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya blushed as if her face was about to explode, then turned away and started fiddling with her own hair.... She's really a playful gal, after all.</p>

<p>Sleeping in the same bed with a guy she has no relationship with seems a bit... But it's clear that she's embarrassed by the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Is she genuinely concerned about me and suggesting we sleep on the bed together?</p>

<p>&quot;K-Kuromine-kun? You're... staring at me too much...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, uh, my bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I really... don't have any intentions like that. If you try to do anything... perverted, I'll get really angry...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rest assured. I have absolutely no intentions like that. I swear that I will never lay a hand on you, and I don't even have the desire to do so. The thought of touching Hoshimiya never crossed my mind. Seriously, believe me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Being told that to that extent is actually shocking,&quot; Hoshimiya responded, pouting with dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>It seemed that emphasizing the point had opposite effect.</p>

<p>&quot;The entrance... is no good, huh. I'll sleep here,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;Here... on the floor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Won't your body hurt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It'll be fine, the carpet is soft...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really want to sleep with a guy that much?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can you stop suggesting I'm slut? Even though I haven't... I mean, I don't have any experience with that stuff.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see, so you're still virgin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would you say that!? I tried to imply it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry. I'm inexperienced too... I'm a virgin.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pervert!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya yelled at Kuromine in earnest... Through their conversation, one thing became clear.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya is... innocent.</p>

<p>Considering her calm appearance now, it's hard to believe, considering her gal mode at school.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, I'll go to sleep now. Goodnight.&quot;</p>

<p>Without waiting for Hoshimiya's response, I lay down on the floor.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, but don't push yourself,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then, I'll turn off the lights now. Goodnight, Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goodnight, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>I heard the sound of her getting under the futon. In the dim darkness, I could make out the silhouette of Hoshimiya lying down.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I never expected that I would end up sleeping in the same room as Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>Ah, how should I justify it as just childhood friends? No, maybe there's no need for justification anymore. After all, I've already been rejected. Maybe I don't even need to come up with excuses.</p>

<p>What should I do from tomorrow onwards? It's certain that I'll have to face my childhood friend. How should I look? This is just my speculation, but knowing her, she'll probably treat me normally as always. Thinking about it that way, it's starting to make me feel frustrated!</p>

<p>*Sound of peaceful breathing*</p>

<p>She fell asleep quickly. I should go to sleep too.</p>

<p>There's no point in overthinking right now. If my childhood friend greets me with a nonchalant &quot;Good morning!&quot; tomorrow, I'll snap at her, &quot;Shut up, woman!&quot; Yeah, that's what I'll do.</p>

<p>As I moronically plot a plan that is bound to fail anyways, my consciousness gradually faded away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>The sound of the alarm on my smartphone ringing forcibly awakens my consciousness.</p>

<p>I fumble around and grab my smartphone, simultaneously turning off the alarm and checking the time. It's 4 o'clock.</p>

<p>I need to wake up early because I have a three-hour bike ride ahead, but... I'm still sleepy.</p>

<p>I take off the jersey I borrowed from Hoshimiya and change into the school uniform I was wearing last night.</p>

<p>I thought it wouldn't be safe to leave silently, so I went to Hoshimiya, who was sleeping peacefully in bed... It's not like I had any sinister thoughts about wanting to see a girl's sleeping face.</p>

<p>&quot;...Mom... Dad...&quot;</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Hoshimiya... was sobbing and calling out for her parents, tears streaming down her cheeks. She really loves her parents.</p>

<p>She was crying so much just by imagining their absence.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hm?&quot;</p>

<p>I call her name and gently shake her shoulder. She slowly opens her droopy eyelids and looks up at me with dazed eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun... Why are you in my house?&quot;</p>

<p> It seems like she hasn't fully grasped reality.</p>


<p>&quot;Is this not a dream? Yesterday, you let me stay over, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Continuing the conversation with a vague sense of discomfort.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm... That's right. What time is it now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's 4 o'clock. Sorry for waking you up early. I wanted to talk to you before I leave. You have to lock the door.&quot;</p>

<p>After yawning.</p>

<p>&quot;...Good morning~&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That maybe is bit late to say right now but, good morning.&quot;</p>

<p>This is how Hoshimiya is in the morning, huh? My impression of mine was, she was cute and childlike.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I waited for Hoshimiya to fully wake up, and then she saw me off to the entrance.</p>

<p>I hopped on my bicycle and began my early morning cycling.</p>

<p>It was a grueling journey that lasted for three hours.</p>

<p>Despite the cool morning breeze hitting my entire body, I was sweating a lot. Finally arriving at my home, a fifteen-story apartment building. My home is on the fifth floor, with a four-bedroom layout.</p>

<p>I have continued to live here even after my family passed away.</p>

<p>Although it feels spacious for a person living alone, I have accustomed to it already.</p>

<p>After returning home, I took a quick shower and changed back into my school uniform.</p>

<p>And so, it's now time to go to school.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want to go to school.&quot;</p>

<p>My true feelings slipped out. We're in the same class as Hoshimiya. That's fine but,</p>

<p>The childhood friend who rejected me is also in the same class as me. That's awkward.</p>

<p>And then...</p>

<p>The doorbell rings inside the room, signaling either a melody from hell or the arrival of the Grim Reaper.</p>

<p>...It's just the doorbell. The question is, who is pressing it?</p>

<p>Basing on my intuition, it's my childhood friend. I don't want to go out. But I can't just stay inside either.</p>

<p>With my bag in hand, I reluctantly move my foolish legs that seem to want to cling to the floor.</p>

<p>Arriving at the door, I take a deep gulp, I open the door with a deliberate motion.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, Riku-chan! It's another beautiful day today!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>She really came with a cheerful and energetic greeting.</p>

<p>She is my childhood friend, Harukaze Haruno, without a doubt.</p>

<p>Her bright smile that she seems aware that would make anyone happy, seemingly unaware of my pain.</p>

<p>Her beautiful hair, reaching down to her shoulders, sways in the wind, and the faint fragrance of flowers, resembling the scent of shampoo she wears, wafts through the air.</p>

<p>Despite having a smaller body than average, Haruno's presence is striking with her sparkling atmosphere.</p>

<p>Her personality is pleasant, bright, and kind... I don't think there is anyone at school who dislikes her.</p>

<p>Haruno gets along well with everyone, and I'm sure she was popular since middle school... No, even since elementary school.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaSC7nt0gRWGpq402tZY73V5L8zvowKvv-1Npi9ZbxUod59P5_1hVIO4eOsc2b4zM2-flw2u_fNJj1TQqPR1iKSkFDEw-S_IkvCrlnVutT4nydGJw8S05YDehajl0znKKAEJP6xathWgMItKwPEm8vedgOrIxMHDJoynxoCjLUeqivRvMkgT-CQIn6/s2048/embed0007_HD.jpg" style="display: block; padding: 1em 0; text-align: center; "><img alt="" border="0" height="320" data-original-height="2048" data-original-width="1443" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjaSC7nt0gRWGpq402tZY73V5L8zvowKvv-1Npi9ZbxUod59P5_1hVIO4eOsc2b4zM2-flw2u_fNJj1TQqPR1iKSkFDEw-S_IkvCrlnVutT4nydGJw8S05YDehajl0znKKAEJP6xathWgMItKwPEm8vedgOrIxMHDJoynxoCjLUeqivRvMkgT-CQIn6/s320/embed0007_HD.jpg"/></a></div>

<p>By the way, I have always been treated as a bonus addition to Haruno. In fact, I was even called &quot;goldfish droppings.&quot;</p>

<p>But I didn't mind being even droppings as long as I could be with Haruno. That was who I was until yesterday.</p>

<p>&quot;Where were you yesterday? We couldn't reach you, and you weren't at home either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had some business and went far away yesterday. I forgot to bring my cellphone; I left it at home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of business? What was it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a secret.&quot;</p>

<p>I was on my way to commit suicide in the mountains because you rejected me!</p>

<p>But I couldn't say that. Looking back now, I realize how foolish I was.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not good to keep secrets from your childhood friend!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you say that... By the way, do you remember what happened yesterday? I confessed to you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Oh, but I still want us to remain good friends as childhood friends.&quot;</p>

<p>...Isn't that too cruel? In terms of web novels, it would be rated as &quot;R-18 with extra twist in it.&quot; (TL: Is he talking about NTR stuff?)</p>

<p>Moreover, Haruno is not saying it with hate. She genuinely wants to continue having friends with me.... The fact that there is no hate makes it even more hurtful.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it possible?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's quite painful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you know, wanting to be with me means wanting to spend time together, right? Even if we're not in a romantic relationship, Riku-chan and I have been childhood friends, and we'll always be together, so I don't think there's any problem.&quot;</p>

<p>She seems to genuinely believe that, and Haruno tilts her head with a puzzled expression.</p>

<p>I'm starting to feel like I'm dealing with a kindergartener. Does she not have any romantic feelings towards me?</p>

<p>Nevertheless, frustratingly enough, whenever I'm in front of Haruno, my heart pounds rapidly.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Haruno. From now on, we...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Come on! Let's go to school quickly! We'll be late!&quot;</p>

<p>As if nothing had happened, as if our previous relationship was completely normal, Haruno tightly holds my hand and drove me to go to school. Then, I thought to myself, what if I could stop liking Haruno...</p>

<p>Even after being rejected, I still love this childhood friend of mine.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>*Sigh*... I knew it would turn out like this.</p>

<p>In the morning classroom, surrounded by a lively atmosphere, I sit at my desk, holding my head and sighing.</p>

<p>The reason is, of course, Haruno. I can't help but gaze at her unintentionally.</p>

<p>It's only natural for our instincts as human beings to look at someone we like when they're in the same classroom.</p>

<p>Sitting in the back seat by the window, I emit an aura of darkness.</p>

<p>Haruno's seat is the second one from the front, near the corridor. During break time, several classmates gather around her seat. Even now, three girls are talking to her.</p>

<p>Occasionally, boys also approach her... Oh, the short-haired handsome guy who happens to be the center of the class is approaching Haruno with a slightly bashful smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Harukaze, how about going to the cafeteria together for lunch today?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sorry. I have plans to spend time with Riku-chan,&quot; Haruno replies.</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Well, invite me another time then,&quot; the rejected short-haired handsome guy says and returns to his seat where his friends have gathered.</p>

<p>On his way back, he glances at me with a dissatisfied expression.</p>

<p>Well, I understand his feelings. I understand, but I'm the one who feels more dissatisfied.</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, let's focus on something other than Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>If I keep only looking at her, it will only bring me more pain.</p>

<p>I slowly scan the classroom and my eyes land on Hoshimiya, who is in the central area of the classroom, engaged in a conversation with another gal-like girl.</p>

<p>&quot;...She looks completely different from her plain mode last night.&quot;</p>

<p>Her messy impression is gone, and her brown hair is now tied up in a ponytail. She has a moderate amount of makeup on her cute face, not too flashy. There is no overwhelming impression. Her aura is sparkling, giving off a sense of being in the top caste. Her conversations are mixed with occasional smiles, and she stands out with her noticeable cuteness.</p>

<p>Well, she didn't have that much of a plain look when she worked at the convenience store.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if no one has ever confessed to her...&quot;</p>

<p>I've heard the guys in the classroom talking about Hoshimiya in various ways.</p>

<p>It seems Hoshimiya has been popular since her first year.</p>

<p>As the days went by, more and more guys started paying attention to her. And now, in our second year, Hoshimiya is said to be one of the most popular girls in the school. Well, with that kind of aura, it's no wonder she's popular.</p>

<p>However, Hoshimiya mentioned that she has never been confessed to... Why is that?</p>

<p>There's another gal-like girl talking to Hoshimiya. I don't know her name. Or rather, I don't remember it. Her gaze is sharp and intimidating.</p>

<p>She has a well-defined face leaning more towards beauty rather than cuteness, but her intimidating gaze gives off a scary impression. She seems more like a delinquent than a gal.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan! Where you looking at?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>My heart skips a beat. Haruno is standing right next to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Why were you looking at Ayana-chan intently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I can look at whoever I want, can't I?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that's true... But whenever I look at you, our eyes always meet...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's voice gradually becomes smaller. Towards the end, I could barely hear her.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe I should dress up like Ayana-chan too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, I don't know... Just a feeling, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that supposed to mean?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno genuinely seems unsure. She's questioning her own statement.</p>

<p>But from my perspective, the reason is quite obvious.</p>

<p>It's jealousy.</p>

<p>When you see the person you like being captivated by someone of the opposite sex, you can't help but feel competitive.</p>

<p>Haruno is oblivious to this... Or at least, that's what the old me would have thought, jumping with joy at the opportunity! But Haruno only sees me as her childhood friend. Her remark earlier about dressing up like Ayana-chan was probably just a passing comment.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm....?&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, Haruno squints her eyes and stares at me intently.</p>

<p>This is Haruno's face when she's angry or about to get angry!</p>

<p>&quot;By any chance... Were you with Ayana-chan last night, were you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>There's no mistake. Right now, I am... being threaten by a murderous gaze!</p>

<p>If I answer incorrectly, I feel like my throat will be slit with a knife right instant.</p>

<p>Well, Haruno doesn't have a knife, though.</p>

<p>But hey, look at that... There's a cold smile plastered on her face... This seems dangerous.</p>

<p>&quot;That's not right. It's too early for you to that kind of thing, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan and I are childhood friends, you know. We've spent as much time together as family... So I have to make sure you will not do anything weird.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by 'weird'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Well, there are rumors going around about Ayana-chan having connections with various boys.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno says it with a hint of apology. I understand what she's trying to convey.</p>

<p>However, I can assert that it's not true based on my interaction with Hoshimiya last night.</p>

<p>&quot;Those rumors are baseless.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I think so too. But, as a possibility...&quot;</p>

<p>While looking at me, Haruno blushingly says this.</p>

<p>&quot;If you're interested in that kind of thing... I'll do my best as your childhood friend! Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>...I didn't want Haruno as just a childhood friend. I wanted her as a lover.</p>

<p>Why is Haruno so fixated on being childhood friends to that extent?</p>

<p>It feels like she has an abnormal obsession with our childhood friend relationship.</p>

<p>&quot;If you say that... Then wouldn't it be okay for us to date?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? I only have feelings for you as a childhood friend... I don't have romantic feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>Guuuhh Aah!! It feels like my heart just got drilled.</p>

<p>To keep myself composed, I decide to change the subject.</p>

<p>There's no way Hoshimiya and I have anything between us.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm telling you the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, really? I was just thinking... Hoshimiya is so cute that it might actually make it difficult for someone to confess to her. Plus, Kana-chan is always around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kana? Ah, that gal.&quot;</p>

<p>I surmise that she's referring to the intimidating gal who is often with Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard that Kana-chan acts in a threatening manner to prevent guys from approaching Ayana-chan... or something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>And I only respond with a nonchalant &quot;Hmm.&quot;</p>

<p>From our interaction last night, it became clear that Hoshimiya isn't used to dealing with guys.</p>

<p>Nothing at all, actually. Her gal appearance is just for appearance after all.</p>

<p>It's possible that Kana, who is Hoshimiya's friend, knows about this and she's protecting her... probably.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan. Do you remember anything about last name Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she's a classmate...  isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, uh, never mind. Don't worry about it.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno smiled brightly as if trying to cover something up. What could it be?</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno! Come take a look at this.&quot;</p>

<p>A female student who was looking at her smartphone at Haruno's desk called out to her, loud enough for us to hear. Haruno raised her hand and cheerfully replied, &quot;Coming!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;See you later, Riku-chan! Oh, by the way, I packed mini hamburgers in today's bento because I know you like them!&quot;</p>

<p>With that, Haruno returned to her seat and resumed her conversation with her friend. Just like always.</p>

<p>Now, what should I do? As I thought about it, I unconsciously started to gaze at Haruno when...</p>

<p>&quot;What!? Ayana, did you really let Kuromine stay over at your house!?&quot;</p>

<p>Kana's surprised voice drowned out the noise in the classroom, bringing a moment of silence. Wait, what?</p>

<p>In the next moment, all of our classmates' eyes turned towards Hoshimiya and Kana.</p>

<p>&quot;H-Hey, Kana! Your voice is too loud!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But Ayana... Wait, you're dating Kuromine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-We're not dating, but...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's small voice spread through the now quiet classroom. That might have been a bit dangerous.</p>

<p>Immediately, my concerns were confirmed. The boys in the class started whispering to each other.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, seriously? Hoshimiya let a guy she's not even dating stay over at her house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is the rumor about her playing around actually true? I thought it was sure just rumor.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's surprisingly innocent for a gal, isn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So Hoshimiya is a slut, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute. First of all, who is this Kuromine guy?&quot;</p>

<p>...Can I cry? Why is all the attention focused on me?</p>

<p>As a classmate who wasn't even acknowledged by others...</p>

<p>Just as I was thinking that, it seemed I was recognized in a different sense. I heard a certain guy's voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine... Oh, that guy. The one who's clinging to my Haruno-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>Ahaha, I'm gonna kill you. Haruno doesn't belong to anyone.</p>

<p>However, what most of the boys in the classroom thought was that Hoshimiya let a guy who wasn't her boyfriend stay over at her house. They couldn't help but imagine what might have happened next, even though nothing actually did.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, um... Ah...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, seemingly sensitive to the surrounding gaze and thoughts, appeared visibly flustered.</p>

<p>Kana had a look on her face as if she wanted to say, &quot;Oops.&quot; Well, it's your fault, isn't it?</p>

<p>...This is bad. With this situation, Hoshimiya will be labeled as a slut.</p>

<p>What should I do?</p>

<p>Based on my experience, it's best to crush rumors before they spread.</p>

<p>Right now, I needed to do something.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya is my savior.</p>

<p>I want to do something to help her... Ah, I see.</p>

<p>The current problem is that Hoshimiya let a guy who isn't her boyfriend stay over at her house.</p>

<p>Then, why not...? I should become Hoshimiya's boyfriend!</p>

<p>For a moment, Haruno's face flashed through my mind... But with a loud sound, I stood up from my chair.</p>

<p>Naturally, this gathered the attention of the entire classroom... Haha, you guys are paying too much attention.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya... Thank you for being my girlfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Eh, Kuromine-kun...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it was certainly worth it when confessing while crying. I never expected you to agree out of pity. But, aren't you too strict? you won't even hold hands.You let me stay over at your house yesterday, but you didn't allow anything to happen...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you saying, Kuromine-kun!? We...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We promised to date for one month, right? Well, for one month... let's get along.&quot;</p>

<p>I continued to talk carelessly.</p>

<p>It was clearly not something to discuss in front of everyone, and it was obviously unnatural.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it seemed to have an effect, as the guys in the classroom started to say things like:</p>

<p>&quot;Crying confession, that's crazy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya started dating Kuromine out of pity, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Limited time and not even holding hands... Is Hoshimiya that strict?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess Hoshimiya wants to pretend they're not dating.&quot;</p>

<p>They freely expressed their opinions. It seemed like Hoshimiya's honor was somehow protected.</p>

<p>&quot;W-Wait a minute! Kuromine-kun and I...&quot;</p>

<p>Just as Hoshimiya stood up from her chair, about to say something, our homeroom teacher entered the classroom. Hoshimiya, whose momentum was interrupted, closed her mouth and quietly sat back down. I also took a seat and let out a sigh of relief. I handled the sudden accident perfectly, if I do say so myself. There's no doubt that Hoshimiya will thank me for this later... Huh?</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmph!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya turned to me, her face reddening as she glared at me.</p>

<p>Well, it was a gaze that lacked intensity... In fact, it had a cute hamster-like charm to it.</p>

<p>But it was clear that she was angry... Why though?</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;!</p>

<p>I felt another intense gaze. Reflexively, I turned my face towards &mdash;her. Haruno's cheeks puffed up. Her face, resembling like hamster also, entering my field of vision. My face probably looked like a hamster too, but her eyes were clearly filled with anger. Uh-oh, Haruno must have figured out that I lied.</p>

<p>...So what?</p>

<p>Haruno and I are just childhood friends.</p>

<p>I confessed and she rejected me.</p>

<p>So, who I date shouldn't matter to her.</p>

<p>I'll make that clear to her during the next break.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>The moment the break time started, two female students came up to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan! What's going on? Explain it properly!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun!? W-What was that about...?&quot;</p>

<p>It was Haruno and Hoshimiya. The two of them, their faces flushed red, approached me with a surprise attack. I feel like I want wave a white flag and surrender. The reasons for their flushed faces seem to be different.</p>

<p>In Haruno's case, it seems to be anger, while in Hoshimiya's case, it seems like she's just embarrassed.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, Ayana-chan. Can I borrow Riku-chan first?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, but I also...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll borrow him.&quot;</p>

<p>Without waiting for Hoshimiya's response, Haruno grabbed my right arm and made me stand up from the chair.</p>

<p>&quot;Let's go, Riku-chan!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>Unable to oppose Haruno's intimidating manner, I obediently let myself be led away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>We were taken to the top floor of the special building. It seemed like an appropriate place for a private conversation, as there was no one around. Normally, I would be happy to be alone with Haruno, but this time, I couldn't stop sweating. After all, it was the first time I had seen Haruno so angry.</p>

<p>I couldn't understand why she was angry.</p>

<p>In fact, I should to be the one who should be angry, but I couldn't say anything in the face of Haruno's rough attitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, what's going on? Last night, you were with Ayana-chan, right? And you even cry while confessing... It doesn't make any sense!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, actually...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When did it start?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When did you start dating Ayana-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...We're not dating.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you just said in front of everyone that you're dating! Riku-chan, you're a liar!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno shouted at me in earnest, and my body shrank in fear. A warm sensation welled up in my eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;You confessed to me after dating Ayana-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that is...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...After confessing to you.&quot;</p>

<p>I had intended to deny it, but I ended up admitting that I was dating Hoshimiya after Haruno rejected me. Even though we weren't actually dating.</p>

<p>&quot;So, you can date any girl, huh? Riku-chan. I didn't know you such 'that' guy.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a sarcastic remark that anyone could understand. Without thinking, I denied it.</p>

<p>&quot;N-No! I'm devoted to you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your words and actions don't match! And of all people, it had to be Ayana-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of all people...?&quot; What does she mean?</p>

<p>More than that, what concerns me is how Haruno's irritation keeps growing.</p>

<p>&quot;...You think I care?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The...the original issue... You and I are just childhood friends... You rejected me, so... It doesn't matter with you who I date...&quot;</p>

<p>I said it in a timid voice, making it barely audible, but I finally said it. However, Haruno immediately retorted.</p>

<p>&quot;It does matter!?? We're childhood friends!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're just childhood friends, so it doesn't matter to you who I date... isn't that right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not just that! Riku-chan, we've been together since we were little... We know everything about each other...! Ugh... Yeah, right!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Liar! I can't forgive you for lying! You're worst, you even lie to your childhood friend!&quot;</p>

<p>As if she had finally understood the reason for her own frustration, Haruno accuses me of lying.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you've never lied to me before! You always watched over me, never even talked to other girls... You were always by my side!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, that's right...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's anguished scream echoes through the hallway, in vain.</p>

<p>I could only hang my head.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Neither of us said anything. In the silence, I could only feel Haruno's gaze.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, Ayana-chan is no good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't tell you the reason. But Ayana-chan is no good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't understand what you're saying...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Please, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>In contrast to earlier, Haruno's voice was calm.</p>

<p>After a brief moment of silence, it seemed like we both regained some composure. And that's exactly why this is my way of resistance.</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter to you...&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, fine! Remember, I warned you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't talk to me!&quot;</p>

<p>Complete rejection. I instinctively opened my mouth to speak.</p>

<p>&quot;M-My relationship with Hoshimiya... There's nothing between us! That's the truth!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno turned her back on me and walked away with rough footsteps, releasing her anger.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... damn it... I feel like crying...&quot;</p>

<p>I said it didn't matter to Haruno, but it hurt me. I, myself, got hurt.</p>

<p>And in the end, fearing rejection, I spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Why is it like this? Just imagining the bond with Haruno being severed, fills me with indescribable fear and anxiety.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I don't remember how I spent the time until after school.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was staring blankly at my desk.</p>

<p>The evening sun streaming in through the window dyed my desk orange.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>I suddenly noticed my reflection in the window. I had the face of a child on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess I should just go home...?&quot;</p>

<p>My body lacked strength. My heart felt empty. I was devoid of energy.</p>

<p>I realized that there was a clear rift between Haruno and me, and I lost all motivation. I walked aimlessly like I was on autopilot towards the exit. And then...</p>

<p>&quot;Finally, Kuromine-kun. What were you doing all this time?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed like Hoshimiya had leaned against the wall, waiting for me.</p>

<p>As I put my phone away in my bag, Hoshimiya approached me.</p>

<p>&quot;Did something happen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Not really.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya responded with disinterest. Well, it doesn't really matter.</p>

<p>The next moment, for some reason, Hoshimiya lightly pinched both of my cheeks and gently kneaded them. It didn't hurt. In fact, it felt nice.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll let it slide for what happened this morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You were still mad? But I did that because, you know you didn't get treated like a, 'that'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not about that. Today was really tough! I was asked all sorts of things by different people...!&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps recalling that moment, Hoshimiya let out a dry laugh with a weary expression.</p>

<p>&quot;Was it alright for you, Kuromine-kun? Everyone's misunderstanding.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine. Well, I'm with the most popular/beautiful gal in school, so I don't feel bad about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're saying weird things again... I'm not popular, though.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless of whether she's the most popular in school, Hoshimiya is genuinely popular. With that appearance, it should be abnormal to not be popular.</p>

<p>&quot;So, why were you waiting for me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? There's no particular reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's with that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... maybe because I wanted to go home with you?&quot;</p>

<p>Uh-oh, my heart skipped a beat. I thought Haruno, the girl I had decided on in my heart... but she rejected me. And today, a clear rift formed between us.</p>

<p>Sure, it's true that Hoshimiya and I are supposed to be dating, but maybe it's not that big of a deal. We don't have to go home together.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you misunderstanding something? Whether we're dating or not, it doesn't matter... I just want to go home with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it no?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya asked anxiously.</p>

<p>Feeling a tightness in my chest, I couldn't find the words to respond, so I shook my head to convey that it's &quot;Not really.&quot; Then Hoshimiya let out an innocent laugh, saying, &quot;Nishishi.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right! Actually my part-time job today is kinda late so, can you hang out with me for a bit?&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>The place I was taken to was a small square near the station, with crepe stalls set up. Tables and chairs were also provided in the square. It seemed popular among middle and high school students on the way home, particularly with the girls.</p>

<p>There were also other couples, Of course.</p>

<p>...What is this feeling? I suddenly have an urge to punch a lamppost.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun? You have a strange expression on your face. Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine. I just momentarily wished for the annihilation of humanity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's definitely not fine! You need counseling right away!&quot;</p>

<p>We approached the food truck and placed our orders. Soon enough, we were handed our crepes.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya had chosen chocolate banana cream, while I had caramel cream.</p>

<p>And Hoshimiya treat me. I was grateful.</p>

<p>We sat at an empty table and started eating in silence. There wasn't much conversation.</p>

<p>Well, it was more accurate to say that Hoshimiya didn't say anything. She was so focus in her crepe.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya finished eating her crepe with a smile, truly enjoying it.</p>

<p>Seeing a girl who eat so deliciously, is something nice see.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After finishing our crepes, we headed towards the station. It was to see Hoshimiya off as she commuted by train.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, see you, Hoshimiya. Thanks for treating me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, umm...&quot;</p>

<p>As we arrived in front of the ticket gate, Hoshimiya had a somewhat unsatisfied expression.</p>

<p>It seemed like she hadn't achieved something she had aimed for... feeling dissatisfied.</p>

<p>I was a little curious, but I decided to go home. I turned my back to Hoshimiya and started walking towards my house.</p>

<p>...Going home, huh.</p>

<p>Starting today, I would be alone. Spending time by myself in that spacious house.</p>

<p>I no longer had Hoshimiya. I would be alone from now on.</p>

<p>I had relied on Hoshimiya's presence to live.</p>

<p>So, from now on, who should I rely on to keep living?</p>

<p>&quot;...Kuromine-kun!&quot;</p>

<p>Someone called out my name.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's loud voice pierced through the bustling noise of the station and reached my ears.</p>

<p>I instinctively stopped and turned around.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya rushed towards me and took a deep breath before saying something shocking.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, so... starting today, would you... stay at my house?&quot;</p>

<p>...Huh?</p>

<p>It was a modest way of saying it, but I was still taken aback by sudden proposal.</p>

<p>&quot;What's this all of a sudden? Is it kind of extension as couple?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you worried about me? I mean, I did try to commit suicide.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not it either, I guess. I am worried, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>I asked her a bit forcefully, given her hesitant demeanor.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I think... I have a stalker...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lately, I feel like someone has been following me... My underwear disappeared from the balcony, and I had a feeling someone was following me after work...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A stalker, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, you probably thought that someone like me wouldn't have a stalker! I thought the same, but it's a little scary...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I wasn't expecting a stalker, but...&quot;</p>

<p>It's actually quite believable. Hoshimiya's appearance is outstanding, after all.</p>

<p>&quot;It could just be my imagination, though. The missing underwear could have been blown away by the wind... And maybe I was just mistaken about being followed...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if it's a misunderstanding, if it gives you a bad feeling, it's better to be cautious.&quot;</p>

<p>Before something bad happen, we should think and plan it, regret is always in the end after all. And you shouldn't underestimate one's instinct.</p>

<p>&quot;I did consult with the police, but they said they can't take action without evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Figures.&quot;</p>

<p>The police are busy too. They might do some patrols, but without evidence, they won't be able to take action.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be reassuring if a boy like you, could be with me...&quot;</p>

<p>Apologetically, Hoshimiya's voice grew softer and softer.</p>

<p>Even if I were to reject her, she would probably quietly back down with a &quot;Yeah, you're right...&quot;</p>

<p>There's no need to think about this any further.</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Starting today, I'll be your bodyguard. I can't refuse the request of someone who saved my life, after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-thank you... But you know, even though I asked, if there really is a stalker... it could be dangerous, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If that's the case, isn't it even more dangerous for you to be alone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that's true, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine. Despite appearances, I'm strong.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I've never told anyone, but back in middle school, I participated in a karate tournament and won with overwhelming strength. I wish I had that kind of accomplishment to brag about.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just wishful thinking! Um, are you really okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leave it to me. I'll protect you even if it costs me my life.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't expect you to go that far... But, still, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;I've come again...&quot; I mutter as I sees Hoshimiya's rundown apartment. There are no security guards or even surveillance camera's. It's understandable to feel uneasy about stalkers in this situation.</p>

<p>&quot;...Here goes nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Ascending the rusty staircase, just like last night, I make my way to Hoshimiya's door.</p>

<p>The backpack on my back feels unusually heavy. I went home earlier to prepare the things needed overnight stay.</p>

<p>With slight nervousness, I firmly press the intercom.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's me, Kuromine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll be right there.&quot;</p>

<p>Such a cheerful voice. It doesn't seem like the attitude of a girl inviting a guy over.</p>

<p>Is this what they call a 'gal'? Or perhaps she completely trusts me...</p>

<p>The door opens slowly, revealing Hoshimiya, dressed in a relaxed outfit that clearly resembles loungewear.</p>

<p>Moreover, she has switched from gal mode to plain girl mode (with messy hair and glasses). It feels like she has a bit of a dual personality.</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks for coming, Kuromine-kun. Come in,&quot; Hoshimiya says, guiding me into her house. We pass through a clean and tidy kitchen space and step into the living area.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Riku-kun, welcome!&quot; And Monmon was there.</p>

<p>Monmon was sitting by a small table, relaxing, and holding a can of beer.</p>

<p>Her face and voice seemed unnecessarily cheerful.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, would it have been a problem if I were here? Don't think you can easily pass me to do something with Ayana-chan.&quot; Monmon says.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Hoshimiya. Can I kick this guy out of the house?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, you can't. Um, should I have mentioned that Chiharu-san was here?&quot; Hoshimiya replies.</p>

<p>&quot;I probably wouldn't have come if you had mentioned it,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You really don't get along with Chiharu-san...&quot;</p>

<p>It's not that we don't get along; we're more like natural enemies. Well, it's more like I'm totally freaked out of this girl.</p>

<p>&quot;I heard about it from Ayana-chan. The runaway boy is here to protect you, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it sort of turned out that way,&quot; I respond.</p>

<p>It seems Hoshimiya told her about it. However, Monmon still thinks I'm a runaway boy.</p>

<p>It seems Hoshimiya also synchronized the story.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's about time for work,&quot; Hoshimiya says and hurriedly heads to the bathroom.</p>

<p>Oh sh*t, I'm left alone with this girl.</p>

<p>Being with her puts me in a position where I'm easily manipulated, so I'm not fond of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, it seems like you dislike me, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not just 'seems', I definitely dislike you,&quot; I reply.</p>

<p>&quot;I see, I see. Well then, as a token of friendship, I'll give you this. Let's get along,&quot; Monmon says with a smirk, taking out a book from her bag.</p>

<p>I naturally accept the book that was offered to me. I glance at the cover and immediately regret it.</p>

<p>&quot;What is this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, no need to thank me. Make good use of it,&quot;(TL: What do you mean 'use'?)</p>

<p>&quot;Use this...? Isn't it an erotic book? And the heroine is, A Gal.&quot;(TL: Thankfully, he's innocent.)</p>

<p>The book depicts a blond-haired gal in provocative clothing with a speech bubble saying, &quot;Shall we engage in some naughty play...?&quot;</p>

<p>It's just awful. Instead of a token of friendship, it's more like the start of a world war.</p>

<p>And it even resembles Hoshimiya in gal mode.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, I'm off,&quot; Hoshimiya said.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya peeks into the room before she goes out and in a moment of panic, I quickly hide the erotic book inside my clothes.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? What's wrong, Kuromine-kun?&quot; she asks.</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing. But I see, you only become plain when you go to work,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Plain... Well, I think it's better to dress modestly for work. Some customers don't like flashy outfits... Well then, I'm off,&quot; Hoshimiya says with a bright smile. She waves lightly at us before leaving.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan is a good girl, isn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, you're going to make a move on her after all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shut-up.&quot;</p>

<p>Just to make sure, let me clarify. I treat people with respect when they are older than me, but not on Monmon.</p>

<p>Although this is our second meeting, her position in my mind is already fixed.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun, this is a serious matter. Please don't make Ayana-chan sad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Monmon-san?&quot;</p>

<p>She's not in her usual lighthearted mood. Monmon has a serious look in her eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I know you're going through a lot, but Ayana-chan is going through a difficult time too,&quot; she said.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems so. With the part-time job and the stalker...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's not what I mean.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I didn't understand the meaning behind her words. What else could there be?</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, I guess I should go home too. Oh, and... don't go rummaging through Ayana-chan's underwear just because she's not here,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry, I will not do that.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, Monmon remained Monmon until the very end.</p>

<p>After seeing Monmon off and closing the front door, I sigh and return to my room.</p>

<p>&quot;Now, what should I do? And what about this erotic book I have in my hands!&quot;</p>

<p>I considered throwing the erotic book from the balcony, but it would be a waste to throw it away.</p>

<p>For now... for now, I'll keep it stored. I'll hide it under Hoshimiya's bed for the time being.</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm...&quot;</p>

<p>After finishing hiding the erotic book, I receive a phone call from a certain person on my smartphone.</p>

<p>&quot;...Haruno?&quot;</p>

<p>What could be the reason for this? I thought there was nothing between Haruno and me anymore.</p>

<p>There's no use being hesitant, so I answer the call.</p>

<p>&quot;...Haruno?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;*Sob...* *sniff...* Riku-chan...?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno was crying.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry... Riku-chan. About today...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't even know why I got so upset... To be separated from you like this... I don't want that... *sniff*&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Can't we reconcile?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's...&quot;</p>

<p>My remaining speck of reason tells me to refuse without hesitation. But emotionally...</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you says so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? Then as childhood friends, we'll continue to be together... right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>This morning, I had hoped to distance myself from Haruno... Haha, how things have changed in just one day.</p>

<p>If she begs me with tears to stay together, there's no way I can refuse.</p>

<p>&quot;...There's nothing going on between you and Ayana-chan, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah... Well, we're not even dating. I also didn't confessed to Hoshimiya either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you still... lying to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not a lie. Believe me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Then why did you say that in front of everyone?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was to protect Hoshimiya's reputation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...But staying at Ayana-chan's house, that was true, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot; I stayed in silence.</p>

<p>&quot;I knew it. Why did you stay at Ayana-chan's house if you're not dating?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That... I can't tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>I got rejected and I attempted to commit suicide in the mountains.</p>

<p>There's no way I can say that.</p>

<p>&quot;If you don't explain, I won't understand...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry. But it's true that there's nothing between me and Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>After I said that, Haruno remained silent for a few seconds before speaking again.</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't know the details, but I believe you, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's nothing going on between you and Ayana-chan, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There isn't.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Okay.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems she has finished confirming what she wanted to know. She didn't ask any further questions.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan, come to my house now. Let's spend some time together like we used to.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry. Let's not do that today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh... Yeah, you're right... Well, see you later...&quot;</p>

<p>With those words, the call ended.</p>

<p>And so, Haruno and I easily returned to our previous relationship.</p>

<p>&quot;...sigh.&quot;</p>

<p>I can't help but think I'm hopeless.</p>

<p>I'm glad we made up. I'm happy to be by Haruno's side again.</p>

<p>I might find it difficult to look at Haruno... But even so, I feel happy and relieved.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After walking on a dimly lit mountain road for a while, I finally arrived at a convenience store standing in the darkness.</p>

<p>A while ago, I contacted Hoshimiya and came to pick her up on foot.</p>

<p>I have a spare key in my pocket. Of course, I received permission from Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>Or rather, it seems like she intended to give it to me... Is this what they call trust?</p>

<p>Regarding the stalker incident, Hoshimiya has been sensing someone's presence, especially during the night-time hours.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's part-time job usually ends at 10 PM.</p>

<p>When she goes home, she has to ride her bicycle down a dark mountain road, and she occasionally feels someone's bike light shining from behind. Moreover, it might be the same person every time... That's what Hoshimiya suspects.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, she hasn't been able to see the person's face, but judging by the physique, they might be in their thirties... That's Hoshimiya's guess. Additionally, she feels someone's gaze when entering her house. Scary.</p>

<p>I arrived at the convenience store and passed through the automatic doors to enter the store. As usual, there were no customers inside.</p>

<p>At the cash register was not Hoshimiya... but a muscular, sturdy middle-aged man.</p>

<p>However, his lips were trembling, and his stern face had minimal makeup applied.</p>

<p>&quot;Welcome... Hm? Aren't you the one from the robbery?&quot; the man noticed me and his eyes sparkled. Scary.</p>

<p>&quot;You have quite an adorable face. How about working here?&quot; he asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you recruiting for a night scout or something?&quot; I replied. &quot;I came to pick up Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Recently, there have been suspicious individuals bothering Ayana-chan. So, you're here to be her bodyguard,&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>He had a peculiar way of speaking. It felt strange hearing a man's voice speaking like a woman.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for protecting Ayana-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's more like a coincidence.&quot; I responded.</p>

<p>&quot;As the owner, let me express my gratitude. Thank you very much.&quot;</p>

<p>He's the owner? That means he's higher up than the store manager!</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana-chan is in the back yard right now. She should be coming out soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood. I'll wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your name is Kuromine Riku-chan, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, if possible, please refrain from using the '-chan'. It's scary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hehe, it's such a cute name. It suits your adorable face,&quot; the owner said with a playful expression. Wait, am I being targeted?</p>

<p>&quot;Would you like to work here?&quot; he asked again.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you say that...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm just worried about leaving Ayana-chan alone. We had a robbery here recently...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This place seems prone to being targeted.&quot;</p>

<p>It's secluded and not many customers come here.</p>

<p>&quot;That's true. That's why I started working at night and managed to repel the robbers so far... but Ayana-chan was targeted when she was alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This is like a haunted place. You're saying it so casually, but it's a really dangerous story.&quot;</p>

<p>Based on what he said earlier, it seems like this owner has fought off robbers multiple times.</p>

<p>Perhaps he's some sort of monster.</p>

<p>&quot;We want to reduce the number of staff since there are few customers... but we can't replace the lives of our important employees. Everyone working here is a woman,&quot; the owner explained.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, everyone is a woman?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, everyone is a woman.&quot;</p>

<p>.........</p>

<p>Come to think of it, the store manager was also looks like a woman. I haven't seen other staff members, but they seem to be women too.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't it like a dream to work together with your lover?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we're not lovers.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even though you're not lovers, you're willing to protect her from robbers and stalkers?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes.&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed impressed, unaware of our circumstances.</p>

<p>Suddenly, he slammed the counter, wide-eyed and let out a deep, loud voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Marvelous! That's what a true Japanese man should be! The blood of a sleeping samurai!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um, excuse me, but I'm not even close to being like that.&quot;</p>

<p>He was a seriously intense middle-aged man. He gave off the vibe of someone who would swing a giant spear on a battlefield.</p>

<p>As I stood there dumbfounded in front of the owner, I felt someone's presence behind me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Kuromine-kun, you came to pick me up. Thank you,&quot; Hoshimiya came.</p>

<p>&quot;...I appreciate you come early.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Ayana tilted her head in confusion. Well, being alone with the owner was mentally exhausting in every way. I was on the verge of tears.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you for your hard work, owner.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good job, Ayana-chan. Make sure your boyfriend protects you well,&quot; the owner said.</p>

<p>(Note: The term &quot;&#12458;&#12493;&#12456;&quot; in this context is a Japanese slang term used to refer to flamboyant or effeminate gay men.)</p>

<p>&quot;I-I-I told you, we're not lover!&quot; Ayana blurted out, her face turning red, and she shook her head so vigorously that her glasses almost flew off.</p>

<p>...Being denied to that extent made me feel a little empty. But whatever, it's fine.</p>

<p>And so we left the convenience store and headed towards the parking lot. Naturally, there was only one bicycle available.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Kuromine-kun, how about we ride together?&quot; Hoshimiya suggested</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I don't feel like walking anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, hop on.&quot;</p>

<p>Ayana confidently mounted the bicycle, gesturing for me to sit behind her.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, are you the one who's going to pedal?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm?, yeah. Leave it to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I can... Well, whatever.&quot;</p>

<p>I sat behind her without giving it much thought. Ayana exclaimed, &quot;Nnngh!&quot; as she tried to pedal the bicycle, but she couldn't maintain her balance and ended up putting her feet on the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;...Seems impossible, huh? Want to change spots?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm fine! I'm pretty confident with my athletic abilities!&quot; Hoshimiya insisted.</p>

<p>&quot;Even so...&quot;</p>

<p>She was making an effort to pedal without touching the ground, but the bicycle was wobbling.</p>

<p>Out of fear, I instinctively grabbed onto Ayana's waist. It was soft...</p>

<p>However, I didn't want to go down a mountain road with such dangerous ride.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Hoshimiya, I don't want to risk my life on a bicycle.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry. I didn't want to inconvenience you too much, Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not about inconveniencing me. I just don't want anything bad to happen to either of us,&quot; I reassured her.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya nodded, understanding my concern.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you're right. Safety should come first.&quot;</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vjvG30d/embed0008-HD.jpg" alt="embed0008-HD" border="0"></a>

<p>And so, we exchange spots. I pedaled down the mountain road effortlessly with Hoshimiya riding on the back. There's something nice about riding a bicycle on a night-time mountain road with a girl. Especially if Hoshimiya were actually Haruno...</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, can I ask you something?&quot; Hoshimiya suddenly asked.</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even when I was working, I couldn't stop thinking about you, Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>...Wait, does she mean...?</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, when you're feeling down... you never ask anyone for help, do you?&quot; Hoshimiya's words struck a chord.</p>

<p>I hesitated for a moment before answering, &quot;Yeah, that's true. I tend to keep things to myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya nodded understandingly. &quot;I thought so. You don't have to bear everything on your own, you know? It's okay to rely on others sometimes.&quot;</p>

<p>Her words resonated with me, and I realized that Hoshimiya had noticed my tendency to shoulder my burdens alone. It was a surprising and comforting at the same time.</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I mean, when you deceive yourself like that, you'll eventually run out of steam. My dad was like that too, bottling everything up. It feels like you're doing the same thing, Kuromine-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>I remained silent, focusing on steering the handlebars and looking ahead into the darkness.</p>

<p>&quot;When you're feeling down, it's okay to admit it. No, I want you to say it.&quot;</p>

<p>Her slender arms wrapped around my waist, and I could feel the warmth and softness of her pressed against my back.</p>

<p>I understood that she was gently embracing me.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. It might be difficult to do it right away, but I'll try it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Take it at your own pace, Kuromine-kun...&quot;</p>

<p>Strangely enough, Hashimiya's words settled in my heart.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was because I could feel her kindness even on my back.</p>

<p>Until now, as long as Haruno was by my side, I was fine with anything.</p>

<p>But now...</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, let's go out and have some fun tomorrow.&quot; I suggested.</p>

<p>&quot;Go out...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah! Let's liberate ourselves and have a blast! What do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Sure. Let's go out and have fun. I'm looking forward to it.&quot;</p>

<p>Hehe, I faintly heard her delightful and adorable voice, as if she were bouncing with joy.</p>

<p>I'm sure she's wearing a captivating smile right now.</p>

<p>With that thought in mind, I accidentally blurted out my true feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya... you're really a great girl, you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, wha-what!? What's with the suddenness!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I just spoke my mind. I'm not joking or anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Are there any other girls who can empathize with someone's heart as much as she does?</p>

<p>I feel overwhelmingly fulfilled, more than if someone were to confess their love to me.</p>

<p>...Hoshimiya and I only started talking yesterday, right?</p>

<p>I've felt as if I've known Hoshimiya for a long time.</p>

<p>We must have spent such intense and meaningful time together.</p>

<p>&quot;Sto-stop it! Don't say weird things! Besides, Kuromine-kun, you're...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H-hey! Don't thrash around!&quot;</p>

<p>Whether it was her attempt to hide her embarrassment or not, Hoshimiya sitting behind me was shaking vigorously. Oh sh*t!</p>

<p>This truly is a nightmarish cycling experience.</p>

<p>From now on, I should refrain from saying anything too awkward...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p> 1 P.M. came. We meet at the park near Hoshimiya's house.</p>

<p>As we promised last night, Hoshimiya and I had plans to hang out together today. And I'm currently waiting for her.</p>

<p>Since we live in the same house, I thought we could go out together, but Hoshimiya insisted on creating the right atmosphere, saying, &quot;Mood is important!&quot; So I left the house first and waited for her. Is this a date, perhaps?</p>

<p>As I was sitting absentmindedly on a bench, observing the entrance of the park when Hoshimiya arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry to keep you waiting. Did you wait long?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not really...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, you should've said I just arrived too.&quot;</p>

<p>It's awkward to me to say that. After all, we were in the same house.</p>

<p>Without saying anything, I just looked at Hoshimiya's appearance.</p>

<p>She had straight brown hair and a light, natural makeup on her face.</p>

<p>She was wearing a white blouse that exposed her shoulders and a mini skirt... Her skin tone seemed a bit noticeable.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya possessed beautiful face, fair skin and a figure that attracted men's attention.</p>

<p>In other words, if she dressed so cute, her charm would go off the charts.</p>

<p>However, compared to Hoshimiya at school, it felt like she toned down her gal-style... And also seem she reduced the flashy elements.</p>

<p>...Ah, could it be... Because of me? Dressing up to match my basic outfit.</p>

<p>I have no interest in fashion, so I only have regular clothes for going out.</p>

<p>Perhaps Hoshimiya dressed up like that to avoid a stark contrast with me.</p>

<p>She's considerate. Perfect both inside and out...!</p>

<p>&quot;Hm, what's wrong, Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... I just thought it looks good on you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh!? Uh, um... Th-thank you...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya blushes and nervously scratches her cheek.</p>

<p>It seems she's not accustomed to receiving compliments from the opposite sex.</p>

<p>At first glance, no one would think she will goes on dates with a plain guy.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun... D-do you, um, say that to others normally...? Are you used to it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah, I've said it many times to my childhood friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see...&quot;</p>

<p>Well, Haruno would proudly say, &quot;I'm so happy to have such a cute childhood friend! Hehehe!&quot; without any embarrassment. She's completely unaware of me as the opposite sex!</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, shall we go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh, what is it?&quot;</p>

<p>I stop Hoshimiya as she steps onto the sidewalk. How bold of me!</p>

<p>&quot;Don't walk so close to the edge of the road. Move further to the side.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um... There's enough space on the sidewalk, isn't it fine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you think life is a joke? You could die!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You never know when a car might come rushing in. Always be cautious of your surroundings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you're right... Right.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's face twitches, but she nods in agreement.</p>

<p>And so, we walk silently, staying not close to the edge of the sidewalk.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>First, we arrived at the movie theater. We took our assigned seats and waited for the screening to begin.</p>

<p>To pass the time, I decided to strike up a conversation with Hoshimiya sitting next to me.</p>

<p>&quot;The movie we're about to watch is a romance, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Mori-san recommended it, so it should be good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see. If Mori-san recommended it, then I have high expectations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right? I've been looking forward to it too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...By the way, who's Mori-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He's a classmate... Geez, Kuromine-kun. It's bad that you don't remember your classmates' names.&quot;</p>

<p> Indeed, Wait a minute? Now that I think about it... I can't remember the last names of my classmates other than Haruno and Hoshimiya. I guess it's because I was only interested in Haruno to the core.</p>

<p>I have to admit, I managed to remember only Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;...Watching a romance movie with a classmate, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't this a date?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh?! W-Why are you suddenly saying that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's obviously a date. Going out together on a holiday to watch a romance movie... It's a date by any definition.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I didn't mean it that way! I just wanted to hang out with you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Fine, calm down. Here, have a drink.&quot;</p>

<p>I took the drink from the cup holder on the armrest of my seat and handed it to Hoshimiya. Her face was beet red as she took the drink and started drinking it enthusiastically through the straw.</p>

<p>&quot;...Ah, that... was mine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmmph!? *cough* ...K-Kuromine-kun?!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry, sorry. It's an accident that occasionally happens at the movie theater.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno also often mistakenly drink mine.</p>

<p>&quot;W-What should I do? It became an indirect kiss... It was my first time...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First time? Isn't just an indirect kiss.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not just an indirect kiss! Take responsibility for it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...How am I supposed to take responsibility for that?&quot; I confusedly asked.</p>

<p>But Hoshimiya turned her face away with a huff.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>After finishing watching the movie, Hoshimiya and I walked through the streets with our heads down.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya kept a slight distance, walking about three steps ahead of me.</p>

<p>No, it wasn't because of the indirect kiss. The problem was related to the content of the movie.</p>

<p>Yes, there were some sensual scenes.</p>

<p>Although it wasn't a movie focused on eroticism, it had some light scenes added on it...</p>

<p>It becomes awkward to watch such a movie with a classmate of the opposite sex.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............Pervert.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why would you say that?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya accused me without even turning around. Unfair!</p>

<p>Spending a day in this atmosphere is like torture.</p>

<p>Wait, it's not just for one day.</p>

<p>Although I haven't set a specific time-frame, how long will I continue live at Hoshimiya's house, I somehow want to change the atmosphere...</p>

<p>With that in mind, I recall how I spent my holidays with Haruno.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, wanna go to arcade? It's fun, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or gals don't go to arcades?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I go there normally. Kuromine-kun, you have strange conception about gals.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I won't deny that.&quot;</p>

<p>Or rather, I'm already suspicious now whether she's a gal or not.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I bring Hoshimiya to a nearby arcade center, who has been blushing all this time.</p>

<p>It's been a while since I've come here. As soon as we step inside, My skin suddenly feel the the sound of the BGMs coming from various game machines blend together, shaking our eardrums intensely.</p>

<p>Besides us, many junior high and high school students are enjoying themselves, and it's clear at a glance that this arcade is popular among young people. Of course, there are adults too...</p>

<p>Uh, there's a guy glancing at Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, is there any game you want to play?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, let me think... Ah, wait! Let's start with air hockey!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>What was that? But I agree. Honestly, anything is fine.</p>

<p>For now, the priority is to get Hoshimiya in a better mood.</p>

<p>And so we walk around in search of air hockey. As soon as we find it, I insert a coin into the slot, and a puck rolls out from the dispensing area. The game begins.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, Hoshimiya, let's go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah! Bring it on!&quot;</p>

<p>She seems oddly excited. Like a fish back in the water...</p>

<p>Well, let's start gently and observe her reaction. If possible, I'll make it a close match and let myself lose. That should improve Hoshimiya's mood. In other words, it's a hospitality air hockey.</p>

<p>I strike the puck with the mallet. The puck heads straight toward Hoshimiya's goal at an astonishing speed... But before I could react, the puck is swiftly returned by Hoshimiya with a thunderous sound, bouncing off the walls at an incredible pace, and before I know it, it's sucked into my goal in the blink of an eye.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I blink in disbelief. I couldn't react in time and she scored a point. What was that speed just now...?</p>

<p>As I'm taken aback, Hoshimiya, emitting a slick aura, lifts her head.</p>

<p>&quot;There was something I forgot to mention.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm actually called the Air Hockey Queen by the neighborhood kids, you know!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I don't know if that's impressive! And seriously, are you really a gal?&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, I suffered a devastating 10-1 defeat without being able to turn the tables. I didn't have time for hospitality.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I wanted her to show me some mercy. She's seriously strong. She's a queen, no doubt about it.</p>

<p>Her skillful manipulation of the mallet, repeatedly striking the puck, made her look like a pro.</p>

<p>However, well... whatever. Hoshimiya's joyful smile was worth it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After finishing the air hockey game, Hoshimiya and I decided to take a break on a bench in the resting area.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew, we worked up a little sweat, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya returns from buying drinks. She sounds quite refreshed.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, your drink.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks...!&quot;</p>

<p>As I raise my head to accept the offered strawberry juice in a paper pack, I suddenly notice something.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's clothes... are transparent with sweat!</p>

<p>The outline of her bra is clearly visible, contrasting against her white blouse!</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, what's up, Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H-Hoshimiya... How much did you sweat? I can.... see through your clothes!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh... Ahhhh!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya clutches her body, screaming in distress as she crouches down.</p>

<p>I hadn't paid attention before, but the amount of sweat is incredible.</p>

<p>Her sweat are stuck to her forehead, and her blouse, soaked with sweat, drawing her curves. This is bad. It would be embarrassing to walk around the arcade in this state.</p>

<p>I look around, searching for a place to seek refuge.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, there's a photo booth over there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So what?! Are you suggesting we take pictures of me like this?! You're worst!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, that's not it. The photo booth is like a private space, right? It won't attract attention. So let's take a rest in there until your sweat dries.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see... You should have said that earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Is it my fault?&quot;</p>

<p>With mixed feelings, we move towards the purikura booth together.</p>

<p>Luckily, no one sees us.</p>

<p>Or rather, it seems that the photo booth in that corner is not popular. There's no one there.</p>

<p>We push aside the curtain and enter. It's smaller than I thought.</p>

<p>I choose the largest booth available, but it's still a tight fit. If I extend my arm slightly, it would touch Hoshimiya.</p>

<p>Well, if it's a booth for two people, I guess it's normal.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Silently, Hoshimiya moves to the corner.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My... sweat. Doesn't it smell bad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all. It actually has a feminine scent.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;G-Gross!&quot; (TL: Ki-mo)</p>

<p>It seems like I messed up the way I tried to comfort her.</p>

<p>Now I'm getting confused whether she is a gal or just childish person.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>An indescribable, awkward silence hangs in the air. The background music from the arcade outside is the only sound in this place. Hoshimiya and I face away from each other, not speaking a word.</p>

<p>The situation, reminiscent of being in a confined space, heightens the tension even further.</p>

<p>Wait, do I even need to be here?</p>

<p>I could just wait outside. I ended up entering together with her by chance.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go outside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why? well...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's just... it feels lonely, you know? Just... stay with me.&quot;</p>

<p>Me staying in this situation... What should I do?</p>

<p>To be honest, I want to escape. However, seeing Hoshimiya's back dampened with sweat, looking somewhat lonely, I had no choice but to stay.... No, maybe I don't need to think about it.</p>

<p>When talking to my childhood friend, I don't need to think about anything, and it's probably the same when talking to Hoshimiya. If we're together and silence fills the air, then that's the natural atmosphere.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>We talk with our backs facing each other. I can't see her face, but this is fine.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Thanks for today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I feel refreshed now.&quot;</p>

<p>Just slowly and carefully expressing my true feelings. It feels like the fog in my mind has cleared.</p>

<p>&quot;I should be the one thanking you. I had a lot of fun. I can't let loose like this with my usual friends after all...&quot;</p>

<p>Hearing Hoshimiya's voice from behind, I felt a sense of satisfaction.</p>

<p>It's a satisfaction I haven't felt before.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>An emotion I haven't even embraced with Haruno.</p>

<p>I didn't know what was that emotion comes to me in that moment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;Mmm. Today was fun, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it was.&quot;</p>

<p>I give a nod as Hoshimiya says that while stretching.</p>

<p>We were walking side by side through the city, bathing the orange glow of the setting sun.</p>

<p>On the close roadway, cars are lined up at a traffic light.</p>

<p>&quot;You and I took a picture in that booth, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mmn? Is there any special meaning behind it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nah. I just said it on a whim.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya held up a picture we took at photo booth and she put it above her head and said it mischievously.</p>

<p>I secretly felt a little excited.</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, Kuromine-kun, you're not used to taking photos, are you? Your smile is awkward. Hahaha.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what can I do? I don't smile much...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then... from now on, you have to smile a lot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>In that moment, unexpectedly, my heart skipped a beat.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's smile, illuminated by the setting sun, looked truly beautiful.</p>

<p>And in the next moment...</p>

<p>From behind, screeeech! A loud horn resounded.</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat, and memories from the past resurfaced in an instant.</p>

<p>My family, in front of my eyes, in a car...</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I was tightly embracing Hoshimiya, shielding her from the car behind us.</p>

<p>&quot;Ku-Kuromine-kun!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun! Wh-Wh-What's wrong!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, the car didn't horn to hit us.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um... I think maybe it's too soon for this kind of thing. We should get to know each other a bit more...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...The car.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, the car... the car?&quot;</p>

<p>We stared at each other up close, blinking our eyes rapidly. Wait, what?</p>

<p>&quot;No, earlier... the horn...&quot;</p>

<p>As I said that, I turned around. The cityscape was unchanged, with no signs of anything happening.</p>

<p>There was no issue with the road, and countless cars were roaring past.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, the horn from earlier. It seems someone honked because a car didn't move even though the light turned green.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, is that so...&quot;</p>

<p>It seems I misunderstood.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, Kuromine-kun... it's about time...&quot;</p>

<p>In my field of vision, Hoshimiya's face was bright red. I was still holding onto her!</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry!&quot;</p>

<p>I quickly let go. I messed up big time.</p>

<p>I lowered my head, and ready to bow.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm really sorry! I mistook it the car crashing into us... I'm really sorry!&quot;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/embed0007_HD.jpg" alt="embed0009-HD" border="0"></a>

<p>&quot;S-So, does that mean you were trying to protect me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>In the end, I became a pervert who suddenly embraced her!</p>

<p>This is worse than being a stalker.</p>

<p>&quot;I-Is that so...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya turned her face away from me and started walking a bit faster.</p>

<p>...Ah, she must hate me now. I messed up. This is awkward.</p>

<p>And to make matters worse, we're heading home together!</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I stared blankly at Hoshimiya's back as she walked away. I couldn't move a step.</p>

<p>I didn't know what to do.</p>

<p>Despite having a pretty good day, I ruined everything in the end.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Hoshimiya, who had stopped walking, turned back to look at me with a sly glance. Her face was still red.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>Her voice reached me, just barely audible. I wanted to answer her question, but I couldn't say anything. Since the moment I thought she hated me, my mind stopped functioning.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, let's go home.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, I...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not angry about what happened earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;R-Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... umm, thank you for trying to save me.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, blushing and looking embarrassed, spoke with her warm smile.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no... What should I do? I can't even look at Kuromine-kun's face properly...&quot;</p>

<p>It was during the evening after finishing dinner. I let out my voice while soaking in the bathtub.</p>

<p>My face felt hot, incomparable to the hot bathwater. It was probably due to my emotions.</p>

<p>&quot;I was tightly... embraced.&quot;</p>

<p>I vividly recalled what happened after the honking of the car horn.</p>

<p>I could remember the sensation of being held by Kuromine-kun, his breath, and the beating of his heart.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had experienced such close contact with the opposite sex.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun... He protected me with his body, even if it was a misunderstanding.&quot;</p>

<p>Regardless of the misunderstanding, he tried to risked his life to protect me.</p>

<p>&quot;It makes my heart race so much...&quot;</p>

<p>I placed my hand on my chest, confirming the rapid beating of my heart.</p>

<p>Unable to hide my confusion about these newfound emotions, I submerged my entire body until the water reach my nose.</p>

<p>*Bubble, bubble, bubble...*</p>

<p>I exhaled and watched the water foam, my head is filled with confusion about these emotions.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>This is the moment just before the honking of the car horn.</p>

<p>&quot;Uh, Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>I stopped in my tracks as I spotted my close childhood friend while out in town with my friends.</p>

<p>I wanted to rush over to him, but I hesitated when I saw Ayana-chan standing next to Riku-chan.</p>

<p>Walking side by side, their shoulders almost touching, they exuded an intimacy that was hard to ignore.</p>

<p>&quot;...Why? Shouldn't there be nothing between Ayana-chan and him...?&quot;</p>

<p>And then, as the car horn sounded, Riku-chan embraced Ayana-chan...!</p>



<p>I was left stunned. It felt like a sharp blade had pierced my heart, leaving me in shock.</p>

<p>&quot;Why... Why...? He said there was nothing between with Ayana-chan...&quot;</p>



<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you're a liar.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't think of anything else. I just stared at them blankly watching their backs moving out away from me.</p>
