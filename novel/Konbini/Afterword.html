<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>This work is a revised version of a story that was originally posted on Kakuyomu.</p>

<p>I changed the course of the story and I wanted to revise it from beginning to end.</p>

<p>So, how was it? Did you find it interesting? It's interesting, right?</p>

<p>I found it interesting!</p>

<p>Even if it gets axed after the first volume, I'll be satisfied!</p>

<p>...Well, that's a lie. It's definitely a lie. I want to write more (honestly).</p>

<p>As a writer, it might be a problem, but I probably enjoyed this work the most.</p>

<p>I focused solely on bringing out the charm of the story to its fullest potential while writing.</p>

<p>As for the content... I wonder how it turned out?</p>

<p>Personally, I believe it become interesting story, but of course, it may not be enjoyable for all readers. Professional writers said, 'write with the intention of entertaining readers' (I heard that somewhere).</p>

<p>I mostly follow that principle as well, but this time, I wrote and revised the novel in a way that I would also enjoy it.</p>

<p>Yes, that's why I was anxious while writing. I wondered, &quot;Is this really going to be okay?&quot;</p>

<p>When I sent the manuscript to my assigned editor, my heart was pounding.</p>

<p>I thought, &quot;What if they say this content can't be made into a book?&quot;</p>

<p>The moment I sent the manuscript by email, I was like, &quot;Ahh! I really sent it!&quot; and I held my head in despair (this is not a joke, I'm serious). It's been years since I felt so flustered, haha.</p>

<p>I was swayed by various emotions, but the process of turning it into a book was very enjoyable, and I am grateful to the editor who gave me that opportunity.</p>

<p>I am also grateful to Nakamura-sensei for handling the illustrations.</p>

<p>When I saw the character designs, I couldn't help but go, &quot;Woah...&quot;</p>

<p>And now, it's up to the readers whether they can enjoy it.</p>

<p>There will surely be various reactions, and there may even be no feedback.</p>

<p>But that's okay.</p>

<p>If even one person can feel the excitement I experienced, that would be amazing.</p>
