<h3>Chapter 2: Progress</h3>

<p>It had been a few days since I started to live in Hoshimiya's house.</p>

<p>I wonder if I'm starting to get used to this lifestyle.</p>

<p>At first, we had some discussions about laundry and sleeping arrangements, but we eventually settled the routine. And the sleeping arrangement was resolved when I bought a futon.</p>

<p>I heard that the convenience store robber give himself to police, so the only remaining issue was the stalker.</p>

<p>However, I haven't felt any signs of the stalker at all.</p>

<p>Could it be that the stalker is being cautious because I'm here?</p>

<p>With all these things going on, I was leading a relatively peaceful and fulfilling life.</p>

<p>However, I had a feeling that something was off.</p>

<p>Since that day when we went out for a date for the first time... Hoshimiya's acts unusually kind for some reason.</p>

<p>&quot;Wake up! Kuromine-kun, wake up already!&quot;</p>

<p>As she shakes my shoulder, I woke up to see Hoshimiya's face against the backdrop of the ceiling. It was Hoshimiya in gal mode. She had changed into her school uniform and had done her makeup perfectly.... Since it's morning, my head doesn't seem to be functioning properly.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Kuromone-kun. Hurry up and get ready, or we'll be late for school.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Goodnight.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm sleepy. I keep my eyes closed and go back to sleep, but apparently she's not willing to give up. &quot;Hey! Wake up!&quot; As I unable to ignore this situation, I reluctantly force myself to get up, feeling lethargic.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, go wash your face.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And make sure to brush your teeth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>In a daze, I make my way to the bathroom, wash my face and brush my teeth.</p>

<p>...Something is definitely off.</p>

<p>While brushing my teeth, I examine my reflection in the bathroom mirror with a sense of doubt.</p>

<p>No, it's normal for Hoshimiya to wake me up... It's strange that everything is normal.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, I made you a bento.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't forget it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mm.&quot;</p>

<p>As I hear Hoshimiya's voice coming from the other room, I give short replies while continuing to brush my teeth.</p>

<p>What should I do? She's taking care of me to another level.</p>

<p>I came here for dealing the stalker, right?</p>

<p>Feeling bewildered by the situation, I finish brushing my teeth and return to the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, breakfast.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya begins to set the table with breakfast. It consists of rice, rolled omelet, grilled fish, and miso soup... A classic lineup.</p>

<p>I might be accusing another prejudices here, but I can't believe a gal made this breakfast.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, is Hoshimiya really a gal? Like in fundamentally sense?</p>

<p>With such thoughts in my mind, I sit down near the table, pick up the chopsticks that have been prepared, and start eating silently. It's delicious.</p>

<p>One of the things I discovered living together is that Hoshimiya is skilled at cooking.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Kuromine-kun! Your bedhead isn't fixed!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Is it really that bad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's bad! Stay still.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Mm.&quot;</p>

<p>With a comb in hand, Hoshimiya untangles my hair and fixes my bedhead.</p>

<p>It feels more like I'm being taken care of, than just being looked after.</p>

<p>Am I like a pet or something? ...Well, whatever.</p>

<p>&quot;There, all done! We're already late... So, Let's eat!&quot;</p>

<p>After fixing my bedhead, Hoshimiya also starts eating her breakfast.</p>

<p>She's becoming more like a mother figure.</p>

<p>The time we spend together in the morning, across the table, has become a natural part of our daily routine. While I wonder if this is really okay, it's also true that I feel a sense of fulfillment that I've never experienced before.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After finishing breakfast, I wash the dishes. It's one of the routine before going out for school.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun! Hurry up and change into your school uniform!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you starting to take off your pajamas in front of me!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Haven't you gotten used to it by now? You've seen my underwear so many times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I haven't seen it! I never had the chance to see it!&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing her face flustered, Hoshimiya turn her face away from me.</p>

<p>It seems she's still not used to situations like this.</p>

<p>Although she should have seen my underwear when doing the laundry.</p>

<p>&quot;We're living together in this cramped apartment, so there's nothing we can do, about seeing various things about each other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even so, I wish you should be little more considerate. It makes my heart race...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How about you come to my place instead? My room is spacey, and we can live comfortably.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-That's... still too early, I think. I mean, for me to go up to a boy's house...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's easier than having a guy stay over at girl's place, right?&quot;</p>

<p>I look at Hoshimiya red face, I think she's feeling a bit dumbfounded.</p>

<p>It seems like she has strange values or maybe she's just naive...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>We are going out to school together, but we will eventually separate to took our own seats.</p>

<p>In the past days, we used to attract attention from our classmates, but now it seems it become natural for everyone, and there are no longer any exaggerated reactions when Hoshimiya and I are together.</p>

<p>The people around us seem to have gotten used to our relationship (we're not really dating).</p>

<p>However, it seems convenient for Hoshimiya to pretend to be in a relationship as a measure against the stalker. Although about the 'living together' is secret, it would be easier to convince others if they know the circumstances.</p>

<p>&quot;...It's peaceful, isn't it?&quot;</p>

<p>My true thoughts slipped out after experiencing a relaxing life.</p>

<p>However, there was one thing that bothered me.</p>

<p>It's that Haruno hasn't been talking to me. It feels like she's intentionally avoiding me.</p>

<p>She said before that she wanted to be together as childhood friends... but now...</p>

<p>Keeping a distance from Haruno was something I also wanted, but it still makes me feel a little sad.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya appears in front of me.</p>

<p>For some reason, she had her right arm behind her back and was leaning over, peering into my face.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Kuromine-kun. Is there... something you forgot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something...? Oh is that it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mean Good morning Kiss.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not that! Jerk!&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, I'm a jerk. And it seems that some of our classmates who were listening to our conversation were whispering, &quot;Kiss... Good morning kiss...&quot; &quot;Damn, they're really getting lovey-dovey.&quot; Hoshimiya apparently caught those words sensitively and her face turned red in an instant.</p>

<p>&quot;K-Kuromine-kun...? I'm going to give you a sermon later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry. By the way, what did I forget?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's your bento, the bento.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, who spoke in a small voice so that no one around could hear. In her right hand, she was holding a black tote bag. It's probably the bento.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you not to forget it right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, you ignored the bento and left home... I've been waiting all this time, wondering if you will remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My bad...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You need to be more responsible, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>With a dissatisfied expression, Hoshimiya handed me the bento and returned to her seat.</p>

<p>And then, she was approached by Kana, her gal friend sitting next to her.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, so you're making a lunch for him?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well.... As a side thing you know? I make mine while I'm at it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, it didn't seem like that to me though. It feels like you're more obsessed with him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, that's not true! The bento is really just a side thing! There's no deep meaning to it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The panicking is kinda sus... Maybe while you're doing this out of pity, you actually fell in love for real?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No way! It's just... I can't leave Kuromine-kun alone. He's like a lost puppy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's up with that? Lately, you've been unusually kind. So that's the reason, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I had a vague sense of it before, but it seems like I was really being treated like a pet.</p>

<p>Feeling dumbfounded, I instinctively looked at Haruno's seat. My heart skipped a beat.</p>

<p>Haruno was looking at me with a rather displeased expression.</p>

<p>-Oh. The moment our eyes met, she quickly turned her face away.</p>

<p>...I don't know what she's thinking.</p>

<p>Maybe I don't need to worry about it anymore. I wanted to enjoy my current life.</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway...&quot;</p>

<p>I took out a letter from the drawer of my desk. It was in my shoebox this morning.</p>

<p>The contents were, &quot;Come to the back of the school building after lunch break.&quot;</p>

<p>The sender is not specified. The handwriting is a bit rough. It has a vibe of a woman writing it, but...</p>

<p>(TL: The wording of &quot;&#39151;&#39135;&#12387;&#12383;&#24460;&quot; (after eating) doesn't have a feminine touch at all.)</p>

<p>Anyway, there's no choice but to go and see.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Following the letter, I arrived at the back of the school building.</p>

<p>After a while, Kana appeared.</p>

<p>She had an expression that seemed impressed as soon as she saw me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you came.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but I can't go out with you.&quot; I answered immediately.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Are you retard? But, I'm more shock that you actually rejected me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, Uh.... so it's not confession...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not. I'm not that desperate to asked Ayana's boyfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>So it wasn't a love letter, huh. Then why did she call me here?</p>

<p>&quot;Getting to the point... Are you getting along with Ayana?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I think we're getting along reasonably well...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. It's a one-month limited relationship, right?&quot;</p>

<p>In response to Kana's question, I nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;You and Ayana have been dating... for about two weeks, right? So, you already know that Ayana isn't used being with guys, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... I found that out before you told me.&quot;</p>

<p>Kanade nodded and continued speaking, saying, &quot;Because Ayana is like that, I've been watching out so that she won't be get hurt by some weird guy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you trying to say? Are you telling me to break up with Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? I would never say something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Her tone was queen as always. Then what is she trying to say? I can't grasp the point of this conversation.</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana has been quite lively and energetic lately.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She used to be a bright and cheerful girl, but especially recently, she's been shining. It's like she's saying, 'I'm fully enjoying my life' with that kind of aura.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ayana seems to be genuinely in love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;With whom?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh... Are you seriously asking? There's no one but you. You.&quot; Pointing her index finger to me.</p>

<p>&quot;T-That's ridiculous...&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't hide my surprise at Kana's words. Really Hoshimiya...?</p>

<p>&quot;To be honest, I used to make fun of you. Like, 'What's up with confessing while crying? How about being a man?' But maybe it's better for Ayana to face someone like that, a guy who's a bit of a coward. It might put her at ease.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you really serious about that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're aware to Ayana's feelings, but you're not making any moves. She's also struggling to gather the courage to express her true feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm currently with Hoshimiya...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine, Ayana has found new love. That's what I think. It seems like the promise of one month dating, will get extended.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's something Hoshimiya will decide, not me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then it's fine. Ayana is only looking at you right now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seriously?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm dead serious. What I wanted to say is, please take care of Ayana from now on. Jyaa...&quot;</p>

<p>After saying whatever she wanted, Kana waved her hand lightly and left from behind the school building.</p>

<p>Her carefree and self-centered attitude was closer to the image I had for gals.</p>

<p>Left alone, I murmured, &quot;Seriously...?&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;Hoshimiya likes me.</p>

<p>I had been thinking about that the whole time, because of it I couldn't focus on the class. Before I knew it, it was already after school.</p>

<p>While my classmates were leaving the classroom, a girl approached me with her usual lighthearted appearance.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, shall we go home?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm? What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya tilted her head with a puzzled expression. Uh-sh*t, my heart just skipped a beat.</p>

<p>I can't believe someone other than Haruno managed to make my heart race...!</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, I haven't lost yet, you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmmnn... Did we have some sort of competition?&quot;</p>

<p>Even with that troubled smile on her face, I feel a hint warmness in my heart.</p>

<p>Oh no, this is bad. I might been falling for her without even realizing it!</p>

<p>No, considering everything that happened so far, wouldn't be strange if I haven't fallen for her!</p>

<p>She saved me from suicide mindset, encouraged me, treated me kindly at every opportunity, and lately, she's been taking care of me on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Haha, hey, hey. It would be abnormal if I didn't fall for her after all what happened.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, marry me right now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh, wha-whaaat!? Wh-what's with that sudden request!? We-it's too early for that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Understood. Then let's talk about the venue tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, w-wait! We should take a few more steps before that...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see. So we should take a few more steps. What step?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well... I don't know...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya's face turns bright red. It's evident that she's mentally cornered.</p>

<p>In that state, an unexpected character appears.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine... I'm counting on you with Ayana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hold on a minute, Kana!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Leave it to me. I will make Hoshimiya happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;K-Kuromine-kun!?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh no, it's fun to see Hoshimiya flustered like that.</p>

<p>Perhaps she saw through my slight enjoyment because Hoshimiya says angrily,</p>

<p>&quot;S-Stop saying weird things! I will ignore from now on!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah--&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya dashes out of the classroom.</p>

<p>I've gone too far. I need to chase after her quickly...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya, I'm really sorry. I got carried away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;..........&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya-san.&quot;</p>

<p>I called out to Hoshimiya's back as she quickly walked away.</p>

<p>Did I seriously anger her? What should I do...?</p>

<p>Regretting what I had done, Hoshimiya suddenly stopped in her tracks.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Do you want me to forgive you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... Yeah. I want you to forgive me.&quot;</p>

<p>I approach Hoshimiya, without looking ay her face.</p>

<p>&quot;Then if you take over today's bath cleaning, I'll forgive you...&quot;</p>

<p>Bath cleaning... Hoshimiya and I take turns every day, alternating in washing the bathtub.</p>

<p>Thinking it's a reasonable condition, I agreed.</p>

<p>&quot;Alright. I'll do the cleaning today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...In that case, okay.&quot;</p>

<p>Seemingly satisfied with my apology, Hoshimiya walked beside me without rushing ahead. We started walking together, side by side. It become normal for us to walk home together.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, by the way... When did you become friendly with Kana?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not like we're particularly close.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? But earlier, the two of you seemed to be in perfect sync.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We just had a little chat during the lunch break.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A chat? What did you talk about? ...Ah, never mind. I guess prying too much is annoying, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What did you talk about? ...Ah, never mind. It's probably better not to pry too much, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's nothing big deal. She just asked me to take care of you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What's that supposed to mean? You really love meddling in other people's affairs... Anyway, Kuromine-kun, you call her by her name, Kana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it's nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya shook her head, ending the conversation. I couldn't quite grasp her intentions, so I decided not to pursue it further. By the way, I don't know Kana's last name.</p>

<p>I wonder what was that from earlier... Could it be that she's jealous?</p>

<p>I discreetly peeked at Hoshimiya's face.</p>

<p>Her lips were slightly pursed, and she had an expression of dissatisfaction. But that wasn't all.</p>

<p>She was also fidgeting with her hair, as if trying to calm herself down.</p>

<p>As Kana said, Hoshimiya is really...</p>

<p>Damn, my face is getting hot...!</p>

<p>What is this? Am I really in-love with Hoshimiya?</p>

<p>The thing from earlier was just a joke...! And I still have feelings for Haruno...</p>

<p>What should I do? I've ended up falling for two girls at the same time...!</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm? What's wrong, Kuromine-kun? You've been acting unsettled since earlier.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;R-Really? Just the usual though?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your way of talking seems forced...&quot;</p>

<p>I want to know. I want to know Hoshimiya's feelings.</p>

<p>It's definitely important to clarify things for future of our relationship...!</p>

<p>&quot;I know this is sudden, but... do you have someone you like, Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!? That really came out of nowhere!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Do you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well... that is...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've asked before if you boyfriend, but I've never asked about someone you like, right? Considering the future of our relationship, I think it's a rather important question to ask if you have someone you like.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, uh... yeah, that might be true...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;D-Do you...?&quot;</p>

<p>I was nervously straightforward. It was probably the most nervous I've ever been in my life. My palms were getting sweaty.</p>

<p>When I confessed to Haruno, I was confident it would be a success, so I didn't feel any nerves at all.</p>

<p>But now...</p>

<p>&quot;...I-I might...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya blushed and hesitantly spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you mean by 'might'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I still don't know, I guess. It's like... I'm experiencing these feelings for the first time... like, um... I wonder if this is what it means to like someone to."</p>

<p>&quot;.......&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I still... haven't found the answer within myself... I guess?&quot;</p>

<p>What's with that? We're not in elementary school, so she should know her own feelings.</p>

<p>&quot;Who... is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I want to know who the other person is.&quot;</p>

<p>Unintentionally, I asked her with a greedy tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, uh... th-that...&quot;</p>

<p>A flustered Hoshimiya tries to distance herself from me, stepping back and accidentally tripping on a step, losing her balance. She almost falls backward, but I quickly grab her arm and support her.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;</p>

<p>I release my hold on Hoshimiya's arm. She moves slightly away from me and expresses her dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, you lack on consideration.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;Uh.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not good to persistently ask about that kind of thing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But... I'm curious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand your feelings, but... asking too much can make people hate you.&quot;</p>

<p>&#9472;Hate.</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>I might have gotten a bit carried away.</p>

<p>In the end, I wasn't able to bring back the conversation we had earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't get depressed, Kuromine-kun. It doesn't mean that I hate you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm not depressed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really? You have that puppy-like face after being scolded.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What kind of face is that...&quot;</p>

<p>Expressing my dissatisfaction, Hoshimiya smiles brightly as if to encourage me.</p>

<p>Then, she stretches herself and desperately reaches to pat my head.</p>

<p>&quot;There, there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Treating me like a dog.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Shake hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woof.&quot;</p>

<p>Since Hoshimiya extends her hand, I promptly offer my paw.</p>

<p>...Do I no longer have any pride left?</p>

<p>&quot;Hahaha, you're surprisingly going along with it. Well then, let's go, loyal dog, Riku-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Woof.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p> Today is actually Hoshimiya's day-off from the work, so we decided to stop at a caf&eacute; on the way home.</p>

<p>Of course, it was Hoshimiya who invited me.</p>

<p>The caf&eacute; was fairly crowded inside, creating a lively atmosphere rather than being relaxing.</p>

<p>Above all, the bright lighting uplifted the mood.</p>

<p>If this caf&eacute; had a stylish and trendy feeling into it, I will not hesitate to go home.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you come here often?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I come with my friends.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, sitting across from me, said with a smile.</p>

<p>Then my gaze fell upon the parfait placed on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to eat all of that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...It might not easy.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya chuckled. Well, it is indeed a parfait, but the size was odd. It was about the size of a small bucket. I think they called it a jumbo parfait.</p>

<p>There's a lot of sliced fruits, and chocolates that were cramped leaving no gaps on the bucket. Just looking at it made me feel full.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't order this before so I'm intrigued. But it's even bigger than I imagined... I don't think I can finish this alone.&quot; Hoshimiya said.</p>

<p>&quot;They probably didn't originally intend for it to be eaten alone, right? They provided two spoons after all.&quot;</p>

<p>Furthermore, the jumbo parfait was placed in the center of the table.</p>

<p>The staff must have considered it easier for two people to eat together.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, would you like to eat it together?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like, Sure, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p>Without any reason to refuse, I took a spoon in hand and joined Hoshimiya in devouring the parfait.</p>

<p>At first, I didn't think much about it, but suddenly I realized the current situation.</p>

<p>Uhhh.... it feels like we're a real couple. A guy and a girl poking at the same parfait!</p>

<p>Hoshimiya is Hoshimiya, after all. She probably said, &quot;Let's eat together,&quot; without thinking much.</p>

<p>I see, that's the lightness of a gal...!</p>

<p>...Ah, suddenly I'm getting nervous. My heart is starting to beat fast.</p>

<p>I close my eyes once and focus on my inner self.</p>

<p>When you clear your mind, even fire becomes cool.</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>With a determined look in my eyes, I start eating the parfait in silence.</p>

<p>That's right, I'm the only one who's conscious of it.</p>

<p>Hoshimiya is enjoying the parfait without a care in the world... Hmm?</p>

<p>I shortly a glance at Hoshimiya's face, and at the exact same moment, Hoshimiya looks at me too.</p>

<p>We both freeze with our spoons in hand.</p>

<p>Then Hoshimiya says, &quot;Ah, ahaha...&quot; and blushes shyly.</p>

<p>Ah, I wasn't the only one who was conscious of it.</p>

<p>Upon closer inspection, Hoshimiya's cheeks have turned slightly red.</p>

<p>I could feel the awkwardness and tension in Hoshimiya's hand as she moved her spoon.</p>

<p>As soon as I realized that, a sudden sense a relief washed over me, and I let out a light chuckle.</p>

<p>&quot;Ku-Kuromine-kun? D-Did I... do something weird?&quot; Hoshimiya asked with her trembling voice.</p>

<p>&quot;No, there's nothing wrong,&quot; shooking my head.</p>

<p>As Hoshimiya looked at me with a puzzled looked.</p>

<p>&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>This is a story from when Riku-chan and I were in middle school.</p>

<p>&quot;Why am I the only one who survived?&quot;</p>

<p>A few days after that accident...</p>

<p>In the empty, lifeless living room, Riku-chan muttered a simple question.</p>

<p>&quot;Why am I the only one who survived?&quot;</p>

<p>Those words carried all of Riku-chan's emotions within them.</p>

<p>Without raising his voice, neither shedding tears, or expressing sadness...</p>

<p>He simply gazed into the empty void.</p>

<p>I think he even forgotten about me who was there beside him.</p>

<p>With a detached expression, Riku-chan stood frozen in the empty living room.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, shall we go? Grandma and Grandpa are waiting,&quot; I said.</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>He didn't even turn his face towards me... He couldn't afford to have such composure.</p>

<p>I wondered what I could do for Riku-chan in that moment.</p>

<p>This is just my personal belief, but I think childhood friends are the closest bonds we have after family.</p>

<p>Especially in our case.</p>

<p>The reason we met was because our houses were next to each other.</p>

<p>Since we were young, we were always together.</p>

<p>We visited each other's houses, took baths together, and slept in the same bed...</p>

<p>We were childhood friends.</p>

<p>This relationship is a stronger and tighter bond than relatives, friends, or even future romantic partners.</p>

<p>That's what childhood friends are.</p>

<p>We've grown up together since we were little. It's natural for us to always be together.</p>

<p>So if Riku-chan is feeling sad, I become sad too.</p>

<p>I want to be by his side no matter what.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't claim to be a substitute for your family or anything like that. But you see, we're childhood friends... we can support each other like family.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...?&quot;</p>

<p>Even though his voice sounded fragile, Riku-chan slowly moved his head and looked at me.</p>

<p>&quot;No matter what happens, I will be always by your side. Just like before, I'll be there as your childhood friend, no matter what.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because we're childhood friends, we should accept each other&quot;</p>

<p>I stared into Riku-chan's vacant eyes that showed nothing, but I spoke with all my heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Because we're childhood friends... because we've been together for so long, like family...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you don't have to hold back anything with me. When it's tough, you can cry, and when you want to rely on someone, you can lean on me. As your childhood friend, I will accept everything about you.&quot;</p>

<p>To me, childhood friends are a very pure relationship that is not influenced by gender, age, or personality traits.</p>

<p>Isn't it that same as family?</p>

<p>No matter what kind of personalities our parents have, the essence of the feelings we have for our relatives will not change.</p>

<p>That's why I want to do everything what I can for Riku-chan, my childhood friend.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter what kind of personality Riku-chan has, and it doesn't matter if he is a boy or a girl. Childhood friend are childhood friend...</p>

<p>I want you to always by side, Riku-chan.</p>

<p>But that was a misunderstanding... The desire to be with Riku-chan's side wasn't because we were childhood friends.</p>

<p>That was just my own feelings as Haruno.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;...Riku-chan and Ayana-chan, they're going home together again today...&quot;</p>

<p>I hid behind the school building, confirming Riku-chan and Ayana-chan coming out from the entrance.</p>

<p>I held my breath and silently watched their backs as they passed through the school gate.</p>

<p>&quot;...Those two, it feels like their distance is getting closer and closer.&quot;</p>

<p>With each passing day, it seemed like two of them were growing closer.</p>

<p>There wasn't a day that I wasn't curious about what Riku-chan was up to.</p>

<p>I restrained myself all this time, but I've reached my limit...</p>

<p>&quot;Alright, today is the day.&quot;</p>

<p>Having made up my mind, I stealthily followed them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;Guuuurrr! These two... they're being lovey-dovey! They're being incredibly lovey-dovey!&quot;</p>

<p>I followed them from a certain distance and watched them from behind a telephone pole.</p>

<p>Ah, Ayana-chan... She made Riku-chan hold her hand! And Riku-chan is all into it!</p>

<p>Not even that, they're comfortable with each other... They're naturally touching each other's arms and stuff.</p>

<p>&quot;E-every day... Are they going home while being so lovey-dovey?&quot;</p>

<p>It's not good, Riku-chan. It's too soon for that kind of thing with you.</p>

<p>...No, it's not about being too soon. Because Riku-chan is mine...</p>

<p>&quot;My... childhood friend?&quot;</p>

<p>Huh? Something felt different. It's obvious that we're childhood friends, but...</p>

<p>Lately, I haven't been able to accept their relationship, and I've been living in a constant state of dissatisfaction and hate.</p>

<p>Above all, even though Riku-chan said, &quot;There's nothing between Hoshimiya and me,&quot; he went out with Ayana-chan on a day off and held her tightly.</p>

<p>The sight of Riku-chan embracing Ayana-chan... I can't forget it.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you smile at other girls too, not just me... Huh.&quot;</p>

<p>Riku-chan seemed a little embarrassed when Ayana-chan said something to him.</p>

<p>Seeing Riku-chan like that, my chest twinged with pain.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do I feel so terrible...? It should be a good thing to see Riku-chan happy.&quot;</p>

<p>But why isn't it me should be with Riku-chan?</p>

<p>I know the reason behind it. It's because I rejected him.</p>

<p>&quot;But... I still don't understand romantic feelings... and dating someone I don't like...&quot;</p>

<p>I wanted just a little more time.</p>

<p>Until Riku-chan confessed to me, I never thought about things like relationships or love with the opposite sex. I didn't have time to think about them.</p>

<p>Just being with my childhood friend Riku-chan was enough to make me satisfied with everything.</p>

<p>So, I wanted just a little more time.</p>

<p>I unconsciously believed that I could be with my childhood friend no matter what happened.</p>

<p>...Was that a mistake?</p>

<p>&quot;But I... I didn't explicitly reject Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>I just said that I saw him as a childhood friend, not as a romantic interest.</p>

<p>I wanted some time to sort out my own emotions and just think.</p>

<p>&quot;...Just a little more time, to observe them...&quot;</p>

<p>I started following them again. Sneaking behind the telephone pole...</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;It's frustrating... I'm incredibly frustrated!&quot;</p>

<p>I was so irritated that I unconsciously clenched my teeth.</p>

<p>I stared at the two of them coming out of the caf&eacute; from behind the telephone pole, barely restraining myself from shouting.</p>

<p>The caf&eacute; had glass walls, allowing me to see inside.</p>

<p>Of course, I had been closely observing Riku-chan and Ayana-chan's interactions.</p>

<p>To confirm it up close, I repeatedly walked back and forth on the street in front of the caf&eacute;, hiding my face with my bag.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh? Why am I feeling so frustrated?&quot;</p>

<p>As I watched the backs of the two of them walking on the sidewalk, I momentarily regained some composure.</p>

<p>I don't understand myself lately. I've been constantly overwhelmed by incomprehensible emotions.</p>

<p>&quot;Argh! It's so infuriating!&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, I couldn't stand it anymore. I just couldn't calm down.</p>

<p>My frustration reached its peak.</p>

<p>The atmosphere between them was filled with the intoxicating feeling of lovers, and I was so frustrated that tears welled up.</p>

<p>&quot;Why am I so bothered by this?&quot;</p>

<p>As Riku-chan said, we're just childhood friends, nothing more.</p>

<p>For me, a childhood friend means always being together.</p>

<p>It's a relationship where we've been together since we were young, just like family.</p>

<p>There's no doubt about having family by your side. It's the same for childhood friends...</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan had such a gentle expression. That face was meant only for me!&quot;</p>

<p>My precious childhood friend is having fulfilling moments.</p>

<p>That should make me incredibly happy.</p>

<p>But why...?</p>

<p>I don't want to see Riku-chan like this, not right now.</p>

<p>I don't want Riku-chan to have fun with other girls besides me!</p>

<p>&quot;This is the first time I've felt like this... Oh, I see.&quot;</p>

<p>Until now, Riku-chan never talked to other girls besides me.</p>

<p>That's why I've never had this kind of feeling before...</p>

<p>&quot;...Where are those two going? Isn't the station that way?&quot;</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Ayana-chan commutes by train... Could it be?</p>

<p>&quot;I have to make sure.&quot;</p>

<p>To shake off the uneasy feeling, I once again followed two of them.</p>

<p>&#9671; &#9671; &#9671;</p>

<p>I followed Riku-chan and Ayana-chan onto the train.</p>

<p>After a few stations, I followed them as they got off, and we arrived at an old two-story wooden apartment building.</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I witnessed the two of them entering the same apartment, and I let out a dumbfounded sound.</p>

<p>I couldn't move a step from the telephone pole, my legs feels numb and unresponsive. (TL: Why always telephone pole?)</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>After waiting for a while, I went to check the mailboxes in the apartment building.</p>

<p>I saw a mailbox with &quot;203 Hoshimiya&quot; written on it.</p>

<p>&quot;So they're... living together after all...&quot;</p>

<p>I had a vague feeling that it might be the case.</p>

<p>After all, I walked the same route to school as Riku-chan every morning, but I never once saw him. And after school, the two of them would leave the classroom together.</p>

<p>I followed them to confirm this as well.</p>

<p>&quot;But... maybe it's just a coincidence, just for today...&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps Riku-chan happened to visit Ayana-chan's house only today.</p>

<p>Believing in reason that it's only convenient to me. I continued to wait for Riku-chan to come out until the sun set, not moving a step from near the telephone pole, staring intently at Ayana-chan's door.</p>

<p>Several hours passed, and before I knew it, darkness had enveloped the surroundings.</p>

<p>I checked the time on my smartphone, and it displayed 9 PM.</p>

<p>Still, I didn't go home. I was determined to wait for Ayana-chan's door to open.</p>

<p>But there was no sign of it opening at all.</p>

<p>I received a message from my mother on my phone, expressing her concern about me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Riku-chan... Are you living together with Ayana-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>I asked Riku-chan, who should be in Ayana-chan's room.</p>

<p>&quot;Being alone together at this hour...? What are you two doing right now? Even if you we're in a relationship, this kind of thing... it's not right.&quot;</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;You told me you liked me.</p>

<p>In the next moment, my vision blurred. Something hot gathered in my eyes, and a tear rolled down my cheek.</p>

<p>Tears were overflowing.</p>

<p>&quot;Why... why am I crying?&quot;</p>

<p>I wiped away the tears with my hand.</p>

<p>No matter how much I wiped, the tears kept flowing.</p>

<p>Like a breaking dam, once the wall's broke, water will never stop flowing.</p>

<p>&quot;........!&quot;</p>

<p>The presence that was by my side starts to blur.</p>

<p>A sense of loss.</p>

<p>The person who's always been beside of me, the person who always acknowledge me.</p>

<p>That person has gone far away.</p>

<p>&quot;A-ah... no... no!&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, I feel the weight of what I've lost.</p>

<p>Riku-chan being by my side was a given.</p>

<p>I never doubted that.</p>

<p>Because we've been childhood friends, I thought we would always be together...</p>

<p>Unconsciously, I convinced myself of that and didn't think about anything else.</p>

<p>Being together because we're childhood friends... No, it's not like that.</p>

<p>&quot;I, I want to be with Riku-chan myself.&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing Riku-chan getting along with Ayana-chan, I finally realize.</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;I want to be his special someone, just me.</p>

<p>&quot;I... I liked Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>I've been granted that will be always with Riku-chan.</p>

<p>No, Riku-chan was always like that. He's always been by my side.</p>

<p>But I taken it too lightly.</p>

<p>With tears streaming down my face, I make a firm resolve.</p>

<p>&quot;I won't give up. I won't let this be the end.&quot;</p>

<p>I wipe away my tears and take a deep breath.</p>

<p>From this moment on, I will confront my feelings and take action.</p>

<p>I won't let Riku-chan slip away without a fight.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll confess my feelings to him. I'll tell him how much he means to me.&quot;</p>

<p>The determination in my voice gives me strength.</p>

<p>I stand up from the spot where I've been watching, my eyes focused on the apartment where Riku-chan and Ayana-chan are.</p>

<p>No matter what obstacles lie ahead, I will face them head-on.</p>

<p>Because I finally understand the depth of my feelings for Riku-chan.</p>

<p>And I won't let her get him without a fight.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>While looking at triangular shape pink fabric with small ribbon as if like a single sakura blooming, though it's not something you can see often, but you can often see them when you glimpse at woman's skirt.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you staring at so intently?!&quot;</p>

<p>Pow! My head was hit. Surprisingly, it made a satisfying sound, even though it was my own head...</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Kuromine! I'm seriously gonna hit you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You already hit me though?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the next one won't be like that!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>I was scolded with such force that I obediently lowered my head.</p>

<p>No, this was an accident. I didn't intentionally look.</p>

<p>After returning home with Hoshimiya, we spent the time lazily, without any particular activities.</p>

<p>Then, around 9 p.m., I could hear the sound of rain starting to fall from outside.</p>

<p>Noticing the clothes left hanging on the balcony, I hurriedly collected them, and in my right hand, I found a pair of panties clenched tightly.</p>

<p>&quot;Give it back already!&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya, who had completely lost her temper, forcefully snatched away the panties...</p>

<p>&quot;Listen, Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...What?&quot;</p>

<p>She glared at me sharply. Scary!</p>

<p>&quot;Well, Hoshimiya, when a man and a woman live together, I think there's nothing we can do for this kind accidents to happen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But there's no need to stare so intently, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, you're staying silent? That's why boys are...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if we're going to start talking like that, Hoshimiya, you were staring at my boxers shorts too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;T-That's because... I was doing the laundry and ironing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you were pulling and stretching them, playing around, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why are you staying silent?&quot;</p>

<p>As if protecting herself from my gaze, Hoshimiya bowed her head and tightly held her own panties in both hands.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-It's fine, really. You're a guy, after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that gender discrimination?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;B-But! Kuromine, you wouldn't mind if I touched your boxers, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it was definitely embarrassing, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But well, since Hoshimiya is fine with it, I thought I didn't need to mind too much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see... Uhm, well, from now on, maybe we should discuss various things, including matters like this.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya was right. While we had established roles and rules for our life together, we had been avoiding discussions that would make us conscious of our genders, like the situation we just experienced.</p>

<p>Part of it was because we had been considerate of each other, but perhaps due to getting accustomed to this lifestyle, we had let our guard down a little. It was the first time I had touched Hoshimiya's underwear so boldly.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, how long should I stay here?&quot;</p>

<p>I suddenly remembered that we hadn't decided on such matters.</p>

<p>&quot;It depends on the stalker, right?... Do you still want to live with me, Kuromine? Or... do you not want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>It would be sad if I said I didn't want to... Her anxious expression conveyed such feelings. I wondered how I should answer.</p>

<p>Personally, I wanted to continue this current life together. That's what I thought.</p>

<p>But what about Hoshimiya? She didn't show any signs of hesitation to live with me, but I still didn't know her true feelings.</p>

<p>Moreover, I still didn't know who Hoshimiya liked. It seemed like she herself wasn't aware of her romantic feelings either. Well, the person she likes seems to be me as Kana mentioned.</p>

<p>But it's better not to jump to conclusions until I confirm it with her.</p>

<p>What if Hoshimiya's crush is... &quot;Eh? The person I like? It's Hori-kun from the next class! He's handsome and the ace of the soccer club, it's great, right?&quot;</p>

<p>............</p>

<p>I wish that handsome soccer player would just disappear. Well, I understand that he's cool and all.</p>

<p>BTW, Horikawa is a fictional guy in my imagination.</p>

<p>&quot;If you don't want to live with me, just let me know. I don't want to tie you down after all...&quot; Hoshimiya said.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't mind. I want to live here with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Delicious food comes out, and you're very kind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You sound like a pet. Your statement is at the pet level.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I was joking. Living with Hoshimiya is actually quite enjoyable.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-Is that so... Living with me is enjoyable... Hehe.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya couldn't help but smile happily. Sh-She's so cute...</p>

<p>As I watched Hoshimiya, feeling my heart pounding, the ringtone from my phone in my pants pocket suddenly rang. I took it out and checked the screen. It was a call from Haruno's mother.</p>

<p>What could it be? It's quite rare for a call to come from Haruno's mother.</p>

<p>Curiously, I tapped the answer button.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello?&quot; (TL: Actually '&#12393;&#12358;&#12373;&#12428;&#12414;&#12375;&#12383;&#12363;?' means &quot;What's up&quot; or &quot;What's the matter&quot; but it's kinda impolite if I used those words comparing to the Riku's words. So I decided to delete them. Let me know how make those words more polite.)</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-kun? Is Haruno there with you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno? I'm not at home right now... I'm not with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Haruno hasn't come back yet. I can't contact her either...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's almost 10 o'clock. Still not back...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've contacted Haruno's friends too, but no one seems to know... I wonder where she went.&quot;</p>

<p>The tension was rising. Could she have been involved in some kind of incident?</p>

<p>Just thinking about it sent a chilling sensation through my veins.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you, Riku-kun. I'm going to the police to report it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay...&quot;</p>

<p>Even after ending the call, my heart was restless. I couldn't help but worry. Lately, I hadn't talked to Haruno at all. That's why I couldn't help but wonder what she was up to.</p>

<p>Basically, I feel anxious when Haruno isn't by my side.</p>

<p>Recently, my life with Hoshimiya has been fulfilling, and I hadn't felt such anxiety... but now...</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno still hasn't returned home. It seems she's not at her friend's place either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That can't be... It's raining quite heavily outside.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Sorry, I'll be right back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you going to look for Harukaze-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think I'll find her running around by myself... But I'll still go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. But I think you should postpone it for now.... Oh! that umbrella, use it. Be careful, Okay.&quot;</p>

<p>I said &quot;Thank you&quot; and hurriedly made my way to the entrance.</p>

<p>I grabbed the umbrella and swung open the door, rushing outside.</p>

<p>It was darker than I had expected, making it difficult to gauge the intensity of the rain.</p>

<p>However, the sound of rain pounding on the roof of the bicycle parking area indicated that it was quite strong. It would be painful if it directly hit my skin.</p>

<p>&quot;It's raining like this. I don't think she'd be outside, but...&quot;</p>

<p>Was she at some store, or perhaps at the house of a friend, that her mother didn't know about?</p>

<p>As the worst-case scenario, could she have been involved in some kind of incident?</p>

<p>&quot;...!&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't shake off the unpleasant thoughts. If, if... something happened to Haruno...!</p>

<p>I leap down the apartment stairs. While having umbrella in my hand, I started running without caring if my feet got wet.</p>

<p>My shoes were soaked, and water seeped into my socks... But that didn't matter.</p>

<p>First, I would take the train to Haruno's neighborhood.</p>

<p>Then, I would systematically search through the places I had in mind...</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>As I sprinted, jumping over puddles and running along the side of the road, I witnessed a peculiar sight.</p>

<p>Underneath a lamppost, someone was sitting. A person huddling her knees drawn close to her body.</p>

<p>The lighting was dim, making it difficult to see clearly, but the aura gave off a feminine vibe.</p>

<p>However, her presence was so faint that it almost seemed like a ghost.</p>

<p>It was not normal for someone to be sitting alone like this on a rainy night.</p>

<p>Under normal circumstances, I might have approached and initiated a conversation. But now, Haruno took priority.</p>

<p>I kept running without stopping, briefly glancing at the person, and... I almost tripped as my feet got tangled.</p>

<p>&quot;H-Haruno!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>Sitting beneath the lamppost, exposed to the rain without any defense, was someone familiar to me from childhood.</p>

<p>Of course, Haruno was completely drenched. Her hair clung tightly to her head, and her uniform, soaked with water, looking heavy. But above all, it's her eyes.</p>

<p>The once sparkling and bright eyes were now clouded, like murky glass balls. She had the gaze of the dead, eyes of a dead person.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno... What... What are you doing here? What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder... What am I doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno!&quot;</p>

<p>I knelt before Haruno and firmly grabbed her shoulders.</p>

<p>They were incredibly cold, and I could feel a faint tremor.</p>

<p>Realizing the urgency of the situation, I held the umbrella over Haruno's head.</p>

<p>The rain were like shotgun pellets, shooting down on my body.</p>

<p>The pain was so intense that my face contorted, but I couldn't afford to worry about that now.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, you're getting wet.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care about that! What about you, Haruno? What are you doing here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... I wonder what I'm doing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did something happen?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you could call it that... Maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno?&quot;</p>

<p>Then she stared at me intently, her bluish-purple lips, began to speak. (TL: Circumoral cyanosis is when only your mouth or lips turn blue. It often occurs when your blood vessels shrink in response to cold temperatures.)</p>

<p>&quot;Today, I realized many things... and I've been thinking about a lot of things...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Okay, Okay... But for now, let's find a place with a roof...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, are you happy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Being with Ayana-chan... Are you happy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh... What do you mean?&quot;</p>

<p>I truly didn't understand. I didn't understand the meaning behind that question or its intention.</p>

<p>Everything was so unclear.</p>

<p>&quot;At first, I thought... If Riku-chan still liked me, then... that would mean your gonna ignore your own feelings, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry for saying something so awful... I'm sorry for saying, I don't see you as opposite sex... If I were in your position, I might even... die...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>How powerless those words were, filled with such conviction.</p>

<p>Were the drops flowing from Haruno's eyes rain or tears, I wondered.</p>

<p>&quot;...If being with Ayana-chan makes you happy... then forget about me... Please...&quot;</p>

<p>In a fleeting voice, Haruno spoke those words and slowly closed her eyelids.</p>

<p>And in the next moment... her consciousness faded away, and her limp body slumped down.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno? Pull yourself together! Haruno!&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Haruno didn't respond...</p>

<p>Only the sound of umbrella in rain echoed.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>I left the umbrella behind and I carried Haruno on my back and sprinted with all my might to Hoshimiya's apartment.</p>

<p> I didn't have the time to bring it back now.</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya! Haruno, Haruno...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What's wrong... Harukaze-san!?&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing us appear at the entrance, drenched from head to toe, Hoshimiya raised her voice in surprise.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno was near the apartment! And... sitting in the rain!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, calm down. We need to warm up Harukaze-san's body now. I'll bring a towel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes! Please!&quot;</p>

<p>After watching Hoshimiya rush into the bathroom, I sat Haruno in the hallway and leaned her against the wall.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, are you okay!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Mmm?&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's eyelids opened faintly. It seemed like she couldn't grasp the situation, as her gaze wandered aimlessly. Nonetheless, I felt relieved that she regained consciousness.</p>

<p>&quot;Thank God! I was worried you wouldn't wake up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where is this?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hoshimiya's house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Ayana-chan's house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I brought a bath towel... Oh, you noticed, Harukaze-san.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Ayana-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First, it might be a good idea for her to take a bath. She might catch a cold if we leave her like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yeah! Haruno, let's get your clothes off!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&#9472;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>If we leave Haruno like this, she might catch a cold.</p>

<p>A cold is a scary illness. We need to do something quickly!</p>

<p>I placed my hand on the uniform Haruno was wearing and hurriedly unbuttoned it.</p>

<p>&quot;K-Kuromine-kun!? What are you doing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;R-Riku-chan's ecchi!&quot;</p>

<p>...Huh?</p>

<p>Hearing the panicked voices of the two, I finally understood what I was doing.</p>

<p>I had already unbuttoned a few buttons of her shirt, exposing Haruno's chest.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop it! Kuromine-kun, stop it! Taking advantage of a weakened girl like this...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-It's not like that! Hoshimiya said to take a bath!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She might have said that, but there's no need to undress her here! And, Kuromine-kun, you don't need to undress her!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um, her clothes are wet, so it would be better to take them off quickly... Wait, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>I had already lost track of what I was saying and what I was getting flustered about.</p>

<p>&quot;...Riku-chan, you're way too flustered...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're always been like this... Whenever I slightly feel unwell... You always end up crying and doing strange things...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>All I could do was apologize. There's no one else but Haruno for me.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/embed0011_HD.jpg">

<p>&quot;It might sound like an excuse, but I can't forget the fear of losing my family.&quot;</p>

<p>And now it feels like I might lose Haruno too.</p>

<p>&quot;Harukaze-san, can you stand up?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah. I'm a bit dizzy, though.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah then, let me support you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun, wait in the room. Consider it an order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Hoshimiya. I'll take care of Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Standby!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll also&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sit!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Like a scolded dog by its owner, I slumped and sat in place. There was an incredible aura about Hoshimiya right now. It's hard to put into words, but she was dependable.</p>

<p>Besides, in my current state of minor panic, I can't help Haruno. I'll leave it to Hoshimiya this time.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>As Hoshimiya instructed me to do, I quietly wait in the room.</p>

<p>I wiped my head and body with a towel, changed into comfortable clothes, and sat down near the table.</p>

<p>It seems Hoshimiya and Haruno are taking a bath together.</p>

<p>&quot;Will you come to pick her up tomorrow morning?&quot;</p>

<p>I just called Haruno's parents a while ago and explained the situation.</p>

<p>That I'm staying at Hoshimiya's house and that Haruno was sitting near the apartment. Haruno's mother said she would come to pick her up immediately, but I reflexively said, &quot;Please wait.&quot; I don't want not to be separated with Haruno right now, and I thought, we need to talk about something.</p>

<p>Haruno's mother hesitated, considering the circumstances, but she eventually agreed.</p>

<p>She seemed to have sensed something with the situation.</p>

<p>So it was decided that Haruno will stay at Hoshimiya's house tonight.</p>

<p>&quot;Those two, I wonder what's their intention.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, considering the current time, it might be realistic for Haruno to stay overnight. Hoshimiya would probably agree, too.</p>

<p>I could hear the cheerful conversation between the girls coming from the bathroom. It seems they finished bathing.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Riku-chan has some dog-like traits.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right! Like giving a paw or sitting...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you giving him proper rewards? If you don't, Riku-chan might get upset.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I forgot. I need to buy some treats for rewards next time.&quot;</p>

<p>........ I beg you, Please respect me as a human.</p>

<p>&quot;Phew, that feels great.&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya enters the room, letting out a pleasant-sounding voice.</p>

<p>Her face, illuminated after coming out of the bath, with her long hair untied...</p>

<p>The pink pajamas is still same as always but her gal mode has completely faded, and returned to being a natural beautiful girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan, thanks for the clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno appears from behind Hoshimiya, wearing my sweatshirt.</p>

<p>Since it doesn't fit properly, her hands don't come out of the sleeves, and it's loose overall. And I like it that way.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, are you feeling okay now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. My head feels a bit fuzzy... but it's not too bad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... Don't push yourself, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you feel even slightly unwell, tell me immediately, okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you really okay? Are you not pushing yourself too hard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're being so persistent, Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>I ended up being too annoying and made an expression of exasperation.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun really likes Harukaze-san, huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... when you put it that way so directly... I don't know...&quot;</p>

<p>Unable to deny it, I scratch my head in embarrassment.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, right. I need to contact my mom... She's probably worried.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I already called. I told her that Haruno will stay here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...That's one-sided, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish you had at least informed the host of the room, me.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm being criticized by the girls. I'm being scolded normally.</p>

<p>But even so, I feel like it would be different to send Haruno home in her current state.</p>

<p>I haven't asked why she was there...</p>

<p>&quot;Then I guess I'll sleep to Chiharu-san's room tonight. You two can sleep in my room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it fine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it's fine. You two probably have a lot to talk about. I'll just be in the way.&quot;</p>

<p>I don't really think she would be in the way, but she's right. We need to have a calm conversation.</p>

<p>Then Hoshimiya approaches me and whispers in my ear.</p>

<p>&quot;Good luck.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya had a meaningful... no, it seemed like she forced a faint smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's up to you two now.&quot;</p>

<p>She waved her hand lightly and left the room.</p>

<p>The sound of the front door closing echoed.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Left in the room, neither I nor Haruno spoke.</p>

<p>We averted our gazes from each other, staring at the walls, floor, and at the ceiling.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, um... I'll also call my mom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, that's a good idea.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno picked up her smartphone and started making a call.</p>

<p>Hearing the pieces of the conversation, it seemed like Haruno was being scolded.</p>

<p>She repeatedly bowed her head apologetically, as if her mother were right in front of her.</p>

<p>&quot;Haha... I got scolded a lot.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno let out a wry smile after ending the call.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course. Your mom probably went to the police to report you missing, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, she was about to start a search... I'm causing trouble for so many people.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I don't think you need to blame yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it's true that I caused trouble, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not trouble, it's worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're right...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, why were you in that place?&quot;</p>

<p>I stared into Haruno's eyes and asked straightforwardly.</p>

<p>&quot;I was... following you, two.&quot;</p>

<p>As I thought. There was no other explanation. The question now is, why's she following us.</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I saw you getting along with Ayana-chan... it made me really irritated.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-Irritated...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;At first, I didn't know why I was getting irritated, and I didn't even realize I was feeling that way. But I understway it now.&quot;</p>

<p>As she said that, Haruno closed the distance between us.</p>

<p>She sat down in front of me, who was sitting on the floor, and spoke those words clearly.</p>

<p>&quot;I... I like you, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not in a childhood friend kind of way. I mean... I like you as a man.&quot;</p>

<p>--- I... I like you, Riku.</p>

<p>--- Not as childhood friends. I mean... I like you as a man.</p>

<p>Haruno's words repeated in my head over and over again.</p>

<p>I wasn't surprised, I wasn't happy, I was just dumbfounded.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>In Hoshimiya's room, where silence reigned, only the sound of rain could be heard.</p>

<p>In the space where only Haruno and I were present, I understood the meaning of her words, but my thoughts were in mess, and I couldn't say anything back.</p>

<p>&quot;It's troubling even if I told you that suddenly. After all, you're dating Ayana-chan now, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're... not dating.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't have to lie. You said you were dating, didn't you? And living together... It's hard to believe you're not dating.&quot;</p>

<p>While what she said made sense, we truly weren't dating. There were complicated circumstances behind it.</p>

<p>I was contemplating how to explain that, but Haruno took the initiative.</p>

<p>&quot;I like you, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When I saw you getting along with other girls, it finally hit me. I felt incredibly irritated. I mean, I was so frustrated that I could cry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the past, I thought that I was concerned about you because we were childhood friends. We've always been together... and I unconsciously thought that we would continue to be together, as if it were natural.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... I thought the same.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you felt that way too. But I... didn't understand it. At first I thought, I just wanted to be with you because were childhood friends, regardless of being with opposite sex.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno, who had spoken up until that point, continued her words.</p>

<p>&quot;It's not because we're childhood friends that I'm concerned about you, but because it's you, Riku.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That means...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. As the opposite sex, I like you.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno stared straight into my eyes and expressed her feelings once again with the word &quot;like.&quot;</p>

<p>I couldn't tell if this was reality.</p>

<p>Could it be that I'm dreaming? That thought crossed my mind.</p>

<p>&quot;So, when you saw me getting along with Hoshimiya, that's when you became aware of your feelings?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... Seeing you and Ayana-chan getting along... No, that was just the trigger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The trigger?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I finally understood when I saw you entering Ayana-chan's house... When you went far away. After you weren't by my side anymore, I realized that I liked you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's how it was...&quot;</p>

<p>I agreed with Haruno. Indeed, there are things that we only realize after losing them.</p>

<p>It's not tangible objects but rather the intangible emotions that reside in the human heart.</p>

<p>It's natural to have someone important by your side.</p>

<p>Can people who live their everyday lives like that imagine one day suddenly losing someone important to them? Absolutely not.</p>

<p>&quot;I also think Riku-chan is a little at fault.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because, Riku-chan, you never showed any interest in other girls besides me. I couldn't understand that. We've always lived in our own world together...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's true, but...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think I've liked you even before I knew what it meant to have feelings of love.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;-!&quot;</p>

<p>I swallowed my breath. Haruno's words were calm and spoking the truth.</p>

<p>&quot;It's too late to realize it after losing you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know when I started liking you. We used to take baths together and sleep together since we were in first grade.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Right.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can't explain it well, but it was natural for me to like you. So, I didn't have the chance to become aware of it... Besides, you never talked to other girls, so there was no opportunity for me to feel jealous...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno mumbled, as if making excuses.</p>

<p>In the past, I didn't need anything besides Haruno. I had no interest in any other woman except her.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm such a terrible person, aren't I? I ended up hurting you and having this conversation in your girlfriend's room...&quot;</p>

<p>She seemed to blame herself. Upon closer look, her eyes were blooming in tears.</p>

<p>&quot;The truth is, no matter what, I want to be by your side and be the special person only for you. I don't want Ayana to... take you away from me!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if you're already in a relationship... if you chose Ayana... then I have no choice but to endure it...&quot;</p>

<p>She was clearly forcing herself.</p>

<p>She kept her eyes downcast, staring at the floor, and tightly gripping her left arm with her right hand.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, Hoshimiya and I are not dating.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Are you still lying? Is this some kind of revenge because I rejected you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not that. I really am not dating anyone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then why are you staying at Ayana-chan's house?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if I explain... it'll take a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me.&quot;</p>

<p>Under Haruno's unwavering gaze, I hesitated but eventually decided to tell her. I told her about the day she rejected me and how I went to the mountains to commit suicide. I mentioned stopping at a convenience store on the way, where I saved Ayana from a robber. I told her about Ayana crying and begging me not to commit suicide, about staying at Ayana's house, about lying in the classroom to protect Ayana's honor by pretending we were dating. And I revealed that Ayana was being stalked and asked for my help...</p>

<p>&quot;I heard everything, everything.</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno hung her head and kept her mouth tightly shut.</p>

<p>When Haruno heard about my contemplation of suicide, her face twisted, and she seemed on the verge of tears. She must be organizing her thoughts in her mind now.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, you don't have to worry about my suicide. It's already over...&quot;</p>

<p>Saying that, I muttered softly, but Haruno whispered quietly, &quot;I do worry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... I worry! Of course, I worry!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno stood up forcefully, shouting as if she were about to cough up blood.</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno, your voice is so loud...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When you were left all alone, I thought to myself, 'What can I do for you? How can I heal your heart?' And yet, it was me... I pushed you into a corner! I can't help but worry about that!&quot;</p>

<p>As Haruno screamed with all her emotions, tears welled up in her eyes.</p>

<p>One by one, the overflowing tears streamed down her cheeks, reaching her chin.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the first time I've seen Haruno's cry like this.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if Riku-chan forgives me... I can't forgive myself...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you look at the results, I'm alive, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It doesn't matter! If Ayana-chan wasn't there... Riku-chan, you would have died! I killed you!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;C-Calm down!&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno's desperation continued to rise. I stood up and tried to console her somehow.</p>

<p>&quot;I've had enough! I... I should have died!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno!&quot;</p>

<p>Facing my childhood friend who was crying and distraught, I impulsively hugged her tightly.</p>

<p>Haruno struggled and squirmed in my arms, but gradually regained her sanity.</p>

<p>&quot;............Riku-chan?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't talk about dying, please.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, I truly felt relieved that I didn't go through with suicide. If I had died, there was no doubt that Haruno would have followed suit.</p>

<p>&quot;If the person you love dies, how can you continue living with what face?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Riku-chan, you... can't say that about others either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is. But I'm saying it because I loved you, Haruno.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...I love you too, Riku-chan. Most of my life spent with you...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>After commotion, a very quiet moment flowed.</p>

<p>Haruno, who was being embraced by me, looked at my face with feverish eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;Riku-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Haruno...&quot;</p>

<p>Calling each other's names seemed to be a signal.</p>

<p>Haruno closed her eyes and tilted her chin slightly.</p>

<p>I intuitively understood what she was seeking.</p>

<p>As I leaned closer to bring our lips together--</p>

<p><i>'...Kuromine-kun.'</i></p>

<p>&quot;...Hoshimiya?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Just before our lips met, my movement came to a halt. Haruno, who opened her eyes, looked bewildered.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no... I just... thought of Hoshimiya... Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see... So, that's it after all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No, that's not it. What is this... I'm sorry.&quot; I tried to explain but it just make me more look ridiculous.</p>

<p>Understanding that fact, I became speechless.</p>

<p>What kind of sarcasm would I receive from Haruno after ruining the timing?</p>

<p>However, Haruno had a smile of compassion that seemed to reassures everything.</p>

<p>&quot;It's okay, Riku-chan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Haruno?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've fallen for Ayana-chan too, haven't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you, Riku-chan. I love you so much, and you occupy most of my life. So... I still want you to be happy the most.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Um... so, what does that mean?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If Riku-chan chooses Ayana-chan... I'll accept it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;............&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course, it will frustrate me and I'll be incredibly jealous if you two get along well.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno repeated her words, saying, &quot;Because I'm a self-centered girl.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's no need to give me an immediate answer. You're still staying at Ayana-chan's house, right? While you two live together... Hey, Riku-chan, do you really need to share the same room? Isn't a doghouse enough for you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why a doghouse? That's human abuse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well... I just don't want you to be with other girls.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno traced a '&#12398;' character on my chest with her fingertip. Her sulking childishness was adorable. (TL: &#12398; &quot;No&quot;)</p>

<p>Even so, suggesting a doghouse is strange.</p>

<p>&quot;I think I'll feel jealous many times from now on. Just imagining it makes me feel awful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Imagining what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Seeing you talking to other girls, besides me.&quot;</p>

<p>As she said it herself, she already said she's self-centered after all. Just me talking to someone else will mostly bother her.</p>

<p>&quot;I've never even imagined it before. But still, I prioritize your happiness the most...&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno is considering me even while consumed by jealousy.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll confirm once again, but Riku-chan isn't dating Ayana-chan, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you do like Ayana-chan...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, probably...&quot;</p>

<p>Hoshimiya is the person who saved my life.</p>

<p>Haruno is the person who supported my life.</p>

<p>...I can't imagine choosing one over the other.</p>

<p>Or rather, I don't feel like I'm in a position to choose a girl.</p>

<p>&quot;Until Riku-chan finds an answer... I'll wait.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you'll still feel jealous, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Haruno responded immediately. While she waits for an answer, her possessiveness remains intact... It's somewhat skillful mindset.</p>

<p>But well, by expressing our true feelings to each other like this, it feels like the tension has been relieved.</p>

<p>One could say it's a step forward.</p>

<p>&quot;If Riku-chan chooses Ayana-chan, I won't hold a grudge... But I'll get angry, cry, and probably be incredibly jealous every day.&quot;</p>

<p>...Isn't that an indirect threat? It's scary.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>&quot;...Will they start dating?&quot;</p>

<p>After moving to Chiharu-san's room, I was convinced that Kuromine-kun and Harukaze-san would reconcile. I didn't know the details, but I could imagine why Harukaze-san was near the apartment. It was because I knew that Harukaze-san cared about Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>And, of course, Kuromine-kun also cared about Harukaze-san...</p>

<p>Without a doubt, if they had a chance to talk things through, the distance between them would shrink.</p>

<p>Knowing that, I left my own home.</p>

<p>&quot;....!&quot;</p>

<p>A sharp pain pierced my chest. I wondered why.</p>

<p>When I left Kuromine-kun and Harukaze-san alone, it felt really unpleasant.</p>

<p>...No, I had started to understand it faintly from before.</p>

<p>I had started to understand, but deep down in my mind, I knew it was an unattainable feeling, so I pretended not to know.</p>

<p>&quot;...Sigh.&quot;</p>

<p>I let out a sigh and looked around Chiharu-san's room.</p>

<p>It was so cluttered that there was barely any space to walk. Trash bags and strange objects were scattered around.</p>

<p>I was forced to sit in a corner of the room, cross-legged.</p>

<p>By the way, Chiharu-san was fast asleep, surrounded by several empty beer cans and covered with a futon.</p>

<p>&quot;Kuromine-kun and Harukaze-san dating... That would be the best. They suit each other... Besides, someone like me...&quot;</p>

<p>I recalled the memories of my life with Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>I had finally gotten used to this life and had a sense of anticipation for the future.</p>

<p>But now, it was all coming to an end.</p>

<p>No matter how much I was troubled by the stalker, it wasn't right to let a boy with a girlfriend stay over at my house.</p>

<p>I gritted my teeth and desperately held back my tears.</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh... This is for the best...&quot;</p>

<p>I wonder if it's still possible to deceive my own emotions.</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;I also like Kuromine-kun.</p>

<p>I realized that my first love immediately experienced heartbreak.</p>
