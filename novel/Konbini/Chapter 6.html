<h2>Chapter 6: Heading in the Opposite Direction Towards Hope!!</h2>

<p>&quot;I wonder if Riku will really come.&quot;</p>

<p>I checked the time and sighed.</p>

<p>&quot;I have no choice but to go to Ayana's place alone...&quot; As I waited in front of the ticket gate at the station.</p>

<p>I don't know what happened those two. But that doesn't matter. Just because I don't know doesn't mean I want to abandon my important friend.</p>

<p>And Riku's reaction... I think something unimaginable happened to me. I guess I'll just have to find something on my own .</p>

<p>Just as I gave up on Riku and started walking...</p>

<p>&quot;Kana! Wait!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Eh... Riku, you came&#9472;&#9472;&quot;</p>

<p>I turned around and Riku was sweating as if he had just taken a shower.</p>

<p>&quot;You're gross. Why are you sweating like that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I... I ran here... Overslept. It's too early in the morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Overslept, huh... Well, whatever.&quot;</p>

<p>Riku caught his breath and walked up to me.</p>

<p>Somehow... Somehow, I felt a different atmosphere than before.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, shall we go, Kana?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Did something change?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you noticed? I just trimmed my bangs a little.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care, and it's not about that... The previous you we're like, there's someone behind you. But now it feels like your walking on your own.&quot;</p>

<p>As I said that, Riku showed a slight sign of thinking and then exclaimed as if he had just realized something.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah... Today, I feel like my mind were clearest than ever been. I feel refreshed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, really?&quot;</p>

<p>There was no lie in those words. Riku's face is truly brightened.</p>

<p>It was as if his heavy burden had been lifted.</p>

<p>We passed through the ticket gate and headed towards the platform. Just then, a train arrived.</p>

<p>After some time staring at train, Riku said....</p>

<p>&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;I can't take this anymore, I want to die.</p> (TL: From the Chapter 1.)

<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>

<p>Wait, don't tell me he's going to jump...</p>

<p>&quot;There was a time when I said such things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are you talking about? Don't joke around.&quot;</p>

<p>Even though I glared at him lightly, Riku seemed unfazed. What's with this guy?</p>

<p>But as Riku walked towards the train, he had a determined look on his face.</p>

<p>He walked with confidence, and there was no trace of hesitation in his demeanor.</p>

<p>&quot;Kana.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's go pick up Hoshimiya.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh... Mmn...&quot; I nodded.</p>

<p>Riku, with his clear eyes, said it to me directly, and I was slightly taken aback.</p>

<p>I felt a sense of strength from him, as if he had found a clear purpose.</p>

<p>...He's a different person from when I last met him.</p>

<p>I don't know what happened between Ayana and Riku.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm not supposed to know.</p>

<p>However, from the current Riku, I felt like I could entrust everything to him...</p>

<p>He had that kind of reliability.</p>

<p>And so, Riku boarded the train, and the doors closed... Ah!</p>

<p>&quot;Riku! Wait! That... it's the wrong train! It's going in the opposite direction!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Riku turned around quickly. Through the doors, we locked eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;H-Hey, aren you idiot!? Why did you get on the wrong train...!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;N-No! Based on the atmosphere, I thought this was the right train... Ah.&quot;</p>

<p>Heartlessly, the train departed, taking Riku to an unfamiliar place...</p>

<p>.........</p>

<p>&quot;Sigh... Maybe he really can't handle it after all.&quot;</p>
