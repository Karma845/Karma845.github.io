<h3>Chapter 8: The School Festival Day</h3>

<p class="calibre3">Finally, the day of the cultural festival arrived.</p><p class="calibre3">We gathered at the school early in the morning, and in our classroom, everyone started preparing.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, Rei wasn't there in the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">(She said she had a great idea, but...)</p><p class="calibre3">I have a bad feeling about this.</p><p class="calibre3">I usually think of Otosaki Rei as a smart person, but that's only for her "usual" self. It doesn't account for impulsive actions driven by desire.</p><p class="calibre3">I hope she doesn't do something crazy&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro! Let's try on the costumes!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? Yeah......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Called by Yukio, I head to where the costumes are.</p><p class="calibre3">There are only six costumes, three for the performance, and the other three as spares in case they don't fit.</p><p class="calibre3">The remaining costumes are available for anyone with free time to wear and promote around the festival.</p><p class="calibre3">The girls have a similar arrangement too.</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, You're on duty today too, Shidou?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I'm scheduled for the third shift." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">A classmate in charge of the costume notices me and approaches, then takes one look at my height, and hands me one of the costumes.</p><p class="calibre3">"You aren't over 180 cm, right, Shidou?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I'm not that tall." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, it's still taller than average, so try it on with the L size."</p><p class="calibre3">"Got it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I put on the handed L-sized jacket, it fit me perfectly.</p><p class="calibre3">When I buy casual clothes, I usually go for the L size, so this should be fine as it is.</p><p class="calibre3">"If the jacket fits, then it's all good. As for the inside, wear your own shirt, and put on the bow tie and the pants that are here."</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I'll wear this in four hours from the start of the school festival.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm assigned to be in charge of the hall on the last shift of the day's schedule, which has three two-hour shifts.</p><p class="calibre3">I requested this shift because it's expected that there will be fewer customers.</p><p class="calibre3">Based on last year's trend, most of the public customers are contented with the morning shift and go home.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, visible changes can't be expected, but there's another reason why I chose this time.</p><p class="calibre3">"The third shift, huh... I'm jealous. The first and third shifts overlap with the street dance club's stage time."</p><p class="calibre3">"Haha, I'm glad I won at rock-paper-scissors." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Outwardly, I appear cheerful. Inwardly, I smirk.</p><p class="calibre3">Our school has a street dance club where male and female students engage in various dance styles.</p><p class="calibre3">Their stage performance is of high quality, attracting many spectators, including students and the public, every year.</p><p class="calibre3">As a result, during their performance time, there are fewer customers for other performances. It's natural for people to gather for scheduled performances, unlike stores that can be visited anytime.</p><p class="calibre3">Understanding this, those of us not particularly enthusiastic about cosplaying have no reason not to aim for that shift.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, as I'm not the type who enjoys standing in front of people in a butler's outfit, it's more convenient for me to be seen as little as possible.</p><p class="calibre3">Having won a game of luck (rock-paper-scissors) against other rivals targeting those specific shifts, I managed to secure the desired shift.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Or so I thought.</p><p class="calibre3">"But the third one has Kakihara and Doumoto, right? I think they'll end up attracting more customers, won't they?"</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yeah, I think so." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Yeah, for some reason, I'm on the same shift as them.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though they're like the top-class popular students in the class hierarchy, for some reason, they're targeting this time slot, and for some reason, they even won the rock-paper-scissors game.</p><p class="calibre3">It's like they have absolute luck, or some kind of special advantage.</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, two good-looking guys, noticeably in butler's costume, greet the customers.</p><p class="calibre3">I've heard rumors that their fame has spread even to other schools, so it's not surprising that more people want to see them. Some might even come here after watching a street dance.</p><p class="calibre3">In short, my plan of taking it easy has gone down the drain.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro, did you finish fitting on the costume?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh... It's the guy with the LL-size." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Haha, what's with that nickname?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">With an unusually cheerful demeanor, Doumoto, accompanied by Kakihara, comes over to me.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto, who has a big build, is wearing a jacket one size larger than mine, and Kakihara, standing next to him, is in a jacket of the same size as mine, L.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro, for some reason, the girls are trying to fix my appearance a lot. Is today's me that bad?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara, looking anxious as he asks, looks just like your usual annoyingly good guy.</p><p class="calibre3">The reason why the girls around him are doing this is probably because they want to bring forth the ultimate butler.</p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe they want to perfect the ideal butler look because the material is good. Yuusuke-kun, you're just the same as always." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"A-am I? Hmm... well, if you say so." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">One of this guy's annoying traits is his lack of awareness of how superior he is.</p><p class="calibre3">But still, he's a million times better than those who act all high and mighty.</p><p class="calibre3">Kinjou, who was making advances on Rei, is a good example of that.</p><p class="calibre3">"......It's about the time." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara looks at the clock on the wall and states so.</p><p class="calibre3">In about ten minutes, it'll be time for the customers to enter. The first shift should already be ready and in position.</p><p class="calibre3">"Alright, everyone! Let's do our best again!"</p><p class="calibre3">"""YEAAAHHH!"""</p><p class="calibre3">And so, this year's school festival begins.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p><p class="calibre3">"...It's peaceful." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I mutter in a low voice as I walk around the school.</p><p class="calibre3">The density of the visitors is quite high. This school's festival has always had a good reputation, and you can see students from other schools here and there.</p><p class="calibre3">Because of that, I've witnessed some of our female students being hit on by students from other schools, but at the same time, our boys are also approaching girls from other schools, so it's in the same boat.</p><p class="calibre3">Teachers are patrolling, so if any trouble were to occur, they would handle it somehow.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well then.</p><p class="calibre3">"…It's boring, isn't it, Rintaro?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, it is." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I walk down the corridor with Yukio, having that conversation.</p><p class="calibre3">Yukio is planning to tour the festival with the girl tomorrow. After this, he will be working in the hall and in the kitchen, and tomorrow he will be completely free.</p><p class="calibre3">"Wanna grab a snack for now? I heard there's a place selling yakisoba outside." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I had a proper breakfast, you know." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"What about shaved ice then?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't that too much like a traditional fair?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, that seems to be the theme. It's being run by Class C." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Hmm―――― I realized as I said that, I was quite indifferent to what other classes were doing.</p><p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, I didn't even know what each class was presenting.</p><p class="calibre3">No wonder I was bored. After all, I had no goal.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, let's go check it out. Just looking around should kill some time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, sounds good." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">The two of us leave the school building, and outside, there are indeed several stalls set up, reminiscent of a festival.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's been years since I bought yakisoba outside. Kinda looking forward to it." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Yeah, you're right, I was about to say that, but I stopped myself.</p><p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, didn't I eat it at the pool with Kakihara and the others? Remembering the taste from that time, I suddenly felt a surge of hunger.</p><p class="calibre3">"…...I guess I'll have some too." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ooh, you're quite a glutton, aren't you." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"I can't compete with some blonde idol, though." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">It's no exaggeration to say that her appetite defied common sense.</p><p class="calibre3">Compared to her voracious appetite, mine was nothing.</p><p class="calibre3">[――――Hey, Is that true?]</p><p class="calibre3">"......Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">On the way to the food stalls, I involuntarily react to a voice I hear while passing by other customers.</p><p class="calibre3">[Isn't this the school where that Rei of the MilleSta goes? I saw it on the internet. She's definitely here somewhere.]</p><p class="calibre3">[But wouldn't that cause a commotion?]</p><p class="calibre3">[Who cares! Let's just go to her class for now!]</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well, some visitors are here for that reason.</p><p class="calibre3">I can understand the feeling of hoping to meet Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">But no matter how hard they try, since she didn't even come to school today, there's no way they can meet her.</p><p class="calibre3">What worries me is that there might be some annoying folks who will complain about just that.</p><p class="calibre3">Hopefully, we can get through this event without any trouble.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"Hmm, it's about time, isn't it?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">After checking the time on his smartphone, Yukio said so.</p><p class="calibre3">After all the back and forth we did, the two hours that I thought were long passed by in no time.</p><p class="calibre3">"What're you going to do after this, Rintaro?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I don't really have anything to do, so maybe I'll help out behind the scenes." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I-isn't that a little too sad?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"I just kidding... Anyway, let's go back to the classroom for now. I have to see you in your butler outfit." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh! When you say that, it makes me feel embarrassed..." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know why this guy is so fidgety, but if he feels embarrassed even a little, it's worth teasing him.</p><p class="calibre3">As we are about to head back to the classroom, a familiar guy walks in front of us.</p><p class="calibre3">This guy with his annoyingly thick blond hair and an unpleasant attitude is none other than Kinjou, who foolishly tried to hit on Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, they still haven't gathered?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry, sorry. They usually sleep until noon... but they'll be in here soon."</p><p class="calibre3">"If they don't come, I won't let them slide, I'm serious."</p><p class="calibre3">Kinjou, along with a rough-looking guy who seems like a public visitor, pass by us.</p><p class="calibre3">He gives off a delinquent vibe, but I hope he's the type of delinquent who would offer an umbrella to a stray cat on the roadside. It would be nice if he were the type to pick it up and keep it.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? What's wrong, Rintaro?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"......It's nothing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I have a vague sense of unease and can't help but worry, but it's not unusual for Kinjou to invite his friends.</p><p class="calibre3">In this situation, it's more rude of me to be wary based on my own preconceptions.</p><p class="calibre3">But――――there's nothing that hits as accurately as this bad premonition at times like this.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p><p class="calibre3">"How could this happen!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">In a partitioned break room inside the classroom, Yukio's voice echoes.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm also there as a related party, but I can't help but laugh at the scene in front of me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry! But the person in charge of promotions came out wearing the smallest size!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugh... I get the situation, but still." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">You probably figured it out from the conversation just now, but it seems that the butler outfit Yukio was supposed to wear has been taken by one of the people in charge of promotions.</p><p class="calibre3">We tried to contact him to return it, but so far, no response.</p><p class="calibre3">It's probably just a case of being too caught up in the school festival and not realizing it.</p><p class="calibre3">So, that's how it is.</p><p class="calibre3">Yukio has no choice but to wear another costume――――in other words, a maid outfit for girls.</p><p class="calibre3">The girls who have wished for him to wear it look somewhat amused as they watch Yukio, as he blushes and looks down in embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugh! Rintaro! You don't have to laugh so much either!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Haha, sorry sorry. It just suits you too well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Since there are classmates around, I respond in my usual nonchalant manner, and Yukio makes a slightly bewildered face.</p><p class="calibre3">In fact, Yukio, who was already known as being too cute for a boy, is now wearing an outfit that is heavily equipped with cuteness, called a maid outfit.</p><p class="calibre3">There's no way that wouldn't be charming.</p><p class="calibre3">If I hadn't known that this person was a boy, I might have been shaken by the blushing face from earlier.</p><p class="calibre3">"D-Does it really suit me...?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. It suits you incredibly well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're not lying, right?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">This guy, just because I'm in my nonchalant mode, is he doubting my words?</p><p class="calibre3">"There's no way I'd be lying. Everyone thinks so, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I ask the girls present, and they nod their heads in agreement.</p><p class="calibre3">I wink at Yukio for proof, and he seems to finally believe me and shows us a grin that we have never seen before.</p><p class="calibre3">"I-I see... Then, I guess it's okay." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I'm not really sure it's okay.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well then, Rintaro, I'm off!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Y-Yeah. Good luck." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know why he's so excited, but if he's having fun――――well, I guess it's fine.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing off Yukio, who is now all excited as he replaces the previous hall staff, I sit down in a nearby seat.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm planning to kill some time here for a while, but I don't intend to stay long considering the turnover rate. For the time that can't be used up, I plan to wander around by myself.</p><p class="calibre3">"Welcome back, Goshujin-sama!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"......You seem pretty excited for someone who had no choice but to do." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, if it's come to this, there's no helping it, so you might as well enjoy it, right?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">As he says that, Yukio is flipping around as if to show off the frills of his skirt, looking somewhat more cheerful compared to the expression on his face when he found out he didn't have his butler's uniform.</p><p class="calibre3">It's way better than being forced to do it, but his adaptability is a little surprising.</p><p class="calibre3">"Could I have your order?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then... I'll have the transparent warabimochi and black tea." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Understood." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Yukio, who has noted my order, goes to the kitchen to communicate it.</p><p class="calibre3">In the meantime, I look around from my seat in the corner.</p><p class="calibre3">The number of customers is decent. It seems like the number of public customers is gradually increasing, and I notice a line forming in the corridor after I have been sitting for a while.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm relieved that we don't have to worry about not having customers come.</p><p class="calibre3">"Here you go, Goshujin-sama. These are the items you ordered." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey... being called 'Goshujin-sama' is giving me an itch." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? But that's the rule, so you have to accept it." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">With a teasing smile, Yukio places the warabimochi and black tea that I have ordered in front of me.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though I suggested it myself, I think this warabimochi will attract attention.</p><p class="calibre3">And the taste――――yeah, they made it just as I taught them.</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">[...Hey, isn't she hella cute?]</i></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">[I totally get it. Should I try talking to her later...?]</i></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">[Hey, wait. I saw her first, okay?]</i></p><p class="calibre3">As I sip my black tea, I overhear the conversation of those guys from the adjacent table.</p><p class="calibre3">Following their gaze, I see Yukio in the maid outfit.</p><p class="calibre3">They look young and are wearing casual clothes, so they are probably from another school.</p><p class="calibre3">It's a pity, but that means they don't know that Yukio is a boy. I hope the shock will be minimal when they find out later.</p><p class="calibre3">――――And then some time passed.</p><p class="calibre3">After finishing the warabimochi, I drink the remaining black tea in one go and get up from my seat.</p><p class="calibre3">Yukio, who notices, approaches me holding a tray for serving dishes.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you leaving already, Rintaro?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, it's not good to linger even though it's my own class. Do your best for the rest of the shift." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Mm. Hehe, I'm looking forward to seeing you in your butler outfit later. I'll use that as motivation." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'd appreciate it if you didn't expect too much......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I guess it's better than not being expected at all.</p><p class="calibre3">But then again, it's kind of awkward if I end up letting him down.</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, I'll just do my work quietly and efficiently.</p><p class="calibre3">I still have over an hour left until I have to go back to the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">So I think I might be able to see the performance of the drama club, but――――</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh...?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I glance out the window in the hallway, I see a group of guys walking past three girls, just like the guys who were staring at Yukio before, and they are staring at the girls in awe.</p><p class="calibre3">My gaze is also drawn to the girls, as if I'm being pulled in by them.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I feel like I've seen them somewhere before." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Even from this distance, I can tell that those three are incredibly beautiful.</p><p class="calibre3">Not just the guys I saw, but several others who notice them are also turning to look at them.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well, it's probably just a coincidence.</p><p class="calibre3">I happen to know a trio of beautiful girls.</p><p class="calibre3">But the ones I'm seeing now have completely different hair colors and slightly different facial impressions.</p><p class="calibre3">The girls I know are really good at disguises, but I'm sure that has nothing to do with it.</p><p class="calibre3">Yeah, it should have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">Putting aside irrelevant matters, I casually fill my spare time.</p><p class="calibre3">I stroll around aimlessly, and even go to see a play that doesn't particularly interest me because I don't know anyone in it, making the most of the freedom of being alone.</p><p class="calibre3">As a result, I find myself surprisingly enjoying the play and basking in the satisfaction of having a good time, before checking the time and heading back to the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">(Ten minutes before the shift change... this should do.)</p><p class="calibre3">Considering the time needed for changing and other handovers, five minutes seems a bit tight.</p><p class="calibre3">I open the door for my classmates, separate from the one for the customers, and enter just like I did with Yukio.</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, sup~! Rintaro." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Then, Doumoto, who has arrived earlier, calls out to me.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto is already dressed in a butler's outfit, and his hair is also neatly styled with wax.</p><p class="calibre3">I've been thinking since the last time at the pool, but is he the kind of guy that other guys admire? His chest is quite prominent due to his thick pectoral muscles, and his waist is tightly toned, creating a stunning inverted triangle body shape.</p><p class="calibre3">Unlike the slender, muscular physique of Kakihara, he gives off a solid and sturdy impression, without any unsightly unsightly, bulging muscle look.</p><p class="calibre3">"I thought I came quite early, but it seemed I lost to Ryuuji-kun, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Nah, I was with Yuusuke and Honoka for a while, but then Yuusuke and Azusa had to leave for the committee work. Honoka and I were going to hang out together, but then she suddenly blushed and said something about feeling embarrassed, and ran off somewhere." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"...Heeeh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"She was acting kind of weird. Maybe she was not feeling well or something." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Most probably, however, I think that worry is misplaced.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems to be a setup of Kakihara → Nikaido, and Nogi → Doumoto. Doumoto seems to be like your typical dense romantic comedy protagonist, and Nogi must be having quite a hard time.</p><p class="calibre3">From here on out, it's really none of my business, so I won't unnecessarily intervene.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry! I'm late!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">As the conversation ended, Kakihara, out of breath, burst through the door behind me.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's okay, there's still over five minutes until the shift change." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I-I see...... I was having trouble resolving the unexpected trouble, but I'm glad I made it in time....." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Catching his breath, Kakihara grabs his costume.</p><p class="calibre3">Now, I also need to change soon.</p><p class="calibre3">The rental items have only a rough size, so they feel a bit off, but it's not as tight as Doumoto's, so I guess it's fine.</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't you style your hair, Rintaro?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well... honestly, I'm not good with wax and stuff. Thus, I don't use it much normally." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">What I don't like about wax is that sticky feeling.</p><p class="calibre3">I understand that styling my hair means grooming to some extent, but I feel uncomfortable when my hair becomes stiff.</p><p class="calibre3">I think my hair is quite long for a guy, but putting wax on it is too much of a hassle.</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't that a waste? It's not like you can wear it that many times, so why not try a different hairstyle?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh...?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"N-no, if you don't want to do it that much, you don't have to do it." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">I unintentionally make a displeased face, which makes Doumoto back off.</p><p class="calibre3">But what he's saying is not entirely wrong.</p><p class="calibre3">Since we have these costumes, it'll be more enjoyable if we dress up properly.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Can you teach me, how to do it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, are you sure?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"I thought about what Ryuuji-kun said, it's only about two hours, so maybe I should give it a try." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I see." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara nods once, picks up the wax he has been using, and stands behind me.</p><p class="calibre3">"If that's the case, I'll help too. Ryuuji, give me your opinion too." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Got it. Let's make Rintaro look really handsome while we're at it." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">No, you don't have to go that far――――</p><p class="calibre3">Before I'm able to say that, Kakihara and Domoto begin working on my hair.</p><p class="calibre3">"Should we make it stand up a bit here?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, and then style it this way......" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">It still feels strange to have someone else touch my hair.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, it doesn't make my heart race like when Rei did it before.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Hey, it's looking pretty good, isn't it?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah...... it's looking really good." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Their gazes are drawn to my face, which is reflected in the mirror used to check my appearance.</p><p class="calibre3">I also see myself with my hair set, well, it's certainly more defined than usual. That's the way of being dressed to be seen, I think.</p><p class="calibre3">Combined with the butler's outfit, which is not like my usual appearance, it's a high point from my point of view.</p><p class="calibre3">"If I take care of my appearance properly every day, I can look like this, huh...... Thank you guys." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No... if anything we're actually the most surprised." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Seriously, their genuinely surprised looks make me more and more confused about the situation, and I even begin to wonder if there is something strange with my outfit.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps seeing my puzzled expression, Kakihara hurriedly speaks up.</p><p class="calibre3">"W-We're surprised because it suits you so well!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah! You can even ask other girls for their opinion if you want!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">There's really no need for that.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, it doesn't seem like they're just being polite, and getting positive feedback from these two is good enough for me.</p><p class="calibre3">Besides, no matter how good I look, it won't make a difference as long as I'm with these two.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro. It's about time...... to shift......" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Just as our trio set ended, Yukio, dressed in a maid outfit, appears.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm, yeah. I'm heading out――――what's up?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh? Umm, Rintaro, aren't you?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah...... I am, what's wrong?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Yukio looks stunned as he gazes at my face.</p><p class="calibre3">I wonder what. I'd like to get some feedback at the very least, but perhaps he's holding back from our usual exchanges because Kakihara and Doumoto are here?</p><p class="calibre3">"Say! Inaba, don't you think Rintaro is cool today, too?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Ah... yeah. I, I think he's really cool." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Asked for feedback, Yukio looks somewhat puzzled.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though there is no sign of falsehood in his words, I can't understand why he looks so complicated.</p><p class="calibre3">"......At this rate, everyone will notice Rintaro's good points." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"What's that supposed to mean?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's nothing, really. Come on, it's time to shift change!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">As Yukio says, it's already time to switch.</p><p class="calibre3">As we leave the staff room-like area and enter the classroom, all eyes are on us.</p><p class="calibre3">Some girls let out excited shrieks, while boys who know Kakihara and Doumoto cheer mockingly.</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"Oh, no way... the super handsome guys show up just as we're leaving?"</i></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"What should we do!? Should we line up again?"</i></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"But then we won't get around......"</i></p><p class="calibre3">I can hear such exchanges from nearby girls who seem to be from another school.</p><p class="calibre3">These girls are not the only ones who have such impressions, everyone, including the current students in the classrooms and the public visitors, directs their attention toward Kakihara and Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugh, it feels kinda uneasy." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"You feel so? I think It's kinda nice to be the center of attention." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, it's not a bad feeling, but..." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Ignoring the conversation between the two, I'm overcome by a strange sensation.</p><p class="calibre3">Some of the gazes that I thought were solely directed at Kakihara and Doumoto are somehow also directed at me.</p><p class="calibre3">And the owners of those gazes begin whispering to each other, making me feel even more uncomfortable.</p><p class="calibre3">I hope they're not saying anything mean at least――――.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">Anyway, what I have to do now is work in the hall.</p><p class="calibre3">I switch with Yukio and the others, and hold a tray for taking orders and menus.</p><p class="calibre3">"Alright! Let's go with full spirit!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">With Doumoto's energetic voice, we welcome new customers.</p><p class="calibre3">"Welcome back, Ojou-sama." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">""KYAA~!""</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">As Kakihara greets the girls from the other classes who have come as customers, they let out even louder screams than before.</p><p class="calibre3">Their reactions are very obvious, to the extent that you can tell they're completely after Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">And if you look closely, you can see that the line of people waiting in the hallway has gotten longer as soon as it's Kakihara's and Doumoto's shift.</p><p class="calibre3">"If Yuusuke leads them that way... then you girls come this way!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, we're also customers, so please serve us properly."</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, You're right! Sorry about that. Then, Ojou-sama, come this way please." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah... this might be quite nice."</p><p class="calibre3">It seems Doumoto has some acquaintances as he starts leading a few girls to their seats.</p><p class="calibre3">Although it's an unspoken agreement, the rule is deeply ingrained that the boys generally handle the female customers and vice versa, and the hall is smoothly managed with just a few words exchanged to inform who will be serving whom.</p><p class="calibre3">After that, male customers continue to arrive for a while, and the girls who are on shift with us at the same time handle them.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">While I'm busy taking orders from existing customers and delivering items, I soon notice new customers who need to be welcomed entering the entrance.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well then.</p><p class="calibre3">When it comes to welcoming customers, I have to say that line that's pretty embarrassing when taken seriously.</p><p class="calibre3">No matter how festive the mood is, an embarrassing thing is still an embarrassing thing.</p><p class="calibre3">But of course, I can't just let it go unsaid.</p><p class="calibre3">I clear my throat and walk towards the female customers waiting at the entrance.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Welcome back, Ojou-sama." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I have to admit, my voice was perfect.</p><p class="calibre3">It feels like the result of living feigning friendliness for the past few years has paid off.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... Umm."</p><p class="calibre3">"......Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">The customer I addressed is three women.</p><p class="calibre3">They're not――――they look mature with their makeup, but upon closer inspection, they seem quite young. Probably students from another school.</p><p class="calibre3">These are the beautiful public visitors who attracted a lot of attention that I saw through the windows of the school a while ago.</p><p class="calibre3">Apart from that, I feel like I have seen them somewhere before.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps they're models in a magazine or something? They all seem to have more than just the looks of entertainers, so it won't be surprising.</p><p class="calibre3">(Anyway......)</p><p class="calibre3">I have to attend to the customers.</p><p class="calibre3">I gather myself and speak again.</p><p class="calibre3">"Seats for three, is that correct?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Y-yes. That's right, please......" <span class="calibre24">(K)</span></p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">The shortest of the three, who was the first to respond to my question, averts her face as if to hide her high-pitched voice that had just escaped her lips.</p><p class="calibre3">It looks a little suspicious, but it doesn't look like there's any harm in it.</p><p class="calibre3">I nod once and guide them to the newly vacant seats.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please, have a seat over there. I will bring you some water." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeysh..."</p><p class="calibre3">Not only her, but for some reason, the other two in the back also look extremely nervous as they walk into the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't feel any harm from them, but seeing such mysterious behavior makes me have to be on guard.</p><p class="calibre3">While feeling sorry for them, I eavesdrop on their conversation.</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"Hey... if you get so restless, he'll know." <span class="calibre25">(R)</span></i></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"I-it can't be helped, can it? If he appears before us in such...... such attire, it's natural to be surprised, right?" <span class="calibre24">(K)</span></i></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"......I'm not denying that."&nbsp;</i><i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre25">(R)</span></i></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"Both of you're acting suspicious too, so don't complain!" <span class="calibre26">(M)</span></i></p><p class="calibre3">――――Haha, it can't be right, can it?</p><p class="calibre3">For some reason, the voice sounds familiar to me now, but I don't know any of these girls.</p><p class="calibre3">They have blonde, red, and black hair, and they look completely different from the all-black-haired girls standing before me right now.</p><p class="calibre3">They have distinctive eye colors, but all of these girls here have black eyes. They are all different from each other in every aspect of their appearance.</p><p class="calibre3">The only thing similar is their body shape and height, extremely similar, but even if I looked at them from above the clothes, it wouldn't be evidence.</p><p class="calibre3">But――――but still.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, what do you want for dinner tonight?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Shrimp fry." <span class="calibre25">(R)</span></p><p class="calibre3">"..." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"..."&nbsp;<span class="calibre25">(R)</span></p><p class="calibre3">When I speak to the girl walking at the back, she immediately gives me that answer.</p><p class="calibre3">When I give her a glare, she gradually breaks out in a cold sweat.</p><p class="calibre3">The same is true for the two in front of her.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I made a mistake. It's a Pork cutlet."&nbsp;<span class="calibre25">(R)</span></p><p class="calibre3">"That's not where you made a mistake!"&nbsp;<span class="calibre24">(K)</span></p><p class="calibre3">The smallest girl delivers a chop to the girl who corrected her answer to pork cutlet.</p><p class="calibre3">Yeah, well, I have expected that to happen.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though the impressions are completely different, I have been surprised by their disguising skills many times. Just by changing their eye and hair colors, they look like completely different people, and my eyes know that best.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry, Rintaro-kun. We'll do our best not to get in your way." (Mia)&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"MIA" puts her face close to my ear and whispers.</p><p class="calibre3">On the eve of the school festival, the word "great idea" that Rei had said passed through my mind.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm sure this is what she meant, but it was so simple that I couldn't even think of it.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Be careful, seriously." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's okay. I'm confident in my acting skills." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Well, she's on the level of a professional actress, so she has confidence.</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon seems to be skilled as an idol, and for Rei&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;as long as she keeps quiet, there shouldn't be any problems.</p><p class="calibre3">Although they are too beautiful and have attracted a lot of attention, they haven't been exposed as MilleSta yet, it's perhaps because they are paying attention to their surroundings properly.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, is there a problem?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"What? No, I'm fine! Nothing's wrong," (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that so......?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I urge Kakihara to return to his own work and then have Rei and the girls sit in the vacant seats.</p><p class="calibre3">"......You're attracting a lot of attention, you know." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I inspect my surroundings with my eyes only, trying not to move my face.</p><p class="calibre3">The male customers are obviously conscious of them, and they keep moving their eyes to check the faces of the girls.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, of course. No matter how much we try to hide it, our overflowing aura of beautiful girls can't be concealed." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"That statement sounds like it came from someone not very smart," (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"HUUUUH?! Calling someone stupid makes you the stupid one." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then it's just you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I didn't say anything referring to her as stupid, though.</p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway――――Ojou-sama, have you decided on your order?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I, as the butler, can't afford to adopt a casual attitude towards customers, whom I should be meeting for the first time from an outsider's perspective.</p><p class="calibre3">With my best sales smile, I addressed the girls who were examining the handmade menu.</p><p class="calibre3">"Stop it, Rintaro. That smile is too much for me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, Rei's eyes seem distorted into heart shapes for some reason.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm happy to know that she's complimenting me, but at the same time, I'm a little scared.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rin――――I mean, Mr. Butler?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, what can I do for you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that smile, also directed at people other than us?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I can't quite grasp Mia's intention behind the question, so I glance around.</p><p class="calibre3">Am I being tested in some way? If so, I should answer honestly.</p><p class="calibre3">"Dear customers are all my first guests to serve, so dear customers are the only Ojou-samas I have had the pleasure of serving in this way yet." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Hmm, I guess that's okay then." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I wonder what pleased her.</p><p class="calibre3">Mia looks back at the menu list with satisfaction.</p><p class="calibre3">Separately, Rei and Kanon look grinning or rather, looking satisfied.</p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway, do you have any recommendations? I'm good with anything." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"In that case, I would highly recommend the warabimochi. For drinks, we have green tea or black tea." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see. Then I'll have the warabimochi and green tea." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Starting with Kanon's choice from the menu, Rei and Mia also follow suit and order the same.</p><p class="calibre3">After jotting down their orders just to be sure, I place my hand on my chest and bow my head towards them.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please wait a moment, Ojou-sama." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">With the designated line spoken, I leave the table with a smile that is not a sales smile.</p><p class="calibre3">Regardless of the method, the fact that I'm able to show Rei myself in the butler's uniform is a pleasure for me.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">The number of people who have come to the restaurant has increased, but the job I have to do is still the same.</p><p class="calibre3">After placing the orders to the girls, I confirm the presence of new customers and proceed to greet them.</p><p class="calibre3">"Welcome back, Ojou-sama." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Standing before two college-aged women, I put on my best sales smile.</p><p class="calibre3">They seem to like it and begin giggling.</p><p class="calibre3">"Seats for two, is that correct??" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. Um, um, are you the person in charge of serving the customers?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Oh, yes. I'm in charge of serving the customers......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yay! Lucky us!"</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know what it is that they're pleased with, but it's always nice to receive compliments.</p><p class="calibre3">As I feel a little better, I notice the commotion behind me.</p><p class="calibre3">Casually glancing to the side, I see that Rei has crushed a paper cup of water, and the rest two are hurriedly covering it up.</p><p class="calibre3">It doesn't seem like a big deal, so I'll leave it for now. But I should refrain from being too obvious about my contentment.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please follow this way." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ka~y!"</p><p class="calibre3">I guide the excited two to their table and provide them with paper cups of water before they decide what they want to order.</p><p class="calibre3">For some reason, they call me, so I halt in front of their table.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, what's your name?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I go by Shidou." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Not just your surname, what's your given name?"</p><p class="calibre3">"......It's Rintaro." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hee~, Rintaro-kun, is that it, that's a cute name."</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think so?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Does Rintaro-kun have a girlfriend?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't... I'm currently not dating anyone." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What? Such a cool guy like you to have none, isn't it a waste?"</p><p class="calibre3">"That's...... I don't think I'm that cool――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"But if you don't have a girlfriend, maybe I should volunteer? Just kidding."</p><p class="calibre3">"Hahaha......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">What the heck is this conversation?</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know how to react, so I just give a friendly laugh and let it go.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems too obvious for a moment, but regardless, the two women in front of me are laughing happily.</p><p class="calibre3">Then I hear a crumpling sound from the back again.</p><p class="calibre3">When I check by averting just my eyes, this time, not only Rei but also Mia is crushing the paper cups.</p><p class="calibre3">It sends a shiver down my spine.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro! Can you help me for a moment?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, sure! I'll be right there!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Called by a hurried Doumoto, I move away from the table where I have been serving the girls.</p><p class="calibre3">Honestly, it is a relief. It's not like I was uncomfortable, but as they were customers, I couldn't just ignore them, and it would have wasted a lot of my time.</p><p class="calibre3">"Eeh, are you leaving?</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm very sorry about that. But, if you've decided on your order, please call me again." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">With a disappointed voice behind me, I head off to deal with the customer that Kakihara and Doumoto are unable to handle.</p><p class="calibre3">We intentionally maintain the number of tables low to avoid being overwhelmed, but as the turnover rate increases, the busyness grows.</p><p class="calibre3">The girls who are on the same shift as us seem to be working part-time at the family restaurant and are efficiently handling the male customers. Unfortunately, we can't keep up with them.</p><p class="calibre3">(Damn it... I knew I shouldn't have taken this job.)</p><p class="calibre3">Even though the work has only just begun, there is nothing I can do about it if I'm not used to it anyway.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara seems to be getting used to it already, and both Dohmoto and I need to catch up quickly.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――C'mon, guys! Get your asses over here!"&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">As I continue my work again, I hear an irritated voice coming from the entrance.</p><p class="calibre3">It is Kinjou, accompanied by a bunch of his friends from another school.</p><p class="calibre3">He's acting even more arrogantly than usual, probably it's due to surrounded by his friends.</p><p class="calibre3">The girl who is supposed to greet them looks somewhat troubled.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sigh... you guys slept till this hour, so we're running late thanks to you." (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">"Seriously, you should be grateful we came here...... We're still sleepy, you know?"</p><p class="calibre3">The guys behind Kinjou, who are yawning, weren't there when I saw him earlier.</p><p class="calibre3">Now there are five of them in total, forming a rather conspicuous group.</p><p class="calibre3">"Umm... Welcome back, Goshujin-sama. Will it be seats for five?"&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"Can't you tell just by looking?" (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">"E-excuse my rudeness! Right this way, please."</p><p class="calibre3">Kinjou, with his unpleasant attitude, follows the maid-dressed girl in an irritated manner.</p><p class="calibre3">At the same time, his friends, with annoying smirks on their faces, start bothering the girl in front of them.</p><p class="calibre3">"Heh, I thought it would be cheap-looking, but it's surprisingly authentic, isn't it? You're cute too, you know?"</p><p class="calibre3">"U-umm..... Please stop it."</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? It's fine, isn't it? Come on, give us good service."</p><p class="calibre3">The guy is trying to touch the girl, and the girl looks uncomfortable, displaying a mix of distress and fear on her face.</p><p class="calibre3">This is clearly going too far.</p><p class="calibre3">Before I can speak up and ask them to stop, the justice-driven Kakihara intervenes.</p><p class="calibre3">"Excuse me, could you please stop touching the girl in our class?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? I haven't touched them yet. Don't make baseless accusations. What a rude guy you are."</p><p class="calibre3">"What...?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">It is clear that they are the ones with a bad attitude, but they don't seem to feel guilty about it. Rather, they even laugh at Kakihara for trying to warn them.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing their faces, Doumoto is about to explode with anger.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto furrows his brow deeply and tries to confront them from behind Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Ryuuji, hold back." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">However, Kakihara stops him with his hand.</p><p class="calibre3">"But..." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Excuse my rudeness. Please continue to enjoy our maid and butler cafe." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara must have judged that these guys are just too much trouble.</p><p class="calibre3">If Doumoto were to confront them, there was a possibility that it could have turned into a violent incident.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, Doumoto would never lay a hand on them, but if they were serious about causing trouble, it wouldn't end well.</p><p class="calibre3">So, for now, they just had to restrain them and change the way they served the girls.</p><p class="calibre3">So for now, it's just a deterrent to calm things down, and it seems like he plans to take the task over from the girl from here on.</p><p class="calibre3">"Kakihara-kun..."</p><p class="calibre3">"It's okay, leave it to me." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">He sends the girl to another table and Kakihara begins to guide the Kinjou's gang.</p><p class="calibre3">However, there's no way they can be satisfied with that――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, hey! We came here because we heard the maids would entertain us, but why do we have to be served by a bastard?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm very sorry. They're also busy." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sigh, this is disappointing. Hey, Kinjou, did you lie to us when you brought us here?"</p><p class="calibre3">The guy who throws the words at Kinjou wears an expression of fake dissatisfaction mixed with a cunning smile.</p><p class="calibre3">Not only he, but the rest of them have the same expression as well, and Kinjou, who is in the center, restrains them with his hand.</p><p class="calibre3">"No, no, I'm sure she's here. She's just hiding because she doesn't want to cause a commotion." (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">After hearing Kinjo's words, I broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p class="calibre3">Finally, I understood Kinjou's objective here.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"We don't have any business with you, boys. Come the hell out quickly, REI of MilleSta." (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">Raising his voice, Kinjo intentionally mentions her name.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Because his voice echoes in the hallway, the other customers begin to buzz.</p><p class="calibre3">Some of them are even visiting this place because REI of the Millefeuille Stars goes to this school. If such voices are heard, many onlookers will come by in search of people who shouldn't be there.</p><p class="calibre3">That's exactly what Kinjou is after.</p><p class="calibre3">It's his revenge――――for being rejected by Rei.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">(What a hassle you've done......)</p><p class="calibre3">I mutter a complaint in my mind.</p><p class="calibre3">In any case, if by some chance customers start pouring in for Rei, and if it's deemed a problem by the school, our maid butler café could face a suspension.</p><p class="calibre3">If that were to happen, all our efforts would be in vain.</p><p class="calibre3">"Here, show yourself up. You're here to attract customers, right? You guys also wanted to use her popularity to attract people, didn't you? Hurry up and make that intention come true." (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">"......We don't have any such intentions! Besides, she hasn't even come to school!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're saying that just for appearance, aren't you? You must've planned for her to come out around this time, considering there wouldn't be too many customers stopping by." (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">Ignoring Kakihara's rebuttal, Kinjou accuses confidently.</p><p class="calibre3">His voice is loud and his attitude is as if he hasn't said anything wrong.</p><p class="calibre3">Then the hallway becomes buzzing with noise. It will be a relief if they understand that Rei isn't here and leaves quickly, but rumors spread quickly and take time to calm down.</p><p class="calibre3">To contain the situation, we have no choice but to raise our voices and refute Kinjou's claims――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, I don't give a f*ck to yourself airs! We'll just have to wait until Rei comes out!" (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">Kinjou says with a sneer, as they settle into the prepared chairs.</p><p class="calibre3">".......Hey, can you guys leave already? Even if you call her, it's impossible for her who isn't even at school to show up." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Shut the f*ck up! We won't be fooled by such lies!" (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">Their claims are nonsensical.</p><p class="calibre3">If we truly want to use Rei to attract customers, we should have had her here from the morning, instead of this time.</p><p class="calibre3">And it will be enough to have her stroll around as a promotional person, not as a customer service person.</p><p class="calibre3">That way, there will definitely be a publicity effect, and since she won't be inside the classrooms, there won't be a flood of customers.</p><p class="calibre3">That's the plan for tomorrow, Rei is supposed to act like that.</p><p class="calibre3">The reason Kinjou and his gang continue to make pointless claims is simply because they want to cause us trouble.</p><p class="calibre3">And they want to make it seem like everything that has happened is all Otosaki Rei's fault.</p><p class="calibre3">What's really frightening is that these guys haven't thought about the consequences at all. They believe that as minors, they can get away with anything under the protection of the law.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yuusuke-kun, go ask the girls to call the teachers." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Oh, yeah. That's a good idea." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I whisper to Kakihara and induce him to tell the girls what to do.</p><p class="calibre3">Kinjou aside, the guys he brought along seem somewhat irritated.</p><p class="calibre3">It's often said not to judge a book by its cover, but they seem to have the kind of unpleasant personalities that match their appearance. If they were to lose their patience and cause a scene, the girls might get hurt.</p><p class="calibre3">If we evacuate the girls first, we can avoid such a situation.</p><p class="calibre3">Truly――――truly, they have caused a lot of trouble.</p><p class="calibre3">The worst part is that the "person in question" is here in this situation.</p><p class="calibre3">Checking the seats where they are sitting out of the corner of my eye, Kanon has an angry expression, and Mia is sending worried looks to Rei. And Rei, the person in question, has her back turned and her expression is not visible.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Kinjou, the teachers will be here soon. If that happens, you're going to be in trouble, aren't you?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I am? In trouble? Are you an idiot? ......I'm just here stopping by and asking if Rei is here or not. I haven't caused any problems. Even if these guys <i class="calibre6">'I coincidentally met today'</i> caught in any trouble, that's none of my concern." (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">I want to say it won't happen, but the fact is that because this guy shouted unnecessary things, instead of decreasing, the number of customers has actually increased.</p><p class="calibre3">Whether increasing customers can be considered a nuisance or not is no longer something we can judge.</p><p class="calibre3">And if these guys themselves deny their involvement, there will be no element for Kinjou to take responsibility.</p><p class="calibre3">It may not go smoothly according to their plan, but as someone like him who just wants to cause trouble for us, I think it's enough to just say something appropriate.</p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway, if Rei doesn't show up soon, should we start causing a scene?"</p><p class="calibre3">The four guys get up from their seats and begin wandering around with grins on their faces.</p><p class="calibre3">They stare at the remaining public customers as if examining them, causing discomfort on their faces.</p><p class="calibre3">Finally realizing that something was wrong, some people, including the two female college students I was in charge of, left the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">(…...Good.)</p><p class="calibre3">If this trend continues, those girls can also leave the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">If they can just leave the classroom, everything else should be manageable. The teacher will probably force them out, even if it's by force, and the situation will be resolved.</p><p class="calibre3">"......We're leaving too." <span class="calibre24">(Kanon)</span></p><p class="calibre3">Kanon in disguise leads Rei and Mia, trying to leave the classroom as I had hoped.</p><p class="calibre3">However――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"My, my my my, you girls are so cute, aren't you? Totally my type!"&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">A guy from Kinjou's gang, who has been absentmindedly watching the leaving customers, stands in front of the three.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm on the verge of clicking my tongue involuntarily.</p><p class="calibre3">Thanks to their excellent disguises, it seems that their true identities have not been exposed, but seeing him stare so intently makes me inevitably uneasy.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Kanecchi, can I have some fun with these girls?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey hey, do it in moderation, understand?" (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">"I know, I know."</p><p class="calibre3">The brown-haired guy, who seems to be the worst women's enemy of all, takes advantage of Kinjou's permission and reaches out to the girls.</p><p class="calibre3">"Aw man, it was a good idea to come along with Kanecchi today. I never thought I'd get to play with such cuties."&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">As he says this, he presumptuously clasps Rei's shoulder.</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, an unpleasant feeling wells up from the bottom of my chest, causing the hair on my whole body to stand on end.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, stop it." <span class="calibre25">(Rei)</span></p><p class="calibre3">"Oops..."</p><p class="calibre3">Wearing a displeased expression, Rei brushes off his arm. Despite being in the wrong, he, who has been brushed away, furrows his brow in irritation for some reason.</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, what? Why the f*ck are you being so rough? You're really irritating me."</p><p class="calibre3">While complaining about the unreasonable anger, he twitches his left eyelid.</p><p class="calibre3">I sense a hint of madness in his reaction, warning me that it will be better not to provoke him.</p><p class="calibre3">For some reason, it feels vaguely familiar, perhaps because he resembled the scout guy who had accosted Mia on the street the other day.</p><p class="calibre3">"A~ah. If only she would just be affectionate and obedient. That guy, he really hates it when women reject him the most." (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">Kinjou's gang feigned a look of exasperation while narrowing their eyes in amusement.</p><p class="calibre3">Sensing their impending danger, Rei and the girls draw closer to each other, their wariness growing stronger.</p><p class="calibre3">"Huff, huff...... When a woman defies me, I seriously feel like my blood vessels are going to burst in my head......"</p><p class="calibre3">The brown-haired guy reaches his hand out towards Rei again.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing that his hand is about to reach for her head――――or her hair, to be precise, I quickly grab a paper cup filled with water from a nearby table.</p><p class="calibre3">"Excuse me......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? ――――Bwha!?"</p><p class="calibre3">Aiming for his face, I splash the contents at him with force, leaving him looking dumbfounded.</p><p class="calibre3">"Has your head cooled down, sir?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Bastard...... I'll kill you."</p><p class="calibre3">Haha, that's not scary at all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">Therefore, I can't afford to be hesitant here.</p><p class="calibre3">Since I've already splashed water on his face, apologizing for it as an accident won't make any difference.</p><p class="calibre3">────But to begin with, I have no intention of apologizing.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you screwing with me, you son of a b*tch?"</p><p class="calibre3">The brown-haired guy seems to have reached his peak of irritation and kicks the nearby chair with full force.</p><p class="calibre3">The chair rolls with a loud noise, causing screams from the women customers.</p><p class="calibre3">The people in the hallway also sense something is wrong and quickly disperse from the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey...I told you to keep your behavior within reason, didn't I?" (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">"Shut up! He's irritating me, so don't give me orders!"</p><p class="calibre3">Frustrated that his words don't get through, Kinjou clicks his tongue.</p><p class="calibre3">The brown-haired guy brushes off the moisture from his hair and grabs my collar.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think you can pick a fight with me and get away with this easily, huh?"</p><p class="calibre3">"It wasn't even crossed in my mind at all...... I don't know you, and I certainly am not the least bit afraid of a "lame-ass" guy who targets weaker opponents than himself in the first place." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What...?"</p><p class="calibre3">The brown-haired man's face turns even redder with anger.</p><p class="calibre3">(It's about the time.)</p><p class="calibre3">As if to deliver the final blow, I put on a big smirk.</p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway, you're just a lackey who can't move without Kinjou's orders, aren't you? Your pretend anger is getting boring. How about acting on your own volition?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I'll kill you."</p><p class="calibre3">He raises his fist and aims it at me.</p><p class="calibre3">Kinjou and the gang rush to intervene, but before they can, his fist has already caught my cheek.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ouch────!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Say it again! You bastard!"</p><p class="calibre3">It hurts. It really hurts.</p><p class="calibre3">I've learned techniques to avoid getting hit in self-defense, but I've never been trained to endure the pain of being hit.</p><p class="calibre3">But this is fine. With this, my plan has been fulfilled.</p><p class="calibre3">"You idiot! I told you to within moderation!" (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">"Shut up, shut up, shut up! I haven't hit enough, damn it!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Tch... Hey! Let's get out of here! Take this idiot out!" (Kinjou)</p><p class="calibre3">The blond-haired guy is restrained, and the flustered Kinjou and the others drag him out of the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">Watching their backs, I exhale a deep breath.</p><p class="calibre3">"R-Rintaro, are you okay?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Yeah, I'm fine. Yuusuke-kun and you guys, are okay too?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"We're fine, but... you're bleeding..." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I wipe my mouth with my finger, there's blood on it.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that I got a cut by the impact of being hit.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I guess I'll have to say this is tolerable.</p><p class="calibre3">"You're amazing. Did you intentionally let yourself get hit?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Well yeah. Although it feels like it went a little too well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">With Doumoto's help, I stand up.</p><p class="calibre3">My plan is based on two main scenarios.</p><p class="calibre3">One is that Kinjou and the others were just bluffing, and they didn't actually intend to resort to violence.</p><p class="calibre3">Despite all the excuses they made, they were aware that it could eventually become a problem, and I first considered the possibility that they wanted to keep the harassment to a minimum level so that they could cover it up at the very least.</p><p class="calibre3">If it became a clear case of violence, there was a limit to how much they could get away with, no matter how many excuses they made.</p><p class="calibre3">That was why they ran away.</p><p class="calibre3">And another possible scenario is that they were just plain stupid.</p><p class="calibre3">Without thinking about the consequences, if they had just acted recklessly for the sake of harassment, the damage would have been much worse.</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, if they were just going to wreak havoc in the classroom, all they had to do was resort to violence against random people, yelling, "Bring REI out!".</p><p class="calibre3">The fact that they didn't proceed with that made the second scenario highly unlikely. That's why I deliberately exposed myself to the guy who seemed most vulnerable to provocation.</p><p class="calibre3">I ultimately won the bet, but I can't help feeling relieved that things went so well.</p><p class="calibre3">"Everyone! Are you okay!" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Harukawa-sensei."</p><p class="calibre3">Breathless, our homeroom teacher, Harukawa-sensei, burst into the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">Upon seeing the partially vandalized classroom and my bruised face, she wears a pained expression.</p><p class="calibre3">"I heard that students from another school were causing trouble, but Shidou-kun, your face is......" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry for causing concern. But I'm okay, so please take care of the customers and the girls." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...If you say so, Shidou-kun, then I'll do so. But please go to the infirmary and get checked. It looks like you're bleeding." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, I understand." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">The situation is temporarily under control, but continuing today's business will be impossible.</p><p class="calibre3">Leaving the cleanup to Kakihara and the others, I head to the infirmary as Harukawa-sensei had suggested.</p><p class="calibre3">The hallway around the infirmary, where there's nothing on display, is deserted.</p><p class="calibre3">Because of this, I quickly realized that "she" is standing there waiting for me.</p><p class="calibre3">"────Rei." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yes." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Leaning against the wall, she looks somewhat apologetic.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are all the three of you fine?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, we're fine. But, Rintaro, you're......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm fine. It's no big deal at all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">As I said, my injuries aren't a big deal.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm not just putting on a brave face or trying to act cool.</p><p class="calibre3">But even though I convey that, it seems like Rei isn't convinced.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">She tugs at the edge of my jacket and looks into my eyes.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry for causing you pain, and thank you for protecting me. ────But... please don't do anything dangerous like that again." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">As I listen to her emotionally charged plea, I find myself unable to say anything.</p><p class="calibre3">Her fingertips are trembling slightly, conveying a sense of fear.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems to have sprouted not because she found herself in a predicament, but because she cared for me.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Sorry for making you worry." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, Rintaro, you don't need to apologize. I will be more careful from now on." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Even though I could now more easily discern Rei's emotional expressions, this one is entirely new to me.</p><p class="calibre3">I might be a little nuts for feeling that it was worth getting injured just to witness this.</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, for now, I guess────I will stay by her side until she calms down.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">After that commotion.</p><p class="calibre3">It seemed Kinjou and his gang left the school, and they didn't cause any more problems.</p><p class="calibre3">Since the teachers were looking for him, he would probably be questioned thoroughly when he came to school next. Even so, it would be better if he were to be suspended from school.</p><p class="calibre3">Returning to the classroom after the treatment in the infirmary, Kakihara and the others, who seemed to have calmed down, welcomed me.</p><p class="calibre3">"We discussed it a bit with the rest, and we decided not to tell Otosaki-san about what happened today. It would be unfortunate if she felt responsible for what happened." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I want to express my gratitude to everyone who came to that conclusion, but saying thank you might complicate things, so I just agreed.</p><p class="calibre3">Later, I'll have to coordinate with Rei and make sure our stories match.</p><p class="calibre3">────So, this is what happened on the first day of our school festival.</p>
