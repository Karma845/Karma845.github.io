<h3>Chapter 4: The Preparation for The School Festival</h3>

<p class="calibre3">"Hey, could you bring that over here?"</p><p class="calibre3">The voice of a classmate echoes through the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">The new semester has started and it has been over ten days since the decision was made for the school festival performance.</p><p class="calibre3">Lately, almost every day after school, we gather in the classroom and prepare for the school festival.</p><p class="calibre3">Although there are some who can't participate because they still have club activities, there is a unique system of cooperation where, depending on the club advisor, the club activities will be suspended for a week just before the festival.</p><p class="calibre3">While everyone is actively moving around, I sit on the floor and diligently move the paintbrush soaked in paint.</p><p class="calibre3">I am now painting the decorative sign to be used in the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">"As expected of a manga assistant. You're efficient at painting." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, rather, I've been doing a lot of beta coloring, so I'm better at this kind of thing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">With Yukio supporting the sign, I paint carefully, making sure not to go over the lines.</p><p class="calibre3">I quite enjoy this kind of work.</p><p class="calibre3">The progress is straightforward and the results are clear, so I don't get bored doing it.</p><p class="calibre3">"But still... he seems busy, doesn't he?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Yeah, he's on the executive committee after all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Glancing at the hallway, I catch a glimpse of Kakihara talking with students from another class and upperclassmen.</p><p class="calibre3">Because he is truly exceptional, people around him come to rely on him.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though he's only a sophomore, Kakihara always seems to be at the center of the conversation.</p><p class="calibre3">Even the seniors come to him for advice, so his skills must be remarkable.</p><p class="calibre3">After giving instructions to a few people, Kakihara walks away quickly, holding some documents.</p><p class="calibre3">I must say, he's too disciplined, to follow the rule of not running in the hallway, even when he's busy.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's quite something to be too outstanding." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. But he's been looking tired lately, and honestly, that worried me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Although people around him may not notice, there is a hint of exhaustion on Kakihara's face.</p><p class="calibre3">When I asked him if there was anything I could do to help, hoping to reduce the burden on him if possible, Kakihara himself insisted saying "I'm fine".</p><p class="calibre3">Since I don't really understand the responsibilities of being on the school festival executive committee, I can't just interfere without permission.</p><p class="calibre3">I hope I can find a way to help him before he reaches his limit――――</p><p class="calibre3">"Since Nikaido-san is here, it probably won't escalate into something serious. For now, let's focus on our own work." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yeah, you're right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">After that, we decided to immerse ourselves in making the signboards.</p><p class="calibre3">As we are doing that, about an hour had passed.</p><p class="calibre3">"I told you that we also have things we need to do, didn't I?!"</p><p class="calibre3">"You're being unfair by making excuses and not helping at all!"</p><p class="calibre3">A voice of anger can be heard from the hallway.</p><p class="calibre3">The classroom falls silent, and several people peek their heads out into the hallway, curious about what is happening.</p><p class="calibre3">Curious as well, Yukiho and I quietly look into the hallway.</p><p class="calibre3">There, we witness a group of boys and girls from a different class, pided into two groups, glaring at each other.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, youth." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, youth indeed." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">We casually observe their situation, thinking it has nothing to do with us.</p><p class="calibre3">The girl at the front is probably a member of the school festival executive committee. She has the same documents that Kashihara has earlier.</p><p class="calibre3">And the boy she's arguing with is probably the sophomore ace of the baseball club.</p><p class="calibre3">The seniors retired since the summer, and he had become the captain or something like that.</p><p class="calibre3">By comparing their voices from earlier and their respective positions, it's easy to understand the cause of their dispute.</p><p class="calibre3">The committee girl wanted more help with the school festival preparations, while the baseball club wanted to focus more on practice as a new team.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that the baseball club had lost in a close match during the summer tournament and was burning with enthusiasm for the upcoming year.</p><p class="calibre3">Both positions are understandable, but......</p><p class="calibre3">"What are you guys doing?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara returns to the scene of the conflict and raises his voice.</p><p class="calibre3">He intervenes between the two and creates some distance.</p><p class="calibre3">"Why are you fighting?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">""Because this guy is......""</p><p class="calibre3">From each person's perspective, the other was at fault. Well, that's natural.</p><p class="calibre3">Having somewhat understood the situation, Kakihara clenches his molars and sighs.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sigh... As a member of the baseball club, you want to do more club activities, and as a class, you want him to dedicate more time to preparations. That's what this is about, right?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">In response to Kakihara's question, each party nods.</p><p class="calibre3">"You understand that you two have each standpoint, don't you?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">""...""</p><p class="calibre3">"But do you also understand that there are times when compromises have to be made?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Both remain silent as they listen to Kakihara's words.</p><p class="calibre3">What they need at that moment is time to calm down.</p><p class="calibre3">It's not like they hate each other.</p><p class="calibre3">If possible, neither of them wanted to use strong words. It should be that way.</p><p class="calibre3">"Put yourself in the other person's shoes and try to think." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">The two look at each other awkwardly.</p><p class="calibre3">Then they seemed to achieve some kind of understanding about each other.</p><p class="calibre3">"...I'm sorry. The club is also important. I've always wanted you to put "club activities" aside, but that's just how committed you are to it, isn't it?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry too...... I mean, you also want to make the school festival a success as an executive committee member. We were thinking the same thing."</p><p class="calibre3">The executive committee member who wanted to make the cultural festival a success and the baseball club captain who had to lead the members to advance in the next year.</p><p class="calibre3">Indeed, their standpoints as leaders were the same.</p><p class="calibre3">"Starting tomorrow, we'll reduce the practice time a bit. When it comes to carrying heavy things or things like that, don't hesitate to ask us for help."</p><p class="calibre3">"Understood. I'll do that!"</p><p class="calibre3">The tense atmosphere in the hallway eases.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara lets out a sigh of relief, understanding that the matter has been resolved.</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you, Kakihara. I was a little too preoccupied with myself."</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm glad you guys are able to reconcile. Well then, I'll take my leave......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, Kakihara leaves the scene, walking quickly as if he were busy.</p><p class="calibre3">Unbeknownst to them, the onlookers have returned to their usual tasks, and time begins to flow as if nothing had happened.</p><p class="calibre3">"Whoa, Kakihara-kun is amazing after all." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">I nod in agreement with Yukio's words.</p><p class="calibre3">I guess you could call him charismatic. I feel that his words can easily reach many people.</p><p class="calibre3">Every word he says is persuasive.</p><p class="calibre3">(There's no way he's unpopular...)</p><p class="calibre3">Because he is excellent, there are girls who send warm gazes to his departing back even now.</p><p class="calibre3">Yes, there's no way he's unpopular.</p><p class="calibre3">And yet, despite that――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, Shidou-kun! Have you seen Kakihara-kun?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Aah, Nikaido-san. If it's Yuusuke-kun, he walked over there." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see, thank you." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">Why does this person always overlook all of his good points?</p><p class="calibre3">It's almost impressive.</p><p class="calibre3">With just this one girl, she can turn the guy named Kakihara Yuusuke, who seems to have been born with all fortune, into an unfortunate character.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">After seeing Nikaido leave the classroom to look for Kakihara, Yukio and I continued making the signboard.</p><p class="calibre3">After about an hour of concentrating on our work, a girl who has been working elsewhere calls out to someone in the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry! Is there anyone who can go throw away the cardboards?"</p><p class="calibre3">Looking there, I notice that there are cardboard remnants used for carrying materials and decorations piled up in a corner of the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">Certainly, it's becoming quite obstructive.</p><p class="calibre3">"...Oh, are you going to take care of that, Rintaro?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I am. I'm feeling a bit stiff, so I'll go for a change of pace." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay. Then I'll continue here." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, thanks. For the trouble, I'll buy you a drink on my way back." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, then I'll ask for something carbonated." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Got it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I stand up and approach the girl who has called out.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll take care of it. Is it okay to dispose of them behind the school building?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, thank you, Shidou-kun! Yeah, there's a place to throw it away behind the school building. There might be things that other classes have thrown away, so it should be easy to find."</p><p class="calibre3">"Understood." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I bundle up the piled-up cardboard with duct tape to some extent and lift it up.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though it's just cardboard, it becomes quite heavy when there's this much.</p><p class="calibre3">And because it's quite bulky, it might be a bit difficult for the girl to carry.</p><p class="calibre3">"Heave-ho..." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I carry the cardboard on my shoulder and head towards the back of the school building.</p><p class="calibre3">As she has described, there's indeed a designated area where cardboard and other items have been discarded.</p><p class="calibre3">It's easy to spot, which is convenient.</p><p class="calibre3">After tossing the cardboard onto the trash pile, I dust off my hands and turn my heel to walk away.</p><p class="calibre3">However, when I look ahead, I notice a familiar face and can't help but stop in my tracks.</p><p class="calibre3">"Otosaki, did the agency tell you not to date guys after all?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? ......Well, they haven't explicitly told me that." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">There, leaning against the wall of the school building, is Rei. In front of her stood a tall, blond-haired guy.</p><p class="calibre3">I vaguely remember him as someone from Class B, named Kinjou or something like that.</p><p class="calibre3">If I have to describe him more precisely, he's the kind of "a popular guy wannabe" who hung out with the suchlike people, acted like they were the coolest, and were always shouting and making a big fuss.</p><p class="calibre3">His catchphrase is "Isn't it f*cking awesome?".</p><p class="calibre3">――――Sorry, that's a bit biased.</p><p class="calibre3">To be honest, I don't know him well enough to know his catchphrase. However, you probably have a rough idea of what kind of person he is.</p><p class="calibre3">Incidentally, when two blondes stand next to each other, it is a bit dazzling.</p><p class="calibre3">Although I think Rei's hair color is more beautiful.</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, they don't seem to notice me at the moment.</p><p class="calibre3">So this is my chance to quietly slip away.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, how about secretly dating me?"</p><p class="calibre3">The moment I hear those words, I instinctively hide behind the pile of trash.</p><p class="calibre3">What the h*ll is that idiot thinking?</p><p class="calibre3">(And why did I even hide...?)</p><p class="calibre3">This situation... It would have been much better to leave right away, as it might have led to an unexpectedly good outcome, but I ended up staying, unable to move.</p><p class="calibre3">Who the h*ll would want to witness someone else's confession scene?</p><p class="calibre3">Besides, who would have thought that it would be her――――</p><p class="calibre3">"I mean, I recently became a model, right? I've even got contact information for celebrities now. This is a straight path to success, isn't it? If you date me, you'll definitely benefit in the future."</p><p class="calibre3">"..." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"School festival is coming up, right? Let's go around together. It'll be okay even if we get caught, won't it? I mean, if the other person is me, everyone will understand."</p><p class="calibre3">"I understand what you're saying, but I'm sorry. I can't date you." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Huh? What?"</p><p class="calibre3">A deep furrow appears on Kinjou's forehead.</p><p class="calibre3">"You know, aren't you getting a bit ahead of yourself? You may be an idol, but you're just a girl, you know? Why don't you just follow my word obediently?"</p><p class="calibre3">"I've said it multiple times, but I'm sorry. I can't date you, and I don't want to." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Are you being serious?"</p><p class="calibre3">Rei nods without hesitation in response to Kinjou's words. In the face of her resolute attitude, he clicks his tongue.</p><p class="calibre3">"Tch... You'll regret this for sure."</p><p class="calibre3">It's a rather petty parting remark.</p><p class="calibre3">Since it didn't escalate to a big incident, I pat my chest and let out a sigh of relief.</p><p class="calibre3">I had thought I would have to intervene somehow, but it was a relief that everything ended peacefully.</p><p class="calibre3">However, despite this relief, I can't shake the sense that something is still bothering me.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Anyway, I can't linger like this forever.</p><p class="calibre3">As I'm about to step out from behind the trash pile, Rei, who senses my presence, turns her gaze toward me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, why are you here?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I came to throw away some garbage, and then suddenly a confession scene unfolded right in front of me. So I couldn't leave." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry about that." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"No need to apologize...... Did Kinjou call you out?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. He said he wanted to talk, and when I followed him, he suddenly asked me out." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei recounts the events calmly, without any signs of upset.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems like she had grown accustomed to such situations somehow.</p><p class="calibre3">"Even after becoming an idol, things like this still happen, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not that many, but it hasn't gone away. Some people say it's for making memories, and there are also some people like the one earlier who have some strange confidence. Honestly, it's a bit of a nuisance." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">There's no sign of excitement or any such emotion, and Rei has a somewhat tired expression.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, I'm glad you didn't fall for some weird guy. Otherwise, my efforts of holding back for you girls' dreams would have been in vain." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you mean?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? What do I mean......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">――――What do I mean, I wonder?</p><p class="calibre3">I tilt my head and reconsider my words.</p><p class="calibre3">Am I holding something back?</p><p class="calibre3">I feel like I have a crack in a tank where I have been storing something away, and that something is starting to leak out, but I can't quite grasp it.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't afford to ignore this feeling.</p><p class="calibre3">With that unsettling premonition in mind, I shake my head and shift my focus away.</p><p class="calibre3">"Everyone is probably still preparing, so let's head back. It would be troublesome if we were seen slacking off." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Mm, okay." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei offers a faint smile and walks alongside me.</p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, Rintaro, have you ever been confessed to before?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Hmm...... Well, it's not like I've never been, but I guess you could say it's happened once." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you mean?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's see, if you include a confession from kindergarten, then yes. if you exclude it, then there hadn't been any." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I can't exactly brag about confessions from when I was five or six years old. It was undoubtedly an expression of genuine feelings, but I think it was quite different from the emotions that high school students experienced.</p><p class="calibre3">So, I didn't really count it.</p><p class="calibre3">But I'm not disparaging it either.</p><p class="calibre3">"When I was in kindergarten, there was a girl who really liked me. She said she wanted to marry me when we were older." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"And what did you respond?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? Ah...... I mean, I understood that it was impossible, so I think I told her it would be okay if we were boyfriend and girlfriend. After that, we graduated, and we went to different schools. We haven't seen each other in over ten years now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">It was the kind of cute puppy love that young children might experience. Thinking back on those hazy memories, I can't help but feel a little warmth.</p><p class="calibre3">"If my memory serves right, her name was Yuzu――――Eh, what's with that face." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......It's nothing." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">I suddenly turn my gaze to Rei, who is wearing an unusual pout, showing her displeasure.</p><p class="calibre3">Her expression is more openly displeasure than when she had watched me and Kanon goofing around the first time we met with jealous eyes.</p><p class="calibre3">But even that expression has a charm of its own, and it makes me smile a bit.</p><p class="calibre3">"Was it boring to you? That story." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It wasn't a story I particularly wanted to hear." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see. Then please just forget about it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...I'm lying. I'm not so childish as to dislike that kind of story." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that so? Then let's leave it at that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I decided that it was a good thing the conversation ended here.</p><p class="calibre3">If she delves any deeper into the story, I might start recalling more about that childhood story.</p><p class="calibre3">(First love, huh...)</p><p class="calibre3">The person who fits that description best would undoubtedly be that girl from kindergarten.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though I have no romantic feelings for her right now, I can't help but wish that she's out there somewhere, living a happy life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">Several days have passed since I witnessed Rei being confessed to.</p><p class="calibre3">Today, exactly one week before the cultural festival, I stand before a few of my classmates in the home economics room.</p><p class="calibre3">"So, Shidou-kun, can you teach us how to make transparent warabimochi?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I'll give it a try, but I can't guarantee it'll be easy to understand." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I give a feigned modest smile in response to Nikaido and look down at the ingredients in front of me.</p><p class="calibre3">Potato starch, mineral water, sugar, ice, soybean flour, and brown sugar syrup.</p><p class="calibre3">With these ingredients, we have everything we need.</p><p class="calibre3">"First, put the potato starch, sugar, and water in a pot in the specified amounts and mix them over low heat." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm demonstrating my instructions, putting the ingredients into the pot and setting the stove to low heat.</p><p class="calibre3">"After stirring over low heat for a while, the mixture will gradually become transparent, at which point you don't need to heat it anymore. Place it on a damp cloth and continue stirring for a while." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Being careful not to get burned, I stir the mixture, and the gooey liquid gradually transforms into a solid.</p><p class="calibre3">Once it reaches that stage, the final steps are easy.</p><p class="calibre3">"Cut the solidified mixture into bite-sized pieces, place them on paper plates, sprinkle soybean flour over them, and drizzle brown sugar syrup on top. That's how you complete the transparent warabimochi-like dessert." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">""WHOA...""</p><p class="calibre3">The students in charge of the kitchen, including Nikaido, express their amazement.</p><p class="calibre3">It's tasting time, each of them picking up the paper plates with warabimochi and eating them with toothpicks.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's delicious!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Great...... Well, the cooking itself is quite simple, so I don't think it's too difficult a task to do. Just be cautious with the heat. Low heat is sufficient, so try to minimize the risk of accidents by not turning up the heat too high." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're right. As long as we're careful with that, it doesn't seem too difficult." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">With Nikaido seeming satisfied and convinced, I let out a sigh of relief.</p><p class="calibre3">While we have other snacks planned for the actual day of the festival, this transparent warabimochi will likely be the main attraction due to its novelty.</p><p class="calibre3">With this, I have been able to contribute to the class to some extent.</p><p class="calibre3">"Now, let's make sure to prepare it ourselves the day before and double-check everything. Can you all go back to your respective tasks for today?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">At Nikaido's call, the classmates who have gathered here return to their preparations.</p><p class="calibre3">I remain in the kitchen, as there are still dishes to be cleaned up. So I pour the soap onto a sponge and begin washing the pot.</p><p class="calibre3">"Shidou-kun, you're really amazing, aren't you?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I'm focused on doing the dishes, I'm unexpectedly addressed by Nikaido, who has stayed behind for some reason. I can't help but look up.</p><p class="calibre3">"Your cooking skills and your kindness... Just having you around makes me feel so safe." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Haha, you're giving me too much credit." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, I'm not!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">Nikaido strongly denies my words, nervously fidgeting with her fingertips in front of her navel.</p><p class="calibre3">It gives off an impression of her being embarrassed or shy.</p><p class="calibre3">"...Hey, Shidou-kun. If you're okay." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Would you like to spend time together at the campfire during the closing party?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">――――Honestly, I have anticipated this topic to come up.</p><p class="calibre3">In fact, our school's post-festival closing party includes not only the stage performances but also a campfire held in the center of the schoolyard.</p><p class="calibre3">Though it's called a campfire, it's not like we're going to dance folk dances or anything.</p><p class="calibre3">Teachers bring snacks, and around the campfire, we can also enjoy the stage performances, so everyone spends the evening as they please.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, I heard you're going to be on stage, so it's fine afterward, but..." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">I lower my gaze to think for a moment.</p><p class="calibre3">If I were to decline, it would surely hurt her feelings. Even though I have little experience in romance, I understand that much.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Sorry, there's someone who I want to spend time with." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Even so, I have an answer already predetermined.</p><p class="calibre3">"I see. No, it's okay. I just thought I'd ask." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks for asking me. I appreciate it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay... If there's another chance, maybe you can invite me." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sure, I'll keep that in mind." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Nikaido seems somewhat shocked, hesitating about what to do, and eventually chooses to leave the scene.</p><p class="calibre3">Maybe it would have been better to start with this from the beginning.</p><p class="calibre3">I've been lying and evading quite a bit.</p><p class="calibre3">While I thought I was being tossed around by them, from Nikaido's perspective, it was the opposite.</p><p class="calibre3">I was the one who was tossing her around.</p><p class="calibre3">Finally realizing this, I feel a pang of guilt.</p><p class="calibre3">The only saving grace is that we hadn't had a clear conversation about our relationship.</p><p class="calibre3">"Nikaido-san!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">I call out to her as she's about to leave the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">Surprised, she turns toward me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Take care of Yuusuke-kun, okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......? Y-yes, got it." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">With a final tilt of her head, she leaves the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">&nbsp;(That was unnecessary meddling...)</p><p class="calibre3">I understand that my actions are somewhat intrusive.</p><p class="calibre3">However, it just slips out.</p><p class="calibre3">I just hope she'll take a look at what Yuusuke is doing, even if it's just a little.</p><p class="calibre3">From her perspective, I think she doesn't have any obligation to do that, but I can't help but want his efforts to be rewarded.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Now then." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Here's where the problem arises.</p><p class="calibre3">I had mentioned that I already had someone I wanted to invite, but to be honest, I hadn't decided on anyone at all.</p><p class="calibre3">Refusing without a reason like "I don't want to spend the cultural festival with you" would be difficult, and it would leave too much of an aftermath, making it terrifying.</p><p class="calibre3">I somehow thought I would spend time with Kashihara and Doumoto after the performance, and if they had someone else to spend time with, I thought I would naturally be with Yukio――――.</p><p class="calibre3">However, the way I phrased it earlier clearly sounded like I wanted to invite a girl.</p><p class="calibre3">Being seen with a boy would only lead to unnecessary misunderstandings.</p><p class="calibre3">"The worst-case scenario would be dressing up Yukio as a girl... No, that's not good." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Using Yukio like that won't be fair to him, and I don't want to be misunderstood as having an interest in cross-dressed Inaba Yukio.</p><p class="calibre3">So, what should I do?</p><p class="calibre3">(......I can't think of anyone but Rei.)</p><p class="calibre3">I hold my head in my hands with my wet hands after finishing washing the dishes.</p><p class="calibre3">If I have to spend special time with someone of the opposite sex, Rei will be the one.</p><p class="calibre3">That's my honest feeling.</p><p class="calibre3">But that will be difficult too.</p><p class="calibre3">To avoid being seen together by others, I deliberately turned down Rei's invitation.</p><p class="calibre3">I have to think of something clever...</p><p class="calibre3">"......Hmm?"</p><p class="calibre3">When I'm about to return to my classroom for the time being, my smartphone in my uniform pocket vibrates.</p><p class="calibre3">Looking at the screen, I get a message from the Line group created by Kakihara and Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">[Let's meet in front of the station tomorrow at 13.00! Don't forget to bring your instrument, okay!]</p><p class="calibre3">The one who sent it is Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">Since I have already read it, I immediately reply with "Got it".</p><p class="calibre3">Tomorrow is finally the first rehearsal.</p><p class="calibre3">Hmm, I have too many things to think about and now, my stomach is starting to hurt......</p>
