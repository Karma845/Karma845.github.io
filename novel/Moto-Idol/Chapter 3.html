<h3>Chapter 3: New Semester</h3>

<p class="calibre3">Plucking the strings with my fingers, I make a sound.</p><p class="calibre3">It's a lively melody with a resonating bass, but just before the chorus ends, the sound disappears as soon as my fingers stop.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I can't concentrate at all." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre3">I release my hand from the strings and lean back against the couch.</p><p class="calibre3">It has already been three days since I went on a date with Mia.</p><p class="calibre3">Our agreement was to spend time as temporary lovers until Rei returns.</p><p class="calibre3">And that agreement ends today.</p><p class="calibre3">Originally, Rei's absence was estimated to be about a week, but it seems that her work finished smoothly, and she will be coming back this evening.</p><p class="calibre3">Since that date, if asked if I had done anything special with Mia, I would answer no.</p><p class="calibre3">At most, I just helped her with her summer homework, if it counted?</p><p class="calibre3">Honestly, I'm glad that I didn't have to do anything more embarrassing than that.</p><p class="calibre3">However――――</p><p class="calibre3">(Why do I...... feel so awkward?)</p><p class="calibre3">Until yesterday, I was with Mia, and from today, I will be with Rei. I feel a sense of guilt, as if I'm switching between women, and with that thought my mood is not good.</p><p class="calibre3">(And, why do I have to be so restless?)</p><p class="calibre3">That's right. It's not like I'm dating anyone, so I should just think of it as hanging out with a friend.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Even if I convince myself with that, my heart is still clouded.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Are you okay?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Whoa!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">A voice suddenly sounds next to my ear, and I turn around with a surprised voice.</p><p class="calibre3">Standing there is Rei, with a surprised expression just like mine. She blinks a few times while looking at me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry, I didn't expect you to be so surprised like that." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"W-when... did you come back?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Just now. I opened the door and came in normally. Then I realized that Rintaro didn't notice me at all, so I decided to call out to you." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... sorry. I was lost in thought." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I stand up and gesture for Rei to sit on the couch instead, then head towards the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"I'm thinking of making iced coffee, do you want some?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, I want some. It was really hot when I came back." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Alright, wait a moment." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Unlike making regular coffee, when making iced coffee, you need to consider the amount of ice and brew the coffee stronger.</p><p class="calibre3">However, the process itself doesn't change much.</p><p class="calibre3">Just use more beans and make it with the same amount of water as usual.</p><p class="calibre3">Put ice in a glass and pour the strong and hot coffee over it.</p><p class="calibre3">When the ice melts, it will be the perfect strength.</p><p class="calibre3">"I've added coffee creamer and gomme syrup. Let me know if it feels off and I'll adjust it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei takes the glass from me and sips the coffee with the straw I prepared.</p><p class="calibre3">"Mmm, taste good. It's just right." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see. Then I'll make it with the same recipe next time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's because you're so proficient like this that I can't leave you, Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're exaggerating." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Feeling somewhat content, I also sit on the sofa and sip the iced coffee.</p><p class="calibre3">The cold coffee flows into my stomach, calming down my restless thoughts.</p><p class="calibre3">"You finished work pretty quickly, didn't you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. It was a shoot for a small commercial to be aired on video sites and such, but the required duration suddenly became shorter, so we finished in about half the time." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"W-what?" (Rintaro)</p>


<p class="calibre3">"Is it true that you went on a date with Mia?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">――――Suddenly, my sweat bursts out.</p><p class="calibre3">I feel a sensation as if all the moisture in my body has evaporated, and my throat becomes suddenly dry.</p><p class="calibre3">(No, wait, this is strange, isn't it?)</p><p class="calibre3">Right. Why do I have to react like a cheating husband who got caught?</p><p class="calibre3">I haven't done anything wrong.</p><p class="calibre3">Yea, I'll go with that feeling.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, well, yeah. She wanted to know what it feels like to be a lover for her next job, so I cooperated." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Hmm, it sounds like I'm making excuses, doesn't it? This is troublesome.</p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, how do you know about that?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Mia was flaunting it in front of me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei shows me her smartphone screen with a perpetually displeased expression.</p><p class="calibre3">On it, there was a photo of me and Mia making heart signs with our hands in the photo box.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing it again like this, it's truly embarrassing from the bottom of my heart.</p><p class="calibre3">"......That's unfair. I want to go on a date with Rintaro too." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, umm... haven't we done that a few times already?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's true. But I want more." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei leans forward, and our faces come close together.</p><p class="calibre3">A slightly different scent is tickling my nostrils, maybe it's because she used a different shampoo than usual while she was out.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if I try not to be conscious of it at this distance, my heart starts pounding.</p><p class="calibre3">"I...... I understand. I'll go along with what you want to do next time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Really?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. We can go out together again, or if there's something else you want to do, that's fine too." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, I want us to go around the school festival together." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">The school festival, huh?</p><p class="calibre3">I start thinking with a calm head again.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"No... that wouldn't do, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Why?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Going around the school together like that would be like inviting suspicion. It's practically suicidal." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Even if I try to push it by using the excuse of being relatives, it still feels unnatural to enjoy the cultural festival together.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if most people were convinced, it would still be troublesome if some doubted it.</p>


<p class="calibre3">"You have...... a point. Then I'll think of something else." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, I feel like you're gaining more rights to casually make me listen to what you say, aren't you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's just your imagination." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's unreasonable......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">What a lass, she leaves no room for carelessness or vulnerability.</p><p class="calibre3">(Well, it's fine.)</p><p class="calibre3">It seems I still can't resist Rei's pleas after all.</p><p class="calibre3">And by being asked like this, the guilt I felt before fades away.</p><p class="calibre3">I have to admit that, even my own mind is simple.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you going to take a break from work for a while?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yup. I have a lot of free time in my schedule. Since students must be struggling with summer vacation assignments, I was given extra time off." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"And what about your idol activities? Are you taking a break too?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Something like that." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">So, from today onwards, I'll be able to cook for Rei almost every day.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm... Since work has settled down, I'll make a feast today." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that okay?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks to your hard work, I can live in this apartment, so doing this is no sweat." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre3">I knew Rei would come back, so I bought the ingredients properly.</p><p class="calibre3">This should be enough to make a slightly luxurious meal.</p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, what do you want to have?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, I want a hamburg steak?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay, leave it to me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I pick up an apron and say so in a slightly cool manner.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">The peaceful time of summer break for students passed by in the blink of an eye, and the new semester arrived.</p><p class="calibre3">After finishing the opening ceremony in the lingering heat, the next day came.</p><p class="calibre3">The classes for the new semester have already begun, and during our lunch break session, some classmates wear weary expressions.</p><p class="calibre3">As usual, I sit across from Yukio at our desks, eating lunch and engaging in small talk.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, did you properly put away the mug cup we bought the other day?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Of course. I washed it and put it away neatly for when you came." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, that's good then. Yeah." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">As he says that, Yukio has a satisfied expression on his face.</p><p class="calibre3">In the second half of summer break, as promised, I went to buy a mug cup with Yukio. I vividly remember Yukio excitedly picking out a cup with a dolphin character similar to the one Rei and I used.</p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, how's your bass practicing?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Bass practicing? Umm... about that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Is it not in good progress?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, it's not that. I practice every day without fail, and I'm getting better――――I think. but I haven't practiced with the other two even once, so I can't really say." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see... I'm not familiar with instruments, but it seems like it's quite difficult to harmonize with other instruments." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm not a particularly cooperative person, and in terms of skills, I'm still a beginner who has been playing for less than a month.</p><p class="calibre3">To be honest, I've been anxious for about a week now, and there have been times when I didn't know what to do because my growth seemed to be slowing down.</p><p class="calibre3">"Right now, it's like this, but as the performance approaches, we're planning to rent a studio for practice, so I'm not too worried." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Heh, I see. I'm looking forward to seeing you play the bass, Rintaro. Do your best." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I'll do everything I can." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I touch my fingertips, which have become hardened from pressing down on the strings all this time.</p><p class="calibre3">It makes me a little bit proud that I can be so engrossed in something other than household chores.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm...... Anyway, what's the afternoon class today?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's to decide what we're going to put on for the school festival. It's only a month left after all." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Our school has a lot of students, so the school festival itself is quite large.</p><p class="calibre3">Every class puts in all their efforts, and there are even new students who chose this school because they wanted to experience and participate in our school festival.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"What did we do last year?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You forgot? We had a food stall. There was a disagreement about whether to have a takoyaki or yakisoba at the festival, so we ended up having both." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh yeah, there was." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm starting to remember.</p><p class="calibre3">We opened four different stalls in the classroom: yakisoba, takoyaki, cotton candy, and shaved ice.</p><p class="calibre3">"Last year was quite successful, but I wonder how it will be this year." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, as long as we don't choose the wrong theme, there shouldn't be any failures." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, that's true. Our class has a lot of serious people after all." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">As the start of a big event approaches, there is a slightly restless atmosphere in the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">It's evidence that many people are looking forward to it.</p><p class="calibre3">Time passes, and it's after school.</p><p class="calibre3">As we sit at our desks waiting, our homeroom teacher, Harukawa Yuri-sensei, enters the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">After we finish the greetings, Harukawa-sensei clears her throat and begins to speak.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, this season has come again. Let's decide on the theme for our long-awaited school festival!" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"""OOOOH!"""</p><p class="calibre3">Cheers rise from the enthusiastic classmates.</p><p class="calibre3">I hope we don't end up with a troublesome theme, looking up at this high tension.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, yes, it seems like everyone is motivated. Before we get into a serious meeting, shall we decide on the school festival committee member first?" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"""......"""</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, hey, stop blatantly lowering the tension." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">Well, that position is the most bothersome after all. I can understand why everyone's tension drops.</p><p class="calibre3">To be honest, as long as I can avoid being a committee member, it's fine with me, no matter what the performance is.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"Sigh...... Well, for the time being, anyone who wants to be a committee member is fine." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">Harukawa-sensei calls out to us so.</p><p class="calibre3">What follows is a probing among classmates.</p><p class="calibre3">Gazes filled with the wish for someone to do it are flying around the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I knew it would come to this, makes Sensei a little sad. Well! I understand the feeling though!" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">Sensei sympathizes that this task is bothersome.</p><p class="calibre3">"But if we leave it like this, nothing will be decided. Should we try the usual recommendation method next? Is there anyone who can be entrusted with this?" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">And so it begins.</p><p class="calibre3">The recommendation for the school festival committee member is nothing more than the selection of a sacrificial lamb.</p><p class="calibre3">Once recommended here, it goes without saying that it's difficult to refuse.</p><p class="calibre3">And because everyone understands that, it's also difficult to betray their friends.</p><p class="calibre3">――――That being said.</p><p class="calibre3">And also, it's only natural that no one will speak up in this situation.</p><p class="calibre3">".......Sigh. Last year, you guys decided quite easily." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">That was because we didn't understand the harshness of being on the school festival committee.</p><p class="calibre3">By now, the freshmen must have decided easily.</p><p class="calibre3">And the serious one who unintentionally became the sacrifice will bear the brunt.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, there's no helping it. Then...... how about you, Kakihara-kun? I think you're quite suited for it." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh, m-me...?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Everyone's gaze turns towards Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that this year's sacrifice has been decided.</p><p class="calibre3">"I-if it's Kakihara, we can trust it on him with peace of mind!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah! He's the perfect person for it!"</p><p class="calibre3">"I've always thought he was dependable!"</p><p class="calibre3">Everyone starts raising their voices all at once.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara has already been completely locked on.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, even if someone were put in this situation, they would unhesitatingly refuse. At least, that's what I would do.</p><p class="calibre3">However, due to Kakihara's personality――――</p><p class="calibre3">"......I-I understand! I will live up to everyone's expectations!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"""OOOHH!"""</p><p class="calibre3">――――This is how it turned out.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As if it had been planned in advance, Kakihara is chosen to be the school festival committee member.</p><p class="calibre3">But, to put it this way, there is no doubt that he is the most qualified person for it.</p><p class="calibre3">He is recognized by everyone as an honor student, and he does not belong to any clubs or committees, so he doesn't have to juggle multiple responsibilities.</p><p class="calibre3">In terms of logic alone, there's no one more suited for the role.</p><p class="calibre3">"Alright! So Kakihara-kun is decided as the committee member! Class representative Nikaido-san, please support Kakihara-kun from now on." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes... understood." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">When Nikaido is requested so, I can see Kakihara making a small victory pose in the corner of my vision.</p><p class="calibre3">(I see...... Kakihara, you're surprisingly a tactician.)</p><p class="calibre3">The school festival committee usually consists of one person from each class, but it is customary for class representatives to assist in some way.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">The reason it is described as 'customary' is because it is not officially mandated as part of the system.</p><p class="calibre3">At least in the class overseen by Harukawa-sensei, this is how the system works.</p><p class="calibre3">The class representative must prioritize assisting the school festival committee over the regular duties, which inevitably increases their time together.</p><p class="calibre3">However, this situation can be seen as the best preparation for the festival.</p><p class="calibre3">While it may not be commendable for personal interests to be involved in the committee's work, I don't mind at all.</p><p class="calibre3">He's taking care of our troubles for the sake of his own romantic pursuits.</p><p class="calibre3">Rather, I believe there should be some kind of reward for his efforts.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"Then, I'll leave the rest to Kakihara-kun and Nikaido-san?" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Understood." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara and Nikaido stand up and take their place at the teacher's desk, replacing Harukawa-sensei.</p><p class="calibre3">"Now, let's decide on what we're going to present right away. Can those with opinions raise their hands?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">And so, the discussion smoothly transitions to the topic of what to put on the school festival.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara listens to the opinions while Nikaido writes them on the blackboard.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that this format is established without much discussion between both of them, perhaps due to their long-standing relationship.</p><p class="calibre3">"Me, me! I want to suggest a haunted house!"</p><p class="calibre3">"A haunted house, huh? It's a classic as the first suggestion." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">One boy's opinion is added to the blackboard.</p><p class="calibre3">During our freshmen time, the haunted house, which is relatively a popular attraction, was handled by the sophomores under the authority of the grade.</p><p class="calibre3">Or rather, it could be said that the popular attractions were all monopolized by the sophomores.</p><p class="calibre3">It was somewhat inevitable, as the seniors were struggling with entrance exams, and the sophomores already understood the know-how and had more freedom to act.</p><p class="calibre3">As a result, the sophomores' requests were more likely to be granted.</p><p class="calibre3">"What about something like a show? Like a theater or a dance show, something in the performance category."</p><p class="calibre3">"A show, huh... It sounds quite challenging, but it also sounds worthwhile." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">One girl's opinion is added to the blackboard, adding up the choices to two.</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll hear more suggestions about the content of the show after all the opinions have been given. Now, please share other ideas." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... How about a café? I think it's also a classic."</p><p class="calibre3">"Sounds good. Since the sophomores were mainly in charge of the café last year, everyone might have been holding back their frustrations." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara jokingly says so, and laughter erupts among us.</p><p class="calibre3">Most of our classmates can relate to it.</p><p class="calibre3">The café is also a popular attraction on par with the haunted house, and last year it was, as expected, monopolized by the current seniors.</p><p class="calibre3">It's no wonder that many of them are fired up about it this year.</p><p class="calibre3">By the way, I'm the type who's pretty much fine with anything as long as it's not too much of a hassle.</p><p class="calibre3">It's not like I really want to do a café or haunted house, so for now, I'll just go along with the atmosphere and laugh.</p><p class="calibre3">"Feel free to express your opinions. It's okay to have as many opinions as you want here." (Yuusuke)</p>
<p class="calibre3">In times like this, Kakihara is definitely reliable.</p><p class="calibre3">With his precise leadership, the brainstorming proceeded quite smoothly.</p><p class="calibre3">And through voting, the idea of a café, which everyone had admired, ended up surviving.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I guess it's reasonable up to this point.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Alright, then we'll go with a café. The question is what kind of café we'll present... Do you have any opinions, Azusa?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Me? Hmm... Maybe a Japanese-style café. It would be fun if the girls dressed in kimonos and the boys in jinbeis served the customers, don't you think?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's a good idea! Write it down for now." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">There might be a slight bias in Kakihara's excitement, but Nikaido's opinion itself is not bad.</p><p class="calibre3">There's no need for flashy decorations, and if we make traditional Japanese sweets like clear warabimochi, it'll still attract attention and become a hot topic within the school. And in fact, the process of making it is surprisingly simple.</p><p class="calibre3">After several ideas were proposed, the final choices narrowed down to "Japanese-style café," "Maid-butler café," and "Cross-dressing café."</p><p class="calibre3">While it's only the classic choices that still remained. It's understandable because most high school students yearn for them.</p><p class="calibre3">"We surprisingly made it this far smoothly. Now, let's decide which genre to go with through another voting." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Kakihara! Before that, I have a question!"</p><p class="calibre3">Just as they are about to move on to another voting, a lively boy raises his hand.</p>


<p class="calibre3">"Hmm? What's it?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"If the maid café chosen, will Otosaki-san also cosplay?"</p><p class="calibre3">With those words, everyone's (mostly boys) attention turned to Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">Until now, she has been mostly on the sidelines, but now she wears an expression of confusion as she suddenly becomes the center of attention.</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh...... Me?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"EEH?! I wanna see Otosaki-san in a maid outfit!"</p><p class="calibre3">Following that, the excited voices of the girls could be heard.</p><p class="calibre3">Being able to see a popular idol dressed in a maid outfit up close is not something that happens often.</p><p class="calibre3">For fans, it would be a once-in-a-lifetime experience and a lasting memory.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I don't think I can do it on the first day because the general public will also come, but I think it will be fine on the second day." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"""WHOAAAAA!"""</p><p class="calibre3">How many times have I heard this cheer today?</p><p class="calibre3">The enthusiasm of my classmates is so overwhelming that even Rei, who is usually composed, looks perplexed.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, let me say this first. Otosaki-san will only participate in the school festival on the second day. On the first day, the general public can enter, and it wouldn't be good if something happened." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Understood, Sensei."&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Everyone agrees with Harukawa-sensei's words.</p><p class="calibre3">Our school's cultural festival takes place over two days, with the first day open to the public. And the second day is reserved for the students to enjoy.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">If Rei were to serve customers or walk around while the general public is present, it would be chaotic and not conducive to the festival.</p><p class="calibre3">This is a classic reminder that becoming famous is not always a good thing.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hahaha... given the current situation, it seems like it has already been concluded, but let's take a voting just to be sure." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">With a somewhat astonished expression, Kakihara asks for a show of hands, and about 80% of the class raises their hands for the maid and butler café.</p><p class="calibre3">Following the flow, I also raise my hand modestly for the maid and butler café.</p><p class="calibre3">It doesn't matter which one, but it's a safer choice to go with the majority.</p><p class="calibre3">Though, I have no ulterior motive either.</p>


<p class="calibre3">――――――Or do I?</p>
<p class="calibre3">"Then, let's decide on the menu and work distribution right away. Does anyone have any suggestions?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">In response to Kakihara's question, several hands go up.</p><p class="calibre3">All of them are the ones who have been giving opinions and suggesting ideas for the café from the beginning.</p><p class="calibre3">Tea, coffee, cola, and juices like orange juice.</p><p class="calibre3">As the drinks are mostly decided, the focus shifts to the food.</p><p class="calibre3">"The drinks are decided, I guess. Now, moving on to the foods......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Kakihara-kun, why don't we ask Shidou-kun for advice on food?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, ask Rintaro?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Nikaido mentions my name and the whole class turns their attention towards me.</p><p class="calibre3">It is so sudden that I can't hide my surprise.</p><p class="calibre3">"M... Me?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. You were really efficient during the cooking practice the other day, so I thought we could rely on you if we need to make something." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"O-oh...... so that's what you meant." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara, Nogi, and Doumoto, who were in the same group during the cooking practice, look somewhat contented.</p><p class="calibre3">And when I see Rei nodding discreetly, trying not to be noticed by everyone, I let out a small sigh.</p><p class="calibre3">"I can't think of anything right now, but I had a menu in mind that I wanted to propose if we were to have a Japanese-style cafe. It's a clear warabimochi......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Clear? What it means?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's clear because it's made with potato starch. It's not that difficult to make, and I think it can be surprisingly light." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, that sounds good! Can we take it as a suggestion for now?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, it's okay, I guess." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">The words "clear warabimochi" that I proposed are written on the blackboard.</p><p class="calibre3">It's a seriously random suggestion, but I'm relieved that no one opposed it.</p><p class="calibre3">Somehow, it's kind of embarrassing to be relied upon by my classmates like this.</p><p class="calibre3">However, it's not a bad one either.</p><p class="calibre3">"Keep conveying more of your opinions and ideas like this. The school festival is the most exciting event in our high school life, no exaggeration. That's why, let's do our best so that we won't have any regrets in the future." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara's speeches make me feel that the class is coming together more and more.</p><p class="calibre3">Although Kakihara had become more of a good-for-nothing person due to being in love, when he took the lead, his charisma was undeniable.</p><p class="calibre3">That is why, Nikaido, could you please look at the person next to you instead of me? I beg you, please.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"Hey, are you really going to cosplay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Rei)</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the night after our performance for the school festival was decided, I ask Rei who is sitting on the couch while doing the dishes.</p><p class="calibre3">She has a puzzled look on her face, as if she doesn't understand why she's being asked that question. She stops eating her vanilla ice cream cup dessert and turns her gaze toward me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well...... I'm just wondering if you're really going to cosplay......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Mmm. I think I might be causing trouble for everyone because of me, so if I can at least meet their expectations, I want to do it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"...I see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">She must be feeling guilty about not being able to participate and help on the first day and not being able to attend events due to work.</p><p class="calibre3">But even so――――</p><p class="calibre3">(Why I kind of feel somewhat uneasy......)</p><p class="calibre3">I realized that I have been washing the same plate for a while and become overwhelmed with mixed emotions as I rinse off the clinging bubbles with water.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"What is it......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Could it be that you don't want me to cosplay?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">I involuntarily flinch.</p><p class="calibre3">She hits somewhere in my heart that I had thought shouldn't exist, and this upset me to a level that surprised even me myself.</p>
<p class="calibre3">(Do I really not want Rei to cosplay......?)</p><p class="calibre3">I take a deep breath and think calmly about it.</p><p class="calibre3">I think cosplay itself is okay and she can do whatever she wants with it. Yeah, I mean this.</p><p class="calibre3">In the first place, it doesn't matter to me how others dress up, so there's no need to be against it in the first place.</p><p class="calibre3">So why do I feel unsettled――――</p><p class="calibre3">"...I don't know." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You don't know?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I've never thought about criticizing what others do......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">After rinsing off the foam on my hands and placing the last dish in the draining basket, I pick up my vanilla ice cream from the freezer and sit on the couch, just like Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry, it sounded like I was nagging you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, it's fine. I'm actually happy about it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, why?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"More importantly, your ice cream is melting, you know?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">While feeling somewhat puzzled by Rei's happy attitude, I look down at my cup of ice cream.</p><p class="calibre3">Certainly, the edges have become soft, and it's clear that it has already started to melt from my body temperature.</p><p class="calibre3">"......That's true." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Using the spoon, I scoop up the softened part and brought it to my mouth, savoring the unique smoothness of the slightly expensive ice cream as it slowly melts on my tongue.</p><p class="calibre3">This ice cream was given to me as a treat when I worked part-time at Yuzuki-sensei's place during the latter half of summer break, but it's good enough that I want to buy it with my own money next time.</p><p class="calibre3">It can even blow away my unsettled feelings――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, do boys wear butler uniforms too?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? Yeah, that was the plan." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre3">If Kakihara or Doumoto wear it, they will look decent, and considering their popularity among girls, it'll also have an impact on attracting customers.</p><p class="calibre3">Yukio's butler appearance is also likely to be popular. He is quite popular among girls as well.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you wear it too, Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. It seems like the cook and waitperson roles will be swapped between the first and second day, so I'm supposed to wear it at least once." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">What a strange conversation.</p><p class="calibre3">As I'm thinking that, Rei finishes her ice cream cup and turns towards me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro, do you want to see me in a maid outfit?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"H-huh!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I almost drop my ice cream in surprise.</p><p class="calibre3">Somehow managing to regain my composure, I meet her gaze as she blinks like a curious child asking a simple question.</p><p class="calibre3">"I want to see it. The Rintaro in a butler outfit. I'm sure it'll look cool." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"...You're expecting too much. It definitely won't be anything special." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, I'm sure it will." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I don't usually take that much care in dressing myself up, so it might have some novelty――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"But I don't want others to see you in that butler outfit too much. I know I'm asking for too much, but I want to be the first one to see you in it. Just like with the swimsuit." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"O-Oh... You're still curious as ever, huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What about you, Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want to see me in a maid outfit?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, um...... I do want to see it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Ah――――.</p><p class="calibre3">I unintentionally let out a small voice.</p><p class="calibre3">Hearing me say so, Rei smiles.</p><p class="calibre3">Right now, I have just revealed the true nature of the uneasiness I have been feeling to her.</p><p class="calibre3">It is the same feeling that Rei has towards me――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"I-I'm going to go grocery shopping......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"At this hour?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't have enough ingredients for tomorrow's lunchbox. If I don't go now, I won't make it in time for the morning." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I guess that can't be helped. Lunchbox is important." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Leaving Rei, who easily believes me when I mention the lunchbox, I stand up from the couch.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I only take my wallet, smartphone, and house keys, put on my sandals, and head outside.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I was impatient." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I sit on the flower bed in front of the apartment building, exhaling and hanging my head.</p><p class="calibre3">I feel like I've said it many times before, but maybe only Otosaki Rei can shake me up like this in my entire life.</p><p class="calibre3">The time I spend with her is pleasant, but at the slightest provocation, my composure is blown away.</p><p class="calibre3">It's really lame to run away like this, but I can't help it anyway.</p><p class="calibre3">I look up at the sky to cool down my strangely heated cheeks.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――What are you doing?"</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, I meet eyes with a familiar girl with red hair.</p><p class="calibre3">"Whoa!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"WHY are you so surprised? Or...... did a sudden appearance of a beauty like me make you flustered!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Phew, don't startle me, Kanon." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Was my voice too quiet? I didn't expect to be ignored!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not ignoring you. We're having a conversation, looking at each other." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What too convenient ears you have there!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">As always, I can't help but laugh at Kanon's loud voice on the night street.</p><p class="calibre3">She has a bag for work and a hat to obscure her face.</p><p class="calibre3">Clearly, she is on her way home from her work.</p><p class="calibre3">When I look at her face, she seems more tired than usual.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you just done with work? Good job." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks. Well, shooting a music video for a single is a piece of cake for me." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"......You seem tired though." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Well yeah. I'm pretty sure I'll be able to sleep like a log tonight." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"You must be really exhausted." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">At a time like this is my turn.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, I have something special in my room――――Ah!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? What's with that 'Oh no!' expression?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well...... come to think of it, I left Rei in my room......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Did you have a fight? It's rare to see you outside like this." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not a fight...... It's just a little awkward, or rather, embarrassing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Upon hearing my words, which have unintentionally become softer, Kanon let out an exaggerated sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><p class="calibre9">In the second half of summer break, as promised, I went to buy a mug cup with Yukio. I vividly remember Yukio excitedly picking out a cup with a dolphin character similar to the one Rei and I used.</p><p class="calibre9">"By the way, how's your bass practicing?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre9">"Bass practicing? Umm... about that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"Huh? Is it not in good progress?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre9">"No, it's not that. I practice every day without fail, and I'm getting better――――I think. but I haven't practiced with the other two even once, so I can't really say." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"I see... I'm not familiar with instruments, but it seems like it's quite difficult to harmonize with others." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre9">I'm not a particularly cooperative person, and in terms of skills, I'm still a beginner who has been playing for less than a month.</p><p class="calibre9">To be honest, I've been anxious for about a week now, and there have been times when I didn't know what to do because my growth seemed to be slowing down.</p><p class="calibre9">"Right now, it's like this, but as the performance approaches, we're planning to rent a studio for practice, so I'm not too worried." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"Heh, I see. I'm looking forward to seeing you play the bass, Rintaro. Do your best." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre9">"Yeah, I'll do everything I can." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">I touch my fingertips, which have become hardened from pressing down on the strings all this time.</p><p class="calibre9">It makes me a little bit proud that I can be so engrossed in something other than household chores.</p><p class="calibre9">"Hmm...... Anyway, what's the afternoon class today?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"It's to decide what we're going to put on for the school festival. It's only a month left after all." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre9">Our school has a lot of students, so the school festival itself is quite large.</p><p class="calibre9">Every class puts in all their efforts, and there are even new students who chose this school because they wanted to experience and participate in our school festival.</p></p>
<p class="calibre3">"Sigh, it's probably just because of Rei's casual remark that your pace is thrown off, right?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Is she an esper or something?</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon seemed to have confirmed it when I stayed silent. She lets out another big sigh.</p><p class="calibre3">I never thought I would be astonished by her――――and it's quite frustrating.</p><p class="calibre3">"Since it’s such a common occurrence, it’s no use worrying about it. It's troublesome if you get all flustered just because you're involved with an idol!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Y-yeah... I know it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">She's right.</p><p class="calibre3">Because I get too excited, I have weird expectations, and then get weirdly flustered.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Hmm, I'm starting to calm down and think rationally.</p><p class="calibre3">Finally, Shidou Rintaro felt like he has regained his footing on the ground.</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks, Kanon. I've cooled my head." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Is so, then that's good." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon crosses her arms and smiles, as if she's relieved about something.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know what that relief implies.</p><p class="calibre3">However, I know that it is something that leaked out against her will.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Therefore, I will pretend not to notice.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well then, show me that special thing you mentioned earlier." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sure. I won't let you down." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I brush off the bit of sand on my pants and stand up.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">I return to my room with Kanon, and Rei, who has remained in the living room, look at us with a surprised look.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hn, Why is Kanon with Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"We ran into each other at the entrance. I met her at the entrance. She looked tired, so I thought I'd treat her to a little something special I've been preparing for a little while." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"A special treat?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I had originally planned to save it for tomorrow, though――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I encourage Kanon to sit down on the couch and open the refrigerator.</p><p class="calibre3">"I wonder what this something special actually is? Do you have any clue of it, Kanon?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I just followed him a few minutes ago, so I don't have any clue. But the nuance seems to be that it's something that will relieve your fatigue......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">While listening to their conversation, I take out a jar filled with a golden liquid from the refrigerator.</p><p class="calibre3">The yellow-peeled fruit is sliced thin and soaked in the liquid beautifully.</p><p class="calibre3">"This is my favorite. The lemon pickled in honey." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">""OOH......."" (Rei, Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Their exclamations of admiration overlap.</p><p class="calibre3">I put it on the table in front of them, and they both begin to observe the contents of the jar.</p><p class="calibre3">"I was actually going to let them soak until tomorrow, but I thought it was already aged enough. Besides, I also wanted to see what it tasted like, so why don't you two be my test subjects?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'd love to try it. At this point, it already looks delicious." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I was also surprised at how much prettier it looked than I thought it would be. Alright, time to give these a try." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I hand out plates to both of them and each picks a slice of lemon from the jar.</p><p class="calibre3">And almost simultaneously, they put them in their mouths and their eyes widened.</p><p class="calibre3">"Whoa......th-this is too good!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"So good......!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm silently nodding at Kanon and Rei's impressions.</p><p class="calibre3">The sweetness of the honey perfectly compensates for the sourness and bitterness of the peel.</p><p class="calibre3">And while it is sweet, the lemon's unique cool, refreshing sensation seems to be addictive.</p><p class="calibre3">――――And for your information.</p><p class="calibre3">All of the lemons used in this recipe were local.</p><p class="calibre3">Although the price is a little expensive, there is a good reason why we went to the trouble of using domestically grown lemons.</p><p class="calibre3">First of all, there is little possibility of pesticides adhering to the peel.</p><p class="calibre3">Lemons imported from overseas must be stored for a long time, and measures are taken to prevent them from spoiling.</p><p class="calibre3">I honestly felt uneasy about pickling the lemon that contained additives on it.</p><p class="calibre3">Therefore, I decided to use local lemons that could be pickled as they are.</p><p class="calibre3">On a related note, if it was difficult to obtain local lemons, I could use foreign lemons with no problem if I just peeled the yellow peel off the surface with a peeler or the like.</p><p class="calibre3">It would be more work to do, but it would also shave off some of the bitter, cottony bits in the peel and make it easier to pickle.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well, that's enough for trivia.</p><p class="calibre3">I get up and head for the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre3">Then I take out three glasses and fill each a half full of ice.</p><p class="calibre3">After carrying the ice-filled glass to the table, I put the carbonated water I have chilled in the refrigerator to them.</p><p class="calibre3">"Put two spoons of honey in the glass half-filled with ice. Then top it off with the carbonated water...... and for the finishing touch, put a pickled lemon on top....... Voila, your lemon honey squash is ready." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">""WHOA!"" (Rei, Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei and Kanon's excitement levels are skyrocketing, and their sparkling eyes were directed at the glasses.</p><p class="calibre3">If I prepare the second serving in the same way, we will have enough lemon squash for three.</p><p class="calibre3">"The actual fact is, I wish I could have made this when summer was in full swing, but I genuinely forgot about to do....... Well, forget about that and just drink these." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">The three of us all slurp down our lemon squash.</p><p class="calibre3">The lemon aroma infiltrate the nose, the sweetness of honey on the tongue, and the refreshing feeling of carbonated water are pleasantly mixed together and surprised me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Delish......!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Second!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"What, already." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Aside from Kanon, who had just returned home, Rei, who had been eating and drinking a lot of things earlier, wanted a refill was somewhat out of place.</p><p class="calibre3">To be frank, it's a little late for that.</p><p class="calibre3">"It can't be helped......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">But I'm still happy to hear they praise that something I put so much time and effort into is delicious.</p><p class="calibre3">With a wry smile on my face, I make lemon squash once again.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, I made it based on the default recipe for now, but if you want to make any adjustments, feel free to use the contents of the jar. You can try making the taste a bit stronger or even add the carbonated water to make it stronger." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then I'll add a teaspoon more of it!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">After handing her a spoon to put the honey in, I'm surprised.</p><p class="calibre3">Next to Kanon, who is adding the honey in high spirits, I find Rei gulping down the lemon squash with the same momentum as before.</p><p class="calibre3">Seriously, what the heck with this lass' stomach dimension? It's too big.</p><p class="calibre3">"......*Burp*." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"H-hey!? Is it appropriate for idols to burp!? Have some self-awareness! Self-awareness!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry. I let my guard down." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, it's like the fizz in carbonated drinks just escape...... You're going to give such an analogy, right?" (Kanon) <i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: this part is hard)</i></p><p class="calibre3">"That's your exaggerated interpretation. Kanon was bombing." (Rei) <i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: this as well)</i></p><p class="calibre3">"I wasn't trying to be funny!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">She is a girl who perfectly suits the voice of "Grrrr!" no matter what.</p><p class="calibre3">"Even you don't like women who burp in front of you, right, Rintaro?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? ......No, I don't mind. It's normal for women to burp and fart, right? So, it's okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Idiot! Idols don't burp! They don't even go to the bathroom!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Which era are you come from?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I can't help but laugh at Kanon, who starts talking like a troublesome old-fashioned fan.</p><p class="calibre3">I have to say that she has a high level of professionalism, but it'll be nice if she can loosen up at least a little bit in a situation like this.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, it's not my place to say that.</p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway! Rei, be a little more careful!　Your selling point is your mysterious beauty, and if you start burping, you'll lose all your fans at once!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"......You may be right. I'll be more careful." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Good!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon nods in a grand manner to her response and then sips on her newly made lemon squash.</p><p class="calibre3">She is, after all, the most serious person in terms of work.</p><p class="calibre3">Normally, Kanon is a noisy and teasable character, but if you ask who is the most respected person in MilleSta, her name will most likely be mentioned.</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, speaking of which, Rintaro. I heard you've been practicing an instrument recently?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? Yeah, I agreed to help out a little with the festival. I'm going to play bass in a three-piece band." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is there a problem with that?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, if you don't mind, how about practicing with us?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Practicing with you...... you mean, in a band?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's what I mean." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon glances at Rei and ruffles her head.</p><p class="calibre3">"Au......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"We were discussing of trying it as a hobby between Mia and me, but this girl wasn't enthusiastic at all about it." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Because...... I prefer singing to playing instruments." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, that itself is not a problem. We didn't want to force anything either. The discussion ended when Rei said she wouldn't play the bass, but I thought if you could play the bass, this girl would only have to sing, so we brought this up again." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">As she says so, Kanon gives me a somewhat expectant look.</p><p class="calibre3">"...... From what you just said, I can deduce you and Mia have experience with musical instruments, can't I?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I've never played in front of an audience, though. I like to play the guitar, so I practiced by myself, and Mia played the drums for a while to relieve stress." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">It may be somewhat surprising, but it's not really strange.</p><p class="calibre3">Certainly, the sound of the drums feels good, and it's imaginable that the more skillful you are at playing them, the more exhilarating it feels.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you okay, Rei?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. It seems fun to do something like that together." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that Rei is also interested in it.</p><p class="calibre3">"This month, we're getting quite a bit more time off because of your school festival, and if you're willing to cooperate, I'll learn the songs that you're practicing so we can play together. What do you think of it, Rintaro? I don't think it's a bad condition." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Yeah. There's no reason for me to refuse either." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then it's settled. I'll let Mia know." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon looks truly happy and immediately pulls out her phone and begins texting in Line.</p><p class="calibre3">A band with three national idols, huh?</p><p class="calibre3">Lately, I feel like I've become able to honestly enjoy this situation.</p><p class="calibre3">Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing, I still don't know yet.</p>
