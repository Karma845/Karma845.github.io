<h3>Chapter 10: The School Festival</h3>


<p>Under the darkening sky, the orange flames of the campfire are casting light across the ground.</p><p>Kakihara and Nikaido are hanging around the campfire, chatting shyly.</p><p>Then there are Doumoto and Nogi a little further away, it seems like they are also having fun.</p><p>"This is how...... youth should be." (Rintaro)</p><p>The youth I longed for is right here.</p><p>It is a refreshing moment, different from the bitter one at the pool from before.</p><p>――――No.</p><p>Maybe it's because of those bitter moments that I can appreciate the present beauty.</p><p>Understanding something that's just a concept is tough, and I am sure that this is only a part of the formless thing called "youth". Even if it's just a little, I'm happy to have understood it.</p><p>Well, just because I understand it doesn't mean I can do anything about it.</p><p>(Man, I'm so alone.) (Rintaro)</p><p>Leaning against the school building's wall, the lonely me is absentmindedly gazing at the fire from a distance.</p><p>For Yukio, he should be dancing with Miyamoto-san around the campfire at this time, who has been showing interest in him for a while now, </p><p>Around the campfire, there are only groups of boys and girls hanging out.</p><p>Those not part of these groups are making a ruckus in their own close-knit circles.</p><p>It was inevitable for someone like me, who doesn't have any close friends or a close-knit group, to end up alone.</p><p>"It feels kinda lame to head back all by myself......" (Rintaro)</p><p>Leaving amidst all this excitement and going back alone feels a bit like being a loser, or maybe it's just a tad pitiful, to say the least.</p><p>So, I'm pretending to be cool by acting like I'm just chilling here.</p><p>But it's so boring, so I get up to leave――――and then.</p><p>"......Rintaro." </p><p>"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p>As someone calls my name, I hear footsteps approaching.</p><p>In the dim light, amidst the faint darkness, there stands Rei, back in her school uniform, taking note of her surroundings.</p><p>"Ah, Rei, huh. That was a good job." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Mm. You too." (Rei)</p><p>She seems a bit restless for some reason as she stands next to me.</p><p>I couldn't figure out what was causing her to act this way, but now, it's making me uncomfortable.</p><p>It's honestly bad for just the two of us to be seen together.</p><p>"...I was thinking of heading back now, what about you? If you still have something to do, I can go back and prepare for dinner." (Rintaro)</p><p>"I don't particularly have anything to do. But......" (Rei)</p><p>"But?" (Rintaro)</p><p>"I want you to accompany me for a little bit." (Rei)</p><p>Saying this, she takes my hand.</p><p>"H-hey...... This is bad, isn't it? If we're seen like this......" (Rintaro)</p><p>"You promised to listen me to whatever I wanted to, didn't you?" (Rei)</p><p>"True, I did promise but..." (Rintaro)</p><p>It was a promise that stemmed from the story of me and Mia going on a date, but I never thought she'd enact it right here, right now.</p><p>"I want to go where there's no one." (Rei)</p><p>"......" (Rintaro)</p><p>My heart skips a beat.</p><p>I don't understand her intentions, but Rei's unusual demeanor is unsettling my heart.</p><p>"If it's behind the school building, there won't be anyone, right?" (Rei)</p><p>"I-I think so, but..." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Shall we go there, then?" (Rei)</p><p>Why does this make my heart race?</p><p>Even though we are usually alone at home, and should be used to it, I can't stay calm right now for some reason.</p><p>Is it because of the sense of immorality――――being in the midst of others?</p><p>Behind the school building, aside from the moonlight, there are no other light sources, and there are no other people besides us.</p><p>This place, where I had witnessed Rei being approached by Kinjou during the school festival preparations, doesn't hold particularly fond memories.</p><p>"......What's gotten into you, all of a sudden?" (Rintaro)</p><p>"I just wanted to be and talk with Rintaro...... Is that a bother?" (Rei)</p><p>"I wouldn't think it's a bother for you to tell me that. But being brought here without knowing why is a little scary......" (Rintaro)</p><p>I'm not talking about just Rei here.</p><p>It's just that I'm a coward when it comes to these things.</p><p>"I didn't have anything specific to talk about. I just...... wanted to spend this time with you." (Rei)</p><p>"......How can you say such an embarrassing thing so easily." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Are you embarrassed?" (Rei)</p><p>"Well, yeah." (Rintaro)</p><p>"......How cute." (Rei)</p><p>"Don't tease me. I'm going home, okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p>Of course, I have no intention of doing it.</p><p>I sit on the steps near the back door and look up at Rei.</p><p>"Sorry. I'm a little embarrassed too." (Rei)</p><p>"It's unusual for you to say that." (Rintaro)</p><p>Rei sits next to me, being careful with the hem of her skirt. There's only a fist's width between us.</p><p>"...Kakihara-kun's confession, I'm glad it ended up being a success." (Rei)</p><p>"Yeah. The pair who should be together are together. I'm at ease too." (Rintaro)</p><p>Although the outcome is fine, I also think it was good to have practiced for today.</p><p>It was worth the trouble when the problem that had been bothering me was resolved.</p><p>"But, school might get a bit chaotic from next week." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Why's that?" (Rei)</p><p>"You know about Kakihara's popularity with the girls, right? I think some of them might cry......" (Rintaro)</p><p>I refrained from mentioning the obvious, but in reality, from the stage, it was clear that there were girls who were in despair when Kakihara's confession succeeded.</p><p>All those who had feelings for Kakihara ended up heartbroken. I'm sure Kakihara himself doesn't understand how much it will shake up the entire school.</p><p>"There were also many guys who liked Nikaido, so ultimately, when someone's love is fulfilled, it might mean the end of someone else's love." (Rintaro)</p><p>"The end of someone's... love." (Rei)</p><p>Rei repeats that part and then looks down with a troubled expression.</p><p>She might have something on her mind, but as for me, I was a little embarrassed to have my words be quoted off at random.</p><p>"Rintaro... do you have, someone you like?" (Rei)</p><p>"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p>At her sudden question, I unintentionally let out a foolish voice.</p><p>Someone I like.</p><p>I reflexively begin to think, and Rei's eyes, somewhat moist, meet mine.</p><p>The person I like――――</p><p>(......What the hell am I thinking!)</p><p>I should have left these feelings at that summer sea.</p><p>As a mere ordinary person, I shouldn't have such feelings, and it's out of the question to express them recklessly.</p><p>Rei――――Millefeuille Stars, they can reach even greater heights.</p><p>I mustn't be a hindrance to them.</p><p>"Even if I have, I wouldn't say it." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Huh, why not?" (Rei)</p><p>"Because it's embarrassing, obviously. Can you openly talk about someone you like?" (Rintaro)</p><p>"Well... it is indeed embarrassing." (Rei)</p><p>"See? So let's end this conversation." (Rintaro)</p><p>"...Okay." (Rei)</p><p>She might have some dissatisfaction, but it seems her own embarrassment won out as she readily backed down.</p><p>I breathe a sigh of relief for the time being.</p><p>However, I can't say that the situation as it is is good.</p><p>I know that Rei is popular with men, and since I actually witnessed her being approached by Kinjou, there's no doubt that there are people in the entertainment industry who are aiming to be her boyfriend.</p><p>Thinking about Rei smiling at someone else and going home to someone else's house――――.</p><p>(Yeah... I really hate it.)</p><p>I feel like this feeling itself is the answer, but let's put that aside for now.</p><p>Just imagining Rei walking happily next to someone else makes my chest feel all tangled up.</p><p>Even though we can't have a named relationship, I can't stand the thought of someone else having that kind of relationship with her.</p><p>I'm so ugly for feeling this way, and it's really cowardly, and I truly hate it.</p><p>"......Do you remember when I told you I wanted to be by your side forever, Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p>Whether she knows what was in my heart or not, Rei suddenly brings up those words.</p><p>"Of course, I remember......" (Rintaro)</p><p>"Those feelings haven't changed at all, and I don't think they ever will." (Rei)</p><p>So――――.</p><p>Rei takes a breath and continues.</p><p>"I can't express it clearly in words yet... but as long as Rintaro doesn't reject me, I'll always be by your side." (Rei)</p><p>As she says that, just like when we talked on the beach that day, Rei closed the one-fist gap between us.</p><p>Just that alone makes the anxiety that has been swelling up suddenly shrink away.</p><p>"......There's no way I'd reject you." (Rintaro)</p><p>I stand up, exposing myself to the moonlight.</p><p>A new song for the folk dance is being played in the schoolyard.</p><p>It's quite late already, so this is probably the last song.</p><p>In short, the closing party is probably coming to an end soon.</p><p>"It might be presumptuous, but you're an important place for me. As long as you say that, I'll come back to you no matter what happens." (Rintaro)</p><p>"......Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p>Realizing that something is off with me, Rei's voice is mixed with concern.</p><p>She really is sharp when it comes to me.</p><p>"It's a great opportunity. Wanna dance a little? ...Just the two of us." (Rintaro)</p><p>I invite her myself, but it feels cheesy and embarrassing, and I unconsciously scratch my cheek.</p><p>Rei smiles and stands up, lining up next to me.</p><p>"If you're okay with me, I'd be happy to." (Rei)</p><p>I reach out my hand, and Rei takes it.</p><p>Even though we have only heard the song a few times, we end up dancing surprisingly well.</p><p>It's not like we're particularly skilled, but we surprisingly have fun dancing.</p><p>"I'm flattered to be called your important place." (Rei)</p><p>"That's an exaggeration." (Rintaro)</p><p>"It's not. I'm really happy about it." (Rei)</p><p>Rei has a smile on her face that I've never seen before.</p><p>Unexpectedly, my heart is easily captured by her smile.</p><p>No matter what happens, I'll come back to her.</p><p>Yes――――<i class="calibre6">No matter what</i>.</p>
