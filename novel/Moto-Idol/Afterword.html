<h3>Afterword</h3>

Nice to meet you or long time no see. </span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">My name is Ametsuki.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thank you so much for reading this.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">I love idols myself and they give me a lot of strength every
day, so it's really fun to write a story about an idol girl.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">And this time I was very happy to write about three troubled
girls.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">The most annoying girl is the funniest, right? (I'm sure.)</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, have you ever seen behind the scenes footage
from Idol concerts?</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">When I first saw them, I was very surprised to see idols who
always show us their sparkling performances struggling to get back on stage
after running out of oxygen.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">This was because when I watched concert footage, they looked
so energetic throughout the concert and I never noticed how tired they were.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Since then, my view of idols has changed.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">I liked them more after learning about their hard work,
perseverance and determination.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">I've never been an idol, so I don't know all of their
feelings, but I hope I've revealed some of the fascinating and important parts
of these girls in Kasumi, as they shine brightly and devote themselves and
their time to the fans.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, I would like to say thank you.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">To the editor who worked with me from the beginning to
create this work.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Rag Miwano-sensei for his fresh and colorful illustrations.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">The proofreader who corrected the manuscript, which was full
of fatal double meanings.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">I would like to thank the publisher, the distributors, and
all those involved in the publication of this work.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Most of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to
you, the readers of this postscript.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">Thank you very much.</span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: medium;">I look forward to seeing you again.</span></p>
