<h3>Epilogue: Reunion</h3>

<p class="calibre3">(Well, it should be fine for about two days, I think.)</p><p class="calibre3">I sent a message to Rei explaining that I would be away from home for a while.</p><p class="calibre3">Under the clear autumn sky, I leave the apartment with a feeling of melancholy.</p><p class="calibre3">In front of me, there's a limousine parked.</p><p class="calibre3">I sigh deliberately and approach the limousine.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I have come to pick you up, Rintaro-sama." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">Sofia-san, who appears after opening the door, bows politely to me.</p><p class="calibre3">We hadn't met face to face since she had forced the letter on me.</p><p class="calibre3">"There's no need to come and pick me up, right? It's not that far, and I could have taken the train." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I cannot let Rintaro-sama to do such a thing." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I've said it many times, but I'm just an ordinary person. I don't need more care than necessary." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I will keep that in mind." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">It's all just lip service anyway.</p><p class="calibre3">They treat me with respect while looking down on me for leaving the household.</p><p class="calibre3">I have no intention of following in my father's footsteps, so there's no point in treating me with respect.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please, get in." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">As prompted, I get into the limousine.</p><p class="calibre3">Why is this car so unnecessarily luxurious? A regular car would have been more than enough for picking me up.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you fully grasp the contents of the letter?" (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......More or less." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"In that case, I will spare you the explanation. You can discuss the details directly with Mr. President." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">I almost let out a sigh.</p><p class="calibre3">The president is basically my father, and to put it bluntly, he's the last person I want to meet.</p><p class="calibre3">Just thinking about having to meet him was greatly unsettling.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Honestly, I was surprised." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I thought that no matter what I did, you wouldn't come." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......If I could avoid it, I still wouldn't want to come. But I do feel indebted for being raised to some extent, and it would be presumptuous of me to think I could live on my own without meeting...... at least once...... That's all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I see." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">After that, Sofia-san and I don't have any more conversations in the car.</p><p class="calibre3">She's just a very rational person, and she must have judged that there was no need for excessive conversation.</p><p class="calibre3">I can empathize with that way of thinking, and it's much better than being forced into a conversation.</p><p class="calibre3">Eventually, the limousine stops, and Sofia-san and I get off, leaving the driver behind.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's ridiculously big...... As ever." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">In front of us is a towering skyscraper.</p><p class="calibre3">This is the headquarters of my father's company, the Shidou Group.</p><p class="calibre3">"Shall we get in, Rintaro-sama." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yeah." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Guided by Sofia-san, we enter the building and take the elevator.</p><p class="calibre3">The elevator then stops at the top floor.</p><p class="calibre3">At the end of a long corridor, there's an automatic door with an electronic lock.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please wait a moment." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">As I wait as instructed, then Sofia-san enters what seems to be a password on the control panel in front of the door and unlocks the electronic lock.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">The door opened, and this time I walk ahead.</p><p class="calibre3">――――And, at the far end of the room.</p><p class="calibre3">The man sitting in the chair behind the large desk turns his gaze from the window to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"......It's been a while, Rintaro." ()</p><p class="calibre3">My father, Shidou Yuutaro, greets me with his usual unsociable expression.</p>
