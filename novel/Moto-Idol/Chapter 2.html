<h3>Chapter 2: Opportunity</h3>


<p class="calibre3">And, the next day.</p><p class="calibre3">I got up as usual, washed my face, brushed my teeth, and is examining at my clothes.</p><p class="calibre3">As was the case with Rei, this is the most difficult part when going out with the opposite sex.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't have a lot of clothes, to begin with, and I'm not confident that I have a good style.</p><p class="calibre3">Some of them were forced on me by Yuzuki-sensei――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"......After all, safe is best, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I let out a sigh and put on a loose-fitting 3/4 sleeve T-shirt and a pair of skinny jeans.</p><p class="calibre3">No. This is too one pattern.</p><p class="calibre3">As I thought, I should have more of a repertoire, right? When Yukio returns, I'll ask him to go shopping with me. I promised him to go shopping for a mug anyway.</p><p class="calibre3">I leave my house with my shoulder bag containing my wallet and other things on my back.</p><p class="calibre3">I head for the train station.</p><p class="calibre3">It is one hour before the appointment, and I plan to kill some time at a coffee shop, as I had originally planned.</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as I step outside, the heat of the sun pours down on me from above and the reflected heat rises up from the asphalt, burning my body.</p><p class="calibre3">It's seriously hot. Summer break will be over soon, but the summer is still far from over.</p><p class="calibre3">(I'll definitely have an iced coffee when I get there.......!)</p><p class="calibre3">With that in mind, I stomp my way to the front of the station.</p><p class="calibre3">Soon I get near the meeting place and find a surprising sight.</p><p class="calibre3">"What...... Mia?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">A girl with a familiar face is standing in front of the statue we agreed upon as our meeting place.</p><p class="calibre3">She is disguised in a long black wig, just like Rei done.</p><p class="calibre3">She has been constantly pulling out a hand mirror and checking her face over and over since a while ago.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With a surprised look on my face, I approach her.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, why are you here so early?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh――――Rintaro-kun!?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">She looks up and looks at me with a surprised look on her face.</p><p class="calibre3">"B-back at you...... There's still an hour to go, remember?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I was planning to cool off at the coffee shop and then come here." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"S-so...... that's it. Ah, I was also planning to do the same." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Then why are you here――――I swallow that question.</p><p class="calibre3">Somewhat impatiently, she fiddles with her wig, and her gaze is wandering restlessly.</p><p class="calibre3">Don't tell me this lass was looking forward to this so much?</p><p class="calibre3">If that's the case, I find that Mia has a cute side too...... unlike her usual self.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Then, let's go to the coffee shop. We still have time before the show anyway." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Y-yes...... You're right." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">The two of us then make our way side by side to the coffee shop in front of the station.</p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, you are very good at disguising yourself." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I can't walk out of the house properly unless I do this. How? Does this suit me?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, your MIA-ness is fading, but your beauty hasn't diminished at all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Rintaro-kun, are you used to giving compliments?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Not really. I just simply say what is in my mind, so it's not a hard thing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">In the first place, she asked me for my opinion about her appearance, so I think it would be wrong if I don't answer her honestly.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"For a lover, I think holding hands is a kind of skinship, so what do you think?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry, but I can't do that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Why can't." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing Mia with a somewhat sullen look on her face, I let out a sigh and then speak.</p><p class="calibre3">"Haven't you told me? I don't have to do anything I don't want to. Holding hands or displaying such a definite appearance of being a lover to those around is not a thing I want to do."</p><p class="calibre3">Holding hands, linking arms, and so on.</p><p class="calibre3">Such behaviors can leave Mia with no excuse if her disguise were to come undone.</p><p class="calibre3">Also, my hands are sweating a lot because of the summer sun.</p><p class="calibre3">To hold hands with her in such a state is certainly embarrassing.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Humph. Well, fine then." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia puffs out her cheeks and walks half a step ahead of me.</p><p class="calibre3">What is it? Somehow, today's her seems to be a bit childish.</p><p class="calibre3">"Come on, hurry up." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"K-kay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Is it just, my imagination?</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>
<p class="calibre3">After killing some time at the coffee shop, we head straight to the cinema.</p><p class="calibre3">The ticket we bought together is titled "Harusaku Koi".</p><p class="calibre3">It is a story about a boring high school girl who is approached by a rich, good-looking guy and a nice, athletic guy.</p><p class="calibre3">The love triangle of her with two boys is said to be the appeal of the story――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Anyhow, aren't there so many girls here?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Most of the people who have been going in and out of the cinema since a while ago are all girls who look somewhat sophisticated.</p><p class="calibre3">It's not that there aren't any boys or adults, but I feel a little uncomfortable.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's natural. The actors are very popular among the girls right now. Here, this is your ticket." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, thanks......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I take the ticket offered by Mia and stare at it for a few seconds.</p><p class="calibre3">"...... It's a bit late, but were you sure for paying for all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's really late for that. But, as I said before, I'll pay for the whole date. I think it's my duty as the person who gets you to spend the day with me." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, But I don't think it's right if it's not the man who pays for the whole date." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman. All you need to do today is to indulge me." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Hmm, well, that's okay.</p><p class="calibre3">As long as you treat me, I shall treat you back in all honesty. It saves money.</p><p class="calibre3">The pride I had kept in my heart is easily shattered.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you like to eat popcorn? I'm thinking of buying some." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, well, I guess I am......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm thinking of buying some," he said. "Then, let's share a large size, shall we? Fufu, I feel like we're becoming more and more like one." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">That "like" probably refers to being more like a lover.</p><p class="calibre3">When you think about it, sharing a snack together is very much like being a lover.</p>
<p class="calibre3">――――I think Rei and I have done it a few times already.</p><p class="calibre3">"What flavor do you like?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I like the soy sauce butter one." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What a coincidence. I'm just about to choose that flavor too." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Caramel and salt are also good, but personally, I get bored easily with caramel, and salt is slightly bland.</p><p class="calibre3">Then again, soy sauce butter would be the perfect one for me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, let's go inside after we buy it, shall we?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sure." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">It's almost time to go in.</p><p class="calibre3">After buying popcorn and drinks, we enter the theater.</p><p class="calibre3">The seats filled up quickly, and soon enough, it was full.</p><p class="calibre3">Is this the power of the latest popular movie?</p><p class="calibre3">"There's a unique sense of excitement in a theater before it even starts, isn't there?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I can understand that. I've never had much sympathy for it, but I actually don't mind watching trailers for other movies that are inserted at the beginning of a movie." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Me too, I can understand that feeling. I feel like I'm getting something out of it when I see a trailer for a movie I've seen before, or a trailer for a movie I'm really interested in." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">While we are chatting like this, the lights dim out in the hall.</p><p class="calibre3">In the darkness, the movie trailers that we have just been talking about are starting to play on the huge screen.</p><p class="calibre3">This is when I feel that I have come to a cinema the most.</p><p class="calibre3">The size of the screen, the impact of the sound. Everything feels special.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">[This is a story that happened in the dull spring of my life――――]</i></b></p>
<p class="calibre3">After the trailer ends, the film begins with such a monologue.</p><p class="calibre3">The heroine is a boring high school girl who gives off the impression of being a bit of a dowdy girl.</p><p class="calibre3">However, because she is played by a popular young actress, she has a well-defined face behind the round glasses she wears.</p><p class="calibre3">Apparently, this is not for the convenience of the actress, but because the manga on which the story is based describes her as something like――――a simple jewel that shines when polished.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't help but wonder what a "simple jewel" is, but if I were to nitpick at every little thing like this, I will never be able to enjoy a work, so I'll just put it to the back of my mind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Who are you going to choose, him or me!] (Rich Guy)</b></p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[I-I can't! I can't decide on the spur of the moment!] (Heroine)</b></p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Enough! Go anywhere you want!] (Rich Guy)</b></p>


<p class="calibre3">The rich, self-centered, handsome guy left the scene after saying that.</p><p class="calibre3">As the heroine, who was left behind, was shedding tears, the athletic guy came up to her as if he had anticipated this.</p><p class="calibre3">He hugged her and whispered in her ear.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[If I were him, I wouldn't make you cry.] (Solid Guy)</b></p><p class="calibre3">Yup, that grosses me out.</p><p class="calibre3">His voice and line seem to have touched the female audience, and most of them are looking at the screen with enraptured faces.</p><p class="calibre3">What face does Mia have?</p><p class="calibre3">Curious, I look at the seat next to me with only a glance.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Heeh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">She has an interested look on her face.</p><p class="calibre3">It is the kind of look that says she is seriously trying to learn something, leaving aside things like excitement and such.</p><p class="calibre3">She is probably examining the face of the heroine, the one who was whispered to.</p><p class="calibre3">Once the scene ended here, it was time for the heroine to think alone.</p><p class="calibre3">Still wavering between the two guys, she eventually came to one conclusion.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[I...... I finally get it.] (Heroine)</b></p><p class="calibre3">And so the heroine ran out to find the athletic guy.</p><p class="calibre3">But she apologized to him and told him she couldn't reciprocate his feelings, and then she ran straight to the handsome guy.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[I! I love you!] (Heroine)</b></p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[I'll never let you go!] (Rich Guy)</b></p><p class="calibre3">After such an exchange, the two eventually tied the knot.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Yep yep, I don't understand at all. <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: Me too dude)</i></b></p><p class="calibre3">Maybe it's because I'm thinking too realistically, but I think that the athletic guy would be better as a lover.</p><p class="calibre3">Being rich is a good point, but it is difficult to be in a relationship with that kind of personality.</p><p class="calibre3">I won't bother to say it out loud because it's just me being me, but it's true that I'm a little unconvinced by her conclusion.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm......I see. So that is how it works. Shall we go then, Rintaro-kun?"&nbsp; (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay. Are you satisfied?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, in its own way, I guess. To be honest, if you ask me if I learned anything different from what I originally knew, I will answer with a tilt of my head." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">As we get up from our seats and leave the theater, we exchange our opinions about the movie with each other.</p><p class="calibre3">Mia seems to have thought that if she were to have a boyfriend in the real world, she would have to choose the athletic guy.</p><p class="calibre3">She said, "If it were me, that rich guy is going to hate me because I tease him too much."</p><p class="calibre3">I can somehow imagine that scene.</p><p class="calibre3">"Now, what shall we do?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... lunchtime is a little off, but we can get some meals for now, right? I'm sure there's a place open right now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I guess so. Ah, I've got something I'd like to try, if you don't mind." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Heeh, what's it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I've memorized the way, so just follow me. It will be fun when you get there." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I nod my head and follow after her.</p><p class="calibre3">This is Mia we're talking about. I'm sure she's going to lead me to some fancy cafes or restaurants.</p><p class="calibre3">Normally, I would be concerned about the high cost of such places, but today is her treat, so my steps don't feel that heavy at all.</p><p class="calibre3">――――This is pretty lame, even from my standpoint.</p><p class="calibre3">"Here we are. I've always wanted to come here." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">And so we arrive at the place, and what wafts out is&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;the thick aroma of garlic.</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't this a ramen shop?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It is. Where did you expect to be led?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">The signboard in front of us said "more vegetables" and "more garlic", words that made me sick to my stomach just by looking at them.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't dislike the shop itself.</p><p class="calibre3">I just didn't expect to be brought here by a girl.</p><p class="calibre3">"Up until recently, I've had a lot of work that required me to stay in style, and I've been trying to avoid anything too high in calories. Once that kind of routine settled down, today was my chance to finally try this." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I-is so......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's enter then." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia's back looks somewhat like a brave warrior as she makes her entrance with dignity.</p><p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, Rei walked into the ramen shop with great enthusiasm, too.</p><p class="calibre3">――――It can't be helped, then.</p>


<p class="calibre3">I am a little overwhelmed, but it is not my first visit to such a store, and I appreciate being in a store like this rather than a fancy store.</p><p class="calibre3">Following Mia's lead, I step into the store and see her standing in front of the ticket machine, which is typical of ramen shops, groaning in frustration.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro-kun, what should I do? Which one should I order?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......If it's your first time here, why don't you just order the regular one? The waiter will probably ask you a few questions later on, but in response to those questions, you can just say that everything is regular." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? I don't understand, but okay." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia purchases the topmost normal ramen and turns back to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro-kun, which one do you want?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll have the regular one too. I'm not too particular about the ingredients." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see. I'll get one more then." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry, and thanks......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You don't have to worry about anything today." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia purchases a ticket for me as well.</p><p class="calibre3">We sit down side by side and hand our tickets to the waiter over the counter.</p><p class="calibre3">"Two bowls of ramen! What's your preference?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh? Ah, just...... regular one, is it okay?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I nod in response to Mia's question.</p><p class="calibre3">When we confirm it to the waiter, he nods and then recites our order.</p><p class="calibre3">A few minutes later, two bowls full of bean sprouts and cabbage are placed in front of us.</p><p class="calibre3">"Whoa...... The serving is bigger than I thought it would be." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Can you finish it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, I think I can." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then, please take care of my leftovers." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yea......, I see." (Mia)</p>
<p class="calibre3">Well, I think I can finish it, but I can't give up the possibility that I might get sick on the way if it has a lot of oil in it.</p><p class="calibre3">Yeah――――I'd like to think I'll be fine, though.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, for now, let's eat it before it becomes soggy. Bon appétit." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Bon appétit." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">We each put our palms together, pick up our chopsticks, and begin to eat.</p><p class="calibre3">I mean, before we start slurping, we first have to do some excavation work.</p><p class="calibre3">We break down the pile of bean sprouts and cabbage so as not to spill it, and at the end of it, we finally get our chopsticks to reach the noodles.</p><p class="calibre3">At this point, I feel like a coal miner.</p><p class="calibre3">"Mmm~~~! So good!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">As I'm struggling to dig out the noodles, I hear a delighted voice from my side.</p><p class="calibre3">I look over and see Mia's face there, holding her cheeks and looking happy.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... Sorry, was that a bit inappropriate?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, I just thought it was a little unexpected." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Unexpected?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"If anything, I have a cool image in you, so it was a little unexpected that you could change your expression so drastically." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Fufu, did you find it unfitting?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I didn't find that way. Rather...... I was happy because I felt like I was getting to know you a little bit better." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh......" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">When we first met, I was much more wary of Mia.</p><p class="calibre3">That's because, at that time, this lass was so mysterious.</p><p class="calibre3">I think it was because she made an effort not to show her true self, and looking back, it was more dangerous to blindly trust a man she had never met before just because Rei had brought him along.</p><p class="calibre3">Although a long time has passed since then, Mia seems to have kept her "MIA" as an idol more than Rei did.</p><p class="calibre3">I know this is just a stereotyped image, but if I were in Mia's shoes, I would not be able to stand being an idol all the time.</p><p class="calibre3">Even Rei has time off, but Mia has none.</p><p class="calibre3">The fact that I was able to see even the slightest glimpse of her true face, which should have been hidden behind such a built-up strong mask.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if it was just even a minuscule, it made me happy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"I've been amazed so many times at how superhuman you girls are...... what's wrong?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Eh? Ah, yes! I see!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......What's wrong with you all of a sudden" (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre3">I look at Mia with quizzical eyes as she quivers and her face turns beet red.</p><p class="calibre3">Then she immediately turns her face away to avoid my gaze.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, don't tell me you're embarrassed?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"E-err? I-I wonder...... I can't get to your question." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">As if to cool down her flushed face, Mia gulps down water from a nearby glass.</p><p class="calibre3">But one problem is――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"That's the one I'd sipped on." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Buuugh." (Mia) <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: Maan, I suck at onomatope.)</i></b></p><p class="calibre3">Because of losing her composure, Mia drinks up all the water in my glass.</p><p class="calibre3">I stroke her back as she coughs from choking on water that got into her windpipe and I wait for her to calm down.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugh......, I'm fine now." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"You sure?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. Sorry I got so discomposed all of a sudden." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">For now, she seems to have calmed down.</p><p class="calibre3">Mia rubs her chest to calm herself down and begins to eat the ramen again.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm really okay now, so let's just finish this before this becomes soggy." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah...... You're right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia, when embarrassed by something, would be distraught like that.</p><p class="calibre3">Knowing this, it might have been worth it to come here.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">"Uggh...... I can't eat more than this." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, you're a surprisingly small eater, aren't you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Shut up...... don't expect all high school boys can eat three servings&nbsp; in one sitting, okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Although I exercise daily to the extent that my body does not become dull, it is far from the amount of exercise that a high school boy engaged in club activities would do.</p><p class="calibre3">In addition, it is summer, and I can't deny that I am suffering from summer heat fatigue.</p><p class="calibre3">It's not that I'm a small eater, by any means. I'm not making excuses.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you not suffer from the summer heat? I can get the answer by seeing you though, you even ordered some extra large servings." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"We~ll, it's not that I don't suffer from it, but it's more like my body craves more calories than usual, I guess? Lately, we've been practicing a lot of intense summer dance songs. My digestive system is not as strong as Rei's or Kanon's, so I need to lose some weight after taking in too much." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Heeh...... I mean, how can it fit in there in the first place?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I look at Mia's belly, which is not even protruding.</p><p class="calibre3">Like Rei, her belly doesn't appear pouchy at all, even when I think she's eaten a lot.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't have a clue, but she's not suppressing it with her stomach muscles, is she?</p><p class="calibre3">"Where have you been looking since a while ago?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Your belly." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're being too honest, dude." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia laughs, clamping her mouth shut.</p><p class="calibre3">The conversation made my painful belly feel a little better.</p><p class="calibre3">I'll have to keep rubbing it for a while, but it's okay for walking.</p><p class="calibre3">"Alright, I think we've accomplished all the goals for now, but what are you going to do now? I don't mind going out with you for the rest of the day." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Mmm, I'll take your word for it, then. I still have some places I want to go." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's the kind of place couples go." (Mia)</p>
<p class="calibre3">Seeing me choking up at the "couple" part, Mia giggles again in amusement.</p><p class="calibre3">Phew, I guess I'm finally getting back on the right track now.</p><p class="calibre3">I follow Mia's lead.</p><p class="calibre3">Eventually, we arrive at a large game center in front of the train station, where there is a lot of noise.</p><p class="calibre3">"A game center, huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. To be honest, I've never been to one by myself, nor have I been with Rei or Kanon, so I was a bit curious about it. Are you familiar with this place?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, I've only been here a few times." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that so?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not good with big noises...... see, there are all kinds of sound effects and music mixed in, right? That's why I never came here voluntarily." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I've never been in those places because I'm underage, but I am not comfortable with places like pachinko parlors and such, more so than at a game center.</p><p class="calibre3">Maybe that's why I'm less interested in such places.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah....., then maybe you're not very interested in...... it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not. It's not like I'm allergic to it, nor hate it. As long as it's with you, I'll go anywhere today." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......If so, then I'll take your word for it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia looks a little apologetic as she makes her way into the game center.</p><p class="calibre3">That was a mistake, I reflect to myself.</p><p class="calibre3">I feel bad for both Mia and the game center for showing a lack of enthusiasm in front of the store when we got there.</p><p class="calibre3">If I was going to tell her that I wasn't good at it, I should have said so more clearly.</p><p class="calibre3">On top of that, if I could have said I didn't want to go there, I would have been able to go to another place without getting into a strange situation――――.</p><p class="calibre3">Whatever the case, I don't want to respond half-heartedly.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro-kun! There's a UFO catcher!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as we enter, Mia pulls my hand in excitement.</p><p class="calibre3">She looks at the UFO catcher machine with stuffed bears of various colors inside.</p><p class="calibre3">"Why don't we try it anyway?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Okay, let's give it a try." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying so, Mia walks toward there.</p><p class="calibre3">The sudden increase in tension is probably to warm up the atmosphere between us once it had dropped.</p><p class="calibre3">I honestly appreciate her consideration at times like this.</p><p class="calibre3">I decided to ride along without hesitation.</p><p class="calibre3">Thus, we decided to play UFO Catcher first――――.</p>
<p class="calibre3">""............""</p><p class="calibre3">The atmosphere between us, which should have been back to square one, gradually cooled down again.</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Hey, isn't this UFO catcher way too hard?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, it would be bad for business if it were taken away easily." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's true, yet......" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">One thousand yen had already gone into the machine, but not a single stuffed animal could be taken.</p><p class="calibre3">I heard that the strength of the arm is related to the degree of difficulty, but from what I saw, the grip seemed to be very weak.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro-kun, will you give it a try?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"What......? But, I doubt I can get it anyway, is it okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's okay, but still. It's unfair that I'm the only one playing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I think it's different from unfair.</p><p class="calibre3">From my standpoint, Mia carries all the burden by putting a hundred-yen coin from her own wallet, but she doesn't seem to be concerned about that at all.</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, she doesn't seem to have any intention to play by herself, and if I don't do it, it will be a waste of money.</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't complain afterward, okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I won't. Don't worry, I have trust in you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's putting pressure on me, you know?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I rebuke her, Mia giggles happily.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, if she's enjoying herself, that's fine.</p><p class="calibre3">".......Phew." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I exhale and observe what I should do first.</p><p class="calibre3">I had been thinking about what I would do while watching Mia play, but standing in front of the button like this, the sensation feels different.</p><p class="calibre3">Let's first adjust the UFO mechanism's horizontal position.</p><p class="calibre3">After all, even Mia could easily adjust its position.</p><p class="calibre3">Since I can't count on the arm's strength at all, I can only hope that it will luckily get caught under the armpit or something.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"Here, right......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">With a feeling of uneasiness, I let go of the button that moves the UFO vertically.</p><p class="calibre3">Watching with somewhat resigned eyes as the arm slowly lowered, I wait patiently.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, the arm catches the stuffed bear's body.</p><p class="calibre3">And as it's lifted up, the tip of the arm slides across the surface of the stuffed bear.</p><p class="calibre3">"Haa~...... Told ya, I couldn't do it――――." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Wait! Rintaro-kun!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Aah?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia taps me on the shoulder as I turn away from the machine, forcing me to look back.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, an unbelievable scene comes into my view.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you kidding me......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">The arm that should have been unable to grip the stuffed bear's body is now hooked under the bear's armpits.</p><p class="calibre3">With that, the stuffed bear is lifted up and falls into the prize door.</p><p class="calibre3">Stunned, I open the door made of clear plastic and take out the prize that had dropped.</p><p class="calibre3">"You did it........" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I did it......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">An indescribable silence spreads between Mia and me.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">"...... Here, you can have this." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" (Mia)</p>
<p class="calibre8"><p class="calibre9">Seeing me choking up at the "couple" part, Mia giggles again in amusement.</p><p class="calibre9">Phew, I guess I'm finally getting back on the right track now.</p><p class="calibre9">I follow Mia's lead.</p><p class="calibre9">Eventually, we arrive at a large game center in front of the train station, where there is a lot of noise.</p><p class="calibre9">"A game center, huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes. To be honest, I've never been to one by myself, nor have I been with Rei or Kanon, so I was a bit curious about it. Are you familiar with this place?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">"No, I've only been here a few times." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"Is that so?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm not good with big noises...... see, there are all kinds of sound effects and music mixed in, right? That's why I never came here voluntarily." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">I've never been in those places because I'm underage, but I am not comfortable with places like pachinko parlors and such, more so than at a game center.</p><p class="calibre9">Maybe that's why I'm less interested in such places.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ah ....., then maybe you're not very interested in...... it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm not. It's not like I'm allergic to it, nor hate it. As long as it's with you, I'll go anywhere today." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"......If so, then I'll take your word for it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">Mia looks a little apologetic as she makes her way into the game center.</p><p class="calibre9">That was a mistake, I reflect to myself.</p><p class="calibre9">I feel bad for both Mia and the game center for showing a lack of enthusiasm in front of the store when we got there.</p><p class="calibre9">If I was going to tell her that I wasn't good at it, I should have said so more clearly.</p><p class="calibre9">On top of that, if I could have said I didn't want to go there, I would have been able to go to another place without getting into a strange situation――――.</p></p>
<p class="calibre3">I hold out the stuffed bear in my hand toward Mia.</p><p class="calibre3">"I got this with your money, so that means this is yours, right? Here." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"N-no no no. You got it with your own effort, so it's yours." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"What am I supposed to do with this......I don't have a hobby collecting stuffed animals, you know?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Me neither......." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">She looks between the stuffed bear and my face repeatedly.</p><p class="calibre3">Then she timidly accepts the stuffed bear from my hand.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well...... if you insist, I guess I'll accept it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"From the very beginning, I told you that it was yours――――well, fine." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Whatever the pretext, if you accept it, I'm fine with it.</p><p class="calibre3">There are men who collect stuffed animals, and I'm not trying to contradict that, it's just that I don't have that kind of hobby.</p><p class="calibre3">If it's going to end up in a closet anyway, I'd much rather it be in someone else's hands other than mine.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Thank you, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia hugs the stuffed doll she accepted from me with a somewhat happy look on her face.</p><p class="calibre3">Her expression resembles the innocent look she had when she was eating ramen.</p><p class="calibre3">I can say that it was worth getting the stuffed doll just to be able to see her behaving like this.</p><p class="calibre3">――――It's just mere luck, though.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are there any other games you'd like to try?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, umm...... do they have a photobox here?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? Yeah, I think there's probably one in the back corner." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Would you mind taking a picture with me? You know, lovers, they take pictures in the photobox together and put them on the back of their cell phones, don't they?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">In which era is that?</p><p class="calibre3">No, maybe even recently?</p>
<p class="calibre3">(......Should I stop touching on every subject too much?)</p><p class="calibre3">I break off my train of thought, feeling like I'm about to step on someone's landmine somewhere.</p><p class="calibre3">"If you want to try it, I'll accompany you. I don't know if I can properly behave like a lover." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks. Experience is the key to everything, and I want to try it anyway." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Moving to the back of the store, I find that a photobox corner is there.</p><p class="calibre3">Just to be sure, I check to see if there are any restrictions that I had heard rumors about, such as no boys allowed, but it seems there are no such restrictions.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro-kun, there is an empty one over there." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">While several photoboxes are occupied, no one has yet entered the one Mia pointed to.</p><p class="calibre3">Surprised to see so many customers using the machine, even though it's summer break, we step inside the machine through the cloth like a banner.</p><p class="calibre3">"Four hundred yen a time. That's more expensive than a regular game, isn't it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia inserts coins with 100-yen nominal on them into the machine.</p><p class="calibre3">Then an announcement starts up and begins to give us instructions.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Make a heart shape with your two fingers!]</b></p><p class="calibre3">――――Huh?</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmmm... So the pose is specified." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, what do we do next!? Something's starting to count!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"For now, let's just give it a try." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia calmly makes one side of the heart shape with her fingers while the announcer starts the count to the shutter.</p><p class="calibre3">As one would expect from an idol. Mia is used to having her picture taken and is calm at times like this.</p><p class="calibre3">I, on the other hand, am not so calm.</p><p class="calibre3">In a nervous manner, I fearfully put my own hand next to Mia's.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[3, 2, 1!]</b></p><p class="calibre3">I hear what sounds like the sound of a shutter being pressed.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems we've been shot in the pose we're in now.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Next, pull your shoulders together!]</b></p><p class="calibre3">Why do you demand such close contact, b*stard?</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, it sure would be a lover's play. Shall we follow all the instructions from here on out?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">".......Yea." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Suddenly, Mia's shoulder touches mine.</p><p class="calibre3">There is no time to feel the stirrings of youth that make one's heart flutter, only pure embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre3">In addition, the embarrassment is further accelerated by the fact that this scene will remain in the photograph.</p>
<p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Next up, you two hug each other!]</b></p><p class="calibre3">I want to hit it now, this b*stard.</p><p class="calibre3">"That is indeed a little embarrassing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Err, are you going to do it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You'll never know unless you try. Right?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I ask myself if we can hug each other when we didn't even hold hands.</p><p class="calibre3">No, it'll be impossible.</p><p class="calibre3">The only reason――――I refused to hold hands was because of the way people looked at me.</p><p class="calibre3">I needed to maintain a distance that would allow me to claim that we were only friends in appearance so that I would have an excuse.</p><p class="calibre3">But now I don't have those pesky eyes around.</p><p class="calibre3">(......Even if it is)</p><p class="calibre3">I take a step away from Mia.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I see, you can't do it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry. I'm not saying I hate it, but it's hard to be in close contact with a girl I'm not even dating." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Although you were fine with taking a bath together with me?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't have anything to say to that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">It's true that I don't hate it.</p><p class="calibre3">As a man, it's a great pleasure to be able to hug such a beautiful woman.</p><p class="calibre3">But, I wonder why.</p>
<p class="calibre3">I can't accept that with enthusiasm.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yea, that's fine. I'm rather relieved that you're so firm." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"You thought...... I'm firm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"To begin with, the time we took a bath together was also something I was forced onto you using my right. Today it's like I've already asked you for a date and you're already doing me a favor, so I won't throw a tantrum." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia says this and smiles as if she has given up.</p><p class="calibre3">When I try to respond to her, she interrupts me by placing her index finger on my lips.</p><p class="calibre3">"How-ev-er. I'll definitely have you do the next pose instruction." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I thought you said you won't throw a tantrum." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I think this is a legitimate request." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia laughs mischievously and turns to the camera.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, fine, only that much.</p><p class="calibre3">I wait for the next instruction, hoping that it'll be as simple as possible.</p>


<p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Next up, a princess carry!]</b></p><p class="calibre3">――――I barely saved.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ahahaha, that's an interesting pose. Hmm hmm, a princess, huh?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Phew...... I'm okay it if it's that much." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see. Then may I ask you to relax?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia steps closer to me and tries to reach for my knee and the back of my neck.</p><p class="calibre3">I quickly move away from her and look at her in disbelief.</p><p class="calibre3">"Why are you evading? You can do this, can't you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, no no no! Why are you the one who has to lift me up?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Because I'm a prince character?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia is tilting her head with an expression as if to say what is obvious.</p><p class="calibre3">It is true that Mia is a cool character among the Millefeuille Stars and is even called a prince by some people. She has the most female fans of the three, and it is said that there are often arguments between male and female fans.</p><p class="calibre3">But that doesn't mean I'm going to be on the princess side here.</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh....... I'm the one who lifts you up, you're the one who gets lifted up. Okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh......?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't "huh" me! I'm never going to give that part up!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">While Mia is stunned by my insistence, I decided to do exactly what she had just tried to do to me.</p><p class="calibre3">I put my arms on the backs of her knees and neck and lift her up in one fluid motion, scooping her up.　</p><p class="calibre3">"Hyaaa...... Eh? What?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"See, this is okay, isn't it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Her body, like the other two, feels lighter than I had imagined, it's a mystery of the female body.</p><p class="calibre3">In fact, it probably isn't, but it feels so thin in my hands that I feel as if I could crush her just by having her in my arms.</p><p class="calibre3">While I am having these thoughts, the shutter of the photobox is pressed by the end of the count.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Are you satisfied?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I guess I had fulfilled her request.</p><p class="calibre3">I look down at Mia's face for confirmation.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah............ Y-es." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Her face, which is unexpectedly close to me as I lift her up, is dyed bright red.</p><p class="calibre3">Her eyes, which are somewhat moist, are looking straight into mine, and I begin to feel somewhat embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre3">After I stay like that for a while, the next shutter is clicked.</p><p class="calibre3">As expected, it would be a waste to have two photos of the same pose in a row.</p><p class="calibre3">Thinking this, I slowly put her body down and have her stand on the floor.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">"......It said the next one will be the last. What are we gonna do?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">From the Photobox, a voice announces that it'll be the last one.</p><p class="calibre3">Apparently, the last take is a free pose, so there're no specific instructions.</p><p class="calibre3">"Or, are you okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">While I worried about the significant diminishment in her talking, Mia nods her head and clutches my chest.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"What is it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Can I ask you a favor for the last take?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"It depends on the content." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I want you to take another picture of us in the pose you lift me up." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I tilt my head, not understanding the true meaning of her request.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you sure? We already took two pictures of us in the same pose." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I am. I want to have this last one to be taken as Ugawa Mia." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia takes off her wig right in front of me.</p><p class="calibre3">The black bob cut, which is her natural color, is revealed.</p><p class="calibre3">Although her face is a little different from her normal face, perhaps due to the makeup, she certainly looks like the Mia I am familiar with.</p><p class="calibre3">"Here I can take off my disguise and people won't know, this is great, isn't it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......It is. That's about right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia nods happily and leans her body against me again.</p><p class="calibre3">I lifts her body in the same way as before, and the shutter pressed at the end of the count.</p><p class="calibre3">This time, we are not looking at each other, but instead, we are genuinely looking at the camera.</p><p class="calibre3">To be honest, I feel extremely embarrassed, though――――well, since Mia looks satisfied, I guess it's fine.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p class="calibre8"><p class="calibre9">Seeing me choking up at the "couple" part, Mia giggles again in amusement.</p><p class="calibre9">Phew, I guess I'm finally getting back on the right track now.</p><p class="calibre9">I follow Mia's lead.</p><p class="calibre9">Eventually, we arrive at a large game center in front of the train station, where there is a lot of noise.</p><p class="calibre9">"A game center, huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"Yes. To be honest, I've never been to one by myself, nor have I been with Rei or Kanon, so I was a bit curious about it. Are you familiar with this place?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">"No, I've only been here a few times." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"Is that so?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm not good with big noises...... see, there are all kinds of sound effects and music mixed in, right? That's why I never came here voluntarily." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">I've never been in those places because I'm underage, but I am not comfortable with places like pachinko parlors and such, more so than at a game center.</p><p class="calibre9">Maybe that's why I'm less interested in such places.</p><p class="calibre9">"Ah ....., then maybe you're not very interested in...... it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">"I'm not. It's not like I'm allergic to it, nor hate it. As long as it's with you, I'll go anywhere today." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">"......If so, then I'll take your word for it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre9">Mia looks a little apologetic as she makes her way into the game center.</p><p class="calibre9">That was a mistake, I reflect to myself.</p><p class="calibre9">I feel bad for both Mia and the game center for showing a lack of enthusiasm in front of the store when we got there.</p><p class="calibre9">If I was going to tell her that I wasn't good at it, I should have said so more clearly.</p><p class="calibre9">On top of that, if I could have said I didn't want to go there, I would have been able to go to another place without getting into a strange situation――――.</p></p>
<p class="calibre3">I――――Ugawa Mia, am a famous celebrity known as an idol.</p><p class="calibre3">The Millefeuille Stars, to which I belong to, sell out of CDs instantly whenever we release a new song, and are so popular that we stay at the top of the charts on download sites for at least a month.</p><p class="calibre3">When we hold concerts, tickets sell out instantly as well, and our merchandise never stops selling.</p><p class="calibre3">If we have such a good track record, we should be a little proud of it, right?</p><p class="calibre3">But that's not important right now.</p><p class="calibre3">What I'm trying to say is that no matter how I choose my words, I've become someone that can hardly be called an ordinary person.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, I wanted to be, and I have no regrets about this.</p><p class="calibre3">However――――sometimes I really wish I wasn't "MIA" at all.</p><p class="calibre3">Especially when I'm in disguise like this.</p><p class="calibre3">I remember the day I was approached for the first time when I was walking down the street.</p><p class="calibre3">I remember feeling overwhelmingly happy that I had become famous and succeeded.</p><p class="calibre3">But it was only for a week or so that I felt like a star.</p><p class="calibre3">Whenever people gathered around me on the street, the size of the crowd meant that there were people who would be blocked from passing by.</p><p class="calibre3">It is a matter of course that I should not do anything that would disturb others. That is why I decided to disguise my appearance more carefully than anyone else.</p><p class="calibre3">In the beginning, it was fun because I felt like a different person than I usually am.</p><p class="calibre3">But gradually, I grew tired of pretending to be someone I'm not, and now I don't even want to go out as much as possible.</p><p class="calibre3">Maybe it's because I've been living like that that I sought "her" side.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yup......Everything looks fine, I think?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Looking at my reflection in the mirror, I nod my head.</p><p class="calibre3">This is the restroom in the arcade where we had taken our Photobox shots.</p><p class="calibre3">I've taken off my disguise for just one shoot, and I'm putting back on my disguise to go back home.</p><p class="calibre3">I know it seems like a hassle, but it's necessary to avoid causing trouble for Rintaro-kun.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Just when I think I've finally gotten rid of my "MIA"-ness, my phone in my bag suddenly shakes.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that Rintaro-kun has sent me a Line message.</p>
<p class="calibre3">[I'm sorry. I suddenly have a stomach-ache and need to go to the bathroom. So, please wait a moment.] (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh no..." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I instinctively held my head.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know for sure why, but I have a feeling that the ramen we had for lunch was the cause. Under the weight of guilt, I try to figure out what to do.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">(...Medicine. That's right, I have to go get medicine for him.)</p><p class="calibre3">There should be a pharmacy nearby. If I bought medicine to relieve his stomachache, it might make up for my mistake.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">I check my disguise in the mirror one last time and confirmed, then I run outside. Perhaps because we had spent a lot of time playing UFO catchers, the day is already starting to turn into the evening.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"It's already this late..." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I look up at the sky and mutter so to myself. The day is coming to an end. It's a bit disappointing, although I was experiencing a day that I hadn't felt short in a long time.</p><p class="calibre3">(I...... had a lot more fun than I thought I would.)</p><p class="calibre3">When I'm by Rintaro-kun's side, I can go back to being "Ugawa Mia" instead of "MIA".</p><p class="calibre3">It was something I was grateful for and appreciated, but he probably wouldn't understand just how much I felt that.</p><p class="calibre3">But that's fine.</p><p class="calibre3">I enter a pharmacy a little ways away from the game center and buy medicine and water. I told Rintaro-kun that I would leave the game center for a while and asked him to wait there.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">(Is this what it's like to take care of a sick boyfriend, I wonder?)</p><p class="calibre3">Looking at the medicine and water in the bag. I'm happy to have achieved my goal.</p><p class="calibre3">So that means, this lover's game will come to an end.</p><p class="calibre3">"Aa~h, how unfortunate." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Taking advantage of Rintaro-kun's absence, I spill those words out of my relaxed mouth.</p><p class="calibre3">――――At that moment, a man appears in front of me.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: We're no strangers to the trope, You know the rules and so do I.)</i></b></p>
<p class="calibre3">"What a hottie you are! Hey, hey, are you interested in a job that pays well?"</p><p class="calibre3">"...Huh?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm sorry to say this to someone I just met, but I don't have a good impression of this person.</p><p class="calibre3">He's wearing a sloppy suit, with flashy dyed hair that is stiffly styled with wax on his head.</p><p class="calibre3">His attitude seems to say, "This is cool, right?" and it's somewhat irritating, as he doesn't seem to understand fashion that suits him at all, which is somewhat comical.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm introducing night jobs and such. I've been going around and talking to girls like you who seem like they could earn some money. But no one listens to me at all... I'm in a pinch with my quota this month, you know? Can you understand? I'll introduce you to a job where you can quickly make a lot of money by entertaining men, so can you come with me to the office for a bit?"</p><p class="calibre3">"..." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">From the bits and pieces of what I heard, it's likely that this man is a scout.</p><p class="calibre3">However, no matter how I look at or listen to him, he's only doing things that would damage the reputation of people who work seriously as scouts.</p><p class="calibre3">His remarks seemed to be contemptuous of the women who were supposed to be the targets of his scouting, and he emphasized only the money aspect.</p><p class="calibre3">Money itself is not a bad thing, but the way he talked about it was too foul.</p><p class="calibre3">It is best to ignore people like him.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, wait a minute."</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh...?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Usually, people like this would give up if you ignored them, but this person grabs my arm with an irritated tone.</p><p class="calibre3">It hurts a little because he suddenly squeezes my arm tightly.</p><p class="calibre3">"I told you I'm in trouble, didn't I? Isn't it strange to ignore me?"</p><p class="calibre3">"....I'm in a hurry." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"That-is-why, I'm really troubled that you won't listen to me. Can't you help me out a bit?"</p><p class="calibre3">――――It's no use, this person won't listen.</p><p class="calibre3">The people around us seem to comprehend this situation, but they just walk away, avoiding us.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't blame them for that, but my weak side is screaming for help if possible.</p><p class="calibre3">"Just by listening to me at the office, I'll be really grateful. Please, won't you help me out? I'll make sure you earn some money."</p><p class="calibre3">"I-I'm a minor, so I can't do that kind of work." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, come on. You can't be a minor with such a mature appearance, right? Can you not lie to me?"</p><p class="calibre3">His hand, which is holding onto my arm, tightened even more.</p><p class="calibre3">If I show my student ID here, I can prove that I'm a minor.</p><p class="calibre3">However, it's also a double-edged sword that will reveal that I'm MIA of MilleSta.</p><p class="calibre3">If this man finds out that I am MIA, I don't know what he'll do.</p><p class="calibre3">"I~'ll be in much trouble...... Can't you just give in soon? Look, our office is in that building over there!"&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"――――" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Silence means it's okay, right? Let's get going then!"</p><p class="calibre3">It's not.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though I try to scream, my voice won't come out.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't hide my agitation about my current situation.</p><p class="calibre3">For some reason, tears wells up in the corners of my eyes and my body stiffened.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be so scared. I won't do anything bad."&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Am I――――scared?</p>


<p class="calibre3">Oh, I see.</p><p class="calibre3">Right now, I'm afraid of this person.</p><p class="calibre3">I've had experiences of being approached by men before, and each time I've acted tough and gotten through them, but today I can't do that.</p><p class="calibre3">Probably because I'm not "MIA" right now.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">(Rintaro-kun...!)</p><p class="calibre3">I call his name in my mind.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if I could shout it out loud, Rintaro-kun wouldn't come here.</p><p class="calibre3">I was the one who told him to wait for me.</p><p class="calibre3">By now, he must be waiting near the game center.</p><p class="calibre3">So, I can't expect any help.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">All I can do is try to stay in this place with my cowered legs.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing me make such a small resistance, the man makes an obvious expression of irritation.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"Tch...... You're so annoying! Just shut up and come with me!"&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Excuse me." ()</p><p class="calibre3">"HUUH!? What the f*ck do you want!?"&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"That girl, she is with me." ()</p><p class="calibre3">Suddenly, the arm that grabbed me is released.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that someone had intervened and forcefully removed the man's arm from me.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Slowly, my gaze shifts to the owner of that arm.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"Yo, looks like I barely make it in time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">It's "Rintaro-kun" who is there, he smiles with relief when he meets my eyes.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">As I look at him in a state of confusion, not knowing what has happened, the scout man forcefully shakes off the arm that had grabbed him, looking more irritated than ever.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, geez, it's always these wannabe heroes. Seriously, they really get on my nerves every time. They think they can mess with my work just because I can't hit back...... Enough with this, it's too much pain in the a*s. Hey, a*shole, come over here for a second."</p>
<p class="calibre3">The man pulls Rintaro-kun into the alleyway, grabbing him by the collar.</p><p class="calibre3">Whether he had been a troublemaker or not, there was something about his actions flowing naturally and a peculiar sense of intimidation.</p><p class="calibre3">If Rintaro-kun were taken into the alleyway, he will undoubtedly be beaten until that man is satisfied.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if it means getting involved with the police due to his violent behavior, the man in front of me, consumed by anger, doesn't seem to have the capacity to think that far.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro-kun! ――――" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">In an attempt to prevent Rintaro-kun from being beaten, I try to intervene and remove the man's arm.</p><p class="calibre3">However, I'm stopped by no one other than Rintaro-kun himself.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Why?</p><p class="calibre3">Those words slipped out of my mouth.</p><p class="calibre3">Rintaro-kun stops me with his hand, silently pleading with his eyes not to move.</p><p class="calibre3">In response to his calm gaze, I obediently obey his unspoken request.</p><p class="calibre3">"Your hand, I guess it's fine to say this is a form of violence, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"HUH?"</p><p class="calibre3">Rintaro-kun grabs the man's hand that had been gripping his collar and twisted it, almost effortlessly.</p><p class="calibre3">"O-OOOOOOUCH!"</p><p class="calibre3">The man, unable to bear the pain, let go of Rintaro-kun's collar, only to be controlled by Rintaro-kun's hand, swiftly taken on his back</p><p class="calibre3">With his arm twisted and restrained behind his back, the man can only struggle and groan in agony. It's a familiar technique often seen in detective dramas, and witnessing it in person almost made me want to exclaim in awe.</p><p class="calibre3">"If you resist, your shoulder joint will be in serious trouble, so it's better to behave." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... You F***CK."</p><p class="calibre3">Rintaro-kun lets out a sigh as he looks into the infuriated eyes of the man.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, he shifts his gaze towards me and kicks the man's back, propelling him forward.</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's run away!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, o...... okay!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">While the man is stumbling forward, Rintaro-kun reaches out his hand toward me.</p><p class="calibre3">As I grab his hand, he immediately pulls me out and sprints away from the scene with all his might.</p><p class="calibre3">"Wa...... wait, hey a*sholes!"&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"Who will wait when told to wait......!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I am pulled by the arm and run.</p><p class="calibre3">In front of me is Rintaro-kun's back.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps because more people are around, the distance between us and the scout man keeps widening.</p><p class="calibre3">The game of tag, which should have been dangerous, somehow becomes fun when I'm with him.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"Haha, if you can laugh that much, it seems like you don't need any aftercare." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Rintaro-kun gradually slows down, turning back looking at me, and says so.</p><p class="calibre3">Before I knew it, I was running and laughing.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though I had been so scared just a moment ago, it's like they say, "Out of sight, out of mind." I think I'm quite a moral hazard person.</p><p class="calibre3">"For now, let's head back to the station. We can walk slowly from here." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Yes." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I walk alongside him, with him still holding my hand.</p><p class="calibre3">There's no sign of the man chasing us anymore.</p><p class="calibre3">We have successfully shaken him off, and finally, my mind is starting to calm down.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah......" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? What's wrong?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"――――No, it's nothing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as I regained my composure, I realized something and quickly shut my mouth.</p><p class="calibre3">If I didn't, Rintaro-kun would probably "let go" of "my hand".</p><p class="calibre3">As long as he holds my hand, I can let myself take advantage of him like this――――that's what I thought.</p><p class="calibre3">"I tried calling you multiple times, but you didn't answer, so I rushed looking for you, thinking something might have happened... I was surprised to see you being hit on." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, calling me?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">When I check my smartphone, just as Rintaro-kun said, there are several missed call notifications on the lock screen.</p><p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, I had put my phone on silent mode since entering the cinema.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry, I didn't notice." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see... Geez. From now on, really be careful, okay? I managed to make it in time this time, but I'm not always by your side." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">"I'm not always by your side"</i>, huh?</p><p class="calibre3">What Rintaro-kun is saying is true.</p><p class="calibre3">We attend different schools. I have my schedule as an idol. No matter how you look at it, I can't rely on him for time-related matters.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ahh. It would be great if you could become my personal manager." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ahaha, then I'd end up working. So sorry, I can't do that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Ah, it's reassuring to see his uncool side like this.</p><p class="calibre3">Rintaro-kun being Rintaro-kun is my mercy.</p><p class="calibre3">If he were only all cool, I don't think my heart could handle it.</p><p class="calibre3">"By the way, Rintaro-kun, you can do Aikido, huh?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Aikido? Oh, that thing from earlier... Was that Aikido――――I wonder?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? What do you mean?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's because of my family circumstances. When I was in elementary school, I was made to do various lessons. Among them were martial arts like karate, judo, and kendo. So I tried a few bites, but honestly, I don't remember which techniques belong to which anymore. Today, my body just remembered and it really saved me......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">As Rintaro-kun says that, his face changes to a slightly pained expression.</p><p class="calibre3">But before I can point it out, he returns to his usual expression.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, you never know what will be useful in life. If it ended up helping you, then that's a good thing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...You're right. Thank you so much." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's awkward to hear you thank me so sincerely." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"How rude. I also value manners." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Finally, I'm back to my usual self.</p><p class="calibre3">We face each other and laugh together.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I want you to hear this now that we're here." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I, actually didn't want to be a prince...... I wanted to be a princess." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">When I confess that, Rintaro-kun looked somewhat surprised.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"I still remember when I was little and read Cinderella and Snow White picture books, I wanted to wear such cute dresses myself. But my mother told me, <i class="calibre6">"You don't have the look of a princess, you know"</i>." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I love my mother, but at that one time, I was really angry. I couldn't understand why she would say something like that....... But now, I realized that what my mother said was right." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">The reason I aimed to become an idol was because I saw other idols on TV wearing adorable outfits and dancing.</p><p class="calibre3">I wanted to try dressing up the same way.</p><p class="calibre3">With that wish, I jumped into the entertainment industry from the path of being an idol.</p><p class="calibre3">"In the end, the costumes I received as an idol, as you know, were all cool prince-like ones. They never expected cuteness from me from the beginning." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">That's why I accepted being a prince character to meet everyone's expectations.</p><p class="calibre3">I rationalized it as something necessary to work as an idol――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"So cuteness wasn't expected, huh? Well, I guess that's true from the public's perspective." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah...... So I gave up on it a long time ago." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"But today, you were more princess-like than anyone else." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Rintaro-kun says that in a somewhat teasing tone.</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, the events of today flash through my mind.</p><p class="calibre3">When I drank the water from his cup and choked at the ramen shop.</p><p class="calibre3">When I was flustered as I was held like a princess in a photo box.</p><p class="calibre3">When I was being pestered by a dangerous person and he came to my rescue.</p><p class="calibre3">Looking back, all of them were embarrassing.</p><p class="calibre3">"As I said earlier, I was happy to see a different side of you today. Mia, when you get excited, you look fit your age." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"That is――――" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"That is?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......No, it's nothing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">By my silence, he tilts his head in confusion.</p><p class="calibre3">But the words that are about to slip out of my mouth are too embarrassing to say.</p><p class="calibre3">(No, it's not true, Rintaro-kun.)</p><p class="calibre3">I was able to be a princess because of you.</p><p class="calibre3">Because you always treated me like a girl, I was able to stop being a prince.</p><p class="calibre3">――――I want to say that, but I can no longer be "MIA" in front of him. I am overwhelmed by embarrassment.</p>


<p class="calibre3">"Thank you today, Rintaro-kun. Thanks to you, I might have learned a thing or two about acting." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I shouldn't forget the things that made me happy with Rintaro-kun.</p><p class="calibre3">If I don't forget, things will surely go well.</p><p class="calibre3">(If I don't forget, huh...... There's no way I can forget.)</p><p class="calibre3">Maybe I'm a more simpleton than I think I am.</p><p class="calibre3">Because, he could easily crumble the image I had built up until now.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, <i class="calibre6">'Rintaro-kun'</i>." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm...?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Fufu, it's nothing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"What's that? You're such a weirdo." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Sorry, Rintaro-kun.</p><p class="calibre3">Because I still get embarrassed, I'll keep these words in my heart for now.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Thank you for making my heart race.</p>
