<h3>Chapter 5 The Band</h3>

<p class="calibre3"><p class="calibre3">"...Heave-phew..." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I put the bass I had been playing until last night into its case and sling it over my back.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Today is a day off, and it is the day of the first rehearsal for the band I formed with Kakihara and Doumoto.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">As I step outside the apartment building, I notice that the temperature has dropped somewhat.</p><p class="calibre3">"...It's almost autumn, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Muttering softly, I can't help but feel a sense of melancholy. I'm grateful for this weather.</p><p class="calibre3">To be honest, the bass is one of the heaviest instruments to carry among portable ones.</p><p class="calibre3">When considering the instrument alone without peripherals, the bass is slightly heavier than the guitar.</p><p class="calibre3">After receiving it, I had been careful not to strain myself while handling it.</p><p class="calibre3">Now, as I carry it on my back, I genuinely think it's a good thing that I had engaged in some physical activity to prevent my body from becoming sluggish.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey! Rintaro! Over here!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I arrived at the station, Kakihara and Doumoto, who had come earlier, waved to me.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara, like me, has a guitar strapped to his back, while Doumoto is pulling some kind of carry-on bag.</p><p class="calibre3">"Now that we got ourselves meet up ahead of the appointed time. There's still some time before our studio reservation, so let's take it easy." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, got it. ...By the way, what's in that bag of yours, Ryuuji-kun?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? This? I'll show you when we get to the studio." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying so proudly, Doumoto leads the way.</p><p class="calibre3">Following him, I get to one of the slightly dimly lit buildings near the station.</p><p class="calibre3">The darkness is partly because many of the buildings here are six stories or taller, but also because there are many so-called "nighttime establishments" nearby.</p><p class="calibre3">Now is still just past noon, so these places aren't open yet.</p><p class="calibre3">I feel somewhat uneasy, but I obediently follow them, and we enter a flashy-looking door.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yo, Manager." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, you're here, you little rascals."&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm not a rascal anymore. Anyway, is the setup done?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's the usual, isn't it? You're the only one who'd treat me like this, even though I'm the manager."</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto and a flamboyant man sitting at the counter beyond the door exchange friendly banter.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems like they have a close relationship.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are you guys his band members?" (Manager)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... yes." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">In response to the manager's question, Kakihara replies hesitantly.</p><p class="calibre3">His attitude makes me wonder.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems like he's even less energetic than usual, or rather, his expression lacks its usual brightness.</p><p class="calibre3">It makes me uneasy just watching him.</p><p class="calibre3">"Use Studio 5. Do you know how to set up the amps?" (Manager)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll teach them that." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, I see. Then take your time." (Manager)</p><p class="calibre3">With a wave of his hand, the manager bid us farewell. Then, we walk through toward the door marked "Studio 5."</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing the thick door, I'm reminded of the time Rei had led me around the office.</p><p class="calibre3">Inside, there are large amplifiers to enhance the sound of guitars and basses, a microphone for vocals, and a neatly arranged drum set.</p><p class="calibre3">"The manager is my uncle. He's the reason I started playing drums. I used to play drums with him sometimes when there were few reservations." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Heeh...... He seems like a nice person." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"He's not a bad person. Well, he lacks a bit of considerateness, though." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">As we approach the drum set, Doumoto shares some stories about the manager.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems like he has admired him since childhood, and his face lights up with joy as he speaks.</p><p class="calibre3">"All right, guys, let's start with how to use the amps. Yuusuke, this is probably your first time using a big one, right? It might seem a bit complicated at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's easy." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">And so, Doumoto begins his tutorial on how to use the amps.</p><p class="calibre3">I have been concerned that I may not be able to use them properly because they look so rugged, but when I listen to his detailed instructions, it doesn't seem that difficult.</p><p class="calibre3">Things like making sure the volume is set to zero before turning on the power, and connecting the cord to the instrument first and then to the amp.</p><p class="calibre3">As long as I pay attention to these finer details, it seems unlikely that I will break anything.</p><p class="calibre3">"And then... the contents of my bag that Rintaro was curious about, it's this." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, Doumoto unzips his bag.</p><p class="calibre3">"This is my own snare drum. It's not a problem to use the one they have here, but having your own snare with a custom tuning just gives it a different vibe, you know?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh... That sounds kinda professional, doesn't it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Haha, I'm not trying to show off or anything, though." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto cradles the snare drum carefully, then takes a seat on the chair in front of the bass drum.</p><p class="calibre3">From his attitude, it's clear that he truly loves playing the drums.</p><p class="calibre3">When it comes to instruments like guitars and basses, even the basic ones will cost at least tens of thousands if you want something you can use for a while.</p><p class="calibre3">I assume snare drums won't be cheap either.</p><p class="calibre3">Some people say that love isn't about the price, but for me, the price is often a quick indicator of how much love someone has for something.</p><p class="calibre3">Time, energy, and any finite things expended for the sake of something demonstrate love. It's something I can't help but envy at times.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well then, once we finish tuning, let's give it a shot." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">With excitement in his eyes, Doumoto hits his own snare drum once.</p><p class="calibre3">I can feel my body tingling with anticipation too.</p><p class="calibre3">The results of all the solo practice I have done are finally coming together as we play as a trio.</p><p class="calibre3">There's no way I can't be excited about this.</p><p class="calibre3">I adjust the tuning of my bass using the pegs on the head and correct any notes that have gone out of tune with the tuner.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara, who handles both guitar and vocals, has to adjust the microphone in addition to tuning the instrument.</p><p class="calibre3">Once that's done, we look at each other.</p><p class="calibre3">"All right... Shall we start from the count?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto poises himself with his drumsticks, tapping them to set the tempo.</p><p class="calibre3">Following his count, we begin the rehearsal.</p><p class="calibre3">The drums maintain the tempo, the bass provides the foundation, and the guitar and vocals boldly carry the melody.</p><p class="calibre3">――――That's the ideal scenario, but I still don't have the skills to support them properly yet.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto, who loves playing the drums and practices regularly, is another story. Kakihara, although not as experienced as Doumoto, is still pretty good, especially considering he's playing the guitar and singing simultaneously.</p><p class="calibre3">(...I shouldn't be thinking about unnecessary things right now.)</p><p class="calibre3">I couldn't afford to be impressed.</p><p class="calibre3">With my limited skills, my primary focus should be on keeping the tempo.</p><p class="calibre3">I can ignore minor mistakes, and in the more complex parts where the music feels overwhelming, I can simplify them as long as it doesn't significantly impact the performance.</p><p class="calibre3">Desperately, I move my fingers.</p><p class="calibre3">Somewhere along the way, I feel that Doumoto is syncing up with my tempo.</p><p class="calibre3">He must have noticed that I was struggling with this first rehearsal.</p><p class="calibre3">When the drum's rhythm slightly slows down, Kakihara's rhythm naturally becomes more relaxed.</p><p class="calibre3">While the tempo is undoubtedly slower than the original song, I'm surprised that we managed to avoid turning the performance into a chaotic mess among the three of us.</p><p class="calibre3">(How wonderful... to be so engrossed in something.)</p><p class="calibre3">With a bit of breathing room, I turn my gaze to Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">He meets my eyes and smiles with genuine joy.</p><p class="calibre3">I wonder what it feels like to have a hobby at which you can excel to such an extent.</p><p class="calibre3">From the depths of my heart, I envy Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">――――But what about Kakihara?</p><p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, just as I have drawn a line with them, I realize that I don't really know much about them either.</p><p class="calibre3">Is Kakihara enjoying the performance right now?</p><p class="calibre3">This guy is singing with his back turned to us...... So, I can't see his expression.</p></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"Are you freaking kidding me!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment,&nbsp;Doumoto's angry voice echoes through the studio.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">An awkward atmosphere flows through the studio.</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">Kakihara</i>, the target of Doumoto's anger, turns to face him with a lost expression, unlike his usual cheerfulness.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro practiced so hard even though it's his first time playing an instrument, and he's been desperately trying to keep up with us...! And yet, why are you, the lead player, playing so carelessly?!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">――――Indeed.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Although I think that the beginner should not speak up, Kakihara's mistakes began to be noticeable as the number of rehearsals increased.</p><p class="calibre3">Because I was able to keep up with the tempo, it became more noticeable.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though over an hour had passed since we entered the studio, it could be said that most of it was not good practice.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"We're spending time to make your confession a success! If you don't have the motivation, what are we supposed to do then?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Yeah." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"HUUH?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Even if we practice this much, it'll just become all meaningless if the confession doesn't succeed!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I've never seen Kakihara raise his voice like this before.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto also seems surprised by Kakihara's outburst and is visibly shaken.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I can't let you waste your time for a confession that won't succeed anyway. If it's becoming a hassle, you can stop if you want." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"You..." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry. I'm heading home for today." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">While we're dumbfounded, Kakihara puts away his guitar and leaves the studio.</p><p class="calibre3">And Doumoto, seeing him off, clenched his fist in frustration.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Damn it, he got chickened after we came this far." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">No, rather than dispirited――――he looks like he's in pain.</p><p class="calibre3">"He looked somewhat pale, so he probably wasn't feeling well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...Probably was, or was not I don't know." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, it doesn't seem like we can continue the practice in this atmosphere.</p><p class="calibre3">I hate to say it, but... honestly, I don't have a good impression of Kakihara today.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto isn't really angry about the mistakes themselves.</p><p class="calibre3">The problem is his lack of motivation.</p><p class="calibre3">Different people may have different opinions on this, but I can't help but feel that it's strange for us to be more enthusiastic than Kakihara, who came to us seeking advice on how to get together with Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre3">If he's already given up, then we don't have an obligation to cooperate with him anymore.</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't know what he meant by saying that, but let's ask him when we meet at school next time. Maybe he'll return to normal if he takes a break." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......You're probably right." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">In the end, we call it a day and go home.</p><p class="calibre3">I have to say, today is definitely unsatisfying.</p><p class="calibre3">In the evening, as the sun begins to set, I walk alone and let out a deep sigh.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm no saint or anything, but I just found this situation to be a real pain.</p><p class="calibre3">It's different from doing things for Rei and the girls or for Yukio.</p><p class="calibre3">In the end, it's difficult to break down the wall once it was built.</p><p class="calibre3">"Phew~..." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I return to the apartment and unlock the door to my room.</p><p class="calibre3">Then I noticed that there were three pairs of girls' shoes lined up next to my own shoes.</p><p class="calibre3">As I walk down the hallway with a distant look, I see the familiar figures of those girls in the living room.</p><p class="calibre3">"My, welcome back." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Just to make sure, this is still my house, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What such weird things are you saying? Obviously, this is your house." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">Those three, Kanon, Rei, and Mia, look at me with a gaze questioning if I'm nuts.</p><p class="calibre3">They're all dressed casually and enjoying snacks and carbonated drinks that they must have bought from somewhere.</p><p class="calibre3">"Welcome back, Rintaro-kun. We've been waiting for you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Me?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, for now, we want you to sit down." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sure, whatever. But first, let me wash my hands and gargle." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I don't really mind if they are in my house.</p><p class="calibre3">I finish washing my hands and gargling in the bathroom and return to the living room.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry to keep you waiting. So, what's it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, do you remember the talk we talked about when we were with Kanon before?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, that talk about the band, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I believe it was about practicing together with Kanon playing the guitar, Mia playing the drums, and Rei doing the vocals.</p><p class="calibre3">At that time, Mia hadn't been informed yet――――</p><p class="calibre3">"After that, I contacted Mia and she easily agreed." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, it sounds interesting. I occasionally rent a studio to relieve stress by playing the drums alone, but I've never played with anyone else before." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......That's it. I just wanted to inform you." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">I understand most of it.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto seemed to be having a lot of fun, too, and playing in a band is definitely a different kind of fun from playing alone.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, it's just a hobby, but both they and I should have taken care of what we usually need to do, so there's no reason for anyone to complain.</p><p class="calibre3">"I get all of it, but couldn't you have just told me with a message on LINE? You didn't have to come all the way to have a girls' meeting in my room." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You are really...... Look, it's that thing." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you mean by that thing?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I mean that thing so it is that thing!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">I see, there doesn't seem to be any particular reason.</p><p class="calibre3">I know Rei's schedule, and I know that she has today and tomorrow off.</p><p class="calibre3">In other words, they are also off.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing them being lazy like this, it's hard to believe that they are immensely popular idols.</p><p class="calibre3">Their appearance is very good, but it's a matter of attitude.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Whatever the talk, I, who tend to be a somewhat fastidious person, have allowed them to invade my home, and I feel like I'm trusting them too much.</p><p class="calibre3">It's not that it's bad, though.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, do you have a song you're practicing now? Come on, tell me. I'll learn it for you." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Wow, that's so cool..."――――I was about to say that, but since it's Kanon, I'll refrain.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't let her get carried away.</p><p class="calibre3">After I swallow my words, I let them know the name of the song, and Kanon and Mia nod in agreement.</p><p class="calibre3">"As expected, that's the go-to song for practicing. The structure is straightforward, and there aren't any particularly difficult parts." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"I may not be perfect, but I understand most of it. We'll be ready by <i class="calibre6">tomorrow</i>." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Wait, tomorrow?</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... Rintaro, do you have time tomorrow?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"That should be the thing you ask first, Rei." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I forgot." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei's nonchalant response makes me sigh involuntarily.</p><p class="calibre3">What would she have done if I had already made plans?</p><p class="calibre3">Or did she think I was too laid-back to have plans?</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well, she's not wrong though.</p><p class="calibre3">Yuzuki-sensei said it's okay if I don't come over often this month because I'll probably be busy at school, and I'm not hanging out with Yukio every day either.</p><p class="calibre3">"But don't we need to reserve a studio for band practice? Is it okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Who are you talking to? I just contacted the manager and had the drums and amp moved to the private studio." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, you're on a different level." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">According to what I heard, the studio I delivered lunches to the other day turned out to be a private studio.</p><p class="calibre3">I thought Rei was renting it and waiting in line every time, but it seems that it meant the tenant was the agency.</p><p class="calibre3">In other words, that place is the studio rented by "Mille-Feuille Stars" and no one else uses it――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"I heard that other artists build their own personal studios. But it's enough for us to just rent it, otherwise, we'd just use it as a hangout spot or let it go to waste." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">I guess so.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"Rei, memorize the lyrics. You're okay with it, right?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, okay." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">The conversation proceeded smoothly, and I'm grateful for the opportunity.</p><p class="calibre3">I couldn't have a satisfying rehearsal at the studio today, and I had been wanting more time to practice with others.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if the other person wasn't Kakihara or Doumoto, the experience of playing music together with someone else would be beneficial.</p><p class="calibre3">"But still... There aren't many people like Rintaro who come to the office with us, right?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm still worried about whether I stand out too much." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Haha, if we were seen walking alone together, it might be different, but if it's with the three of us walking together, we probably just look like people from the entertainment industry. You just need to be confident." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Confident, huh?</p><p class="calibre3">Does she really think I, who isn't even a celebrity, can confidently walk alongside these girls?</p><p class="calibre3">Let me say it upfront, it's impossible, not even a bit.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps she understands my personality well, Mia stifles a chuckle, covering her mouth.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Hey, don't you think Mia and Rintaro are getting too close? Their way of addressing each other is somehow different." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"They are, I'd like them to keep a bit more distance." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon and Rei are muttering something as they look at us.</p><p class="calibre3">When they mention the distance, I glance at Mia, and it does seem like there was less space between us than usual――――or does not.</p><p class="calibre3">It's probably just my imagination. It must be just a minor difference.</p><p class="calibre3">"Come on, our distance has always been like this. Right, Rintaro-kun?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, Mia wraps her arm around mine.</p><p class="calibre3">When she does that, a soft sensation is transmitted to my upper arm, and my mind is thrown into disarray.</p><p class="calibre3">Dang, why do women smell so good? Even though I have no intention in this, please stop making me feel dizzy.</p><p class="calibre3">"Mia, get away from Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Why? Isn't this just a little bit of skinship?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Why are there sparks flying between Rei and Mia?</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, I don't want unnecessary fights, so I try to pull Mia away with my free hand――――</p><p class="calibre3">"Get away from him." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">――――That very arm I try to pull Mia away is now entangled by Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">The soft sensation that almost drove me insane with just being transmitted to one arm now doubles.</p><p class="calibre3">I seriously can't handle this sensation. Seriously, I can't handle this.</p><p class="calibre3">It is said it's better to say important things twice.</p><p class="calibre3">"Your philtrum is getting longer, you know." (Kanon) <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6"><span class="calibre21">(PTW/N: 鼻の下が伸びる (hana no shita ga nobiru), [Idiom], lit.: the area below one’s nose gets longer, meaning: to make a goofy face when seggsually attracted, to have a l*wd look on one's face, to ogle.)</span></i></b></p><p class="calibre3">"It's not. Don't make light of my record of feigning innocence." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"If you say that, it means you're actually happy, right? After all, philtrum can't physically get longer, can it?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">That's definitely true.</p><p class="calibre3">Thanks to Kanon's comment, seems like I've dug my own grave.</p><p class="calibre3">By the way, I'm just holding back with all my might, but I do have the sexual desires of a high school boy.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm trying my best to endure and not cross that line.</p><p class="calibre3">I beg you, please stop doing things that easily push me to cross that line.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sigh... hey, didn't I tell both of you multiple times not to touch a guy so easily? Just get away from him already." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">At this point, Kanon looks like a goddess of salvation to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"If Mia does, I'll do too." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll do too if Rei does." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei and Mia glare at each other without giving in.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps getting annoyed by their stubborn attitudes, Kanon gives them a fierce look and chops them both in their heads.</p><p class="calibre3">"Cut it out! It's fine to fool around in private, but I won't allow any indecent behavior!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">""Ouch......"" (Rei, Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">As Rei and Mia hold the spots where they were chopped, my arms are finally freed.</p><p class="calibre3">I lift my head to thank Kanon, but she unexpectedly flicks my forehead as if she has aimed for it.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ouch!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You too, you could have forcibly pulled them away if you wanted to. It's a punishment for being spoony." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Y-you...!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What, do you have a complaint?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"...No." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">You're just like a mother――――</p><p class="calibre3">As I'm about to say that, I remember my position.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't find the words and I unintentionally avert my gaze from Kanon's questioning stare.</p><p class="calibre3">"You're such a weirdo, Rintaro. Come on, you guys need to get your act together!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Kanon's chop still works as usual......" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Judging from Mia's words, it seems that they've received her iron-fisted punishment several times.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing them instantly become obedient, they must've been through situations like this a few times before.</p><p class="calibre3">They both indeed have a tendency to go wild, and Kanon must have gone through a lot of hard times.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Well, let's cut the playtime off. Should we gather at the office tomorrow?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sounds good. Rintaro, you remember the place, right?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">I nod.</p><p class="calibre3">I won't easily forget what happened a few months ago.</p><p class="calibre3">"Then we'll go ahead and pick you up at the lobby later. Make sure to bring your instrument, okay?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Got it... hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Just when I think the conversation is settled, suddenly a rumbling sound comes from somewhere.</p><p class="calibre3">Attracted by the sound, the gaze of me, <i class="calibre6">Mia</i>, and <i class="calibre6">Kanon</i>&nbsp;are drawn towards it.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――I'm hungry." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I had a feeling that this lass was the culprit.</p><p class="calibre3">While we were talking about this and that, it's already about time for dinner.</p><p class="calibre3">It's about time for me to fulfill my original role too.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll prepare the dinner. Both of you wanna join too?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is it alright?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's strange to tell you girls to leave when you're here. And there are enough ingredients, so you can join us without hesitation." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Really? Then I'll take you up on that offer." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">I grab an apron and head to the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, by the way, do you girls have any specific food you want to eat?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm fine with whatever Rei wants." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Me too. The one who is the hungriest is probably her." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">These girls really get along well after all.</p><p class="calibre3">The tension from earlier seemed like it could escalate, but it was just playful banter.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Probably.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well then, I'll prepare according to what Rei wants, but what do you want to eat?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I want omelette rice." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, that's easy since it doesn't need much preparation." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I have chicken thighs ready, and there are still some onions left.</p><p class="calibre3">If I mix in carrots and green peppers, we can at least get some vegetables in it.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, right. Rintaro, can you make a runny omelette rice?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"A runny one?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, the one that's half-cooked." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm called from the living room, and when I turn back, Rei walks towards me and shows me her phone screen.</p><p class="calibre3">What is displayed is not a traditional omelette rice that wraps chicken rice, but a type of omelette rice where the egg is lightly cooked on top of the rice and then cut open.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you want to eat this?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, sorry. It's not like that. But if you can make it, I wanted to try it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not impossible, but it's not doable today. Making demi-glace sauce takes quite some time after all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I understand. I'll ask you next time." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sure." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">After that exchange, I returned to cooking.</p><p class="calibre3">(The demi-glace sauce... the demi-glace sauce, huh?)</p><p class="calibre3">It's a versatile sauce that can also be used for hamburg steak, so I do want to get better at making it.</p><p class="calibre3">The problem is, the more serious I want to make it, the more I have to buy "red wine".</p><p class="calibre3">I have reservations about buying it as a minor, and even if I can buy it, it'll lower the credibility of that store.</p><p class="calibre3">I've heard that alcoholic beverages for cooking like cooking wine are expensive――――Hmm.</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't you envy that exchange?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. I'm honestly envious." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">While Rei and I are having our conversation, the other two seem to be talking about something, but I have no way of knowing as I retreat into the depths of the kitchen.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Just like yesterday, I carry my bass on my back and leave my house a little later than the time Kanon had told me.</p><p>The weather is clear. Although the temperature is high, it isn't as scorching hot as the peak of summer.</p><p></p><p>With the weight of the bass slowing me down a bit, I make my way to their agency office.</p><p>It's within walking distance without needing to take a train, but it's a bit far for walking, or rather, it's at that perfect distance where it's not too close or too far.</p><p>Of course, those three who belong to the agency are being picked up and dropped off by taxis and such, but that is not the case for me.</p><p>I thought that using a bicycle would make it a bit easier, but when I actually tried it, the bass was too heavy and I couldn't ride it properly.</p><p>I could force myself to go, but it's much better to walk than to fall and break the bass.</p><p></p><p>By the time I started sweating, I finally arrived at the Fantasista Entertainment Office, which I hadn't been to in months.</p><p>I enter the entrance and go to the reception desk.</p><p>The woman who had helped me last time was standing at the reception, making a startled look on her face when she saw me.</p><p></p><p>"Could you be Mister Shidou?"</p><p>"Huh? Ah, yes, I am." (Rintaro)</p><p>"I've been informed about you. Please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Seems like they had already informed the details in advance this time.</p><p>The woman in reception makes a phone call and after a while, a familiar red-haired girl appears from the elevator wearing practice clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Rintaro. Right on time." (Kanon)</p><p>"Yeah. Thanks for letting the receptionist know." (Rintaro)</p><p></p><p>I remember being looked at with suspicion last time.</p><p></p><p>"I've learned to be considerate since Rei picked you up last time. Especially this time, it's completely private, so we should be more cautious about our surroundings." (Kanon)</p><p>"You really have it together." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Yeah. No matter how good you are at singing and dancing, you can't make it as an idol without thoughtfulness and charm." (Kanon)</p><p></p><p><i class="calibre6">And a little bit of cunningness too――――</i></p><p></p><p>Saying that, Kanon puts her index finger on her lips and winks at me.</p><p>Caught off guard by her cuteness, my heart jumps and I shyly look away.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my goodness~!? Could it be that this sweet Kanon-chan got you fascinated?" (Kanon)</p><p>"Thank you, Kanon. Your attitude brought me back to my senses." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Why!? Why are you being so cold!" (Kanon)</p><p></p><p>If she just stayed quiet, she would be such a cute girl, but that annoying attitude of hers ruins everything in an instant.</p><p>However, that's fine with me. Totally fine.</p><p></p><p>I walk down the path I had only taken once before and enter the heavy door of MilleSta's private studio with Kanon. Inside, two girls wearing exercise clothes for lessons are sitting and chatting with each other.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you're here." (Mia)</p><p>"Are you guys done with the setup?" (Kanon)</p><p>"Yeah. Mine is all set. Rei's microphone is also set up." (Mia)</p><p></p><p>When Mia directs her gaze in a certain direction, there are drums and large amps like in the studio that Doumoto had taken us to.</p><p>There is a microphone in the center, and Rei heads towards there.</p><p></p><p>"Rei, is there any problem with the lyrics?" (Kanon)</p><p>"I had one night, so it's no problem." (Rei)</p><p>"Alright. Then you also get ready, Rintaro." (Kanon)</p><p></p><p>Prompted by Kanon, I approach the amp.</p><p>It is not much different from the one I used in the studio yesterday.</p><p>Following the startup instructions taught by Doumoto faithfully, I connect the bass.</p><p></p><p>――――But.</p><p></p><p>"Kanon, aren't you more excited than usual?" (Rintaro)</p><p>"Well, of course! I've always wanted to play with someone like this!" (Kanon)</p><p></p><p>Kanon has the brightest smile on her face as she plays her guitar. Maybe it is because she said words similar to Doumoto's, I feel closer to Kanon than usual.</p><p></p><p>"A~, a~." (Rei)</p><p></p><p>Rei's voice echoes through the studio via the microphone. It is a voice that I should be used to hearing. But just by passing through a single machine, her voice suddenly becomes closer to the atmosphere of a live performance.</p><p>It goes without saying that my heart, which is captivated by that moment, jumps a beat at such a simple thing.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I'm ready anytime." (Rei)</p><p>"......Okay. Are you guys ready too?" (Kanon)</p><p></p><p>I nod in response to Kanon's question, and Mia hits the drums dynamically to indicate that we can start anytime.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then, Mia! On your count!" (Kanon)</p><p></p><p>Mia taps her sticks, counting the beginning of the song.</p><p>The intro of this song starts with the vocals coming in slightly faster, followed by the guitar.</p><p>In other words, at the starting point, the main focus is on Rei and Kanon.</p><p>Rei sings, and Kanon plays the guitar.</p><p>As for Kakihara, who has to do both singing and playing guitar, it is a bit risky, but since they pided the roles, it's not a problem for them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover――――they are incredibly skilled.</p><p></p><p>(Of course, that's obvious...)</p><p></p><p>Kanon's background is like Doumoto's.</p><p>Due to practicing instruments as a hobby for a long time, it's natural for her to play smoothly like this.</p><p>And as for Rei, she is a professional singer.</p><p>She flawlessly handles this song that was originally sung by a male singer.</p><p>I can't help but wonder where she can produce such a low tone, even though her voice is usually somewhat fluffy and bell-like.</p><p></p><p>(Well, this isn't the time to be drowned in thoughts.)</p><p></p><p>Once their duet is over, the A melody will begin from here.</p><p>Both Mia and I will join in from here.</p><p>Whether it's because of the experience of playing with others even once, I'm able to join in more smoothly than yesterday.</p><p>Mia's performance is undeniably skilled, even from an amateur's perspective.</p><p>While Doumoto's drums had strength and power, her drums exude a precision that never falters.</p><p>Each beat is exact, or well, that's what an amateur like me will say.</p><p>But even with my untrained ears, I can sense that.</p><p></p><p>(――――This is fun.)</p><p></p><p>As the song progresses, that feeling wells up from the depths of my heart.</p><p>Even though I only have a moderate level of skill to just keep up, playing with someone else is so much fun.</p><p>It must be fun.</p><p></p><p>"......" (Rintaro)</p><p></p><p>As I feel the last chorus approaching, I clench my back teeth.</p><p>Because playing with these girls is so fun, I regret missing out on that rehearsal with Kakihara and Doumoto even more.</p><p>Even then, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it.</p><p>Unlike work or study, we were just indulging in our hobbies.</p><p>There's no point in having a hobby if we're not having fun.</p><p></p><p>As the last chorus begins, I decide to play more intensely than before.</p><p>After all, this is just a practice. It might be better if I play this intensely so that I won't panic during the actual performance.</p><p>But as I play intensely, I see Kanon, who is nearby, smirk.</p><p>And at the same time――――the momentum of her guitar playing intensifies.</p><p>I think that it's because I intensified my momentum that Kanon follows, and that makes me happy.</p><p>And as we get more intense, the momentum of Mia and Rei naturally increases.</p><p>Ultimately, we race through this song at its peak excitement.</p><p></p><p>"You did well, Rintaro. I never expected you to lead us from the very beginning." (Kanon)</p><p></p><p><i class="calibre6">Well, you made a lot of mistakes though――――</i></p><p></p><p>Adding that, Kanon laughs teasingly.</p><p>Indeed, I should reflect on making several mistakes, even after playing with such intensity. </p><p>To put it bluntly, it is no exaggeration to say that I misled myself with my momentum.</p><p>But thanks to that, I feel like something snapped.</p><p></p><p>"...Thanks, Kanon." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Huh? W-what... that's so unlike you." (Kanon)</p><p></p><p>It's rude to say it's unlike me just because I sincerely thanked her.</p><p>Well, she doesn't know all the circumstances I have, so I guess it can't be helped.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I don't really get it, but let's do it again! This time, a bit faster tempo! I know that you slowed down a bit to pamper Rintaro! Mia!" (Kanon)</p><p>"Oh, you noticed?" (Mia)</p><p>"Of course. But it's fine, but now that we know that Rintaro is unexpectedly <i class="calibre6">'capable'</i> to keep up, so it'll be okay, right?" (Kanon)</p><p>"You're right. I'll play at a normal tempo next." (Mia)</p><p></p><p>I hear them talking like that, but I don't feel much sense of crisis.</p><p>Because I played with all my might once, I feel like my fingers move better than usual now.</p><p></p><p>――――Tomorrow, I'll talk to Kakihara at school.</p><p></p><p>Confession or whatever, that doesn't matter.</p><p>Anyway, I'll have words with Kakihara so that he can have fun performing with us.</p>
