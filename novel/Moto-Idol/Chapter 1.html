<h3>Chapter 1: Come To Want</h3>

<p class="calibre3">I had a dream.</p><p class="calibre3">It must have taken place in New York, US.</p><p class="calibre3">Many beautiful women and handsome men were walking around, and I was in the center of them.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Ah――――this is where I am now, huh.</p><p class="calibre3">Though it was a dream, I easily accepted that fact.</p><p class="calibre3">[Hey, Mia. Are you ready to go?]</p><p class="calibre3">"......OK, anytime."</p><p class="calibre3">I threw the "script" down on the chair I was sitting on and stood up.</p><p class="calibre3">This was a dream. But it was a dream that was not so far away.</p><p class="calibre3">Dressed in a glamorous outfit, I moved to the front of the camera.</p><p class="calibre3">I took a breath and look at him, who is holding my bag.</p><p class="calibre3">He makes eye contact with me and then――――.</p>
<p class="calibre8"><p class="calibre9">Leaving aside a retort of "we are not rascals", the four of us are working together to carry the ingredients to the cooking area outside the cottage.</p><p class="calibre9">The meats, including sausages and other such items, are not cheap, but are all well-processed products. Grilling them over a charcoal fire must be delicious.</p><p class="calibre9">"Rintaro, grill me a lot of meat." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre9">"Hold on, hold on. We haven't even started the fire yet." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre9">I suppress Rei's urging and prepare charcoals and an igniter.</p><p class="calibre9">The actuality is that I've never done the work of lighting a charcoal fire outside like this, so I've been secretly longing to do this.</p><p class="calibre9">With my heart racing, and following the fire-starting manual in the cottage, I start to light the fire. It is my first time doing this, so I struggle with it for a while. When I finally succeeded in lighting a decent charcoal fire, I feel a sense of accomplishment run through my entire body.</p></p>
<p class="calibre3">And there, my dream came to an end.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">It was the second half of August.</p><p class="calibre3">My best friend, Inaba Yukio, went on an overseas trip with his parents.</p><p class="calibre3">Am I taking care of her? Otosaki Rei, a very popular idol that I'm taking care of, seems to be busy with recording these days and hasn't been home much. When she did come back, she looked very tired and went straight to sleep.</p><p class="calibre3">She is a monster of stamina, including her physical abilities, but looking at how exhausted she is She must be working very hard.</p><p class="calibre3">I, whose motto is "don't work," can't stand this kind of work at all.</p><p class="calibre3">(Because I...... have a hard time even in this situation.)</p><p class="calibre3">I sip the melon soda I got from the drink bar through a straw.</p><p class="calibre3">Then I look at the two boys sitting on the couch in front of me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, guys, what should I do to get...... Azusa to look at me?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you mean by, 'What should I do?'...... All you should do is spectacularly hit on her." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto, what do you mean by "hit on her"? You don't mean physically, do you?</p><p class="calibre3">This place is the family restaurant where I met Nikaido before.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara had called me to visit this place again.</p><p class="calibre3">At first, I was reluctant, but my weak will was easily broken when Kakihara offered to pay for my lunch.</p><p class="calibre3">So I ended up being treated to a set of spaghetti and a drink bar.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hit on her this! Hit on her that, I even got turned down for a date, you know!?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then you probably don't have enough power! You have to hit her with more power!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's only going to blow up Azusa!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Seriously, what the h*ll are you guys talking about?</p><p class="calibre3">I cough one cough and interrupt their conversation.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm here in a position to give relationship advice, so I'll do my job at least.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, I guess it's hard to get someone to suddenly turn around." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, that may be so, but......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"The priority is to make her aware of you as a man, right? For example, saving Nikaido-san from a predicament." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">".......I've done that before." (Yuusuke)</p>
<p class="calibre3">――――So you've.</p><p class="calibre3">This guy had saved Nikaido from being picked up many times on her way home from cram school.</p><p class="calibre3">Then I asked her.</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">So Kakihara Yuusuke is a prince to you.</i></p><p class="calibre3">And Nikaido replied,</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">No, I think that's different.</i></p><p class="calibre3">Sorry Kakihara, but I really don't think she has a feeling for you.</p><p class="calibre3">If there was a turnaround from here, I think I'll forever be telling your story in the drinking community. Well, I don't think I'll have any drinking buddies once I become a full-time househusband, though.</p><p class="calibre3">"Isn't there anything else? Something like a one-hit turn-table strategy?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Stop it, Doumoto. Don't say that so clearly. By saying turn-table means he's losing now, right? Don't make Kakihara face reality anymore.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Yuusuke-kun. You're not going to give up at all, are you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Yeah, I'm not going to give up. Unless Azusa gets a boyfriend or I am completely rejected." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Maybe it's bad to say, but Yuusuke-kun, you're quite popular and I think you can always have a good relationship with a girl anytime you want to. But even so?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I can only think of Azusa." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... I understand. If you say that much." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I'll be honest. I am genuinely starting to support Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">At first, I was melancholy that I got involved in something troublesome――――well, I am still melancholy, but I can sympathize with and like Kakihara's single-mindedness.</p><p class="calibre3">Now Nikaido has no romantic feelings for him. It'll only be a nuisance if the obstacles are removed badly.</p><p class="calibre3">Even so, I wish Kakihara's feelings will come true if at all possible.</p><p class="calibre3">I want to do something about it as long as I don't have to sacrifice myself.</p><p class="calibre3">The answer I came up with is to take advantage of an event.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yuusuke-kun, the school festival." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Confession at the festival. Do you know it? There's an urban legend in our high school." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm pretty sure it is...... that if you confess your feelings on the stage that is set up for the closing party, you'll always succeed." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, that's it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">At our school festival, there is an event called the Closing Party, in which students who have worked hard reward themselves.</p><p class="calibre3">Even the teachers, who are usually strict, loosen their watchful eyes on this occasion and allow a certain amount of misbehavior to go unchecked.</p><p class="calibre3">At the closing party, there is a stage called the Free Stage.</p><p class="calibre3">On that stage, there is a 15-minute exclusive time for every participant, which is used, for example, by students who are not in the light music club to play in a band, by dancers who dance for fun, or by dancers who form a comic duo to show their comic talents.</p><p class="calibre3">There is an urban legend that says that the feelings of those who confess their love there will always be fulfilled.</p><p class="calibre3">To be precise, it is not so vague as to be an urban legend.</p><p class="calibre3">This is because no matter in which generation, couples have always been formed.</p><p class="calibre3">With the help of this event, which can now be called a jinx, it may become a little easier to succeed in a confession that would normally fail.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There is no doubt that by making a big public confession, you are creating an atmosphere that makes it difficult for the other person to refuse.</p><p class="calibre3">It is said that there are couples who accepted the confession on the spot but broke up within a week.</p><p class="calibre3">I can only say that it is a very cowardly move, but I don't think Nikaido would let the atmosphere of the place get the better of her.</p><p class="calibre3">She is strong.</p><p class="calibre3">She has the power to say that what is impossible is impossible, and the result is that she turns down Kakihara's date invitation.</p><p class="calibre3">In other words, there is a high probability that he would not be able to go out with her even if he went that far.――――If he is rejected on such a public stage, it will fulfill Kakihara's condition of being completely rejected.</p><p class="calibre3">And that would end all my trouble at once.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, hold on. It's okay to use the free stage, but isn't that for those who have something to show? I don't think it's acceptable to use it for a confession." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Oh, you have a surprisingly sharp point, Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">"If this idea goes through, you'll need to think of something to put on the show. How about you guys doing a two-person comedy act?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then confessing after the comedy act, how does that sound......?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... That sounds good." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Yup, that's not a comedy act anymore.</p><p class="calibre3">So what is it then? Something that can be performed by a maximum of two people, something that creates an atmosphere of confession.</p><p class="calibre3">If it's just one person, then doing a solo performance will do.</p><p class="calibre3">Oh, this is a good idea.</p><p class="calibre3">"How about a solo performance――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's it! Let's form a band!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">――――What?</p><p class="calibre3">"I play drums as a hobby! Yuusuke has a guitar too, right?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"What? O-oh yeah......, the one you and I went to buy before." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's it! I've only played with it a few times and then stopped, but now is the time to use it again!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">I see, a band, huh.</p><p class="calibre3">If so, depending on the song, you can bring the atmosphere to that of a confession.</p><p class="calibre3">But a band with just a guitar and drums....... seems to be quite difficult.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro is the bassist! That makes it a three-piece band!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">How can that be?</p><p class="calibre3">"No, you see...... I can't play bass at all, you know?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't worry! We still have more than a month to go, we will somehow manage to play at least one song!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">That's the logic of someone who can play.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm a complete amateur, and I have to start from scratch, staring at sheet music and letting my fingers memorize it.</p><p class="calibre3">I understand how difficult it is.</p><p class="calibre3">No matter how much I practice, the level of difficulty itself won't seem to decrease.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro......! Please! Please, form a band with us!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">No, It's impossible. Think with common sense.</p><p class="calibre3">But there is a law of 'he who smelt it dealt it'. It'll be irresponsible, even among kids, to let them get to this point and then just abandon them.</p><p class="calibre3">Fortunately――――I have time.</p><p class="calibre3">I still have two weeks of summer break left, so if I stay home and keep practicing, I might be able to make it.</p><p class="calibre3">......Maybe?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"But I don't have a bass, to begin with." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I am quite reluctant to buy a bass that costs at least several tens of thousands of yen for a 15-minute live performance at a school festival.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know anyone who has one, so I can't even borrow one.</p><p class="calibre3">"Actually, Honoka has it. She bought it so that me, Yuusuke, and her could play together, but she got tired of it first." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Nogi-san is the bassist?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Well, considering Nogi's personality, she will certainly get tired of it soon.</p><p class="calibre3">I think she would enjoy playing guitar, drums, or vocals more. It is just a selfish impression, though.</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't think she's going to throw it away, and I think we can borrow it tomorrow." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Okay. If you insist." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I don't really want to appear in public, but Kakihara is the star of the show.</p><p class="calibre3">If I play indifferently, I won't leave much of an impression.</p><p class="calibre3">Besides――――I'd be lying if I say I don't have an interest in the instrument.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yuusuke is definitely a guitarist and vocalist. He's a good singer and very skilled. We will have a microphone in front of us for the chorus, though." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Isn't my role too heavy?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"But wouldn't it be better if we just recruited a vocalist?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"What about Honoka? (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"The ultimate goal is to confess your feelings, so wouldn't it be strange if there is another girl in the band?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Aah...... You got a point." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I can't say what exactly, but I generally agreed with Doumoto's opinion.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, in short, the idea is that he wants to do stupid things with just the boys.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Maybe I can make it if it's the song I've been practicing." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Alright, then it's decided!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Now it's decided.</p><p class="calibre3">It will be what it will be. This event is for Kakihara's confession in the first place, and I just have to do the bare minimum of work.</p><p class="calibre3">So――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――What about the song?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm glad you asked! If we're talking about a man's love song, it's definitely that one!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">The title of the song Doumoto told me is a famous love song that even I know.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">The next day.</p><p class="calibre3">I visit the station nearest to the school.</p><p class="calibre3">It is to pick up the bass from Nogi.</p><p class="calibre3">After our discussion at the family restaurant, Doumoto explained the situation to her and received a reply saying that I could pick it up the next day.</p><p class="calibre3">And this is how this happened――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Shidou-kun! Hello again!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, Nogi-san." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, did I keep you waiting long?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, I just got here a few minutes ago." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">Precisely, twelve and a bit minutes.</p><p class="calibre3">But under the blazing sun, it's more than twelve minutes!</p><p class="calibre3">"Here, then, is the promised bass."</p><p class="calibre3">Saying this, Nogi hands me a long, black case she has been carrying on her back.</p><p class="calibre3">As soon as I receive it with both hands, I almost stumble because it is heavier than I had imagined</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh... This is surprisingly heavy, isn't it? It must have been hard to bring this here, right? Thank you so much." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, It's to support Yuusuke's love! But more importantly, you don't have to return the bass." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I look at Nogi's face in surprise, she looks away awkwardly.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, you know. My mom was angry with me. She said it was taking up too much space and getting in the way even though I don't use it. So when I told her we'd lend it to a friend, she said to just give it to him as it is." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"What, but...... this is expensive, isn't it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ahaha, actually, it is a cheap one, about 20,000 yen." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">20,000 yen is high enough, but I don't know the market price of musical instruments.</p><p class="calibre3">So, I guess it is relatively cheap. Maybe.</p><p class="calibre3">Either that, or she has no financial sense at all.</p><p class="calibre3">"If you do mind so much, buy me dinner sometime! From a slightly more expensive restaurant!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"What a shrewd and calculating.... Originally, I am not good at borrowing things from other people, so I appreciate it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">When I use something thinking that it is borrowed, I am distracted by worrying about unnecessary things. I think about how not to make it dirty, how not to damage it, and so on. All of these things are obvious, but the problem is that they cause me to overthink.</p><p class="calibre3">Being overly worried is also a problem.</p><p class="calibre3">"I see! ......Well, good luck with that. I'm really rooting for you guys." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yeah. We'll give it our all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm! Then that's even better! Well then, I've promised to hang out with Azurin after this!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks for coming all the way out here. It really helped me out." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, it's not a problem! See you at school!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yea, See you!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I wave Nogi off as she walks away.</p><p class="calibre3">She is definitely a nice girl.</p><p class="calibre3">She's so considerate, and it's no people around her like her so much.</p><p class="calibre3">――That's why.</p><p class="calibre3">She must have some idea that this incident might crack the friendship between the four of them in the future.</p><p class="calibre3">If it ends up with the two of them becoming a couple, all is well. But if failed, things won't be as they used to be in many cases.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I know how you feel." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I spit those words into the void.</p><p class="calibre3">I also have something to ponder.</p><p class="calibre3">It's been a few days since that "confession" and she's been waiting for my response.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't feel comfortable making her wait any longer.</p><p class="calibre3">It's time to tell her how I really feel.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">Clink-clunk</i>, such sounds can be heard coming from the pot.</p><p class="calibre3">The kitchen is filled with the distinctive smell of curry, which naturally whets one's appetite.</p><p class="calibre3">A blonde-haired girl is leaning against the couch in the living room.</p><p class="calibre3">It's Otosaki Rei, who is back here after a few days.</p><p class="calibre3">"......The curry, it'll be ready soon." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I've been waiting for it. It's been a long time since I've had Rintaro's cooking, so I'm looking forward to it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's been a long time, huh, but it's actually been a week or so, right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Not seeing Rintaro for a week was too lonely." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"How about Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well...... just a little bit." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Just a little, eh. But I'm glad." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Phew, that's so cute, god d*mn it.</p><p class="calibre3">After that time together at the beach, she has become more and more attractive.</p><p class="calibre3">Maybe it's just me feeling that way because I don't hear people around me saying such things. This makes me feel a little embarrassed when I think so――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"For now, I'm going to live up to your expectations and get dinner ready quickly. There, help me clean up the desk. I'll bring them there now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm, got it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">I open the lid of the pot and stir the curry several times.</p><p class="calibre3">Today's curry is a summer vegetable curry with plenty of summer vegetables. Some people may not like eggplant or green peppers in it, but it doesn't matter to me and Rei, who are not picky eaters.</p><p class="calibre3">"Here, it's ready!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Whoaa...... it's full of vegetables." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"This is a summer vegetable curry. Here, take a spoon." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Mmm, Bon appétit!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">I hand her a spoon, and Rei scoops up the white rice and roux together and brings it to her mouth.</p><p class="calibre3">After a few chews, her face lit up.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yummyyyy!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Glad to hear." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I sit down next to her and put the curry in my mouth in the same way.</p><p class="calibre3">Yup――――this is delicious.</p><p class="calibre3">The vegetables, which are cut a little bigger than usual, are well mixed with the roux, which gives it a different taste than the meat.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if you don't have much of an appetite due to the summer heat, you can eat as much as you want because it's not as filling as meat.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm really glad you like curry. Because I can make it in bulk." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, I love curry. But I like Rintaro's curry the best. He always comes up with something new, and that makes me happy." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"You always say that my cooking makes you happy each and every time. If you say that to me, it's worth all the thought and effort I put into making it every time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Even if it is just an ordinary curry, Rei will eat it without a single complaint.</p><p class="calibre3">However, that would be somewhat――――boring.</p><p class="calibre3">Since this dish has infinite possibilities, I want to experiment with various things.</p><p class="calibre3">To put it in a very extreme way, it may be no exaggeration to say that I am conducting a culinary experiment using myself and Rei as guinea pigs.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, the premise is that I don't cook a bad meal.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"Speaking of which, Rintaro, what's that?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">As I'm relaxing on the couch after dinner and washing up, Rei suddenly points to the bass case propped up on the wall and asks me a question.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, no wonder she'll be curious about it. It wasn't there until yesterday.</p><p class="calibre3">"There's been a little thing going on. And it turns out that I'm going to perform on the stage at the closing party after the school festival." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh, Rintaro, you are going to?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is it that surprising?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. Very much." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well yeah, I think so too." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I am sure Yukio will be surprised to hear that I will be performing in front of such a large audience.</p><p class="calibre3">I take out the bass from the case and sit down on the couch again while holding it.</p><p class="calibre3">Fortunately, it seems that Nogi didn't have the habit of decorating everything with pretty things, and this bass itself was monotonously colored black and white.</p><p class="calibre3">That way, even if I carry it with me, it won't look blatantly like a borrowed one.</p><p class="calibre3">"What kind of wind brought that on?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ostensibly, it's to help other people. But underneath it all, I just wanted to start playing a musical instrument." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I didn't know Rintaro was interested in musical instruments." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Because it's cool." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">I feel embarrassed and avert my eyes from Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">My employer, Yuzuki-sensei, told me to lead a life of understanding toward various kinds of entertainment, and among them, I tend to enjoy music, which is ideal to accompany me while I work.</p><p class="calibre3">I am not yet an adult, but my simple mind easily yearns for music when I listen to it regularly.</p><p class="calibre3">As for singing, I don't think I ever wanted to try it, but I have always wanted to try playing guitar, drums, or bass guitar, even if only once in my life.</p><p class="calibre3">I didn't have any notable hobbies to begin with, so I had a faint hope that it would become a hobby if I got into it.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm just an average high school boy, so I think it would be fun to play a musical instrument and I honestly think it would be cool too. That's the kind of reason." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......It was simpler than I thought." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugh...... Sorry to disappoint. I didn't have a good reason." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No. I'm rather relieved to see that side of you. So I want to support you." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">As Rei leans toward me, she smiles as if she were looking at something pleasing.</p><p class="calibre3">Since I've been spending time with Rei, I've been gradually becoming more honest with myself――――no, I feel like I'm being forced to be honest.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that her straightforwardness in conveying her feelings has influenced me as well.</p><p class="calibre3">I thought it would just be horrible to be influenced by others and have myself change, but I didn't find this to be as bad as I thought it would be.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, when it comes to actually playing an instrument, this doesn't go so well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I fiddle with the screws called "pegs" that line up at the tip of the bass called "head" with my fingers.</p><p class="calibre3">This is called tuning.</p><p class="calibre3">If guitars and basses are left alone, they will gradually deviate from their original sound. I don't know the details of the cause, but it is said that there are various causes, such as strings stretching or shrinking due to humidity or temperature.</p><p class="calibre3">Before playing, it is necessary to adjust the strings in this way so that they sound as they should. This is a bit of a hassle, though.</p><p class="calibre3">Fortunately, there is an item called a tuner that assists in tuning.</p><p class="calibre3">If you put this tuner on the head and find that the sound is not out of tune, the tuning process is complete.</p><p class="calibre3">While holding down the strings on the neck, I plucked the strings with my other hand.</p><p class="calibre3">A piece of the prelude to the song we are going to perform echoes in the room.</p><p class="calibre3">After receiving the bass from Nogi, I practiced this part over and over again. Although I didn't have much time, I managed to play it slowly and steadily.</p><p class="calibre3">"......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"What do you think? Even if it's just the bass, one can at least vaguely tell what song I'm playing――――What's wrong?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... no, I was just looking." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I follow Rei's gaze and it leads me to my hand.</p><p class="calibre3">Is there something wrong with my hand?</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, you belong to plucking style, don't you?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"What? A-ah...... all the artists I like are playing with plucking style, because it feels more comfortable than using a pick." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">There are two main factions of bass players, which leads to the difference between using a pick and not using a pick.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, it seems that most people are plucking style, but I couldn't understand the difference in the details regarding this as well.</p><p class="calibre3">I may eventually be able to understand the difference in detail, but I wonder when that will be――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, let me see your hand." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I take my hand off the bass and show it to Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">She scoops my hand from under and begins to lay her other hand on top of mine, stroking my fingers one by one, and tracing the palm of my hand. <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: How l*wd.)</i></b></p><p class="calibre3">That is so ticklish.</p><p class="calibre3">Her face is somewhat serious as she strokes my hand, and even though I am getting embarrassed, I feel a little uncomfortable withdrawing my hand from her.</p><p class="calibre3">"Umm ...... Rei-san?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Hello~." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Yesh." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Before I knew it, Rei's entranced eyes had returned to consciousness.</p><p class="calibre3">She looks at my hand and then at my face, and somewhat embarrassed, she removes her hand.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Sorry." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"This is just my guess, but do you have a hand fetish......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I thought I didn't, but maybe I do." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"A pattern you were unaware of, huh. So, are my hands into your type?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. I have never looked at them closely before, but I think Rintaro's hands are very my type. It's bigger than I thought, and his fingers are long and slender. The veins that stick out just a little bit are somewhat...... naughty." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Let's not go any further! Okay!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">That's close, I nearly let myself be carried away by this strange atmosphere.</p><p class="calibre3">Both of us become awkward for some reason and our eyes start to swim.</p><p class="calibre3">I can no longer stand this atmosphere, so I turn on the TV.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah...... this is." (Rintaro)</p>


<p class="calibre3">What appears on the TV is a music program that airs every week at this hour.</p><p class="calibre3">The set is a set where the guests sit between the host and the regulars, but I recognize the girls sitting there.</p><p class="calibre3">Or rather, they're living next door to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"This is the one taken the other day. I think they did it to coincide with the release of our photo book." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Heh........" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">As we are both watching the program, the regular performance by the guests begins.</p><p class="calibre3">Every time in this segment, the guest performs a new song, which seems to play a role in the promotion.</p><p class="calibre3">MilleSta also performs a new song without exception and makes the program greatly lively.</p><p class="calibre3">[The new song that we just performed will be released on the same day as our photo book.] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">[We are literally putting our skin* into it, so if you are interested, please don't hesitate to purchase.] (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">[The CD also has a handshake ticket that can be used at the handshake session with us!] (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">The program ends with the advertisement by the girls.</p><p class="calibre3">But a handshake session, huh. Hearing these words, I am made to remember that these girls are indeed idols.</p><p class="calibre3">"I mean, the photo book has already been released, hasn't it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. Ah――――Reminds me, I've been thinking about giving one to Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying this, Rei takes out a magazine from her baggage that has herself and the girls highlighted on the cover, and hands it to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Here it is." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Even if I were to accept it, it's kind of complicated to think that it's a photo album of the girl in front of me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is it?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">The reason is that all of them are dressed in very revealing swimsuits.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if I am accustomed to being with Rei in this way, it is still very poisonous to the eyes of adolescents.</p><p class="calibre3">By the way, I don't think it matters, but I don't have any er*tic books. I buy everything in digital file form.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well...... if you say you'll give it to me, I'll accept it gratefully." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Mmm. It's good that you are being honest." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"It sounds like you have ulterior motives, so please stop it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I took the photo book and put it on the table for the time being.</p><p class="calibre3">At the same time, the smartphone Rei is holding starts vibrating.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, my manager is calling. I'll be out in a minute." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, she walks out into the hallway.</p><p class="calibre3">I am relieved to see that she is sensible enough to make sure I, an outsider, can't hear the conversation.</p><p class="calibre3">I pick up the photo book, which I placed on the table, and move toward my bedroom.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, I take out the "other photo book" hidden under the pillow.</p><p class="calibre3">"There's no way...... I can tell her that I already bought one myself, can't I?" (Rintaro) <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: Bro should buy at least 3, one to use, one as a spare, and last one as a spare's spare.)</i></b></p><p class="calibre3">I put the photo book I just got on a bookshelf lined with manga and put the "other photo book" back under the pillow.</p><p class="calibre3">Please don't let her find out about this by all means.</p>

<p class="calibre3">"Sorry, I kept you waiting." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">By the time Rei returns, I'm standing in the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre3">I welcome her casually and put down a cup of coffee I had brewed well in advance.</p><p class="calibre3">She sips from her mug and exhales.</p><p class="calibre3">"My manager told me the next gig was set." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, really?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes. The next show is for Halloween. After that, we might go on tour toward the end of the year." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"When you say tour, do you mean the one that goes all over the country?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">If so, Rei and the others won't be back for a while.</p><p class="calibre3">"Once the tour starts, you girls will be absent from school, then?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Probably so. We don't know exactly how the tour will go, since it will be our first tour." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">This may appear presumptuous, but when it comes to touring, she will probably not be able to move freely for at least two weeks, right?</p><p class="calibre3">I am concerned about the number of days she will be absent, but thanks to Rei's efforts, she will probably be able to stay within the acceptable range of absences.</p><p class="calibre3">If this is the reason why she has been going through such a hard time, I have nothing but respect for her from the bottom of my heart.</p><p class="calibre3">"You are one step closer to your dream, right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yes. Maybe we're almost there." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei clenches her fists with a somewhat expectant look on her face.</p><p class="calibre3">Her dream is, to perform live at the Nippon Budokan.</p><p class="calibre3">For those who have become national idols, it is not a distant goal.</p><p class="calibre3">But that does not mean it is an easy goal.</p><p class="calibre3">――――If, she were to fulfill that dream.</p><p class="calibre3">What will Rei do after that?</p><p class="calibre3">"?? What's wrong?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......No, it's nothing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I shake my head at her words and check my watch.</p><p class="calibre3">Before I knew it, it was already quite late.</p><p class="calibre3">"You should go back to your room. You have an early day tomorrow, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ugh... You're right. Can you wake me up at six tomorrow?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay. I've already scheduled it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks for everything. I'm already very anxious without Rintaro. If it's possible, I'd like to take you on tour with me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's impossible. I don't want to miss school." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I know. I won't ask you for unreasonable things." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">But you tried to resist for a moment.</p><p class="calibre3">Rei will be away from home again for a while starting tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems that each member of Millefeuille Stars is working on a single song, and Rei will be the first one to start working on it.</p><p class="calibre3">She is going to be even busier than before, as she will also be shooting music videos.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sure things will settle down a bit more in September......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then I guess you'll just have to persevere until then. If there is anything I can do, I will help you as much as I can." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, thank you. ――――And, I haven't forgotten my right to order you to do anything I say." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">――――Tsk.</p><p class="calibre3">"I wish you could just forget it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't worry, I'll use this right when it matters most." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Be easy on me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">The punishment for losing at beach volleyball.</p><p class="calibre3">I have heard Mia's wish, but Rei and Kanon have yet to tell me what they wished for.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm thankful as well as anxious about that.</p><p class="calibre3">"Bye, Rintaro, good night." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah...... good night." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei left my room, throwing one last unexpected pickoff.</p><p class="calibre3">In the room left alone, I let out a sigh once.</p><p class="calibre3">From tomorrow, Rei will be gone.</p><p class="calibre3">This makes me feel a little lonely again, but there is something more important to think about.</p><p class="calibre3">"A week starting from tomorrow, huh ......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">A by-promise I made during the beach volleyball game.</p><p class="calibre3">The promise to cook dinner for Mia for a week starts tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre3">The reason why it starts tomorrow is because Mia will be coming home by the time Rei leaves.</p><p class="calibre3">I have to see her tomorrow whether I want to or not.</p><p class="calibre3">I will naturally have to give her an answer to her confession――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Sigh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, let's just go to bed now.</p><p class="calibre3">Because the answer to it has already been decided.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p class="calibre3">The next day arrived with more or less melancholy in my heart.</p><p class="calibre3">I cleaned my own room and did laundry. Following that, I finished cleaning Rei's room, and then relaxed on the couch in my own room.</p><p class="calibre3">There was a time when I thought that cleaning is not something I should do that often, but it was surprisingly uplifting to be able to keep the place clean.</p><p class="calibre3">I myself often clean as a casual way to pass the time.</p><p class="calibre3">"...... it's about time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I mumble so and casually look at my smartphone.</p><p class="calibre3">Then I see a message from Mia displayed in the notification.</p><p class="calibre3">I grab a set of my cooking utensils and leave the room.</p><p class="calibre3">It takes me ten seconds to walk down the hallway.</p><p class="calibre3">I stand in front of the door to the room farthest from mine.</p><p class="calibre3">I press the intercom, and a few moments later.</p><p class="calibre3">[――――Please come in.] (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia's voice comes over the speaker and I open the door.</p><p class="calibre3">"E-excuse me......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Something about the thought of stepping into a girl's room of my grade suddenly made me nervous.</p><p class="calibre3">Even Rei's room is still a girl's room――――but, maybe because I've been in there so much for cleaning, and so on, I no longer feel any kind of nervousness.</p><p class="calibre3">I wonder if that is a good thing or a bad thing...... But, well, it doesn't matter either way.</p><p class="calibre3">"Yo! I'm glad you're here." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... I've promised after all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I scratch my cheek in front of Mia.</p><p class="calibre3">She is dressed in loungewear that I have seen at the cottage, but it is still somewhat fresh.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though it is just loungewear, it doesn't have a dowdy atmosphere at all, which I can only say is due to the quality of the material.</p><p class="calibre3">"Eh, I think I've shown you this loungewear before." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be silly. I don't have a soft heart to be discomposed by the unusual appearance of the opposite sex." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmmm. You seem a bit nervous though." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Shut up!</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, never mind. Let's talk anyway. You're going to give me――――your answer, right?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Yeah." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I step into the room as Mia leads me.</p><p class="calibre3">The room is decorated with a lot of blues, which is the color of her image, and has a cool atmosphere.</p><p class="calibre3">This layout itself may be quite to my liking.</p><p class="calibre3">"Come on, sit down." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">She urges me to sit down on the couch.</p><p class="calibre3">Then she takes out a bottle of water from the refrigerator and hands it to me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry. I want to brew you coffee as you did, but unfortunately, I don't have such a thing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't worry about it. I'm not the kind of man who would complain about the hospitality of others." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I bought the coffeemaker because I wanted it.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Well, then" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I take a sip of the water I have been given and look up.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't want to waste time. This is because the longer it takes, the harder it will be for me to say it.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll let you know the conclusion I've reached." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Mmm." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I pause for a beat and then say the words.</p>


<p class="calibre3">"I, can't go out with you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Her expression doesn't change even after hearing these words.</p><p class="calibre3">It is as if she has predicted that I would say that.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, I suppose. But, can I ask you why, just in case?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......The only person I want to be my lover is someone I'm convinced I can love for the rest of my life. So I don't want to make a decision on the spur of the moment at this bratty age." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I think I have said something similar to that to Mia before.</p><p class="calibre3">Besides――――having that kind of relationship with me means that she will inevitably have to work instead of me for the rest of her life.</p><p class="calibre3">I know that sounds bad, but that's the path that I'm pursuing, so I can't help it.</p><p class="calibre3">So, I think I have to be even more careful in my search for a partner considering that she will bear such a responsibility.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't want to be abandoned again.</p><p class="calibre3">"......, are you all right?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Uh, yeah. I am." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I've caused her unnecessary worry because of the darkened expression on my face.</p><p class="calibre3">Now is not the time to make her worry about me.</p><p class="calibre3">I have to tell her why――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――And besides. It's not like you actually are in love with me, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia's expression finally changed here.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"It's not that I don't get the feeling you like me. It's just that I don't think it's the only reason." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">It's hard to put into words, but it felt like "there's a reason why she had to do it".</p><p class="calibre3">"If you don't want to tell me the reason, I won't ask you. But I don't feel comfortable...... being used for something without being told." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yeah, you're right. I'm ...... sorry about that." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia then apologizes honestly.</p><p class="calibre3">I accept it and wait for her next words.</p><p class="calibre3">"Last time, I told you that my dream is to have a career abroad, right?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"You did." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Just recently, I feel like I'm starting to get a foothold in that dream." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia takes a sip and continues.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"A well-known director with international connections is holding auditions for his new film. If I pass the audition, then――――" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"You'll have a foothold to go international, right? That sounds like a great opportunity." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, but...... the problem is that the film I'm auditioning for is a romance one." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Aah......, hmm?</p><p class="calibre3">"What's the problem with that? Isn't any work as difficult as any other?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, that is. But I ...... have never felt what is called love in my entire life." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">She narrows her eyes somewhat sadly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"How can I put this....... perhaps it's because I've lived my whole life trying to be like my mom, I haven't really been able to see much of the people around me. This is so embarrassing to say but I still can't even remember the names of my classmates." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"That's...... You have a job to do, so you can't help it, can you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I don't like to use that as an excuse. Maybe some people will be offended by it. Well, anyway. I don't know much about love. So when I got the script for the audition, I didn't know how to act." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I feel somehow embarrassed to be listening to it.</p><p class="calibre3">Romance, it is indeed difficult――――I suppose.</p><p class="calibre3">I intended to listen calmly, but if you ask me if I myself am familiar with romance, I'll answer no.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"So, you know.&nbsp; If I don't know, then I thought, why don't I just try having a boyfriend?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Then, it didn't have to be me, did it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"No, let me be clear about this. I confessed to you because it's you. You are the one I trust the most." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I make eye contact with Mia.</p><p class="calibre3">Looking into her eyes, there is no hint that she is lying or deceiving.</p><p class="calibre3">I think I can trust her on this part.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro-kun. I know I'm being brazen, but allow me to ask you this." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... What is it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Can you pretend to be my boyfriend?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I tilt my head, not understanding the intent of that question.</p><p class="calibre3">"I want you to help me experience what something lover-like is, even if it is only for the time Rei is not coming back. Of course, you don't have to do the things you don't want to." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">She can't ask anyone else for that――――.</p><p class="calibre3">I put on a stern expression in front of Mia, who tell me this with a serious expression on her face.</p><p class="calibre3">It's not that I'm offended by this request by any means.</p><p class="calibre3">I just don't know what to do.</p><p class="calibre3">(But......)</p><p class="calibre3">Mia's in serious trouble.</p><p class="calibre3">It's so much so that she's become terribly distraught.</p>
<p class="calibre3">"――――I have a condition." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"What?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"The promise to cook for you for a week. I'll cooperate with you if you can pretend this promise never happened." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Is that the only what you want?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's not that easy to cook every day, do you know it? Well, cooking may be one of the things lovers do, and I'm not saying I'll never cook for you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">If you pile on two or three promises, you will inevitably feel it as a burden in an unpleasant way.</p><p class="calibre3">The reason for requesting a reset here is for a kind of self-preservation.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Okay, I get it. I'm fine with that. If it gets you some cooperation." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Then we have a deal." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">We shake hands as a sign of agreement.</p><p class="calibre3">However.</p><p class="calibre3">"Seriously, I wonder what it is about...... something lover-like?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"......I wonder what." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"You gave Rei some weird advice in the first place, didn't you? Perhaps you're lying about not knowing anything about relationships." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I can understand why you are suspicious of me, but that's all stuff I got from fiction. And I know it's different from real life." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">――――Well, I thought it was a strange knowledge.</p><p class="calibre3">"For now, why don't we go out together tomorrow?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Aah, you mean going on a date?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm a little embarrassed when you put it that way, but yes, I mean it. Right now, a popular romantic movie is just in cinemas, so I thought we could go watch it and learn a little something." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Heh...... a romanic movie, huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Thinking back, when was the last time I went to the cinema?</p><p class="calibre3">I think the last time was a few years ago when I accompanied Yukio to a B-movie he wanted to see.</p><p class="calibre3">Uh, now I'm getting a little excited before the date.</p><p class="calibre3">"Okay. I'll go out with you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you. So tomorrow, can we meet up in front of the station?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"Are we going to start with a rendezvous......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Naturally. The thrill of coming to our rendezvous. We have to start with that." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I've already had enough of waiting under the scorching sun.</p><p class="calibre3">――――No, I should probably head to the station very early here.</p><p class="calibre3">I'll head there about an hour early, go into a coffee shop, and wait while cooling off.</p><p class="calibre3">If I have that much time, the sweat must have gone away, and I won't have to walk next to her sweating.</p><p class="calibre3">"How about tomorrow at ten o'clock in front of the station?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"That sounds good, doesn't it? We can have lunch by the time the movie is over." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I agree. Then......." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, I hear the sound of a stomach growling loudly.</p><p class="calibre3">My gaze is naturally drawn to Mia's stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre3">She instantly blushes and turns her face away to hide her embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre3">"S-sorry...... I was planning to have the dinner you made today, so I didn't prepare anything else to eat......." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">After saying so herself, Mia suddenly starts to panic.</p><p class="calibre3">"A-ah! But, since you agreed to pretend to be my boyfriend, you don't have to worry about your promise to cook for me. I'll order a delivery service later." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"...... Haha, don't worry about it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I get up and take out an apron from my luggage.</p><p class="calibre3">I have gone to the trouble of preparing the utensils. So it will be a waste to go home without using them.</p><p class="calibre3">"I told you, it's not like I won't do it. I'll serve it in no time, so just wait there." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Y-yes......" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Leaving Mia stunned, I head for the kitchen.</p><p class="calibre3">Fortunately, the kitchen has the same shape, so it's easy to get used to.</p><p class="calibre3">When it comes to dishes that can be made quickly and easily――――yup, pasta is the way to go.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I mean, if you had asked me to play the role of your boyfriend from the beginning, I wouldn't have gone through all this trouble. I've given it some serious thought, you know?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Er, well...... It appears that I'm not that good of a person either. When I see "something that people want", I end up wanting it for no reason at all." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">I don't know what the h*ll she's talking about.</p><p class="calibre3">I dismiss it as a random joke and start to prepare the dinner.</p>
