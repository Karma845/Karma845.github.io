<h3>Chapter 6: Honest Intention</h3>

<p>The day after practicing in the studio with Rei and the girls.</p><p>I go to the school, with the determination to talk to Kakihara and Doumoto.</p><p>However――――</p><p></p><p>"Huh, he hasn't come?" (Rintaro)</p><p>"Yeah, I'm a little worried because there hasn't been any contact from him." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>I go to check with Doumoto since Kakihara wasn't in the classroom, but all I find out is that he's apparently absent today.</p><p>Neither Nikaido nor Nogi seem to know why, and they have the same worried expression as Doumoto.</p><p></p><p>"Yusuke, is he okay? His parents are overseas, right? If he's not in good shape, it could be really bad if he doesn't have anyone to take care of him......" (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, I heard something like that during the tripartite meeting.</p><p>If he's feeling unwell, there's a possibility that he's in a situation where he can't expect help from anyone.</p><p></p><p>"Rintaro, can you keep me company after school for a bit?" (Ryuuji)</p><p>"Sure. You're going to visit him, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p>"Yeah. He's not a frail guy, but just in case something happens......" (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>Maybe there's another reason why he's absent.</p><p>But I remember his recent condition being somewhat strange.</p><p>His complexion was off, and his mental state seemed to be down.</p><p>With these factors in place, there's a high possibility that he's unwell after all.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't help with today's preparations, is everything okay with you, Nikaido-san?"</p><p>"Yeah. Everyone's moving proactively, so we have some leeway for a day. Sorry for leaving Kakihara-kun to you. Since he's not here, I have to take charge......" (Azusa)</p><p>If Kakihara, who is a member of the school festival executive committee, is absent, it's inevitable that Nikaido, who is his assistant, will have to take charge of coordinating everyone.</p><p>Since the preparations for the festival have to proceed steadily, it'll be a problem if she were to go visit him as well.</p><p></p><p>"I'll also help Azu-rin today. If it turns out that he's really unwell, I don't think it's a good idea to visit him in a large group. And if we stay at school, there might be something we can do too." (Honoka)</p><p>"Okay, that sounds good. Then, Rintaro and I will stop by the pharmacy before going to Yuusuke's house." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>I nod in response to Doumoto's words.</p><p>Buying sports drinks and medicine shouldn't be a waste if we're going to visit him.</p><p></p><p>After the conversation is settled, the first-period chime rings.</p><p>We exchange brief greetings and return to our seats.</p><p>When I have time to think alone during class, an inexplicable anxiety well up inside me.</p><p></p><p>(I hope he doesn't end up like this on the D-day of the school festival...)</p><p></p><p>I open my left palm and look at my fingertips.</p><p>Although it's only been about a month, calluses have formed that can be seen as proof of practicing the bass every day.</p><p>The corn I got on the first day burst the next day, and there were times when it bled.</p><p>My time, accumulated in a short period, is packed in here.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, I feel terrible that all this time I've spent is going to waste.</p><p></p><p class="calibre22">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre22"></p><p></p><p>I explain the situation in detail to Yukio, who has been working on the school festival preparations, and then I leave the school with Doumoto.</p><p>Following his lead, we board a train and get off at the fifth station.</p><p>It's a place I've walked to several times, being close to the school station. But my memory of the area is not enough to say that I'm familiar with it, and of course, I don't know Kakihara's house, so I'll rely on Doumoto here.</p><p></p><p>"...Here we are. It's still as huge as ever." (Ryuuji)</p><p>"O-oh......" (Rintaro)</p><p></p><p>We walked through the residential area for about five minutes.</p><p>At the place of Doumoto pointed to, and there stood a three-story mansion.</p><p>Compared to the surrounding houses, it was noticeably larger.</p><p>It seems like both of his parents working abroad is no joke.</p><p>We open the lattice gate that is as tall as our shoulders and stand in front of the front door.</p><p>When Doumoto presses the intercom installed next to the door, we hear the chime ring from inside the house.</p><p>However, even after waiting for a while, no one comes out.</p><p></p><p>"......Is he not home?" (Ryuuji)</p><p>"If he's unwell, there's a high chance he's in bed." (Rintaro)</p><p>"Sigh... Well, there's no helping it then." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>Doumoto takes out a key from his bag, inserts it into the front door keyhole, and turns it.</p><p>With a clicking sound, the front door is easily unlocked.</p><p></p><p>"I know Yuusuke's mom as well. They trust him, but they gave me the spare key just in case he collapses alone at home. I guess this is the time when it comes in handy." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>Doumoto opens the door and we enter the house.</p><p>I had expected that a single boy living in such a mansion would have at least some mess, but it's surprisingly well-organized, to the extent that it defies my expectations.</p><p>According to Doumoto, a hired housekeeper-like person came once a week to clean up.</p><p></p><p>"This is Yuusuke's room." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>We went upstairs and Doumoto pointed to the door at the end of the corridor.</p><p>By the way, I have already confirmed Kakihara's shoes at the entrance, so I know he is inside the house.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Yuusuke! Are you there?" (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>Doumoto calls him out with a slightly louder voice into the room, and then there is a rustling movement from inside.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm... Ryuuji, huh?" (Yuusuke)</p><p>"Yeah. Can I come in?" (Ryuuji)</p><p>"Yeah... Sure." (Yuusuke)</p><p></p><p>The voice from inside the room is definitely Kakihara's, but his usual spirit and cheerfulness are nowhere to be found.</p><p>This is clearly that he's not in good condition.</p><p></p><p>"Well, I'm coming in then." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the room, a bed, a study desk, a TV, and a computer placed on a desk come into view.</p><p>Overall, it's tidy, and there isn't much of a masculine smell.</p><p></p><p>"I see you're here too Rintaro ...... sorry I didn't contact you guys." (Yuusuke)</p><p>"It's okay, it can't be helped right? That... are you feeling okay now?" (Ryuuji)</p><p>"I managed to catch a taxi first thing in the morning and had myself checked at the hospital, so it's not a serious condition. They said it's probably just accumulated fatigue, no specific illness. I've been so busy, after all." (Yuusuke)</p><p></p><p>Fatigue, huh.</p><p>It seems that what I had feared before had come true.</p><p></p><p>"With all the stuff you've been juggling, it's no wonder your body gave out." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>As Doumoto looks at the printouts on the study desk, he mutters.</p><p>Those printouts were filled with details about the class budget and schedule.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah... the seniors asked if we could cut down the budget a bit, so I've been thinking about where we can make cuts. Especially the costumes were going to be expensive, so I called the vendors and tried to negotiate with them...... Haha, I wish I could have done better." (Yuusuke)</p><p></p><p>Kakiwara tells this with a somewhat apologetic expression.</p><p>In response, Doumoto makes a bitter face, clenches his fist tightly, and lowers his head.</p><p></p><p>"Yuusuke... I'm sorry for yelling at you that time. I have forgotten that you've been working really hard in the committee." (Ryuuji)</p><p></p><p>Accepting the sincere apology, Kakihara scratches his cheek, looking embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Same here, I'm sorry...... No matter how tired I was, I shouldn't have shown such a throwaway attitude to you guys, who have been helping me." (Yuusuke)</p><p></p><p>But――――</p><p></p><p>Pausing, Kakihara twists his expression in frustration.</p><p></p><p>"I'm anxious. Even though you've been helping me so much, if I confess and get rejected, I'll feel incredibly sorry――――No, to be more honest, I think I'm more scared of that happening." (Yuusuke)</p><p></p><p>Trying to downplay his anxiety with a chuckle, the Kakihara now doesn't seem like the super extrovert person I imagined, but just a shy boy.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"…Well, maybe I should just stop with the confessions." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Hearing Kakihara say that, that word just slips out of my mouth.</p><p class="calibre3">The two of them look at me in surprise.</p><p class="calibre3">"You're pressured because you're so determined to confess, why not think about confessing after standing on stage? It's not too late, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Whether Kakihara is considering confessing to Nikaido or not, no one besides us would know.</p><p class="calibre3">If you're scared to confess, just don't do it.</p><p class="calibre3">If you've mustered up the courage to overcome your fear, then just go ahead and do it.</p><p class="calibre3">It's all Kakihara's choice.</p><p class="calibre3">Confessing in the first place isn't something he "has to" do, after all.</p><p class="calibre3">"…...Yeah, that might be true. Confessing or things like that shouldn't be done out of obligation." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">With Doumoto's agreement in place, I look at Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">He has a relieved expression, as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders.</p><p class="calibre3">"I see… Yeah, you're probably right. There might have been some strange sense of obligation. Maybe because of that, I wasn't sure if I really liked Azusa or not." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I think it's a common story for people to be crushed by a sense of obligation and forget their original purpose.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara's feelings for Nikaido are genuine. But the busyness and pressure had deprived him of the luxury to enjoy those feelings to the fullest.</p><p class="calibre3">And now, it's time for me to speak my mind.</p><p class="calibre3">"......I've finally realized how much fun it is to play music with someone else. That's why I want the three of us to have a proper performance together." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">That's why――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"Please don't say that it's okay to stop." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"…...!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">This is my true feelings, and it's selfish.</p><p class="calibre3">It took quite a bit of courage for me to express my true feelings to them for the first time.</p><p class="calibre3">The trigger that gave me the courage was undoubtedly the practice with Rei and the girls yesterday.</p><p class="calibre3">Because that time was just so much fun, I wanted to spend similar time with these two.</p><p class="calibre3">"Just enjoying the stage isn't enough. For the confession...... Let's just forget about it for now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"…Rintaro." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"We've worked so hard to get this far, so I don't think we'll be punished for having a bit of fun from now on." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Yeah, you might be right." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I hope this will provide some comfort, but judging by the smile he puts on his face in front of me, it seems to have a significant effect.</p><p class="calibre3">In my heart, I express my gratitude to Kanon, who had invited me to perform together.</p><p class="calibre3">The next time that lass comes over, I'll treat her an apple pie.</p><p class="calibre3">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey! Is Kakihara-kun here?"</p><p class="calibre3">A senior suddenly pops into my class, where we are preparing for the school festival. She seems to be looking for Kakihara-kun, glancing around the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah! Nikaido-san! Do you know where Kakihara-kun is?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah... Kakihara-kun is absent today due to not feeling well." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">I had just received a message from Doumoto-kun, so I already knew about his health condition.</p><p class="calibre3">After I relayed the news, the senior's face looked as if she had seen the end of the world.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, for real......"</p><p class="calibre3">"Umm, What happened?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">The senior, looking troubled, awkwardly began to speak.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, it's just that... we were discussing the budget. Kakihara-kun was so good at adjusting and calculating, so everyone relied on him."</p><p class="calibre3">I see.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems like she thinks Kakihara-kun fell ill because they relied on him too much.</p><p class="calibre3">If that's the case, I can understand why she's feeling apologetic.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Well, even though he's outstanding, it's not right to rely on underclassmen too much. Instead of using exams as an excuse, we should try to handle things on our own a bit more."</p><p class="calibre3">Saying that, the senior leaves the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">I always thought he was amazing, but seeing even the senior relying on him, I realize that Kakihara-kun really isn't just an ordinary person.</p><p class="calibre3">And when my friend is being praised by others, I feel a little proud too.</p><p class="calibre3">"Azurin! Come over here for a sec!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh...? What's up?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm suddenly called by Honoka, so I move to a corner of the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">There, two classmates look troubled and seem relieved to see me.</p><p class="calibre3">"They're in charge of shopping, but it seems like the budget doesn't quite match with what we need to buy on the day. We have to either increase the budget or cut down on the materials cost. What should we do?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"W-What? The budget doesn't match?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm in trouble.</p><p class="calibre3">I had never been involved in budget discussions at all, so I had no idea of what to do.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't give careless instructions about money, which is such an important aspect. If only I could come up with a clever solution...</p><p class="calibre3">"......Sorry, I haven't been involved in those discussions. I'll ask when Kakihara-kun returns, so can you wait until then?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Y-yeah...... Sorry, we're kind of in a hurry."</p><p class="calibre3">The only thing I could do was to postpone the problem.</p><p class="calibre3">I have to report to the teacher about the budget we are going to use in the class, so I can't really afford to be leisurely.</p><p class="calibre3">It's indescribably frustrating that I have no choice but to wait for Kakihara-kun's return here.</p><p class="calibre3">"Nikaido! Where can I find the materials for the advertising signboard?"</p><p class="calibre3">As I depart from them, a boy, panting and sweating, rushes towards me.</p><p class="calibre3">"What? Ah, um... I think they might be in the multipurpose room." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"I see! Thanks!"</p><p class="calibre3">The boy, who seemed to be in a hurry, ran down the corridor as he thanked.</p><p class="calibre3">The warning not to run in the hallway had already fallen on deaf ears, and in no time, his back disappeared from sight.</p><p class="calibre3">"Nikaido-san! We've run out of paint, where can we get some?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Um... I think you can find it in the gym storage room." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thank you!"</p><p class="calibre3">Once the girl asking about the paint had left, the homeroom teacher, Harukawa-sensei, peeked into the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">"Kakihara-ku――――oh, right, he's absent today. Nikaido-san! Can you come here for a moment?" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, yes! What is it?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"We have a meeting for the School Festival Executive Committee, and I want you to attend. Just listen to what we have to say for now." (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">Told that all I have to do is take notes, I walk behind the teacher to the meeting place.</p><p class="calibre3">When I got into the room, most of the class had already gathered there.</p><p class="calibre3">Then all eyes turn towards me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, Harukawa-sensei. Is Kakihara not coming today?"</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? Yeah, he is... Is there a problem?" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, no... We always relied on Kakihara-kun to lead, so we're not sure what to do today."</p><p class="calibre3">The senior girl scratches her cheek apologetically.</p><p class="calibre3">I've been constantly surprised up to this point.</p><p class="calibre3">Wherever I go, I hear Kakihara-kun's name, and everyone relies on him.</p><p class="calibre3">He whom supposed to be close to me, but before I knew it, he had become someone that everyone in this school relied on.</p><p class="calibre3">It's something to be proud of, but at the same time, it fills me with guilt.</p><p class="calibre3">(I knew he wasn't someone strong enough to bear all these expectations......)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto-kun said that Kakihara-kun was feeling unwell due to fatigue.</p><p class="calibre3">He must have been running around so much to push his body to the limit.</p><p class="calibre3">During that time, Kakihara-kun never once asked for my help.</p><p class="calibre3">――――No, that's just an excuse.</p><p class="calibre3">It's my fault for not realizing Kakihara-kun's limits.</p><p class="calibre3">He, who always comes to my rescue when I am approached by someone scary on my way home from cram school, is not someone I can call a prince.</p><p class="calibre3">He is always too desperate to be called that.</p><p class="calibre3">Suppressing the fear and holding back the tears that well up with it.</p><p class="calibre3">He's not some perfect super prince, but a kind and gentle "hero" who always gives his all.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah..." (Nikaido)</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, I felt something melting inside me.</p><p class="calibre3">I see. For me, Kakihara-kun is――――</p><p class="calibre3">"...I'm sorry, Sensei. I just remembered something urgent." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh? What happened?" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm sorry! I have to go somewhere!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"H-huh?! Nikaido-san?!" (Harukawa-sensei)</p><p class="calibre3">While hearing the bewildered voice of Harukawa-sensei behind me, I walk down the hallway with larger strides than usual.</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">[Take care of Yuusuke-kun, okay?]</i> <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: chap 85)</i></b></p><p class="calibre3">As I leave the school building, Shidou-kun's words keep repeating in my head.</p><p class="calibre3">There is no doubt that I was attracted to Shidou-kun. But now I understand.</p><p class="calibre3">The feelings I had for him were just "admiration."</p><p class="calibre3">It's completely different from my feelings for Kakihara-kun.</p><p class="calibre3">As I pass through the school gate, I start running.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't want to convey anything. I don't want to talk about anything.</p><p class="calibre3">Right now――――I just want to see him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">"Oops, looks like it's getting late, huh?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Checking my phone after hearing Doumoto's words, it's already time for dinner, no doubt about it.</p><p class="calibre3">Even if I were to go back to school now, it would be past the time to leave.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry, I shouldn't have kept you in conversation when you're still not feeling well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It's okay. Thanks to both of you, I feel better, so I'm actually relieved to be able to talk about various things." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Even though Kakihara says that, it's really just inexcusable that we ended up having some conversation in his room for about two hours.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm glad that it helped him with mental recovery, as it is said that illness starts from the mind, but I'm not sure I can say that about his physical condition.</p><p class="calibre3">"Just to be safe, I'll take another day off tomorrow, and then I'll make sure to attend from the day after." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, I'll be waiting."</p><p class="calibre3">"......Thanks. And... um..." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara seems to have something difficult to say, but after nodding decisively, he speaks up.</p><p class="calibre3">"When I come back, would you like to practice in the studio with me again?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">At that question, Doumoto and I look at each other.</p><p class="calibre3">As we originally intended to do so, being asked in such a formal manner feels a bit strange.</p><p class="calibre3">As we pretend to keep a serious expression holding our laughter, we turn to Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'll make the reservation just in case, but if you play as half-heartedly as you did last time, you won't get off easy, you know?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm still a beginner, but at that time, I'll take advantage of Ryuuji-kun and get angry. You won't get off easy too, you know." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">As we teasingly convey that, Kakihara scratches his head apologetically, yet happily.</p><p class="calibre3">"All right, now that we've wrapped this up! Let's rock the main event of the closing party! We're gonna be the ones who are having the most fun! That's the spirit!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"The ones having the most fun are us... huh. Yeah, you're right. When you do something, it is always the best to enjoy it.." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah! ......let's do it!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto and Kakihara thrust their arms into the air with the momentum of their burning spirits.</p><p class="calibre3">(......Is this what real youth is all about?)</p><p class="calibre3">―――I hope so.</p><p class="calibre3">It is a different feeling from the hardship I experienced at the pool with them, this has a refreshing atmosphere.</p><p class="calibre3">With this kind of atmosphere, it is definitely not unpleasant.</p><p class="calibre3">Thinking that, I also raise my arm.</p><p class="calibre3">Though, because I'm more reserved than the two of them, my embarrassment got the better of me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well then, we're heading home―――" (Doumoto)</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, interrupting Doumoto's words, the chime of Kakihara's house rings out.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems like someone has come.</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, a visitor?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm, I didn't have any notice for an acquaintance to come...... and I didn't order anything online either......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Anyway, it's probably best to confirm who it is.</p><p class="calibre3">I stand up, pull away from the two, and walk towards the room's exit.</p><p class="calibre3">"Since we're leaving anyway, should Ryuuji and I go check? If it's door-to-door sales, we'll have to turn them away." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I can't let someone who is unwell do that.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, that would be great. Can I ask you to do that?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, leave it to us."</p><p class="calibre3">We decided that we would probably leave soon, so we prepared to leave and exit the room.</p><p class="calibre3">As we walk through the hallway and go to check the camera footage on the intercom, we see an unexpected person there.</p><p class="calibre3">"......For real?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">As Doumoto is surprised, I am equally shocked.</p><p class="calibre3">There stands Kakihara's crush, Nikaido Azusa.</p><p class="calibre3">Judging by her disheveled hair and the way she is breathing heavily, she seems to have come here in quite a hurry.</p><p class="calibre3">"We can't just turn her away now, can we?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah..." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">The two of us head to the entrance and open the door.</p><p class="calibre3">On the other side of the door, Nikaido looks puzzled as she sees me and Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah... you two are still here." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, what's up, Azusa? Are you here to visit Yuusuke too?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Yes, I wanted to see Kakihara-kun's face too." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">Blushing slightly, Nikaido confessed.</p><p class="calibre3">No matter how you look, her attitude was clearly――――</p><p class="calibre3">"I see. Well, I guess we should just head out then." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, that's probably for the best." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto and I exchange glances and slip past her.</p><p class="calibre3">If her feelings had changed, it would have been convenient for us.</p><p class="calibre3">It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that we could see hope for his confession at the post-festival closing party.</p><p class="calibre3">"Shidou-kun!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">As I'm leaving, Nikaido calls out to me, and I turn around.</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks for turning me down at that time and for entrusting Kakihara-kun to me." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"...You're welcome." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I had been wondering what had caused her change of heart, but I guess that was it.</p><p class="calibre3">It seemed that my clear refusal had worked out in the end.</p><p class="calibre3">(I should have done that from the beginning...)</p><p class="calibre3">It's too late for regrets.</p><p class="calibre3">In the end, it's our own fears that have made things complicated.</p><p class="calibre3">The fear of getting hurt, the fear of hurting others.</p><p class="calibre3">Everyone understands how terrifying both of those are.</p><p class="calibre3">But if you take a step forward from there, the world starts to move so smoothly.</p><p class="calibre3">"Rintaro, thanks. Thanks for sticking with us this far." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Why the sudden sentiment?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Thanks to you starting hanging out with us, everything seems to be heading in a good direction." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto says it with a happy smile.</p><p class="calibre3">For some reason, that makes me happy too.</p><p class="calibre3">I may have recognized that they were closer to me than I thought.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, see you tomorrow. Don't skip practice, okay?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Of course. I'll do my best to make sure everyone has fun." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah, let's do our best." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">I part ways with Doumoto at the intersection leading to the station, where he could walk home.</p><p class="calibre3">I arrive at the station, board the train, and get off at the nearest station to my apartment.</p><p class="calibre3">As I walk home alone, I find myself immersed in a deep sense of satisfaction.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Seem like you're in a good mood, '<i class="calibre6">Rintaro-sama</i>'."</p><p class="calibre3">Suddenly, a black luxury car pulls up next to me.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">As I stop walking, the car comes to a complete stop, and the window on the passenger side opens.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">A woman in her late twenties with silver hair pops her head out.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">She gives off a similar vibe to Rei, maybe because she has some foreign blood in her.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"......Sofia-san." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You remembered me, I'm honored." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">She says this in a matter-of-fact tone.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Sofia Kornilov. That's the name of this woman who works for a certain company.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">I'm trying to keep a calm face, but deep down, I'm really confused.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"We had an agreement not to have any contact until I graduated from college, didn't we." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm aware of it. However, this is a bit of an emergency." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">Sofia takes an envelope out of her pocket and hands it to me.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"This is a letter from your '<i class="calibre6">father</i>'. Please check the contents." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">"......What if I don't want it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"In that case, I'll put it in the mailbox at your house. I'll keep doing that until you check it." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">I let out a deep sigh and take the letter.</p><p class="calibre3">I was in a good mood to go home, but now everything's ruined.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">I shove the letter into my pants pocket and give her a sidelong glance.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">"......Tell my old man. Someone who can't keep his promises shouldn't be president." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Understood." (Sofia)</p><p class="calibre3">The car window closes, and then the car drives away from me.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">I feel like dark clouds have crept into my clear mind, and my shoulders feel terribly heavy.</p><p class="calibre3">(I have to pull myself together......)&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">I grip the letter in my pocket tightly and start my walk home again.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara has finally gotten better.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">I can't absolutely afford to lose it here.</p>
