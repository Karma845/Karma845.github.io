<h3>Chapter 9  - Give Me All
Your Too</h3>

<p>In order to take
my mind off Kasumi, I started to dedicate myself to shooting for the filming
process.</span></span></p><span style="font-size: medium;">

</span><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Every time
Kasumi's shadow comes into my mind, I forcefully stack it with a movie.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm still
learning how to edit the video, but I think I'm getting good at it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It's the only
thing I can think of. Things I can do to help Kasumi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">For the sake of
the success of the festival later, for the sake of our class, and for the
sacrifice of Kasumi, who is willing to force herself to be a 'normal girl'.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">In the end, all
I could do was finish this movie.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">For a while, the
participation rate in the filming was quite low due to Kasumi's change in
attitude, but fortunately, the motivation of everyone in the class was high
again thanks to unexpected guests who came, such as the homeroom teacher who
came with gifts, and Tadokoro who came every day after his club activities and
invited his club members to help us.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Besides that,
I'm sure everyone knows that.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">What made Kasumi
change and why.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Even so, there
were still some uninvited guests who came.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Like students
from other classes staring at us, or seniors making comments in our ears.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">At first, I
thought there was a problem with their attitude, but in the end there was
nothing I could do.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">They might still
not like the fact that Kasumi is in this class.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Even so, 'Kasumi
being in that class' is something we can't handle, so we're concentrating more
on making our festival preparations a success by assuming that everything will
go 'normally'. It's our common understanding that Kasumi is more important than
the bad opinions out there.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">In fact, in the
Class LIME group (which Kotono just started, and of course Kasumi is in it), I
think the people who talk about Kasumi are starting to look like they are proud
to be in the <i>'Miru Kasumi's Class'</i>.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">They are no
longer disappointed by the malice directed at them. Instead, they are now very
eager to win this competition by a large margin to prove to the malicious
parties &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Ah,
Kashiwagi. You sacrificed your day off again, huh, isn't Class 3 too
ambitious?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Well, if someone
who's jealous is really approaching, it's a different story.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The atmosphere
suddenly became awkward with the arrival of these cold comments.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It was Shimizu,
the festival committee member of my class and Tadokoro last year.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...Hmm,
well, that's it."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">He tried to call
my name, but I was concentrating on composing the movie scenes.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">So I just
answered as it is, nodding... and maybe it was because of that answer that he
got angry with me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Isn't it
great, huh, Class 3? Using Mirufy is cheating, right? That's why I thought, why
are you so serious when you can beat us with her without any effort?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Wrong. Maybe he
not only wanted to provoke me, but his real target was Kasumi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Well,
that's not important anyway. We just want to enjoy the festival."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Huh?
You're not the kind of person who would get excited about something like a
festival. You always look bored because you can do anything. I have never seen
you serious about anything."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"That's
right."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"You just
want to show off to Mirufy, right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I always look
bored. And I always do everything half-heartedly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Well, that might
be true.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I always thought
that everything was enough for me, but the truth is that I always felt that
something was missing. I also thought that if I died later in this state, I
would have nothing to leave behind. I feel frustrated, but I don't know how to
go on, and I don't have anyone to tell you about it. Even Fuyu-nee and Kotono
moved on and felt more and more distant from me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">But now
everything is different, there is Kasumi, there is this movie, and there are my
classmates.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm very
'enthusiastic' about doing something with everyone else, and I'm willing to
give it my all.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">If I had been as
reckless as I was last year, I might have been involved in a fight at this
time.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Sorry,
we're busy right now, can we talk again later?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I just smiled
normally in return.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Now I've found
'something' in me, so I don't care if he doesn't understand and thinks what I'm
doing is out of character. Besides, as I said here, all I'm thinking about is
how to take better pictures, and honestly, nothing else can get into my head
right now.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm
concentrating so hard right now that it's making me nauseous.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I don't want to
waste my time with Shimizu, who is only my acquaintance, not my friend.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Kashiwagi,
you are too serious. It's so embarrassing to see."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Really? I
really enjoyed it."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Really.
You're not doing well."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Is that
so?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I just smiled at
him and went on with my work.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I thought that
if I just ignored him, he would get bored and go somewhere else.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">But actually,
Shimizu is not satisfied with just provoking me. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"You know,
Kashiwagi forced me to do this thing, but didn't you force yourself too much?
You are using your precious free time. Weren't you trying too hard just for an
ordinary school festival?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I looked up and
saw Shimizu with a contemptuous smile on his face.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I mean, in
the end, you only depend on Mirufy's popularity, right? Ah, that's right? Or do
you really want to show off in front of her? Our class has nothing to show off
like you do. And the other classes think the same way, so it's time for you to
realize that. Isn't that why one of you was bullied? Well, I don't know
anyway."</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Hey...
Hey..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kotono said, not
wanting to say it to anyone, even though she had been bullied by such a
bastard. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I was so
emotional that I almost let it out reflexively, but when I saw Kotono just
staring ahead without saying anything, I finally managed to suppress my anger.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Don't be
so casual, okay, just because we were in the same class before. Mirufy must be
annoyed as well!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">No matter how
much I, Kotono, and other classmates talk to her, no matter how many times she
says she is not hurt, in the end she will blame herself again.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Even though she
was hurt, she always pretended to be okay so as not to worry others.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">So please don't
mind people like this &#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"What's
wrong with trying so hard!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">For a moment, I
didn't recognize the sharp voice.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...Kasumi...?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It's because she's
been acting like a normal girl these days.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She was already
trying not to stand out.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi, who
doesn't seem to be normal, didn't react to my voice and walked towards Shimizu.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"... Do you
know? Ren-kun always thought about the composition of his shots until he didn't
have time to sleep. That's why he always looks sleepy in class these
days."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">My name suddenly
came out of Kasumi's mouth and an unpleasant tension ran down my spine. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"It was
Kotono-chan who added important scenes for me. She was bullied because of me,
but she spoke as if nothing had happened, and even she was still worried about
me."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"So, she
noticed", Kotono, who was standing next to me, muttered to herself with a
face that looked like she was about to cry.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Sakamoto-san
was making equipment for me. I saw that he had a cast on his hand, and he still
laughed with me to cover his injury while making it at home. Asamiya-san, even
though she doesn't like me, admits that I've been doing my best lately."</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">After that,
Kasumi mentioned the names of her classmates one by one, sometimes choking up
as she said them.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I feel
like a stupid person. Why are they trying so hard? Why did they help me? They
don't want to give up on me. They're all protecting me, aren't they!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She said it
hastily, feeling guilty, and took a deep breath to catch her breath.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I've made
so many mistakes..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She smiled with
an expression that showed either happiness or sadness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm sure she's
over her limit.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Because her
voice sounded very soft and it was as if she was biting her finger to hold it
back.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Her eyes were
already very moist and it seemed as if her tears could flow freely if she
blinked once, her mouth trembling as if she was trying hard to keep her smile.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The figure
standing in front of me was very slender and fragile, as if she could fall down
at any moment, but I'm sure she would try to hold on to it because she was
Kasumi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I'm the
one who always causes trouble around here, and now you say they only rely on my
name? And the accident? Don't joke with me!!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I was so surprised
to see Kasumi raise her voice.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">For the past two
months, this was the first time I had seen her angry with anyone.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I hate
people who make fun of others who have tried so hard...! So what? Do you think
it's better if we don't try? Why? What's wrong with that? You are just jealous,
you can only talk. People who can't appreciate other people's efforts are even
more disgusting!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Shimizu can only
freeze when he is confronted with the most beautiful girl in front of him.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Then Kasumi,
while holding back her tears, gave her a smile that people had never seen
before.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I don't
want you, who don't know anything about my precious classmates, who don't know
their struggles and their virtues, to put them down again! I don't want you to
blame them anymore...!!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It was her
idol's smile like when she was on stage.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I can imagine
Kasumi saying, <i>"Even though you're hurting, you have to keep
smiling"</i>.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm not the only
one who can't take my eyes off her. I'm sure everyone's eyes are on her as
well.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It's as if we
were called to see and experience it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">When in reality
Kasumi was already completely within her limits, like a mille-feuille being
forcibly stoned from above with a fork, she looked very overwhelmed.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">What the hell is
this, really.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I almost stopped
breathing.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">This was it, the
real figure of Miru Kasumi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I saw cherry
blossoms. Behind Kasumi, the cherry blossoms were blooming beautifully.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I deliberately
formed a frame with my hands and lowered my arms, thinking that I couldn't just
look at them, the cherry blossoms.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I want to
capture them, I thought. I want to take a picture of Kasumi's current form.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Wow, what
the... now..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It was
frightening and exciting.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The real Miru
Kasumi made me hold my breath and be stunned by her, really.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;Gosh,
she's so cool.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I always thought
that she was too patient.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I also think she
should have accepted that she didn't have to blame herself for everything that
happened.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I was even
annoyed with her, wondering why she took it so hard without shedding a single
tear.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">But eventually,
for the first time, I realized that she was doing it to preserve something so
important to her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi's words
suddenly came back to me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I heard it, but

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I didn't know

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm the one who

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><i>'Miru
Kasumi'</i> is indeed distorted. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">However, this is
not normal.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">For the sake of
the people she cares about, she is willing to be hurt no matter what the
circumstances. She resisted, she endured, and even when she was beaten and
injured, she continued to smile for the sake of the people around her without
shedding the slightest tear.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">But that is why
she is Miru Kasumi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...So, of
course."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I've always run
away, always believed in the advantage of people who have talent, always run
away, never willing to change, and this is where I am now.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Even though it
looks really bad from the outside, I'm absolutely sure that I want to change.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">That's why I'm

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I will never
forgive him. I whispered it with my mouth so that no one would hear me and then
I stood in front of Kasumi who looked like she was about to fall.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I'm not in
a good mood and I'm not trying to win or anything. I don't want to compete with
you for something so boring, and honestly, yes, it's very annoying."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Shimizu's face
turned pale when he saw Kasumi who was already fighting him and me who was
already in a different state than before. Still, I had never intended to
forgive him. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">He'd crossed the
line ever since he dared to touch Kotono with the pocari incident.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">... Ah, I don't
want to deal with that man anymore, and I think it's useless.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Maybe there will
be rumors that Kashiwagi has changed, or that he suddenly lost his temper, or
something like that. But I don't care how many relationships I would break with
such rumors.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I won't be able
to make friends with everyone like a kindergartner.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I don't care
about the others anymore because now I already have 'something' I'm looking

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Ah, Kasumi

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I was so weak

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I mean,
hmm. If you want to continue living such a boring life every day, I guess I

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Shimizu's face
also turned very red, and he still tried to say a few words to deny it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"... I see, okay. Why don't you just enjoy this race the way you want?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Well, it's
clear that our class will win this year whether Kasumi is here or not!!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">For a moment,
Shimizu dared to fight back, thinking that I had missed my words as well, but
it was Kotono's cold voice that said, "I'm going to call the teacher and
complain about you interrupting our work", that made him immediately
surrender and run away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">When she turned
around, her classmates cheered as well.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">And as soon as
Shimizu was gone, Kasumi collapsed on the spot. Her classmates surrounded her
and said that she was very cool. She tried hard to cover her face, which looked
like it was about to cry.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"It was so

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kotono, who was
next to me, also looked at Kasumi with pleasure.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Mn. Thanks

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...No, I
didn't do anything. Kashiwagi-kun, I am happy for you as well. You've changed a
lot since you met Mirufy."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Hmm,
that's right, yup."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I said shyly and
put my hand on Kotono's shoulder.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...It's
impossible for me not to change."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It's not because
she's an idol.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It's because
she's Miru Kasumi, and that's what makes her so attractive.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">But without
knowing it, I had already hurt Kasumi.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...I

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She pulled at
the sleeve of my uniform.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The bright color
of cherry blossoms flashed across the tip of my eye.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I'll cry

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...
Although you are almost crying now."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Shut
up...!!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi pulled me
very weakly, which I could have easily resisted.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Where are

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Still, I was
happy to see the happiness in Kasumi's eyes again, and I was also happy to be
able to talk to her again, so I just let her pull me along.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Kotono!!
Please put my stuff and Kasumi's stuff in the locker in the classroom,
okay!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kotono also
said, "Huh!? How are you going to clean up after this!", but I
covered my ears and continued to follow Kasumi. Then she let go of my sleeves
and grabbed my hands.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I'll be
mad if you let go of my hand."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Her big eyes
were already filled with tears, and she looked at me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi pressed
her trembling fingers into mine as if she would never let go.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;&#9472;In this

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">So, following
Kasumi, we left the school and went out and finally arrived in front of a big
apartment.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"This is
where Miru lives."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Huh!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">While I was
still surprised by the size of the building, Kasumi escorted me through the
entrance, emphasizing the card-shaped key and pressing the elevator button with
a relaxed gesture.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Um... so
you really live here alone?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Of course.
I am a former Top Idol, right?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">So, she
could pay the rent.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">And then the elevator
took us to the top floor.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Ordinary people
like me will obviously be overwhelmed at this point.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"By the
way, has anyone been here before?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Obviously
not, right? You see, Miru has no other friends to invite here. I invited you
because you are."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I wondered if
she meant to mock me with every word she said, this former idol.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">While I was
still nervous about this feeling I hadn't felt in a long time, the elevator
showed that we had arrived.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"We
arrived. Take your shoes off there and let's go in."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Excuse
me."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">No, no, no, no,
I'm so nervous!</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I took off my
shoes and walked into the living room, feeling very sick from my nervousness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The room feels
surprisingly empty, and most of it is filled with monotonous furniture.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The emptiness of
this room made my nervousness a little less, but I still felt nervous. Then,
after looking at the various corners of the room, I looked out through the
large window and saw the sunset on the horizon.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"It's
beautiful here, isn't it?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...Eh?
Yup, right, it's so beautiful."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi said,
"I only realized that after living here for two months", and then
opens the entrance to the balcony.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Since
we're here, let's talk outside."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I calmed down
and agreed, then borrowed a pair of slippers and went out to the balcony. As I expected,
the balcony in an apartment of this size is obviously different from the
balcony in an ordinary person's house, the size is very spacious.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">A cool breeze
blew across my cheek.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Under the
afternoon sun, Kasumi asked me to sit on a randomly placed white stool.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She had
deliberately invited me here to talk to her personally, not just by chance, and
just the two of us.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">So it would be
better if I talked to her right away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...You
know, I'm sorry for what happened that day. I made my own assumptions and said
inappropriate things to you."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I want to
apologize as well."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi said it
so easily, and I almost lost my composure.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"It's
impossible for me to assume that this has nothing to do with me now."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Sitting on the
stool, she suddenly opened her mouth.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I heard
that Fuyuka-san told you about me."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Fuyuka-san
is innocent, okay? She heard it from me. Ren-kun, I had a feeling you would do
this."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I clasped my
hands together and looked down.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I'm
sorry."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"For
what?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"For asking
about your past without your consent."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"You're too
serious. I'm not mad at you anyway. After all, most of the information about
Miru's life is in Sukipedia."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi smiled
weakly and pressed her index finger against mine.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Well, I'll
tell you what's not in Sukipedia, okay?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">My throat
tightened with nervousness.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"You heard
about Miru's haircut incident, right? The person who cut my hair said that his
life went wrong after that incident."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...Eh."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"If you
think about it, it must be true. Even though they didn't tell the press and
only the management knew about it, Miru was their best product, so they
reported it to the authorities."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Before I can
say, "Right, of course",</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Then I was
surprised to find out that he already had a wife and a newborn child. Well,
that's the story."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Those extremely
sharp words flew to my ears.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"That's..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Heavy. The story
was so heavy that I didn't want to know what happened next.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Nevertheless,
Kasumi smiled all the time, as if she had carried this wound all her life.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Then he
asked them to forgive him. When the company refused his apology, he shouted
that things had gone wrong because of Miru Kasumi. But that's just a rumor, so
I don't know the full truth."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I think she also
kept this secret from Fuyu-nee because she knew that Fuyu-nee would be even
more worried if she knew.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi took a
deep breath before she continued.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Of course,
many people around me are protecting me, right? But it's also true that
Fuyuka-san is no longer supported by the agency after the incident, and I can't
help but wonder if it's better if Miru doesn't become an idol at all, or if
there's someone else whose life has become chaotic because of Miru... So..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">In contrast to
her serious words, Kasumi just smiled resignedly.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I'm
devastated too. I can't go back on stage."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"In the
end, I put myself in front of the fans. I was saved many times... but since I
was saved... I was afraid that they would hate me more than my ability to make
them smile. So I thought that I had reached my limit to continue being an idol."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi is very
close to me, but she feels very far away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"There are
people who like Mirufy, but no one accepts Miru Kasumi. Because the real Miru
is so confused. She couldn't get along with the people around her, she made
trouble and people hated her. So I try not to look at it by concentrating on my
idol routine."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"That's not
true..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"It is
true. I would do the same thing this time if you weren't here. I'm not normal.
That's why everyone gets hurt."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Just as she was
about to continue, Kasumi's face distorted for the first time.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Every time
I realize that there is no one around me..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Her slender
shoulders, which seemed ready to break at any moment, gasped.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She wanted to be
normal, and she thought she should not fail this time.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">In her
desperation, she covered up the distorted parts of herself, corrected them,
endured them, and tried to put the pain of others in front of her own.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"That's
because I'm not an idol anymore. And from the beginning, there were many other
girls who deserved to be idols more than me. It doesn't have to be me, not at
all".</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm sure Kasumi
is the kindest person who can love people more than anything else.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">That's why I
can't stop admiring her even now.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">To put it
simply, at first I just thought something in me would change if I was with her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I was attracted
to her sparkling eyes. I admire her and want to be friends with her and get to
know her better. But Kasumi is more than that.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She has always
been energetic and given her all. She is sensitive and emotional.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">She is sensitive
to everything and always holds back and blames herself.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">However, she
never gave up. She was always determined to go forward. And the more she
suffers, the more she shines.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Seeing that, why
didn't she ever admit to herself.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi is so
amazing. She was so far away that sometimes I wanted to give up on her and say
I couldn't reach her.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">And why she's in
denial.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Something was
rising inside me and I couldn't stop it.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It seems I'm
quite upset now.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"So you
still don't like being an idol? Do you regret being an idol, coating up
yourself, and not being a normal girl?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...It's
not like that!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The words poured
out. A cry came from Kasumi's throat.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Of course,
I don't regret it or force myself to do it! There are people out there who
spend their lives for me and live for me. So, no matter how hard it is, no
matter how strange I am, I never feel unhappy, and not even once do I feel
sorry!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I'm relieved.
This is the Kasumi I know, the Kasumi I admire, and the Kasumi who feels very
distant to me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Then
everything is fine!!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I don't care
about anything else, so focus on me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Instead of
saying that, I cupped her cheek between my hands.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Maybe you
didn't want to be an idol at first, maybe you thought you lost your feelings
for others, but Kasumi has learned to love them in your own way, right. For
your fans and for your idol's life."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Otherwise, she
wouldn't care about such things at all.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"But you
stopped being an idol because you were afraid to continue. Then it's okay,
you're a normal girl now. So why not just enjoy your life as a normal girl. And
if you feel like coming back, you can be an idol again."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi looked at
me and removed my hand from her face.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Then she stood
up and cried with sobs.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...That's

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"It's true.
You were an idol before. But being an idol isn't the only thing for you, right,
Kasumi?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">So. No more and
no less.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"If you
find something you want to do... I'll be your first fan! If you feel depressed,
I'll tell you 100 good things about Kasumi, and that's easy for me!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Because, you

permission, and when I opened the door, there was a line of food that was too

for today! Instead of always abstaining from chocolate and so on, once every

quick to take advantage of your wealth like that. You're lucky to eat well.

no. I'll stick to the delivery food."</span></span></p>

you eat first!? There is a better way to eat it, you know!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi said with

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">But I wondered
if she couldn't even hear <i>'Itadakimasu'</i> in her house, although it was

thanks to the taste of this food that was beyond my imagination and Kasumi's
gluttony, we managed to eat enough food for about five people in no time.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It seems that

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The lights are

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">As it turned
out, the room I opened by mistake was her gaming room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I don't
want you to know..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The other side
of the wall is decorated with a large monitor, like in a movie theater, and
posters of video game characters so large that I can't see the true colors of
the walls.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">The only cute
element here is a pair of cat-ear shaped headphones sitting on the table,
standing out among all the black stripes and figures of the surrounding video
game characters.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">I looked around
the room and took a deep breath.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Usually, no
matter how complicated a person tries to decorate their room, it is difficult
to find a room with such density.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">When I first
looked at the living room, I had the strange feeling that Kasumi had a house
with a normal room, so I was relieved and happy to see this.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"This room
is so cool, I want to live here."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Uuuu! Why
are you being so nice to me, Ren-kun?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I envy you
for having something you're so fond of! You should be more proud of yourself
for being so great."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">If I had a room
like this, I would definitely invite my friends over 5 times a week to show it
off. Uh, no, if I were obsessed with something like that, I would treat that
room as sacred to me and wouldn't let anyone in.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I see.
You're that kind of guy..."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi said
after taking a breath and then turned on the light in the game room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Then she looked
at me with a blank expression.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Miru is a
gamer. I can't live without this room. My apex rank is diamond, and I play solo
all the time because I don't have any friends. Do you find me strange?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"No. But as
always, I am very jealous of you." </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Giving
everything as an idol, even taking your hobbies so seriously, how idealistic
your life has always been.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Share that
little bit of your way of life with me.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...Ah,
Mouu. I hope you will withdraw from seeing me like this. It makes me like you
even more, and it's a problem for me."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"...Eh?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"No, no. I
just said that I chose the wrong person to interact with."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi, who
looked happy despite saying that, quickly went to her game room.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Hee, no
one is more suitable for this job than me. I was hurt by your words~"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"You're not
really hurt if you can say it like that. Well, you always say that I make
mistakes, but you never say that you don't like it, right? Actually, I'm happy
because my partner is Ren-kun."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"... Ah, I
see."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Something like
that makes me feel that Kasumi is so unfair.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Before I
misunderstood the meaning of her words, I changed the subject.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">With Kasumi like
that, there must be no room for misunderstanding. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Oh, I
remember. Did you mean to play games with me <i>'after that'</i> before?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">That's right. I
think she was so excited about the arrival of her classmates that she didn't
expect her friend to go home right away.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Even for dinner,
I could have gone straight home to eat instead of her having to order it for me
as well.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">When I looked at
Kasumi's face, I saw that she was blushing with shame and flushed like a
poached egg.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Is this a sign &#8594;
My guess was right.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I told you
to forget that! Oh, yeah! I was going to pretend to be a light gamer by asking
you to play Mario Kart and so on! How!? You don't like it!?"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I didn't
say I didn't like it. And so, let's just play Apex. But I'm a newbie, so carry
me, please~"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"I have no
choice. Miru will carry you to your death."</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Kasumi said it
with a big smile on her face and didn't hide her doubts anymore.</span><span style="font-family: &quot;Georgia&quot;,serif; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">Then we played
the game together for two hours before it was finally over.</span></span></p>

can't do it! Okay, I have a good position... argh! Ah... your aim is garbage!

that's really rude of you. You didn't turn on the voice chat, so I was the only
one listening to you, but how could you keep yelling?"</span></i><span lang="EN"></span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">It turns out
that Kasumi is the kind of person who changes her personality when she holds
the mouse. </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">If she did that
all the time, her throat would be dry.</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN"><span> </span>"Yosh, nice
Ren-kun! I really thought I was going to die when I was discovered, but it's
really fun to play games while talking! I always turn off my voice chat to
avoid being recognized, so this is the first time I have done this!"</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; mso-margin-top-alt: auto;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span lang="EN">However,
compared to her <i>'idol-like'</i> and always smiling self, she now looks more like a
