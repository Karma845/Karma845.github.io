<h3>Chapter 9: The Post-festival Closing Party</h3>

<p class="calibre3">"Otosaki-san is really popular, isn't she?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">Standing next to me, Yukio murmurs as he looks at the crowd gathered in the schoolyard.</p><p class="calibre3">In the center of the crowd is our idol, Otosaki Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">"This should have a great promotional effect, don't you think?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Although I think it's a little too overdone, though.</p><p class="calibre3">Today is the second day of the school festival.</p><p class="calibre3">Our maid and butler café is allowed to operate as usual since yesterday's issue didn't turn into a big deal.</p><p class="calibre3">As for the person responsible for the incident, Kinjou, it seems he did not receive much punishment because I did not strongly appeal to the authorities.</p><p class="calibre3">However, I heard that he was suspended from school for around a week and that he could not prevent a report from being sent to the modeling agency with which he had a contract.</p><p class="calibre3">It will probably affect his future entertainment activities, but it's better than being involved in a criminal case.</p><p class="calibre3">[Otosaki-san is so cute......]</p><p class="calibre3">[Isn't REI's maid outfit like a premium item?]&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">[I want to date her... I want to date her for real.]</p><p class="calibre3">[C-can I take a picture with her?]</p><p class="calibre3">As we approach the crowd, voices of affirmation for Rei can be heard from seniors, classmates, and juniors alike.</p><p class="calibre3">I'm as happy about Otosaki Rei's popularity as if it were my own.</p><p class="calibre3">But――――deep down, for some reason, it hurts a bit.</p><p class="calibre3">"...More importantly, Rintaro, it's finally today." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm? Oh, yeah. It's been quite chaotic lately, so it doesn't quite feel real."</p><p class="calibre3">After today's school festival, our post-festival closing party will begin.</p><p class="calibre3">It's a place to showcase our practice results and at the same time, it can be a turning point in Kakihara's future school life――――and even his life.</p><p class="calibre3">There's a great possibility he won't confess, but whether he does or not will greatly affect his life, and I'm not lying about that.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps the recent illness was a turning point for him, as his nervousness was at a minimum.</p><p class="calibre3">At least he doesn't seem to be overly tense, which is a relief.</p><p class="calibre3">"This is my first time doing something like this, so I need to stay focused." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"...Do your best, Rintaro." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Yukio probably never thought I would be on stage.</p><p class="calibre3">It wouldn't be surprising if he thought it didn't suit me.</p><p class="calibre3">But, his smile showed pure anticipation.</p><p class="calibre3">It's the expectation of my best friend. So I want to live up to it.</p><p class="calibre3">(I've done everything I can...)</p><p class="calibre3">Looking down at the palm of my hand, I see the calluses that have formed on my fingertips.</p><p class="calibre3">This is my proof of all the effort I've put in. It's been a result of one thing that started in the summer, both enjoyable and painful.</p><p class="calibre3">The saying that "hard work pays off" may sound like a cliche, but I can understand it when I think about how it wasn't all for nothing.</p><p class="calibre3">At any rate, the result of all the effort I've put in will be my support from now on――――.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, for now, let's finish today's work. We won't be able to enjoy the closing party if the school festival doesn't end successfully." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're right!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre3">I still have some kitchen work to do.</p><p class="calibre3">Let's finish it quickly and prepare for the afternoon.</p><p class="calibre3">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre3">"Everyone! Good job for the past two days!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"""Good job!!!"""</p><p class="calibre3">Following Kakiwara's lead, we raised our paper cups.</p><p class="calibre3">In the afternoon, after finishing our business without any particular trouble, we hold our remaining drinks and commend each other for our hard work.</p><p class="calibre3">Although the sales during the time we worked as butlers on the first day were slightly dropped thanks to Kinjo, on the second day, there was no particular impact. If anything, Rei's promotional activities seemed to have been too effective, as the sales didn't change much from the first day, even though there shouldn't have been any public customers.</p><p class="calibre3">"The post-festival closing party is optional, so from here on, we're all free to disperse. Really, everyone, good job until today." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey hey! You guys are going to be on stage at the closing party, right? I'll make sure to see your performance before I leave."</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing our classmates grinning, Kakiwara scratches his head in embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre3">"I-I see... I and Ryuuji and Rintaro worked hard, so please come and see us." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't be shy!"</p><p class="calibre3">Watching Kakiwara being roughhoused by the guys, I can't help but find it amusing.</p><p class="calibre3">In the midst of that, Nikaido and Nogi approached me.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey, Shidou-kun. Did my bass come in handy?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. I've been using it carefully." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm hmm, glad to hear." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">Nogi also seems somewhat pleased and satisfied.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps she has been worried about letting her treasure go to waste all this time.</p><p class="calibre3">"Are Nikaido-san and Nogi-san going to the closing party? If you're willing, I'd like you to come and see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"We'll be there. We have to properly witness you guys' big moment!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">Nogi cheerfully announces, and next to her, Nikaido fidgets with her hands and mutters with a slightly flushed face.</p><p class="calibre3">"About that... Kakihara-kun really wanted me to come and see, so... that's why." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">――――Ooh, well done, Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">"...I see. Then, we have to make sure to see them!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">Nogi, still with a happy expression, grabs Nikaido's hand and shakes it.</p><p class="calibre3">Nikaido becomes flustered by the momentum, but in the end, she doesn't seem entirely displeased, much like Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">(I see you've made up your mind, Kakihara.)</p><p class="calibre3">By the fact that he directly asked Nikaido, Kakihara must have intended to confess.</p><p class="calibre3">Even though he must have been suffering so much, the fact that he was able to show his usual refreshing face, unlike at that time, might mean that he has somehow managed to overcome something.</p><p class="calibre3">Although he must have suffered so much at that time, he now is able to put on his usual fresh face, maybe it's because he was able to overcome it somehow――――Although I don't know how.</p><p class="calibre3">For some reason, I find myself feeling nervous.</p><p class="calibre3">Yeah, it's embarrassing to say it myself.</p><p class="calibre3">"Hmm... huh?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">"What's wrong? Honoka." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, come to think of it, isn't Otosaki-san gone?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre3">As to what Nogi said, Rei's figure is not visible in the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">I had noticed that, but I had concluded on my own that she must be in the restroom or something.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, suddenly, the school broadcast begins to echo from the speakers installed in the classroom.</p><p class="calibre3">[Ah, testing.]</p><p class="calibre3">The voice that seems to be a microphone test sounds familiar.</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh, Otosaki-san...?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">As Nikaido said, this voice is undoubtedly Rei's.</p><p class="calibre3">Amidst the confusion of my classmates, she continued her words through the speaker.</p><p class="calibre3">[Umm... Hello, I'm Otosaki Rei. To all the students at the school, thank you for your hard work in succeeding the school festival.] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Hearing her faltering voice, the classroom and the hallway fall silent to hear her continued words.</p><p class="calibre3">[Including the preparation period, I wasn't able to be involved in the school festival very much. And yet, I heard rumors that everyone in my class was getting into trouble because of me.] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">The classroom becomes slightly buzzy.</p><p class="calibre3">Since it had been decided that the incident with Kinjou was not to be told to Rei, it must be awkward that the situation is already known.</p><p class="calibre3">What they don't know is that she was there and was almost harmed, so it's inevitable that she already knows about it.</p><p class="calibre3">[Today, I want to make amends for that, so I'm borrowing the broadcasting room like this.] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Please look at the schoolyard――――.</p><p class="calibre3">In response to Rei's words, we look outside from the classroom window.</p><p class="calibre3">In the schoolyard in front of us, there are preparations for a campfire and the foundation of the closing party stage.</p><p class="calibre3">And on that stage, there are two figures.</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?! Aren't those KANON and MIA?!"</p><p class="calibre3">"No way?! Seriously?!"</p><p class="calibre3">The excitement spread among my classmates.</p><p class="calibre3">Those two are definitely Kanon and Mia.</p><p class="calibre3">When both of them notice that we are watching, they wave towards the school building.</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, cheers erupt from the entire school.</p><p class="calibre3">[As a prelude to the post-festival closing party, we, Millefeuille Stars, will borrow the stage for a little while. We hope you enjoy it.]</p><p class="calibre3">With those words as the conclusion, the school broadcast ends. ――――Needless to say, everyone left the classroom in unison.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">Before I knew it, many students had gathered in front of the stage set up in the schoolyard.</p><p class="calibre3">It may be an exaggeration to say "all the students," but at least 80% of them seem to be there.</p><p class="calibre3">"WHOOAAAAAAAAA! It's KANON in the fleeeeeesh!"</p><p class="calibre3">"MIA-samaaaaaaaaaa! MIA-sama, look over here, pleaseee!"</p><p class="calibre3">The two on the stage respond to the cheers by waving their hands.</p><p class="calibre3">With just that simple action, the entire schoolyard is enveloped in even louder cheers.</p><p class="calibre3">Truly, it's as can be expected from idols.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Everyone! Thanks for going along with our REI's whims!] (KANON)</b></p><p class="calibre3">"""No problem at all!"""</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[All of you are so kind, I'm happy! But since we're here like this, we'll do our best to make it as exciting as possible!] (KANON)</b></p><p class="calibre3">"""WHOAAAAAA!"""</p><p class="calibre3">When KANON is in her idol outfit, she gives a completely different impression than usual.</p><p class="calibre3">She is known in the public eye as a lively and energetic girl, and she indeed puts that part of herself out there. However, to me, she gives off a strong impression of being reliable.</p><p class="calibre3">Her pride in perfectly fulfilling her role as an idol seems to be fully on display.</p><p class="calibre3">Perhaps this is the impression I got because I know the usual Kanon.</p><p class="calibre3">It feels somewhat special, and I don't feel bad about it.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Today, we're going to perform our classic song and a new one. Please enjoy until the end!] (MIA)</b></p><p class="calibre3">"""Kyaaaaa! Mia-samaaaaa!"""</p><p class="calibre3">When Mia speaks, the cheers from the girls become even louder.</p><p class="calibre3">Truly, as can be expected of a prince-like character. ――――But I know that she wants to be a "girl" more than anyone else.</p><p class="calibre3">That fact also fills my insignificant self with a sense of superiority.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Hey, geez! You're late!] (KANON)</b></p><p class="calibre3">KANON says as she looks behind us, the audience.</p><p class="calibre3">When we all turn in that direction, we see Rei walking leisurely towards us.</p><p class="calibre3">She's already changed into her stage costume, and the decorations resembling jewels on her clothes are sparkling in the sunlight.</p><p class="calibre3">"Sorry, I'm going now." (REI)</p><p class="calibre3">We open the way for Rei to pass through to the stage.</p><p class="calibre3">It seems like she was planning to go around the outside and head to the stage, as she looks surprised and bows her head to the students who made way for her.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Umm... Once again, thank you for your hard work during the two days of the school festival.]</b></p><p class="calibre3">Rei, wearing a chest-mounted microphone, says so as she looks at all of us.</p><p class="calibre3">We all listen to her quietly.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Once again, I apologize to those who were inconvenienced because of me. And also to everyone in Class 2-A. I'm sorry for not being able to help with the school festival preparations and on the day itself...]</b></p><p class="calibre3">Rei bows her head.</p><p class="calibre3">Kanon, Mia, and all of us. Everyone silently watches her.</p><p class="calibre3">I didn't want to talk about this kind of thing, but the truth is that there are quite a few people who harbor negative feelings towards Rei.</p><p class="calibre3">Some say she's too high and mighty, or that she's getting too full of herself, or that she's just a nuisance by being at school. Heartless conversations like these can be heard as long as you're at this school.</p><p class="calibre3">Rei probably hears them too.</p><p class="calibre3">There should have been a more suitable school for REI of the Millefeuille Stars.</p><p class="calibre3">Even so, the fact that she chose this school means that she must have come with some kind of determination, even though she didn't tell us the reason.</p><p class="calibre3">In the midst of all this, Rei might be putting her body on the line like this in the hopes of being accepted even just a little.</p><p class="calibre3">This could be the trigger for even more people to dislike Rei――――Well, there's no use just thinking about unpleasant things.</p><p class="calibre3">All I can do is simply watch over this.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[Well then... please listen. "Summer Over".]</b></p><p class="calibre3">Then, the intro of the song begins to play which I don't really remember hearing, only that I heard her humming at home.</p><p class="calibre3">This is Millefeuille Stars' new song.</p><p class="calibre3">The lyrics of the song, which features a girl who doesn't want summer to end, resonated with everyone. It's a dilemma of feeling happy that it's no longer hot, yet feeling sad as it becomes colder.</p><p class="calibre3">Every year, a different summer comes, and every year, we feel the sadness of a summer that will never come again.</p><p class="calibre3">We just listen, completely absorbed in the song.</p><p class="calibre3">And as the song ended, an unprecedentedly loud cheer erupted, engulfing the stage.</p><p class="calibre3">Some students are in tears of joy at being able to hear MilleSta's new song up close.</p><p class="calibre3">Thinking of watching a live performance in this kind of atmosphere, it's no wonder that everyone feels a little melancholy.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[The next song is the last one.] (MIA)</b></p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[The last song is our signature song! If you know it, please sing along with us!] (KANON)</b></p><p class="calibre3">Upon hearing Kanon and Mia's words, those who understood cheered loudly.</p><p class="calibre3">When it comes to their signature song, there is only one.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">[――――Please listen, "Millefeuille Star".]</b></p><p class="calibre3">MilleSta's debut song, "Millefeuille Star". It boasts a notoriety surpassing the songs used in commercials, it goes without saying that it's their signature song.</p><p class="calibre3">The fans, whose excitement was already high, joined in enthusiastically.</p><p class="calibre3">With the audience participation, the song became even more exciting, and the three of them gradually got more energized.</p><p class="calibre3">If I were just a fan, this time today would have been a lifelong memory.</p><p class="calibre3">I am reminded once again how much of a luxurious time I usually spend.</p><p class="calibre3">"......Ah."&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">At that moment, I feel a gaze and turn to it.</p><p class="calibre3">It comes from the center of the stage. Amidst many students, Rei found me, and our eyes met.</p><p class="calibre3">――――[Do your best.]</p><p class="calibre3">I can somehow hear those words in Rei's gaze.</p><p class="calibre3">(This is the return from that day, huh.)</p><p class="calibre3">On that day, Rei choked up during MilleSta's live performance.</p><p class="calibre3">I had raised my voice to her, but in such a large venue, it probably didn't reach her at all.</p><p class="calibre3">What reached her was probably just my gaze.</p><p class="calibre3">Even I wasn't certain of it, but by returning the gaze like this, I felt that it had indeed been conveyed.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't help but smile at how happy this interaction made me.</p><p class="calibre3">"...... I guess I'll give all my best." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I'm just a simple boy, who for getting spurred on to do my very best by the encouragement of a girl.</p><p class="calibre3">I'll have to thank her later.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Before I become unable to convey anything at all.</p><p class="calibre3">"......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">I grit my teeth and leave the crowd in front of the stage.</p><p class="calibre3">It's about time we have to get ready.</p><p class="calibre3">Let's forget the unpleasant things for now and just focus on today.</p><p class="calibre3">Just like a summer that has passed once, today, once it's over, it won't come back again.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3">After retrieving my bass in the classroom, I return to the schoolyard and make my way to the backstage.</p><p class="calibre3">By that time, MilleSta's live performance had already ended, and the students were standing at a loose end.</p><p class="calibre3">Some stay behind to see them off, but most are planning to spend the rest of the night as usual.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, Rintaro." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"You're talking to me so casually, huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, there's no one else around." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">The fact that there are still people waiting to see MilleSta off, means they haven't left the backstage area yet.</p><p class="calibre3">I didn't plan on seeing them, but in retrospect, it's only natural for us to bump into each other.</p><p class="calibre3">"Anyway, we won't be able to leave for a while, so we might as well listen to your performance before we go." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"Hey...... Don't put pressure on me like that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"It'll be okay. You've practiced enough, so have confidence." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">It's frustrating to be told by Kanon, who is the best at playing instruments, that I should be a little more confident.</p><p class="calibre3">She seems to understand this and looks at me with teasing eyes.</p><p class="calibre3">I decided to resist at least the urge to thank her.</p><p class="calibre3">"I'm also planning on watching. As your fan, I must see you perform on the big stage." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"My fan? Are you kidding me?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Nay, I genuinely mean it. This heart of mine is completely devoted to solely you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">Her way of speaking is a bit old-fashioned.</p><p class="calibre3">It's hard to tell if Mia is being truthful or not.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I should probably just take it as a joke.</p><p class="calibre3">"Speaking of which, can you really leave without causing a commotion? There are still a lot of people at the closing party......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't worry. We'll disguise ourselves and blend in with the school's uniform." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Following Rei, Kanon boasts that she can do plain makeup, so I had to accept it.</p><p class="calibre3">I can't just keep worrying about them.</p><p class="calibre3">[Hey, Yuusuke, don't drop the cymbals, okay?] (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">[I know...... Ugh, It's surprisingly heavy.] (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">I hear a familiar voice from the other side of the stage.</p><p class="calibre3">We have to start pretending to be strangers soon.</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, Rintaro! You were here before us!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yeah. Ah, you were carrying the drums. Sorry, I wasn't very helpful." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Oh, this? Don't worry about it. I was just asked to carry it by the brass band instructor, and ended up being used." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">As he says this, Doumoto begins to place the drum set in an empty space.</p><p class="calibre3">I go to help Kakihara with the cymbals and place them in the same spot.</p><p class="calibre3">Then Doumoto, who has just taken a break, notices the three of them who are standing behind him.</p><p class="calibre3">"What?! Y-you were still here――――No, I mean, you guys have not left yet?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah, sorry. We can't leave right away because it'll cause a commotion. Can you allow us to stay here until we find a chance to leave?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre3">"O-o-of-of-of course!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto, the epitome of manliness and the man that all boys aspire to be, is now bowing his head and shrinking himself.</p><p class="calibre3">Sorry to say, but I really didn't want to see him like this.</p><p class="calibre3">Well, I guess this just proves that he is a genuinely pure-hearted man.</p><p class="calibre3">"O-Otosaki-san...... Umm, as a member of the class culture festival committee, I just wanted to you know that...... we never thought you weren't helping us at all. So I really hope you don't feel guilty about it." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yes, thank you. Hearing that does make me feel a little better." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">With Kakihara's words, Rei's expression softens.</p><p class="calibre3">Having someone express it in words was a source of relief.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――By the way, what should we call ourselves when we go on stage?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Don't you think we should have a band name? Everyone else seems to have decided on one. I saw the list with the order of performances." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Come to think of it, we never discussed choosing a band name.</p><p class="calibre3">I didn't plan on performing in public again, so there was no intention to decide on one in the first place.</p><p class="calibre3">"Do you think it's necessary to have one? Even if we think of one, I feel a bit awkward proudly presenting it......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"But isn't it kind of uncool? Right now, we're registered as the Kakihara Band, you know?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Yup, that does sound uncool.</p><p class="calibre3">"For example... Millefeuille Boys――――J-just kidding!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">――――I wonder if it's okay to use that name.</p><p class="calibre3">Although Doumoto seems to be joking, he's sneakily glancing at the reactions of the three members of MilleSta.</p><p class="calibre3">Thanks to him, the hurdle seems to have lowered considerably.</p><p class="calibre3">"I think it's okay. Millefeuille Boys." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">"......Huh?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei's abrupt approval shattered the indescribable atmosphere created by his joke.</p><p class="calibre3">Unexpectedly, Rei thinks that the name "Mille-feuille Boys" is okay. It's no wonder Doumoto lets out a silly sound.</p><p class="calibre3">"O-Otosaki-san...... We can?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">"Yup. The Millefeuille name itself isn't really ours to begin with." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre3">Rei responds nonchalantly to my question.</p><p class="calibre3">While I feel that this is not the issue, there's no way we can come up with a better name right away.</p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara and Doumoto both seem perplexed, so it seems like we have no choice but to go with this name for now.</p><p class="calibre3">"Well, isn't it interesting? Others will probably think you guys are aiming for attention." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre3">"T-that's true! Hehehe!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">In response to Kanon's teasing, Doumoto scratches his cheek in embarrassment.</p><p class="calibre3">――――Doumoto is a boy, after all.</p><p class="calibre3">"So...... our band name is Millefeuille Boys. Ryuuji, Rintaro, is that okay with you guys?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">With a nod, both I and Doumoto agree.</p><p class="calibre3">And so, quietly, our band name is decided.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"H-hello! We are Millefeuille Boys!" (Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">When Kakihara stands in front of the stage mic and makes this announcement, the audience bursts into laughter.</p><p class="calibre3">It's a relief to know that the audience is responding well to our intended humor.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre3">Honestly, I was worried about whether the fanatic fans would throw garbage at us.</p><p class="calibre3">"Kakihara-ku~n, you're so cool!"</p><p class="calibre3">"We came to see you! Doumoto~!"</p><p class="calibre3">"Umm... Who's that guy on bass?"</p><p class="calibre3">I can hear voices like that, and I can't help but smile.</p><p class="calibre3">Thanks to Kakihara and Doumoto's popularity, about thirty to forty people had gathered.</p><p class="calibre3">It's quite impressive to have more than a class worth of people gathered here.</p><p class="calibre3">And crucially there, I see Nikaido as well.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"Err... before we begin, we've practiced quite a bit for this moment."&nbsp;(Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">As Kakihara begins speaking, the audience gradually hushed.</p><p class="calibre3">This might be a testament to his charisma or his ability to lead people.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"Up until today, I have caused trouble for these two who chose to stand on this stage with me. So first of all, I would like to express my gratitude to them for still choosing to stand on this stage with me despite that." (Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">Cut it out, aren't you embarrassed?</i></p><p class="calibre3">――――I put on a face expressing that words. Well, to be honest, I am a little embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto seems genuinely embarrassed as he plays the cymbals discreetly.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"And to everyone who came to see our performance, thank you very much. It's just one song, but please stay with us."&nbsp;</b><b class="calibre5">(Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">Cheers erupt and fill the air.</p><p class="calibre3">As Kakihara starts speaking into the mic, more and more people are drawn to the sound of his voice.</p><p class="calibre3">There may have already been more than fifty or sixty people gathered.</p><p class="calibre3">But strangely enough, I don't feel nervous at all.</p><p class="calibre3">(That's probably because we practiced so much.)</p><p class="calibre3">I glance at the bass Nogi had given me.</p><p class="calibre3">Somehow, I never found the practice to be too difficult.</p><p class="calibre3">Although my fingertips would peel and I would take breaks, I felt happy knowing that I had practiced so much.</p><p class="calibre3">Besides, I was standing next to those girls who were performing hundreds or thousands of times larger than this at every show.</p><p class="calibre3">This level of pressure is nothing.</p><p class="calibre3">"Can you do it, guys?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Glancing at me and Doumoto, Kakihara says so.</p><p class="calibre3">We don't say anything, just nod in response.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"Now, please listen――――" (Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">Announcing the song title, Kakihara strums his guitar.</p><p class="calibre3">As he begins to weave the song, he captivates the audience's attention.</p><p class="calibre3">Once Kakihara's intro solo ends, that's when me and Doumoto join in.</p><p class="calibre3">The start is good. The high tension makes the tempo slightly faster, but it isn't unnaturally fast. It's much easier to keep up with than being strangely slow.</p><p class="calibre3">(...This is so fun.)</p><p class="calibre3">It's impossible to eliminate mistakes.</p><p class="calibre3">But compared to when we first started, it's clearly smoother, and I'm confident that I'm not dragging Kakihara and Doumoto down.</p><p class="calibre3">Above all, it's fun.</p><p class="calibre3">"!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">As we enter the chorus, Doumoto's drums become even more intense.</p><p class="calibre3">I briefly glance at Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3">Our eyes meet, and I can't help but raise the corners of my mouth slightly.</p><p class="calibre3">Somehow, I felt like I was being told, "Go for it."</p><p class="calibre3">(Alright...!)</p><p class="calibre3">So I step forward.</p><p class="calibre3">I play more intensely than usual.</p><p class="calibre3">Although I have a bad habit of looking at the strings while playing, today I forcibly ignore it.</p><p class="calibre3">As I raise my head towards the audience.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ah......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Everyone's eyes are fixed on us.</p><p class="calibre3">Without a doubt, we're the main characters in this place.</p><p class="calibre3">A thrilling sensation surges through my back.</p><p class="calibre3">This is bad, it may become addictive.</p><p class="calibre3">The song progresses, reaching its final chorus.</p><p class="calibre3">There's no need to hold anything back now.</p><p class="calibre3">We pour all our best into the music.</p><p class="calibre3">Using up every ounce of our energy is fine. We go forward with that level of determination.</p><p class="calibre3">As the end approaches, a poignant feeling of it all coming to an end wells up inside me.</p><p class="calibre3">There likely won't be another time for me to perform on stage with Kakihara and Doumoto.</p><p class="calibre3">So, I don't want to hold back. I put everything we practiced into this moment, with the feeling that it's okay to end here.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"――――!" (Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara shouts the final lyrics.</p><p class="calibre3">I believe we have given it our all.</p><p class="calibre3">Despite not being the vocalist, I find myself out of breath, placing my hands on my knees.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, the bass hanging from my shoulder almost scrapes the floor, so I hurriedly support it.</p><p class="calibre3">I don't want to accidentally damage it here.</p><p class="calibre3">"Come on, Rintaro. Lift your head." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto taps my shoulder, and I unintentionally look up.</p><p class="calibre3">"""WHOAAAAAAAAAAA!"""</p><p class="calibre3">A mix of male and female cheers shower down on us.</p><p class="calibre3">Of course, it's only a fraction of the enthusiasm compared to the girls' performance, but this space was undeniably created by us.</p><p class="calibre3">"Haah, with this the stage is set...... Go, Yuusuke?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">"Ryuuji......." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto pushes Kakihara's back, and then he steps back with me.</p><p class="calibre3">From here on, it's solely Kakihara's stage.</p><p class="calibre3">"Guys...... Thank you." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Go for it, Yuusuke-kun." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Nodding, Kakihara once again stands in front of the microphone.</p><p class="calibre3">After a few seconds, he raises his face and opens his mouth.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"...Finally, there's something I want to convey in this opportunity and this place." (Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">The audience murmurs.</p><p class="calibre3">Declaring that he has something to convey here means attempting to carry out the school's urban legend.</p><p class="calibre3">The confession by Kakihara Yuusuke, who is arguably the most popular guy in the school, is sure to cause great turmoil to those who know him.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"I have, someone I've liked since my first grade. ――――Nikaido Azusa-san." (Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">At the mention of her name, everyone's attentions are focused on Nikaido, who is among the audience.</p><p class="calibre3">She has a serious expression and is looking straight at Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre3"><b class="calibre5">"Azusa, I've...... I've liked you for so long! Please, go out with me!" (Yuusuke)</b></p><p class="calibre3">Kakihara finally spoke those important words. Even without the mic, his voice is loud enough for everyone to hear.</p><p class="calibre3">After a moment of silence, Nikaido slowly walks to the front of the stage.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――If you're okay with me, then...... Yes, with pleasure." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre3">Responding to Kakihara's confession, Nikaido has a joyful, happy, and seemingly fragile smile.</p><p class="calibre3">This moment is undoubtedly precious.</p><p class="calibre3">That's why it looks fleeting and has the power to sway someone's feelings.</p><p class="calibre3">"Ryuuji, Rintaro! I-I......!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre3">"Go get her. We'll take care of the stage." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">Why is he willingly taking on such a troublesome task?</i> That's what I want to say, but, well&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;For today, I think it's fine.</p><p class="calibre3">Seeing him off with a smile, Kakihara jumps off the stage and heads for Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre3">Then, the two hold hands and bow to us and the audience.</p><p class="calibre3">"It's kind of...... emotional, isn't it?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre3">Doumoto mutters beside me, his voice trembling slightly.</p><p class="calibre3">I try not to look at his face and start cleaning up the stage.</p><p class="calibre3"><i class="calibre6">How much had he worried about Kakihara and Nikaido's relationship?</i> Even without seeing his face, I can understand that from his voice alone.</p><p class="calibre3">"――――Good job, you deserved it, Kakihara." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre3">Glancing at Kakihara and Nikaido, who are being congratulated by their acquaintances, I put Kakihara's guitar into its case.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>After Rintaro and the others' live performance, there's a confession by Kakihara-kun on stage.</p><p>The three of us quietly listen to his confession.</p><p>"――――How nice, being young." (Kanon)</p><p>Hearing the cheers at the moment of his successful confession, Kanon murmurs.</p><p>It sounds a bit like an old lady would say.</p><p>"Rei, you thought I sounded like an old lady just now, didn't you?" (Kanon)</p><p>......Is she an esper?</p><p>"...Hmph, well, whatever." (Kanon)</p><p>Kanon, with a somewhat sullen expression, settles into the prepared chair.</p><p>Without looking at me and Mia, she resumes with a question.</p><p>"Do you feel envious of them?" (Kanon)</p><p>Those words are surely directed at what they had just experienced on stage, something that could be called youthness.</p><p>I glance at Mia for a moment.</p><p>Mia looks at me with a troubled expression, then returns her gaze to Kanon.</p><p>"...I do. Because it's something we can't experience right now." (Mia)</p><p>Mia's words are true.</p><p>No one of us regrets becoming an idol.</p><p>We're well aware that not everyone can become one, and we're proud of it.</p><p>――――But still.</p><p>I can't lie about feeling envious of them.</p><p>"We became idols and gained a lot, but at the same time, we lost a lot too. Even though I know I sacrificed it myself...... but I can't help feeling envious." (Mia)</p><p>"......Well, they do say the grass is always greener on the neighbor's lawn. I agree with that." (Kanon)</p><p>I nod in agreement with their words.</p><p>We didn't sacrifice our normal high school lives because we wanted to.</p><p>Even if we sacrificed it, it was because we had something we wanted to achieve.</p><p>"Rei, Mia... how long do you think we'll continue being idols?" (Kanon)</p><p>Mia and I choke on our words in response to Kanon's question.</p><p>It's a topic we have been thinking about for a long time, but no one has brought it up as a topic of discussion.</p><p>When, will we "retire"――――.</p><p>"I...... I don't think I'll retire any time soon. I want to become an actress overseas someday, but that's still a long way off." (Mia)</p><p>Mia has an audition for a movie soon.</p><p>Both I and Kanon support her, and I believe she'll definitely pass.</p><p>"What about you, Rei? Have you thought about when you'll retire?" (Kanon)</p><p>"I... " (Rei)</p><p>My dream is to do a large-scale live performance at Nippon Budokan.</p><p>That dream hasn't changed since my debut.</p><p>When that dream comes true, I'm sure I'll――――.</p><p>"Hmm? I see, you've made up your mind, huh?" (Kanon)</p><p>"Huh?" (Rei)</p><p>"We're talking about retiring. You don't seem to be hesitating at all." (Kanon)</p><p>Certainly, I might as well say that I've already made up my mind.</p><p>"If I could perform a live performance at Nippon Budokan... at the very least, I think I'd be satisfied." (Rei)</p><p>"At Nippon Budokan? With where we are now, there's a possibility it could happen within a year, you know?" (Kanon)</p><p>"Yes, but――――" (Rei)</p><p>Honestly, I'm still undecided about whether to retire or not.</p><p>I still don't know what will remain for me once I'm no longer an idol.</p><p>"Is it okay, Rei?" (Mia)</p><p>"Huh?" (Rei)</p><p>"If you're not an idol anymore, you might not be able to support Rintaro-kun, you know?" (Mia)</p><p>As I'm taken aback, Mia continues with a serious expression.</p><p>"Rintaro-kun's dream is to focus on housework without working and support the woman who becomes his wife for life, right? So, the person becoming his wife needs to have a decent income." (Mia)</p><p>"That's... I think that's true." (Rei)</p><p>"You should be able to continue working in the entertainment industry after retiring as an idol. But it's not certain. There's a real possibility that your popularity might decline and you might lose your earnings." (Mia)</p><p>I, I can't say anything.</p><p>If I were told I didn't have a resolve, that would be enough, but there might be a part of me that still thought of myself as a child.</p><p>"――――I already make up my resolve." (Mia)</p><p>Mia's unwavering gaze captures me.</p><p>I was just bewildered, not understanding the true meaning behind those eyes.</p><p>"I'm resolved to support Rintaro-kun for life. I'll definitely succeed as an actress and make sure he'll live a life without any discomfort." (Mia)</p><p>"Y-you... isn't that...?" (Kanon)</p><p>Kanon looks at Mia with unbelieving eyes.</p><p>So do I.</p><p>I never expected Mia will develop the same feelings as me――――.</p><p>"...I feel bad for you, Rei, but I can't lie to myself... or rather, I don't want to hide it in front of you."(Mia)</p><p>"Mia..." (Rei)</p><p>"I also――――" (Mia)</p><p>――――love Rintaro-kun.</p><p>"!" (Rei)</p><p>It's not like I didn't anticipate this would happen.</p><p>Sometimes mean, unfriendly, and lazy.</p><p>Despite acting that way, but actually kind and caring, thoughtful.</p><p>Like when he was in his butler uniform, if he tidied himself up properly, you can see that his face is more handsome than you'd imagine, also he regularly exercises, so he's surprisingly muscular.</p><p>When he smiles, he looks like a little boy and it's cute, and his hands are big but his fingers are slender and sexy.</p><p>He's good at cooking, and he's really good at cleaning and laundry as well.</p><p>And most of all――――just being with him makes me feel at ease.</p><p>With all of those good points, there's no way I'm the only one who's fallen for someone like Rintaro.</p><p>Although I should be the only one who knows all of those.</p><p>"I don't think Rintaro-kun sees me as a romantic interest yet right now. So I'm going to go more aggressive from now on. More than you, Rei." (Mia)</p><p>Mia's face is somehow dazzling as she confidently declares this.</p><p>The impatience I've been holding back overflowed, squeezing my heart.</p><p>"......Whatever you do, but it would be really lame if your discord led to disbandment. Please avoid that, okay?" (Kanon)</p><p>"Don't worry, Kanon. Even if Rintaro-kun chooses Rei over me, I won't resent Rei." (Mia)</p><p>"Hmm, then...... what about you, Rei?" (Kanon)</p><p>Kanon's gaze turns to me, and I can't help but flinch.</p><p>I. How will I be?</p><p>Will I be able to remain calm when I see Mia and Rintaro walking together?</p><p>(......Probably, no.)</p><p>My chest tightened even more.</p><p>I love Rintaro and Mia.</p><p>I don't want to fight with Mia, and I really don't want MilleSta to fall apart.</p><p>Can I handle it like Mia does――――</p><p>"Fufu, a group splitting up over just one guy...... it's such a cliché." (Kanon)</p><p>"Kanon......" (Rei)</p><p>"It's so cliché that it's not even funny." (Kanon)</p><p>After quickly finishing her disguise, Kanon stands up and walks towards the exit.</p><p>"Even if things go sour between you two, I won't allow disbandment." (Kanon)</p><p>"Huh...?" (Rei)</p><p>"Knowing him, if he knows that MilleSta disbands because of him, he'll feel responsible and distance himself from us." (Kanon)</p><p>It's entirely possible if it's Rintaro.</p><p>Hence, we absolutely must avoid that.</p><p>"I probably, have some feelings for him too...... though not as strong as you two." (Kanon)</p><p>"...Kanon too?" (Rei)</p><p>"Don't get me wrong, I'm not as into him as you two are, okay? Among the opposite sex, I think Rintaro is the best guy――――that's all." (Kanon)</p><p>I can't help but connect it to feelings of love, but it seems different for Kanon.</p><p>I feel a little relieved.</p><p>"Anyway, Rintaro's life right now is mostly dependent on you, right? You're even paying the rent." (Kanon)</p><p>"Yes." (Rei)</p><p>"If that's the case, then we have to take good care of him until he finds someone else, or until either of you has a clear plan to support him for life. At least until then, disbanding is absolutely out of the question." (Kanon)</p><p>Certainly, that's true.</p><p>"Anything is fine at this point, but don't be irresponsible. I believe in both of you." (Kanon)</p><p>"...I know it. Thank you, Kanon." (Rei)</p><p>"Hmph." (Kanon)</p><p>Turning away, Kanon leaves backstage.</p><p>It's about time for the next performers to arrive.</p><p>So we need to leave soon.</p><p>"Well, I guess I'll head home now. I only stayed because I wanted to see Rintaro's big moment." (Mia)</p><p>"Mia...... I......" (Rei)</p><p>"......You don't need to rush to give an answer, you know." (Mia)</p><p>"What do you mean?" (Rei)</p><p>"As long as we're idols, I don't think he'll date either of us. I think you understand that better." (Mia)</p><p>Mia's words make sense.</p><p>Rintaro is trying to support us, and he really wants to avoid anything that might break "Mille-feuille Stars".</p><p>Maybe the real battle will come when we are no longer idols.</p><p>By then, I need to find a new path.</p><p>"Phew... Sorry for suddenly stirring things up today. I'll let you take over from here, as an apology. Well, it's not really an apology, but what I mean is, I'll leave the rest to you." (Mia)</p><p>"The rest?" (Rei)</p><p>"The closing party isn't over yet, right? Enjoy it with Rintaro-kun. I'm not happy about it, but I'll make my move from tomorrow." (Mia)</p><p>With a challenging smile, Mia, in a simple disguise, leaves backstage.</p><p>Mia really is so cool after all.</p><p>But that's exactly why I don't want to lose. From the bottom of my heart, that's what I think.</p><p>"......I have to go." (Rei)</p><p>I have to see Rintaro.</p><p>Feeling that impulse, I have already jumped out of the backstage area.</p>
