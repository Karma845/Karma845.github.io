<h3>Chapter 3: Mikage Saeka Beyond Reach</h3>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A few more days passed since then.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shida was called for basketball intensive training, so his consultation was temporarily on hold. For Mikage, I only had one call.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, Mikage was somewhat preoccupied at that time and dozed off most of the time. There were only ten days left, and yet she was still hesitant about confessing her feelings. To be frank, I was getting impatient. And I was at a loss as to why she wasn’t in a hurry at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Maybe I should be less passive. Do you think you can confess like this? Is that fine with you? I’ve thought about ways to deliver those, but I wasn’t sure it would work that well with Mikage, though.</span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Good Evening, Angel,” she greeted calmly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had received a message saying that she had something to report. To me, that was nothing but anxiety. I’ve got a feeling that I can’t be good.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What do you have to report this far in?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what’s up?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I swigged up the new tumbler and drank today’s cider. It was unimaginably easy to use and had become my favorite in no time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The large gulp I took was a way to brace myself. In romance, everything is unforeseen. There is no such love that went all according to plan. In fact, I should know better than anyone else.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And so I thought…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’ve started going out with Hibiki-kun”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was a development I hadn’t expected at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I meant exactly what I said. I confessed to him yesterday, and he said yes.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, it’s not just, “he said yes.” Firstly, isn’t that too sudden?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Weren’t you hesitating just two days before?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Momentum? I guess I went with the flow, kinda lame, isn’t it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, okay…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But…If it would go this easily… Why did I concern myself over her again? If she got what she wanted then that should be good.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">All that was left was Shida…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Alright, I’m glad you got your wish.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“All thanks to you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m not being humble here, you’d have done it without my help.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Rather, she took longer than she should have because of me. In some cases, I should have just let them be, note, note.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then, that’s it for us. Good work, Mikage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yes. I appreciate your help.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At first, I wondered where this would land. It seems that this easily is also possible too. A model and a beauty, I wish you two all the best.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“By the way, I have another favor.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Can I talk about you to my friends?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What would you get from doing that…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No. That was the condition for our consultation. I’ve told you since the beginning. That includes any of your friends and Hibiki too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I know, that’s why this is a separate request.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Just why…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll have to ask. Why?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Well, I’ve become a known face in Kuze High. I bet it wouldn’t take more than two days for everyone to know that I’m finally dating. And if they’re gonna talk about me, then at least I want to get them right on the details.” She said all of that in one go, just like when she told me about Hibiki… like a memorized script.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see where you’re coming from. But, you can omit the part where I took place, told them you confessed and he said yes, that’s it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“And if, by chance, someone finds out, they’d have known I lied. I want to avoid that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And who is that someone? Where? It’s you and me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yuzuki-san. She must have known what’s going on. You said you have your associates too, didn’t you. There’s no way you could be hundred percent certain.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, hey, this is getting suspicious. You weren’t this desperate when we talked about Hibiki.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then, as if she realized herself. &ndash;“No, I’m not questioning your or Yuzuki’s credibility…urgh, I get it, you can’t. Sorry for asking.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t mind. It is like you said, my credibility isn’t absolute. But that doesn’t change where I stand.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She didn’t press further.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I never thought I would be arguing with Mikage like this. All the more after the consultation had ended.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Was there anything to fear? What would happen if someone found out she had consulted with the angel later.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let me elaborate. This condition is not only to reduce the risk of my identity, but to protect you too. What would you feel if the Hibiki was conspiring with someone to get with you? My existence would only strain your relationship.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Silence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Besides, if you don’t count Yuzuki’s, none of my clients are known, right? I’m keeping all information confidential.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, the silence is getting unnerving.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At this point, she would probably comply, but I want to make her understand why.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then, let’s say people find out, you can use me as a scapegoat. ‘The Angel made me promise not to mention it.’ There, now your honor isn’t questioned anymore.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yeah… Forget what I said. I was silly.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She returned to her calm demeanor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Uhh, what kind of mood swing is this?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Then, I have another request. If you can’t then you don’t have to.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Don’t accept requests from people who want to confess to me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t think I can do that, but I want to hear your reason.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’m already with Hibiki, everyone is getting a guaranteed no from me, from now on. Better make them give up in the first place.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And how is that different from people who already know you have someone you like but decided to confess anyway.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s&mdash;” She abruptly hushed, exhaled, and continued. “Okay, you don’t have to. Anyway, I hope you made those people know what answer they will get. Thanks.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Even if it’s a no, there’s a meaning in getting to confess. I’ll have to decline both your requests.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’m sorry, Shida, Mikage. But this is what I believe in.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Getting rejected isn’t an easy affair. But it isn’t any better if your feelings go unsaid.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So, Mikage, If anyone confesses to you, give them a definite answer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Sorry for the strange favors. Hope I haven’t thrown you off balance.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, no, I’m thrown off balance, all right. Haven’t met someone like you in my career.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I doubt you had.” Hey, is that funny? “Then on top of the requests, I’d like to ask you a thing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So she’s got questions now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Will this be the last?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“It will.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Please, what is that quirky tone?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;”Are you, by any chance, a girl?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?” Regaining my composure, I growled, “Why did I tell you about not probing for my identity?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Oops, then you don’t have to answer,” she said as if she had expected my reaction.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Unable to resist, I returned a question, “And why would you think I’m a girl?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;If anything, most people would have branded the Angel as a man already, thanks to referring to myself as “</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">ore</span></i><span class="calibre17">” in the broadcast. Actually, I had thought of giving up the gender ambiguity altogether.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So why is this girl…?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Every boy would try to pamper me, at least unconsciously,” said Mikage as though it was a matter of fact.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So you’re saying this because I wasn’t trying to flirt with you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s a way of saying it. All this from experience, I’m not toplofty, mind you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re not, and you’re probably right.” She was, after all, Kuze’s Top Three. That title alone could change one’s impression drastically.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If so, why was she so unconfident during the consultation?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hypothetically, if you’re a boy.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Then you must have someone you like already? So much you don’t care about me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Isn’t the question before the last one?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Whoops, is that so?” she giggled merrily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A nasty girl to the end. Good grief.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The next day, the school was festive.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, you’ve heard? Mikage-san!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just now! That one&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh. It’s over… my youth ends here&mdash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hallways, classrooms, stair landings, everywhere.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The morning was quiet, but by lunchtime, everyone knew. Second year class eight was no exception, the commotion continued.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What a mess…” complained Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The traffic in the hallway was heavier than usual today, so we refrain from trespassing on the rooftop. As a result, we had lunch in the classroom.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage-chan… what a shame.” Reiji, without looking very disappointed, joked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At least when compared to Minato’s, this atmosphere was way better this time. And since it wasn’t something to be shy about, everyone voiced out their thoughts. Although isn’t this spreading too fast?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, where did it start?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage-chan herself. I just checked earlier.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Digging people’s info is still your job, huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope, pretty much everyone knows that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hm… I guess everyone does.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I heard the guy she’s dating is her childhood friend and does modeling! A perfect match for her, don’t you think?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, finally… there goes my chance…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You don’t have one from the start. They’ve liked each other for quite a long time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The information circulating was quite detailed. And accurate to boot. Saying she didn’t want to hide things, rather, wasn’t this too open?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yuzuki-chan, The Angel, now Mikage. We’re not short of rumors, eh, Akashi?” teased Reiwa.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Urgh, enough with the same talk every minute? I’m going mad.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re always mad, Hiura”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then I’ll go on a rampage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Please don’t, we don’t need any more topics.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Nope, we don’t need any mess like, “Plus Four Hiura finally destroys the school building!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Still , Mikage-san had been silent the whole time. Don’t you think she’d have reported some progress before dropping the bombshell? I wonder what happened.” He looked meaningfully at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Somehow, his white teeth grin flet obnoxious.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What are you getting at?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm? Nothing,” He said frivolously, “You might know something, that’s what I’m saying.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why should I know?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s no ‘Why should I know with you’, never.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Reiji.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoopsie. There, there, cool down, buddy. He’s moving away, right, so she quickly confessed.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So you were leading me around.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“About what, I wonder.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Tch, this guy…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, now that it came to this, Shida must have heard…</span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’ve heard”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When I sent a message to him that night, he called back right after. I shifted my gaze longingly to the tumbler containing melon soda.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“it’s like you said… she was also trying to realize her own romance too…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“It’s over… my dream, huh…” listlessly, he sighed. “Congratulations on her part. I’m not happy, though. I hope she is happy…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He’s getting a little incoherent…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But still, he still had to confess, I needed to make him. He might not realize it now, but there was on;y one choice that wouldn’t leave him with regret.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The answer would be a guaranteed denial, but I had to push his back. This feeling had to end, one way or another.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shida…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;”Angel&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?” We spoke at the same time. No, considering the connection lag, Shida spoke first.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You first. I need to make up my mind.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope, Shida, saying that you have to make up your mind made me nervous. Spill it now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’m not sure if I should tell you, but…” he stammered. “But I had given up on Mikage-san since the start.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was disturbing. I had a hundred questions, but the best thing to do was probably hear what he had to say first.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“before you called me… and even after we’ve started the consultation, I’ve no illusion that it would be a yes, Angel or not… I wasn’t expecting anything”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So?” I urged.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’m not even going to confess anymore. That was the only word I feared.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But all I could do was listen to him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You’ve been trying to make my confession a success. For that, I’m incredibly grateful. But I didn’t want to win over Mikage-san or anything like that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shida?” I asked tentatively.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Still, I…!” his voice gained momentum. What would make him like that, I had no idea. “I still want to confess to Mikage-san!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shida…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s lame, I know. I only want to get my feelings across and end it. That’s all.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, you’re not lame…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I know it’s crazy. Confessing is to ask someone out, or at least get their attention. It’s supposed to be an important thing and yet I…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yes, that’s it. That’s the spirit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I want to have a proper ending…! For my own sake, I’ll tell her I like her. I’ll do it! I !”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh…” I sighed incredulously.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That “I” in the end was grammatically incorrect, wasn’t it? Your lexicon’s dropping, Shida.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I don’t just like her romantically! I admire her as a person too! I’ll tell herr!! I’ve always admire you! Aahhhh&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shida”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Y-yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll say my piece.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“G-go ahead?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You’re an idiot, Shida, but properly idiotic.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tell her! You’ll have your show! I’ll be watching!” Carried by the atmosphere, gone was my cool.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We might as well be idiots together.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yuck, what’s that…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Forgetting my demeanor, we laughed and teased at each other’s lines. After a few solid minutes, our laughter came to an end.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You must have known, right? That I don’t have a chance.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was not an easy question to answer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s not about impossible or not, is it?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Haha, I guess not.” He laughed amusedly. “The fact that she has someone she likes is as clear as day, and you still call out to me. Success isn’t in your intention from the beginning.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“T-that’s not how I think…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“ No, no, I get it. You aren’t here to save me, but to make me take the plunge. Thanks for doing that. I finally know what I want.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm… he saw right through my intentions. You’re sharper than you let on, Shida. Or it was simply obvious when what I was doing was sending him to make an impossible confession.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“So, how do I do?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Do what?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“The confession.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I can’t decide if this guy’s smart or dumb.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…Do whatever you like. Call her out, tell her your feelings.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That sounds… ordinary.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Like I said, whatever you like. Mind you, she has a boyfriend, so keep it within bounds.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Agh! Why do you have to remind me that…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t tell me you’ve already forgotten it…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Maybe this idiot would just turn out fine. Probably.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[I’ll report as soon as I confess!]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was what Shida sent to me a week ago.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There was heavy rain today, a prelude to the rainy season. The downpour continued well after school hours ended.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I remained in the classroom, blankly watching the rain.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was waiting for the rain to stop. I was also waiting for a report from Shida.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want ice cream. The one at Nanaya, to be specific.” For some reason, Hiura suddenly mumbled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I recheck the chatroom with Shida anxiously. I was in a bleak position.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why so? It was because I saw them together during lunch today. From the atmosphere, he was going to confess.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After school, call her to an empty room, confess. That was the plan. So, right now he’s…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m begging you… seriously…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What? Who?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not you,” I shooed Hiura away.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To no effect, though, she spun the rooftop key playfully.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t lose it.” I warned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Over the past week, Mikage getting a boyfriend had begun to quiet down to a reasonable degree. Perhaps it was because she had told almost all the information so easily and truthfully that there was no room to speculate. From the look of it, there was no need to mention the Angel. And if so, why was she so fraught over the Angel?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A new message popped up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Angel, I’ve got trouble.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Trouble?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[‘M listening.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Oh, you’re here. That saves time.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That saved my time too, so get on with it…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Actually, I’ve tried to call Mikage-san a few times already.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Today wasn’t the first time he’d called her?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As if sensing my doubt, he sent me a long explanatory message.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Today’s the fourth time. First time, she said she’s not free, asking if it could be later. I saw no harm, so I waited for the next day…]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hm… that explains the silence.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Can’t get hold of her the second time either. Anymore and I’d be pestering her, so I agreed for the next day. And the next and next. Something’s off, she’d been using the same excuse.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was certainly strange…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[I tried a different strategy, asking when she’s available. But… this is just the same as an indirect rejection…]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">His message seemed to end there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Perhaps he was right. She must have been aware of his purpose. Afterall, she had been confessed countless times.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And credits duly to Shida, he was working harder than I thought he would.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[What did she say?]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[‘Sorry,’ that’s all.She looked really uncomfortable, so I don’t feel good saying anything more…]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[I see, that’s why you contacted me.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Argh… what really…” I groaned to myself.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m talking to myself, mind your business.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope, I wanna know.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ignoring her “Tch, tch.” I returned my attention to the screen.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Should I really do this? I don’t want to trouble her…]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Nope, you’ll confess. If she doesn’t want trouble, she can reject you outright and be done with it. But she hasn’t done that, something’s up.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Pardon the language, but she could have just got done with it, it would just save her time as much as ours.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Was it because she has a boyfriend?]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Probable. That’s the only thing that has changed. Still, I couldn’t see how these two things relate.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Picturing the situation, a memory resurfaced.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t accept requests from people who want to confess to me.”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What if this has something to do with that…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Angellll… I can’t do this anymoreee… How many more times? She even said ‘Sorry’ to me…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Right, you’ve done everything you could, Shida. Honestly, I should stop him before he gets traumatized.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But, we’re this close…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[I’ll find out what happened] I texted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[You will?]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[If we know why then that might be a more satisfactory ending, in the best case, you might even get to confess.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[O-oh… Thanks a lot. I don’t want to cause any more trouble to Mikage-san.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Think of this as included in the package. Cases like yours happens time to time]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Considering that during the course of the consultation, there were practically no difficulties, so this was nothing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Maybe I’m being selfish. Maybe I’m meddling in his affairs. But it can’t end like this, Shida will surely regret it. One day, he would look back and think, “I should have confessed back then.” If I don’t step in now, all we have done would have been for nothing.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[‘Kay. Counting on you. Ah, just do what you can, right. I have a feeling that you’d do something reckless.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Wait, why did he think I’d do something reckless</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Don’t worry. Won’t take long, in most cases.] I promised, [I’ll let you know how it goes. Until then, you hold off calling her out.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With that, the exchange was over.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Okay, what I need to do is&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi&mdash;! I’m bored!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hnya?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Help me. Strawberry au lait and Thirty-One’s at the table.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yep, I’ve traded my dignity for every help I could get.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What about Nanaya?” she asked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ll make do with Thirty-One.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What have you gotten yourself into, Io?” came an incredulous voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And I know you’re involved in the Mikage-chan thing. Keeping secrets from us when it’s convenient, when it’s not coming running for our help.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While enduring Reiji’s amused sarcasm, I offered my tributes of strawberry au lait and coffee. In the end, I had to resort to their help. And now, they knew everything between me, Shida, and Mikage.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Above all, I felt apologetic for Mikage. Even though I had presented the probability of disclosure of information as a condition for the consultation, this was stretching the condition too far. Well, she too was trying to have a leeway with me, so maybe I will call it even.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[TN: I don’t think it is, Io.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then… Hiura, if you would share your report,” I solemnly urged.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait.” She held up a hand, another fumbled with the straw of the au lait.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What I had asked Hiura to do was an experimental probe. In other words, asking Mikage directly. Since Hiura, with her attitude, was the best person for the job, I borrowed her help.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Before that, how did you ask? You know each other?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope. ‘I saw that vice captain trying to confess to you for some time. Haven’t you said no yet?’ and that’s it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoa, that’s just crude like you,” Reiji provoked death.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Miwa, watch your back.” Hiura scowled.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, Reiji, stop. I don’t want to see you stabbed in an alley.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And the results?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Maybe this was too early to expect results, but…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No luck. She got outta reach.” Another slurp.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Acted dumb, like.” She shifted her body, changed her gesture. “‘Was that a confession? He hadn’t said so?’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was an awfully good imitation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And, ‘You’re interested in me? Plus Four’s Aki Hiura-san.’” She shifted fluidly. “It looked like trouble, so I ran.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Stop the imitation, you look exactly like her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I wouldn’t expect Mikage to have such a counter up her sleeves… She’s more trouble than she seemed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That ends mine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks for your effort, Hiura.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Praise me more.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, okay, that au lait in your hand isn’t enough? And Reiji?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Our second shot, Reiji. What I had asked him was to get a broad grasp at the situation, the plan B, “Ask Around”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tough. Mikage-chan barely has any friends. None that could tell what’s happening to her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose… Couldn’t say whether this is strange or normal for her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Liked by everyone, but never close to anybody. According to Shida, she was “Mikage-san for everyone.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even so, Reji combed her probable close acquaintances in a meager two days, that was some serious detective skills. It would be a nightmare to be his enemy… No, if this is a manga, he’d definitely be the betrayer character.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Although I got a catch. I found a girl from the same middle school as her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, that sounds good.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tell you what, it isn’t,” Reiji made his voice higher. “‘She’s been like this since middle school! She’s super popular!’”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Stop imitating, I need reliable data.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And Reiji, that’s creepy, just stop. Why did you have to remember her every word?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘She was popular with boys and girls alike! Ah! She seems to have changed a little, though.’”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Miwa, stop.” Hiura came to my aid.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Geez, here comes Hiura-sama’s disapproval. Disclaimer, though, she’s just as close with Mikage as the next person, so I can’t say much.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She seemed to have changed a little…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That… might be completely unrelated to this case, or it could be the key…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No other information of note from other interviews. I mean, all they talked about was her getting a boyfriend. ‘I wonder how handsome he is?’ or, ‘I’m jealous&mdash;’. Imagine listening to these dozens of times.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I-I see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">By the way, Mikage still hadn’t revealed Hibiki’s name, apparently. That was only natural, if he really was a model, you could have traced by his name alone. As a courtesy to Mikage, I didn’t mention his name to these two.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So a dead end…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Don’t worry. Won’t take long, in most cases, I had said to Shida. However, it also meant that in rare cases, it might take forever to get over with.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Where had I assessed the situation wrong…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just can’t understand, tho. Why not say no and get done with it. This Shida guy could finally have clarity and move on. What a pity.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">For once, Reiji seemed a little sympathetic. Perhaps it was because Shida was his immediate senior in the basketball club. If so, then he must have been putting in extra effort in the investigation this time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Isn’t she toying with him in particular? She wasn’t like this a while before…” Hiura, from her looks, began to get fed up with the topic.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CH4.png" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No,” Surprisingly, Reiji came into Mikage’s defense. “I don’t think so. I’ve talked to her a few times, and she isn’t someone who’d do something like that, she’s too good to be real” His brows furrowed. “But she really is. She acts friendly to everyone, and not intentionally, it was as if being a samaritan was in her DNA. That’s… crazy.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Reiji shook his head repeatedly in exasperation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Reiji was a lady-killer, the type that never hesitated to go hard on assessment of women. As far as I remember, he had never praised any girl as much as this time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That raised a question.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then why does she have no friends?” said Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yep, she’s the kind of girl that people gather around even though she does nothing…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura and I tilted our heads to Reiji together, as if seeking an answer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Holding up his index finger, Reiji grinned.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That is”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That is?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That is I don’t know.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why is it that I’m not surprised?” Hiura rested her back against the fence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The only explanation is that she avoids making friends on purpose? A lone wolf mindset…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And what does that lead to? She is not socially anxious and is hundred percent fine interacting with people, so what does she get by actively not befriending anyone?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Isn’t that the point of this meeting? To know why.” Annoyedly, Reiji chuckled the last of his cream bun.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, there was no proof that Mikage not making friends had something to do with Shida’s denial. It might turn out to be a completely different matter. Since Minato didn’t have any friends too, maybe we could just chalk it up to the habit of high ranking beauties.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So she simply doesn’t want to get confessed?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She has no interest, and is too lazy to refuse?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Isn’t that only applicable to you, Hiura?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As a matter of course, I couldn’t say that snide to her face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s a little sad, don’t you think? Well, usually, I’d say yes for most of the confessions I get,” said the frivolous Reiji. As ever, he believed in his, “You’ll never know until you’ve gone out together.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although there was no insight here. Perhaps despite how sharp these two were, Mikage proved to be too much of a mystery.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then if there was nothing to be gained from roundabout ways, then…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This “Hibiki-kun”?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To be honest, I didn’t want to involve third parties, but the situation called.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks. I might have some more requests, keep on standby for me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That depends on your attitude and what you’re treating us to next,” chuckled Reiji.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nanaya?” coaxed Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If it comes to it, maybe Nanaya.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, that! You two went with Yuzuki-chan without inviting me last time!” complained Reiji.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You want to come?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not really. But you could have invited for courtesy’s sake.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why do you want me to invite you despite having no intention of going…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Without any progress, we disbanded for the day and I headed for Cafe Proof, part-time until dark.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Keihan-Zeze Station… Tokimeki Hill…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When I pushed open the door, a pale-faced Yukito lunged at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ooh, Messiah! Hurry up and get ready! We’re falling apart…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m surprised a good-for-nothing manager like you could hold it together so long.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No! The staff’s down to me alone! Please help!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Listening to him complain, I changed into work clothes in the kitchen. It was rare that there was no one else here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I hurried to the counter, letting work of a bustling cafe chase away the burnt of the day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Take orders, serve drinks, clean up empty seats.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Guests today weren’t that much, actually, but it was a handful for two people working.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Welcome!” The bell rang and I said the automatic response.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wha! Akashi-kun’s here!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Didn’t I say I work here?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In their uniforms were Minato and a happy looking Fujimiya. They’re here again…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Have a seat…” I guide them to the usual seat with my eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">They seemed to get the signal and went to the table.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Please call me when you’re ready.” I passed them the menu.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Milk tea and cafe au lait, both iced, please,” Fujimiya answered immediately.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahem… So what’s your business”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Study. The exam’s close by. Minato here will guide me through these difficult times.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry about Shiho. We’ll be staying for a while, is that fine with you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nah, fill up the table all you like, we’re understaffed today.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This surely wasn’t good for sales, but who cares about that when there’s only two people working.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun, you look good with an apron,” complimented Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh? Err, isn’t this normal? Uhh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Haha, you’re all flustered. You look good, be proud!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Be proud?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If you’d excuse me…” I slipped back to the counter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After that, I went back to working quietly in the kitchen. It was just me and Yukito until the end of the day. Through the evening, Minato and Fujimiya were there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When I scurry around in the cafe, Fujimiya would sometimes wave to me, but I would just nod in return. Can’t have reputation damage, that would be bad on Yukito…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hahh～ I want to have a chan with the two girls～～”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ve wasted my consideration on you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Get to work, manager.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Really, how could this cafe get so high a review on the internet with a manager like this. Probably the part-timers like me who made that happen.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We’ve survived!!” said Yukito to the counter, plopping down.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Today was tiring… if it had been a weekend, the customer would have…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">By the way, Yuzuki and Fujimiya were still here. Yukito treated them as a special case, it seemed, the kind of favoritism normally seen in society.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Io, you can go now. Go play with those two or whatever.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And the closing down?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“They’re here for you, go. I’ll do it alone.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m working… Don’t act cool, you’re heaving.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shut up, this is my cafe, and I won’t pay for your overtime.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He shot upright and staggered to the cleaning equipment. Ah, there goes the manly pride. I don’t suppose he’d accept my help at this rate.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Good work. You’re off?” Greeted Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I shrugged. “Yukito insisted he do it alone.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Getting a seat for the first time in hours, a wave of exhaustion washed over me. Legs ached, and my whole body felt numb.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m tired tooo…” complained Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You weren’t even concentrating.” quipped Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huuuh? MInato&ndash;, you’re looking at Akashi-kun’s apron&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shhh! Shiho!!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My apron? Well, if they still had the energy to bricker then they still have way to go.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“When are we going back?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh… uhh… A little more? Get this chapter done…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Roger. Ten more minutes wouldn’t hurt, right, Akashi-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yep, keep me company.” Yukito answered from the counter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay&ndash;. Thanks, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The two girls bowed at Yukito.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">They’re getting familiar with this cafe…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, right, about Mikage-san’s boyfriend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Never expect to meet this topic here. A cursory glance showed an expressionless Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, that’s sudden… well, maybe not, it’s a known fact that she has someone she likes…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why the face, Akashi-kun? Minato?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Um, Minato, should we tell her now? I asked her with a glance</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, maybe I could use her opinion on this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[TN: What happened with the “respect Mikage’s privacy” thing]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmmmm… Minato, and now Mikage-san? You’re incredible, Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As the situation called, I told Fujimiya everything but Shida’s name. Only now did I feel glad I added the “I may reveal some information to collaborators”.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: At this point, why don’t tell everything.]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Of course, I won’t abuse it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: You already had]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wow. This is like a professional detective scenario.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Only this and Minato’s that got this complicated. This isn’t the sort of once-in-a-lifetime experience I wished for, getting consulted by Kuze’s Top Three consecutively like this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then that’s how much you influence the Kuze High, I’m sure.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">…I don’t want that attention. I was fine being a sketchy urban legend. I only wanted to choose who to help.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I look at Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But you accomplished your goal? Mikage-san, she got off happy…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s all her doing. I wasn’t so much of a help.” Then I realized. “Ah, I should have told you earlier…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, I don’t have the right to ask about her matters, do I? Mikage-san probably wouldn’t like for people to know about the consultation”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Um, in fact, the said Mikage wanted people to know about the consultation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Besides, Shida’s problem this time was the only reason I told these guys… why does this sound like&nbsp; a shabby justification…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what I wanted to ask is&ndash;” A glimpse told me that it would be a while before Yukito will be finished. “Why would Mikage go to such lengths to avoid the confession.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm… let me think…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You girls got confessed often, right? Any guesses?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s Minato. I got one from time to time… sometimes? Once in a while? I’m most flattered.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why the formal expression…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By the way, do you have a boyfriend, Fujimiya?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh? No, I’m lonely and single. My luck came short.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hoh, despite how popular she is? How high are her standards?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And Minato… You don’t have to, if you don’t want to talk about it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato’s input might be the most valuable. Speaking of confessions, she might be the veteran…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Contrary to my concern, she answered coolly, “I’ve always been there to say no. I don’t understand why Mikage-san would do that either.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That sounds just like you…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She shrugged. “It is hard to reject someone, and quite an exhausting affair too. Still, better than any alternatives”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the contrary, Minato should be the one avoiding confessions, not Mikage. The guys who were rejected turned to antagonize her instead, Reiji had said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Maybe that was what Mikage feared?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Have you ever heard of people who hate Mikage because she rejected them?” Hiura or Reiji would know these things better, but for now, these two will do.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm. I haven’t.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Me neither.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She had already established that she has someone she likes. So I don’t think it’s logical to hold a grudge against her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose…” So that was the difference between Minato and Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Actually, why don’t you tell her directly?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? Minato? Akashi-kun already had Hiura-san ask directly?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yes, so this time tell, not ask.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tell what?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tell her to accept the confession. The purpose is not to know </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">why</span></i><span class="calibre17"> she avoids him, but to </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">make</span></i><span class="calibre17"> her show up for his confession, no? You go to her as the Angel and ask for favor, that might work.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, that was possible too. I shouldn’t expect less from someone who had blown up my identity.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wow! That’s my Minato!” Clapped Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Save for one obvious drawback it posed, it made sense.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But I don’t think I can do it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why exactly?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I told her to accept the confession, it’d mean I had confessed on behalf of the guy. Right now, to Mikage, the guy </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">might </span></i><span class="calibre17">have liked her, it isn’t a certainty to her yet.” I leaned against the chair, beaten back to square one. “I can’t afford that, it betrays the principal emotional aspect of a confession.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In romance, there was nothing more malicious than tipping off someone else’s feelings. I would never do such a thing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, sorry then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, it’s a good enough idea, thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Sorry, I can’t find a good place to end this part.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, let’s get this straight, you mean to ask Mikage-san to show up to the confession, without telling her it is a confession”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya made a shocked face. “That sounds troublesome.” She fell against the cushion. “And roundabout.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s the situation. There’s no straight way for this.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That may be so, but…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“In the first place, the duty of the Angel </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">is</span></i><span class="calibre17"> troublesome, not to mention roundabout. But someone has to do it, and I’m willing. Just find a way to get results, and I’ll do anything.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then I felt a stare from next to me. Minato had a straight face when I turned to her. She nodded. Unlike Fujimiya, she knows the full story as to why I obsess with getting the feeling across.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That sounds like a dead end to me. Or do you have any more leads?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After all the great things I’ve said, the reality was that I couldn’t do anything. Hiura, Reiji, Minato, Fujimiya. If all these people’s wisdom didn’t help, we might need a change of perspective…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was frustrating, but, “Yukito.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm～～?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ve listened?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I wasn’t listening, but I heard everything alright. Looks like you’re having fun there.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This was exactly why I avoided asking him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What do you think?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Dunno. I don’t know a single thing about that Mikage-san.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Any thought patterns? What’s your view on confession, why would you avoid one, whatever.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hnghhh. I like getting confessions. It’s terrible that my halcyon days of getting confessed are coming to an end…” He swung his head left and right. “People change drastically when they’ve got lovers, speaking about youngsters these days.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, one thing.” His eyes lost focus, as if recounting the past. “What if it’s not with Mikage-san herself?”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/360104-722x1024.jpg" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not Mikage herself?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah!” As if seeing something, Minato let out a startled voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yukito sniffled smugly. “What if her boyfriend told her not to accept confessions?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Aah, I see. I might be that…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But there’s no proof yet? Io?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, it fits. From the timeline, everything fits. Whether it would be his influence, or a direct request.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I wouldn’t be surprised if this boyfriend-san’s a jealous type.” Fujimiya spoke up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Jealous…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I got a girlfriend like Mikage-san, I wouldn’t let anyone confess to her. She’s bound to say no, yes, but that’s pure anxiety, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If Hibiki liked Mikage from the start, it would certainly make sense. That also explained why she dodged Hiura’s question.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Is that the case…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She’s like a celebrity without being a celebrity , haah～” Fujimiya smiled lazily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But from that moment, my mind was already working on what I should do from now on.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We disbanded. Before she could get to the station, I secretly called out to Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I needed to set up the stage for the next step.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What is it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can I call you when you get home?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Heh? U-um, okay…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry, and thanks. I’ll call you.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I hadn’t thought I would have to use </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">that </span></i><span class="calibre17">in this case…</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After arriving home and finishing my meal and bath, I called Minato as planned. After ten seconds of ringing, Minato connected to the call.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“H-hello?” For some reason, her voice felt meeker than in person.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah, thanks for answering.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Um.” A monosyllable. “What’s the matter, then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I need a favor. I could only ask this when we’re alone, hence the call.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“O-oh… and that is?” I could hear her faint gulp. Well, it wasn’t something big, so no need to worry…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want to tough Mikage’s face.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll use my power this time too. You’re the only one who knows about it, so help me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Oh, that. I see,” she said dryly. Hey, why are you suddenly disinterested? “Okay. But, why use the power?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We talked about her boyfriend at the cafe, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why do I feel like there was an edge to her voice…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yep, the jealous one…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Jealous or not, that’s for us to find out. The point is, I want to find this boyfriend and ask him instead. Compared to Mikage, he might be loose mounted”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I see, if you move correctly, she wouldn’t know that you’ve moving behind the scenes.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s a far shot, but that’s what I’m trying to do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although there was one preliminary condition to clear: finding Hibiki.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After a thoughtful pause. &ndash;“But… don’t you know his identity already?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Only his nickname, otherwise, I’m as knowledgeable as any other Kuze High student. As it turns out, I can’t find any with that nickname.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Until now, I had only operated on intra-school romances, so this was the first time this issue had been raised. Rather, everything was my first with Mikage. Troublesome.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s… strange…” she muttered.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Right? If he’s a celebrity, there must have been some trace, a face to compare.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You’re doing that? From all the young celebrities sprouting these days?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If that’s the only option. Still, meeting this boyfriend might be the key, I’ll do it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had no illusions of how difficult a task that would be.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Nonetheless, Shida must confess. If this way was impossible then I will just try another…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, didn’t Shida say that I seem to get reckless… Well, he was true. The recklessness was already off the charts now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Okay, I’ll help.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ooh… thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“But why my help? You don’t seem to have trouble doing that by yourself?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage’s not a normal average person. Her action patterns are irregular, and she has that weird sense of distance. You could never get too close to her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Naturally, there were those who were easy to touch and those who were not.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato, and many others were the former. Mikage, unfortunately, was the latter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And there are only three days left until he moves. Considering the time it would take to do the research and pin him down, I’d have to use the power by tomorrow. I can’t wait for that chance to come naturally.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The day after tomorrow was the weekend. Approximately, the entire Saturday and Sunday were to locate his whereabouts. His house was near Mikage’s, so that narrowed down the scale. Likeness of his face would assist the process.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You know what, Shiho was right, you’re a detective in your own right.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Maybe, an affair detective, that might fit. None of my skills can solve a crime case, though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s not funny.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I wasn’t being funny.” Rather, I’m serious.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I wonder what kind of person her boyfriend is.” Minato’s voice had a strange rhythm. “You said he had a one-sided love, right? I wonder how does it feels to like someone for years without saying it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It was mutual since the start?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Double one-sided love?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: The one mentioned before, a term for when people have mutual feelings, but neither knows it.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, yep, that term”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hm, as expected of a fellow Shojo manga enthusiast.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the roof again, at lunch break of the next day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had only noticed then that it was almost summer. Even the summer uniform did nothing to ease the heat. My skin was pricking from the beating sunlight.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yesterday, I had devised a way to get to Mikage with Minato. It was time to carry out the plan today. Although, before that…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I really appreciate your hard work, Hiura-san, Reiji-san…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I respectfully offered a set of lunch dishes to my two friends, these two competent investigators. Since I was bowing, naturally, I couldn’t see their faces.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you very much… I will forever be in debt.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whatever with gratitude, that’s too much, even for you. You expect us to do all that in half a day?” Reji had reached a new peak of exasperation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At the same time, there was a light chop to my head, probably Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I really don’t have time… forgive me”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph, I’m interested in your investigation too. I’ll call it even with one more lunch set.” Reiji snickered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But I’m not interested,” complained Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When I looked up, Reiji had already started eating his bread, and Hiura was glaring discontentedly. What a waste of a cute face.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what’s the catch?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Last night, I messaged them to ask around again, this time to find information around Hibiki.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nothing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Unfortunately, no.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I knew it wouldn’t work.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not a soul had seen her with this boyfriend, nor any pictures.” Reiji shrugged. “Don’t expect much from a half a day investigation.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s enough. Thanks a lot.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, it was originally an insurance policy in case I couldn’t use my power on Mikage. If it came to this, I had no option but to make sure the plan succeeded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“A separate report, but I’ve heard something spicy.” he paused for a mouthful of coffee. “I’ve been talking with that girl from last report.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Go on.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Want me to do an imitation.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Normally, please.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Aw, you’re no fun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, isn’t this supposed to be serious? And don’t invoke Hiura.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She talked about Mikage-chan’s background and then&mdash;” Then, theatrically, “There was a time when she was suddenly absent from school.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Absent?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That… didn’t sound like something she would do voluntarily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It was for two weeks. After that, she went to school again like there was nothing. Her attendance after that was perfect.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The reason?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She heard it from someone else, but it seemed that there was a class-wide fight. Awkward situation? Not only Mikage, but some other classmates were absent too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s… sounds problematic.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And that was the only impression I had. It was hard to decide anything with so little information. But I can’t see why a class-wide fight would affect her romantic tendencies, nor why she would reject confessions.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">School absence… Well, people have a lot going on in their lives.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s all I have.” he clapped.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So, nothing remotely useful.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, screw this.” With a groan, I stretched my arms and unwind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I fell on the floor and let out a long breath. The cloudless sky was so beautiful, contrary to my miserable situation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Someone here?” From the rooftop entrance…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The three of our attention directed to the door at once. I could feel my muscles tense.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That, was not definitely Minato or Fujimiya. At best it was a student and we could somehow talk our way out, at worst it was a teacher and our key got confiscated.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I had a feeling that that was a voice I knew…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, what a surprise. And outside too…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The girl in question, Saeka Mikage, Kuze High’s Top Three.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoa, Mikage-chan? What brings you here?” his composure intact, Reiji greeted flatly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As one would expect, he was a master of acting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage shook her head slightly, as if to tell us she was as surprised as we were. “I want to have some quiet on the stair landing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She stepped out into the sun, her hair swaying as she looked around.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was a little peculiar. For almost a month, I had been consulted by her, but she didn’t have the slightest clue it was the person in front of her right now.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I took a cue from Reji and fought to remain calm.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Got ambushed by too many questions… Haha, yeah, ran away, to here.” One by one, she looked at us, her gaze indicating that her explanation was done and it was our turn.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Now that I think about it, it was probably the first time I had looked her in the eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To urge on our explanation, she mused, “I heard the rooftop’s off limits? The doors are said to be locked for certain.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Is that so? I should have left the door locked today…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her eyes narrowed. “Not your first time, I’ll take it. And you have a key, from that statement.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I sharp terror ran down my spine; I need to watch my every word with this girl…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She slowly made her way towards us. Her loitering on the rooftop could have been on any TV commercial.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pfft” she burst out. “Why so tense, guys? I won’t rattle.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just, I’d appreciate it if you’d shelter me for today. Let’s not tell anyone we’re here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Without waiting for permission, she headed for the fence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Deal, enjoy your stay.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you, Miwa-kun, Hiura-san, Akashi-kun.” As if cataloging, she said our names.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We send nervous glances at each other. It wasn’t a wonder why she knew Hiura and Reiji, but… me? How?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If she noticed our skepticism, she didn’t show it. Mikage closed her eyes and put a hand on the fence. I rubbed my eyes. Was this some sort of music video? Vibe, looks, there was a quality different from when we had online meetings: an invisible wall of pressure…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“MIkage&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What is it, Hiura-san?”</span><span class="calibre17"></span></p>
<p class="calibre8"></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“From where we left off last time, show me a picture of your boyfriend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While I had asked her to do this, isn’t this too drastic? Or this could be the reverse card we need…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmmp… didn’t I say I was tired of questions right now?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just his face and that’s it.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s quite an interest you have in me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I told you why would you let me see it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">None of them were backing down. Normally, Hiura hated this kind of probing, not that she couldn’t.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Haaah. I give up, ‘kay? Let me go.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s the deal? He’s good looking, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Please.” Like a celebrity, she laughed softly, but her tone implied the end of the discussion well enough that Hiura dared no further.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She then turned back to the view of the rooftop and remained silent.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura took out her phone and sent me a stamp, a cat with an annoyed look.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Thanks a lot, my ace] I replied.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She continued her lunch without reading my message.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><b class="calibre16">Minato Interlude</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The cafeteria after school was like a cemetery.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The shops closed down, so it served no more purpose than a place to chat, which served our purpose just fine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In the large, dimly lit space, many large tables and chairs were lined up. The only sound was the faint buzzing of the vending machine by the wall.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As soon as I got to school today, I dropped a letter in Mikage-san’s shoe box.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The time, place, and my name. That should be enough to get her here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yaa, Yuzuki-san.” She leaned to the pillar opposite to mine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She was glamorous, as always. I got a little nervous just by being in her presence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, I’m terribly sorry, Mikage-san…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I have to lie to you here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s been a little while. And on that note, thanks.” Mikage-san smiled and sat down without asking any questions.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The two of us were alone in the middle of the spacious cafeteria.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After taking a deep breath, I sipped from a can of cider I had left on the table.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I rarely drink soda, but only recently, I found myself drinking it a little more often. Why…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Is there anything? I’m a little nervous, what could you possibly have for me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not exactly anything… I chose this timing because we wouldn’t stand out.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fufu, if it’s our combo, maybe,” she teased.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Io, I can’t hold this long, you got this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ve talked with the Angel?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, that went fine. Must have caused lotta trouble. For that part I’m grateful, though.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage-san did not seem to be reluctant to answer, exactly like how Io said she’d be.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, good to hear. I was a little worried.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah, all thanks to you!” said Mikage-san amiably.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’m feeling guilty…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Io, what are you doing?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The recent buzz about you…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Haha, don’t say that. I never knew it’d get that big.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Is that by Angel’s help?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ummm… yes, and no. The Angel said not to tell anyone… But you might be an exception…” Mikage-san was deep in thought.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From the sound of it, it should be that condition before consultation. You really think ahead, don’t you, Io?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m sorry, but I’ll leave it to your imagination. You’re on the right track.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Right. I should have thought more before asking.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Before I could say “sorry,”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Clack</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The cafeteria double door swung open.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;Simultaneously, Mikage-san’s gaze darted towards the sound.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Io walked in. He was furiously typing on the phone. I would have believed he was actually texting someone had he hadn’t told me beforehand. He looked up at us disinterestedly before continuing texting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was acting. He must have been as nervous as me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I checked Mikage-san’s expression. For a moment, her expression stiffened. What happened? Is our plan still working?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By the way, I saw you at Ishiyama Station’s deli cafe the other day.” I threw the prepared topic at her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Get this together, Minato, this is the only chance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, when? I go there a lot.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Umm, when you helped the customer who knocked over his coffee. I was there when it happened.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, you were there? I didn’t notice.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Io then passed behind me. For a second, Mikage-san’s gaze followed him.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, hadn’t you left the cafe? Why did you come back…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, guess I did… I didn’t remember why…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To accent the end of her sentence, the vending machine Io was at clunked. At the edge of my vision, Io bent down to take the drink.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Just a little more…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m wondering.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The moment was near. I quickly search for questions. If I ask her now, her attention would be on how to answer, not Io…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t you hesitate? Whether to help or not.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Either way, it really was what I was wondering.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I didn’t hesitate.” Without slightest hesitation, she answered. “I don’t want to feel guilty for not helping later. I like myself better this way.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want to be the perfect Mikage Saeka. To be someone I could be proud of.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage-san&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Thud.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Io kicked the table and fell forward. His hands reached for support, an by doing so&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">His hand grazed Mikage-san’s cheek.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">His other hand slammed the floor and he rolled. Miage-san trembled, hugging her shoulders.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, sorry. I didn’t hurt you, right?” apologized Io.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“N-no. You alright?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll manage.” he quickly limped away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From what I saw, it was a success… but why did he have a clouded expression.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Did it work?</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After wrapping up the talk with Mikage-san, I rendezvous with Io at Cafe Proof.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I walked through the cutely decorated entrance into the cafe, bowed to Akashi-san, and walked to the innermost seat. Io was there, his head in hands.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From the look of him, it couldn’t be good.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh… Minato, good work back there.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What happened? You didn’t reach her? Not enough time to sketch…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, I touch it all right. No, I’ve definitely touched her cheek” he mumbled. “It was soft…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Tch.</span></i><span class="calibre17"> Is he enjoying her cheek?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Io leaned back languidly and looked up at the ceiling. His Adam’s apple bobbed a little…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ve seen nothing,” he admitted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No one, nothing,” </span>he said dryly, <span class="calibre17">“Ha ha, what a deep mess.”&nbsp; His voice was immediately drowned over by the bustle of the café.</span></p>
