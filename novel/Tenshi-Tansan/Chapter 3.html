<p><span style="font-weight: 400">School rooftops are, in most cases, restricted. Both in middle school and high school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kuze High is no exception, usually, students can’t enter. That’s the trick, usually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heave-ho!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl in front of me exclaimed as she unlocked the key.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clang. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The door swung open easily. The scenery in front of me spread, dazzling blue sky and the shining sun. The dry wind felt good, and with it, my weariness from classes dissipated. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: sorry for the interruption, but it seems that my chapters are stolen again. To support me, please read on Travis Translation.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As spacious as ever–” she stretched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All thanks to the secret key. Could you return it now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, yup.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Click. </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The key clinked as the short-haired girl, Aki Hiura, tossed the key without turning back to me. I caught it carefully and tucked it into my pocket.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: The green themed girl in the introduction illust.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, be more careful. If it got lost and someone found it, we&#8217;d be in trouble,” I chided</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, you don’t need to worry,” Hiura assured nonchalantly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She checked around a bit before she sat down. The way she crossed her legs made her short skirt dangerously almost visible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t look.” She frowned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then don’t let me see.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sexy, aren’t I?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span>More of sensitive”</p>
<p><b>[TN: transliteration of “sensitive” is used in the raw. If I’m to guess, this “sensitive” means to be easily embarrassed.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Good grief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to give a short description of my number one friend, Aki Hiura, it would be “Free spirited manly girl”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To make it easier to understand, the exact opposite of Yuzuki, no Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Outspoken and frank, I respected how her attitude remains the same, no matter who she’s talking to. However, she is also like this in front of teachers and seniors, many were also displeased with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, troublesome. Well there’s nothing left to say unless I repeat again, so that’s it. I’ll try emphasizing her strong points.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But anyway, you’re not going around doing that right?” I asked her back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing to worry about, I have leggings. Here.” Her hands reached for her skirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t I just say stop?!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a healthy high school boy, just a pair of leggings and thighs are enough! And I’m not saying what’s enough!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, she’s a helpful person… But actually, besides her personality, Hiura is quite awesome for a highschool girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, she is extremely athletic. Despite the dainty image, she is the top of the female physical education in the school year. She was the only girl to participate in the boy’s relay race at last year’s sports festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it was her fault the “Male Class Representative’s Serious Relay” changed its name to “Male and Female Indiscriminate Class Representative’s Serious Relay”.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:I did my best to translate the name;-;]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Based on her running speed, she is inferior to that of the boys, but her baton pass was another level. In fact, seven men plus Hiura is faster than eight men.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The name says ‘Serious’ but doesn&#8217;t let someone like me play? How is that serious?”, the legendary words of wisdom that Hiura uttered at that time are still passed down until today. In addition to her physical abilities, she possesses outstanding athletic skills. That was Aki Hiura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And also, being even more skilled than third year students, she’s the reigning ace of the tennis club. Since the first year, she even won first place in a tournament among tennis club members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was demanded by many clubs. But, as expected of a free spirit, she brushed them off with a single word, “Troublesome.”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a man, I can’t help but admire her swagger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, she has a pretty figure, girlish eyes and nose, things that didn’t match her personality at all. In short, another beauty. Other than her crudeness, she has no notable flaw. And maybe that’s why she was easily antagonized.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the bag she was carrying, she took out yakisoba bread, cream buns, and strawberry au lait.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed her suit, arranging my own lunch on the floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what’s your intel? Anything useful?” I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nahh, nothing,” she shrugged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey! I paid in advance!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, how annoying,” She rolled her eyes. “I’m joking. Who do you think I am?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m worried because it’s you.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? Wanna fight?” Hiura showed her yaeba teeth as she balled her fists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I usually lose anyway, I don’t like where this is going. I’m, after all, against violence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura is one of the few people who knows that I am the Angel of Kuze High. Not only that, she also assists me by providing information through her wide network of connections.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Except for my power, I’m an ordinary person, there’s a limit to workload I can handle and time I have. Thus, collaborators are essential to the Angel’s activities. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the condition was that I buy her an au lait as a payment. She seems to like it a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No extra random gossip today. Forgive me for that,” she began her report.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah. And what about the person I asked?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura would usually investigate love affairs of the entire school. Since she has a diverse circle of acquaintances, her gathering capability is quite impressive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But today was different, I asked her to focus on a single person. I want to respect her privacy, but there are things that you can’t glean from the person herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuzuki Minato, second year, class seven, go-home club. In the latest examination ranked fourth in overall grades, A in physical education,” she listed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa… I kinda expected that, but she sure is high spec.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Times she had been confessed too: twelve confirmed. Boyfriend during highschool: zero. Very popular, she assumed the title of ‘Kuze High’s Top Three’ this year.  Her cup size–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t!&#8230; Really?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, serious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see… So she’s packing… No, stop it, Io. Don’t touch this topic any further. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, for Hiura to know about such things…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the “Kuze High’s Top Three” is just what the name implies, a title for the top three popular girls among the boys, regardless of school year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Kuze High has a reputation for having a high percentage of beautiful girls. And those girls are real beauty, no joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The members are not decided by anyone, and they are referred to in common parlance. Although there are rumors about the rank authorizing body being secretly run by a group of students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along with the Angel of Kuze High, some students call this “The two urban legends of Kuze High”. They are my rivals. Hm… maybe not. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN:What’s with this school and rumors? And that naming too, lol]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her closest friend: Fumiya Shiho…No, she’s the only one she has a proper relationship with. The rest are more or less shallow, she can talk with them, that’s it. Fujimiya also went to the same middle school, but—” she frowned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They’re from another prefecture. I heard that they went to a middle school in Kyoto. But I haven’t been able to find any more information on this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyoto…How strange. We are a public school here right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wanna dig further?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…No. I’ll ask you to if necessary, but until then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It should have nothing to do with this case. Besides, she herself doesn’t seem to be fond of that time. If possible, I wanted to avoid this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if remembering something, she added, “and about the ‘Kuze High’s Top Three’, she was disliked by a group of people.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Why is that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From what I know of her, she didn’t seem like the kind of guy to be disliked. Although I did get why she has a few friends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First is plain envy, and the latter grudges. Grudge against Yuzuki for stealing their crushes. These are from the girl’s side.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the guys it’s a bit stupid. They think–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuzuki-chan was leading them on.” From behind, a voice interrupted Hiura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, my number two friend, Reiji Miwa, walked in with his hands clasped behind his head.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reiji sat down and pulled out a curry bun from his bag. His brown two block cut hair and his flashy, well-groomed hace was attention grabbing again today. His earrings reflected light at his ear. Since Kuze High is quite liberal, piercings are not prohibited, and thus Reiji’s not a delinquent. Although he’s quite an idiot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Reji knows the Angel’s true identity, just like Hiura. Though Reiji isn’t a collaborator, he is knowledgeable in love affairs and human relations, so he is of help sometimes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I hadn’t told them about my power. If there’s no necessity, then let&#8217;s keep things that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “You finished your business?” I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. We’re dating.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As always…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was late today because a junior called him out. And as usual, he was confessed, then accepted easily, everything was over in an impossible speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it doesn’t matter. There’s no point in being judgemental, and I’m not planning to. He’ll probably break up soon, again. It was hopeless the moment I heard the girl’s name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: sorry for the interruption, but my chapters are still stolen, again. To support me, please read on Travis Translation.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, ‘leading them on’?” I brought the topic back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, it sounded like it had more meaning to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Yuzuki-chan’s quite cold, right? Or maybe calm and collected? Anyway, you can’t read her feelings and she seems smart.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her first impression was indeed like that. But now that I know her more, getting immediately flustered or embarrassed like that, she’s quite emotionally expressive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But when you get to know her, she’s a real dere,” Reiji went on.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Dere as in deredere]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-dere?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s with that rom-com vocab…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To put it simply, she gives them hope. She’s usually cool, but she would start blushing when talking with them. That gives the boys ‘Maybe she likes me?’ moment”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm…”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I could see it happening. That’s an understandable situation… from both Minato’s perspective and the guy’s.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But when it comes to confession, it was a straight no. That, in one move, made them antagonistic. Just like what Hiura said.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A bunch of nonsense, you stupid men. Pushed your own luck and then came back lamenting.” Hiura added before chugging her strawberry au lait. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha,” Reiji laughed in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, a bunch of nonsense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in that regard, Minato herself must have liked them. She just couldn’t hide her feelings well, which leads to this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coming to that conclusion, I did feel sympathetic for those boys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm. You’re strangely knowledgeable about this, Reiji,” I commented.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah–smart girls are not my type. But I do understand their feelings. With their cheap pride trampled, they become antagonistic. This is the problem with the unpopular guys.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> He shook his head as if to say “good grief”, then proceeded to chomp down the remaining curry bun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura changed her posture from cross-legged and said, “Well, that’s all about Yuzuki. Both famous and infamous, if the balance tipped, she might fall back to Plus Four.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please stop that, I could almost see again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Plus Four”, additional ranking of the four most popular girls after Kuze&#8217;s Top Three. Just like the Kuze’s Top Three, a common name by the students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And by the way, aren’t you enjoying this too much, Kuze High students? What is this even? Backlash against intense study?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoah. Then isn’t this interesting? Our Hiura might finally rank up.” After swallowing his bread, Reiji mentioned playfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing to hide, Aki Hiura here is also one of the Flus Four. She’s not in the same league as Minato, but she’s another high-spec beauty nonetheless. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Over my dead body. Don’t.” She rolled her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Want it or not, it’s the end of the line if you’re selected, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, yep. You can&#8217;t escape your destiny,” assented Reiji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s annoying just as it is. Make me a Top Three, I’ll track down that authorizing body and make them pay.” Death reflected in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kuzu’s Top Three, Plus Four… titles of honor, longed by boys and girls alike… and whatsoever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, titles like these are many things, including a pain.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Multiple?” Reji immediately asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… Ten to twenty. Unusual number of that magnitude.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, isn’t it simple? I mean, it’s just a matter of that guy’s style?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dunno. Not something a virgin like me would know.” Hiura shook her head in resignation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait! You! Idiot! A girl shouldn’t talk like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh? Hiura, you&#8217;re a virgin?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m serious about everything~”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, our conversation turned to the afternoon classes.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, we met up again at Yukito’s café.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the café was filled to the brim with customers that day, so I was called in by Yukito to help until the flood of customers calmed. After an hour of serving and taking orders, I returned to our usual table, Minato was waiting there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, but you could have gone home today. I must have wasted your time sitting here.” I sat down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I came all the way here. Actually, I’m a bit guilty about using your table the whole time…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I nodded, Minato let out a small breath of relief. As upright as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were studying?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">English textbooks and notes sprawled on the table. Both had a lot of writing on it and pages were worn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that your grades are good, you’re studying properly after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing, I’m not a genius. Besides, everyone at Kuze’s smart.” Minato replied somewhat uncomfortably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suppose that’s true. However, not everyone has the will to work hard to go to the next level. There are many temptations in life, especially in high school.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akashi… Io, how are yours?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let’s start today’s session”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somehow… I got the picture.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She saw right through me. It’s okay, getting into Kuze high is good enough for me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, she still continues to call me by my name. As expected, it was still embarrassing. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, just like before, I touched her cheek once to discern any changes. There were no additions this time, but I did discover a new trend. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It decreased.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I checked again, but the result was the same. Comparing the faces to the note, I found the missing one. Matsumoto who was rejected a while before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm… Farewell, Matsumoto. We won’t forget you.” I crossed his name out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-when…?”</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need more data,” I decided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She tilted her head anxiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Data…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yesterday, Aoki’s handkerchief incident told us that the length of the relationship doesn&#8217;t matter. You haven’t talked to him before, right?” I asked to make sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yup” she nodded.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, when you like more people, we can narrow down the criteria a little more. These samples will lead us the way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was now difficult to obtain any accurate information from the people she had already liked. With that, this option was the best. This is a game of numbers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait! That means you want me to increase the number?” She fretted in alarm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Yeah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-but! Isn’t that a complete turnaround?!” She protested, her glare on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I quickly cut her off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, your logic is the turnaround.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your goal is not to reduce the number, but to cure the Falling-in-love Peculiarity itself,” I state calmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I know it’s hard to be positive. Falling in love isn’t that convenient. But to move forward, we </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">must</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> make mistakes. But those mistakes are meaningful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato seemed troubled, her eyes casted down, her mouth pressed thin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have understood what I meant. Even so, she still couldn’t make up her mind. That’s the stage she’s in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I do believe that those mistakes are worth it. If you really don’t want to, then it’s your choice. But I’m sure you want to be cured.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I could have used the “I’ll do anything”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was something that ties to her feelings directly. If possible, I want her to make her own decision. Otherwise, she might get lost in the process and end up regretting it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept quiet and waited for her reply. Around me, I could hear the clattering of dishes and the faint murmurs of the other customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the jazz track Yukito put on ended, she finally answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it… I’ll do as you said.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. If I’m not, I won’t go as far as playing up the rumors. Romantic feelings aren’t something to be taken lightly. I don’t want to take on something like this with half-hearted determination.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied curtly then huffed and turned away. I stared at her profile as she looked around the cafe and blinked two, three times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation took an awkward turn. The itch to cover up the earlier statement was unbearable, so I added, “Well, I usually hide my gender, use voice change, and a tad bit flowery lingo.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Woah, Akashi. What’s up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, Minato is now trying to approach the boys more actively. Of course, it was to make her like more people. But since she seemed like she could freeze up any moment, and that was even before she began talking, I told her to relax. But I just can’t let her be, so…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? What a weird guy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to her task, mine was simple. In short, to monitor her as she carries out the plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was why I’m here, second year class seven, Minato’s class, standing by. Incidentally, this Machida is a fellow who was in the same class with me last year. This time, I intended to use him as a placeholder during the operation. I’m from another class, afterall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! You’re here for Yuzuki? How cute–.” His dubious face broke into a grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, nope. Well, the truth is… I’m kinda curious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He probably meant it as a joke, but that’s exactly what I’m waiting for. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He exclaimed in surprise, his eyes shooting sparks all over. “Eeh?! Really? You’re not the type to take interest in a girl.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m interested–, a lot, at that. Besides, she’s different.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I can see why. Hmm… got it, got it.” He crossed his arms, satisfied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m grateful he believed that, but sometimes, he could be a bit too much. But it’s all thanks to you that I can come here without being suspicious. Sorry for taking advantage of you, Machida</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s here, Yuzuki. Look, there,” he called.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I followed his finger, Minato was already at her seat, radiating her sparkling aura as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, why are you there…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she slowly turned this way. When our eyes met, her head quickly lurched back to its original position. Compared to a second before, her expression stiffened visibly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nope, she just noticed my presence, then panicked, now that there’s no way back for her now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scanned people around Minato absentmindedly, while grunting a few responses to Machida’s questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few boys looked at her from afar. There were also a few girls too. All the expressions and looks on their faces varied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This might be a bit too hard for her… So this is the normal atmosphere for her, huh? Having good looks could be a bit of a bother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, she stood up, then awkwardly approached a group of boys and girls mixed nearby. Both Minato and the group seemed nervous. But after a while, the conversation flowed normally and the atmosphere relaxed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A wave of relief washed over me as I sighed.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Yuzuki-san, that’s unusual. She’s usually with Fujimiya-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fujimiya?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I already knew her from Hiura yesterday. Fujimiya Shiho, Minato’s best friend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, she’s here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following Machida’s gaze, I looked at the entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chestnut-colored medium hair curled loosely inward, under her neatly trimmed bangs, round red-rimmed glasses. Behind them her bright slanted eyes scanned the room quickly. Her round outline and her short height contributed to her cute appearance. She had the impression of a quiet yet gorgeous girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a friend of Minato’s so she was quite noticeable. No, that has nothing to do with this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She dropped her bag at her seat and immediately joined Minato. Like Minato, she joined the conversation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps because of her arrival, Minato became more relaxed.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s pretty. And she seems to be strong-willed too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s calm and serene, but somehow I feel that way. The quiet fervor type?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s the best part〜. That plainess was exquisite, ahhh. She’s always next to Yuzuki-san, so she doesn&#8217;t stand out, but I think she could rise to Plus Four if she wants to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm. Flus Four, huh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, by popularity, she seems to fare better than Hiura. But if it&#8217;s just looks then they&#8217;re a good match.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph. That’s unexpected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks, Machida. But well, I don’t plan to send a letter to you. For various reasons.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, nothing of note happened and the first period came around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For today, no, for a while, I will continue this kind of monitoring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavy footed, I left class seven. Before I duck out, I glanced at Minato. Secretly, we nodded encouragingly to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same day, I left my class and visited her during lunch break. While making random responses to Machida’s prattling, I watched her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probably aware of me and she was properly interacting with a variety of people. As serious as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuzuki-san doesn’t belong to any club, right? So what are you doing at home?” One of the boys asked with keen interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A group of three boys, five including Minato and Fujimiya, were engaging in a small talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-umm… Well, the usual. Reading books, watching TV shows, and so on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Watching TV shows? That’s unexpected,”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, Yup. You look like the type to only read books–” Another guy agreed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I think the same thing too. And she’s probably studying too, but she’s not saying it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, you go out with me often, don’t you?” This time, it was Fujimiya. Hugging Minato’s arm, she joined the conversation with a smile on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, you two get along well. You were in the same class last year?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. Minato here doesn’t have many friends, so I’m quite worried about not being together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, stop it, Shiho!”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/302360.jpg"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At her sheepish reaction, everyone laughed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just according to the intel from Machida, Fujimiya was always at Minato’s side, just like now. But it wasn’t that one of them was following the other around, their hearts seemed to connect, their bond was that deep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever she was doing, whoever she talked to, Minato and Fujimiya came in a set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Then, let’s be friends, Yuzuki-chan! Tell me your LINE! LINE!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… ‘Kay. Then… here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hesitated a bit before handing her phone to them. Her commitment sees no end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But of course, this is not something bad. Expanding her connection and getting to know more people would surely increase the number of people she likes. That’s her–our– current goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, the boys whooped and were waving their phones around excitedly. The hollering got the attention of the other guys around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s purely my own personal judgment, but this seems to be going well. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn, they got it before you.” From the side, Machida said with a knowing grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Too bad, that wasn’t the case. We already had each other’s LINE since the day she discovered me. No, I’m not showing off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Yuzuki-san, what’s wrong with her? She hadn’t talked to anyone until now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That kind of small talk should be normal?” Yes, this is a feigned ignorance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unn–, Maybe–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He cocked his head curiously while looking at Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the situation, she had probably refrained from interactions with other people to decrease the number. However, her action, and also motive, was the complete opposite from before. So it was inevitable that people would suspect something. In fact, Machida already had.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know you’re not eager to do this, but please, Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well–, compared to the unapproachable version, now’s way better. At least I think so.” He threw his body back against the chair. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I have to choose, that is! But cute girls are still cute at the end of the day!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood,” I replied dryly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! But I’m not going to be your rival, so rest assured, Akashi–” That knowing grin again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it’s for the sake of the operation, he’s getting more annoying by the day…</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called her to the cafe after school and checked once. This was to evaluate today’s operation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there was someone, then we would get to identifying. After that, we would list that guy’s interaction with her. She might have slipped something, so that will be where my observation came in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept her head down all the while I compared the list.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, there’s one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she’s aware of it. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh,” she sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s that guy. The guy that asked you what you usually do at home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So it’s Inada-kun… Nghh…” She groaned as she plopped down on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was our objective, so this is a complete success. Although I understand how she couldn’t feel happy about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At any rate, good job on the first one, Minato.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m tired… Really…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, you’re more compliant than I thought. I’m surprised. And you’re getting results too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean…It’s my problem. So it’s my duty to…” Her head was still plopped down. She really seemed worn out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wish I could ease things up a little, but until a satisfactory result comes out, we’re stuck with this. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you don’t understand the reason for this time too?” I asked, just in case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup… But we only talked, something must have happened there…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though you said that, it was just a normal conversation.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We exchanged contacts…” From the gap of her arms peeked at the phone on the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you liked him because he asked you LINE?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait!” she shouted, but then stammered, “I’m not so sure either… But I don’t think so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm. Well, if that’s the case, then it would probably be too much, wouldn’t it? But we can’t just disregard the idea too. For now, note that down, just in case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, have you chatted?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yeah… A little.” Her face turned red again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite that, her lips curled into a smile. I don’t mean to put it this way, but that was certainly an expression of a maiden in love, the only difference being the number of people she fell in love with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm, a get-together. Definitely sus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well considering the time of the year, it wasn’t absurd.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Io… How should I respond?” She said meekly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? A bit hard for an observation here. So operation-wise I don’t advise you to. Of course, that’s just advice. If it’s really a get-together, then you should go, they’re your classmates.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so…” She was deep in thought, putting her hand to her well-shaped chin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’ll leave it to you. Do whatever you want.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yup, got it. I’ll give it a thought”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day too, she carried out the plan dutifully. She went on talking with different people, even those who she wasn&#8217;t particularly friendly with. That must have been exhausting, since she sometimes returned to slump at her seat. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I already know she’s like this, but this is more stoic than I thought. Given my previous consultations, most of them are pretty stubborn. They lacked the courage, froze up from time to time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really wanted them to learn from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, to make the most of her efforts, I went to class seven as much as allowed. Listened to Machida’s prattle, observed Minato’s surroundings, and memorized events.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t just slack off, just so you know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You come here pretty often–. To do this much, quite dedicated you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At lunch, while munching on the bread I bought, I watched her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato and Fujimiya, along with a group of boys and girls, were enjoying their own lunch. Her popularity really shows in times like this, she was welcomed no matter which group she visited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was one thing that piques my interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yuzuki-san, have you finished the fifth period’s math assignment?” One of the boys asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was my consultant, Makino Kousuke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. The two pages exercise, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, that one. Um… I have something I don’t understand, mind explaining?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ok. But I’m not really confident myself…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Thanks!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And their conversation came to an end. They were both conspicuously blushing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that Makino guy there, he’s usually mature and quiet, but he’s like that only when he talks with Yuzuki-san.” In front of me, Machida whispered. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From my reading, he likes her. And quite serious, by that, you know? Isn’t he your rival?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven’t talked to him much lately, but he’s working hard too, it seems. Besides, he’s on the list too. Strange as it may sound, their affection was mutual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected… I can’t just choose one of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, they brought out their books and exchanged notes. No doubt, Makino, and then unexpectedly, Minato too, were bashful. They were on cloud nine, bringing their faces closer and closer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like what Reiji said, she was “leading them on”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there’s no helping that. But she had no bad intentions, she really felt the same way as them, she was just bad at hiding it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh… First of all, this is troubling”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My sigh was too quiet for even Machida to hear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I’ll call you]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After sending the message, I called her. The call reang for three–four times. Didn’t she just chat with me? What’s taking her so long? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An experiment that satisfies the conditions of her having a brief contact with a variety of people and within my monitoring range. My wording might be rude, but to do so, we needed to go out somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, hi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I intentionally moved up one stop and arrived a little earlier than Minato. By the way, it took me only ten minutes from my house to here. Twenty from Kuze High via the Keihan Line. The Kyoto station was just that close to Shiga Prefecture.</span></p>

The black bag across her shoulder also added accent to her overall look. Although simple, her outfit catches people’s attention without being obnoxious. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, to avoid being recognized by any familiar faces, she wore a pink mask and stylish glasses. Even with half of her face obscured, she had an overwhelming presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, an appearance worthy of Kuze High’s Top Three.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I wore a black mask too. But there was nothing interesting about me, so I’ll leave it at that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s go”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somewhat awkward, we started walking side by side. Along the main road, we headed north along the main street toward our first destination. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, nothing to focus in particular, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup,” I replied, “Go shopping normally and go home. The number of people you like, increase or not, it will be a hint anyway. We’re eliminating possibilities one by one here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, the purpose of going out today was to get hints for the Falling-in-love Peculiarity. This isn’t a date. But despite that, we couldn’t just walk around, that would be a waste of time. That was why we decided to accompany each other as we went shopping.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First was my turn. My target was earphones. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m going all out today, just wait for me, earphones.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re an earphone geek?” Did I sound that eager?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kinda, well, mostly it’s for work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the Yodobashi Camera’s escalator carried us up, she asked. </span></p>
<p><b>[TN:I think this should be it: </b><a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/ULNjYpsbGTzeg5J68"><b>https://images.app.goo.gl/ULNjYpsbGTzeg5J68</b></a><b>]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Work’? You mean as the Angel?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. Specifically, it’s one of the excuses for touching the target’s face naturally.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we reached the wireless section, I quickly ran my eyes over the displayed earphones. The types of earphone was its own mystery, but I have my own way of choosing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The expensive and rare ones are easier to lend.” I said as I inspected one of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah, so that’s what you meant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. I brought up the topic about earphones and steered my way to it. ‘Wanna try?’, and then when they are satisfied, I reach to take it off. If my hand could graze the slightest of their faces, it’s mission complete.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s some creativity…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Trial and error. Pretending to brush something from their hair’s convenient too, but that would raise suspicion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Excuses for touching the target&#8217;s face, the more the better. I’m carrying a lot of risks here.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that Minato found out, that’s a special case. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bone conduction or noise canceling types are the best. Most people wanted to try them. They’re expensive, though. Thanks to that, whatever’s left of my already little part time wages are gone too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? You’re…spending all your money on these?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Strictly speaking, not all. But a good chunk of it, though. Investment in my work isn’t something I’d regret… Damn, this one’s two thousand yen !”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um…Why do you go to such lengths?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was gawking at the price tag when she asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To such lengths?” I repeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I had asked once before too. How you spend your money, how serious you are. You’re strangely earnest. I’m curious about that…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suppose that would be a normal response to my attitude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well then, how do I answer?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I honestly didn’t expect you to be this serious when I asked for your help. Although I did have high hopes for the Angel and that rumored power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m happy you think like that. But, well, how do I explain… It’s my policy. Obsession, maybe. No, you just ask why am I so obsessed…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this… one of the things you don’t want to say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, something like that. I think this is not the place to talk about such things. Please just forget it.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That wasn’t even an excuse, just plain refusal to talk. But I think this is better than beating around the bush stubbornly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, if it’s Minato…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it. Sorry I asked you something unnecessary.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s okay. I’m the one keeping things from you, sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asking about the other side while keeping yours secret. I usually do this in normal cases, but being face to face like this only made it worse. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she didn’t seem to mind at all. Instead, she was studying one of the high-quality earphones in the showcase. Her face was unconcerned, as if she had forgotten about the earlier conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m grateful for your attitude, Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, my earphones are the one that came with my phone, should I buy a new one?” She picked up one of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If there’s no problem then you don’t have to. Do you listen to a lot of music or videos?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. Maybe some music once in a while, but the cords tend to tangle in my hair, so I usually don’t.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hn? So there’s such a disadvantage to long black hair every man yearns for.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe not for everyone with long hair, but at least for me.” She then tried on one of the samples. “And what’s that ‘every man yearns for’” she added. The dark red of the earphones suits her well. Although she did seem to have trouble putting it on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about I give you one? I have one left.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?” She turned this way sharply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have an out of use wireless earphone. It’s quite cheap, so don’t think much about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that okay? Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. I brought it online, but they don’t quite fit my ears. They’re wireless, so it might be easier to put on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Kay… Thanks, I’ll take it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato nodded, her eyes narrowed a litte. I couldn’t see her mouth because of the mask, but she was probably smiling. Somehow, I felt worse.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sorry for not telling you, hope this could make up for that, sorry, Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, I brought the new JBL noise canceling waterproof earphones. It cost me 15,000 yen, my first splurge in a long while. I needed to fill in more shifts again, it seemed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we took the elevator to Ogaki Bookstore on the sixth floor. This time, it was her turn. I was glad she chose here, since I have some purchase in mind too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, by the way, Minato.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hn?” She tilted her head questioningly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were only the two of us in the elevator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have time. Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh? Wait?! Hya!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand quickly touched the cheek peeking from her mask. She might have killed me if I were to say “You’re wide open” or some shojo pickup lines, so I kept silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the door opened and people entered. We acted like nothing happened and went up silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pulled me aside as soon as we left the elevator. “Hey, Io! Stop that! You’re scaring me!” She hissed. With her cheeks puffed, she scowled. I wanna see her face under the mask.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Me too, bud, me too.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well– I apologized. I want to see if there’s any change from the station until now. What’s wrong with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, tell me before you do it!. Pervert!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, I know… The door’s opening, and it’s not like we could do it out here. That’s the only private space around here.” Of course, I need to make my defenses clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-still! I… I’m not used to it yet. I want you to care about me more-”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-care…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uhhh… I mean, I understand what she wanted to say. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was starting to sound like an argument between couples…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And? The result?” She crossed her arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, um. No, it&#8217;s still the same.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… but it’s a good thing, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. But, I want to know who it is immediately if you happened to like someone. It would be untraceable if time passes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, ‘kay… Then, we need to check occasionally… And if I notice, I’ll tell you…” She bent sideways coyly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Duh, don’t she know? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, we arrived at Ogaki Bookstore. Incidentally, there were two other Ogaki Bookstores, one in the center of Kyoto Station, and the other at the Aeon Mall on the opposite side.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: So three Ogakis in total in that area]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even Though the company’s headquarter was in Kyoto, this should be an overpopulation. There’s only one in Shiga. Give us some. I love Ogaki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, which do you have your eyes on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied curtly and strode to the manga section, I followed at her heels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So the new volume you said was a manga?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah… I’m fine on my own, you don’t have to follow me. I have already decided what to buy anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, I’ll follow. It would be a big deal if anything were to happen when we part ways.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her response felt…forced? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the reason became clear the next moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A pink clad cover. With a group of flashy men and beautiful girls illustrated. The colors were glamorous too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hoh? Shoujo manga? That’s unexpected.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what’s wrong?! It’s fun! Also e-exciting too. The girls are cute.”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/4r46c7spgaa81.webp"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato glared at me angrily, and somewhere, impishly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, so she didn’t want me to see her buying shoujo manga. Hmm, considering her image at school… Understandable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I’m sorry, Minato. Your concern was misplaced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Shoujo manga is the best. I usually read it too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?” Her eyes widened, her mouth agape under the mask, probably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s exciting, makes your heart wring. The plot is compelling too. Besides, I’m the Angel of Kuze High, remember?  These are the sacred textbooks of love.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, love advice requires understanding of both male and female mind. Although it was fiction, there’s an inextricable structure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-is that so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And also novels and movies too. I like what I like, there’s no helping it. The leftover part-time money from earphones is spent on this.” I picked one up myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato joined me as we let out a troubled “Hmm” while studying the manga.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if it looks interesting, buying the first volume is always a hurdle.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, me too. Can’t really bring myself to buy if I don’t know if it’s well-received or not, or if there’d be a continuation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, yeah– But if I buy it later and it’s fun, then I’d feel like ‘Why haven’t I supported it since the first volume!’. Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup! I’d feel so guilty. Why didn’t I choose better, like that.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really, just like that–” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While having such otaku talk, we browsed the shelves and secured some mangas. With that, we went on to the literacy zone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, this is the one I had my eyes on for today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll take a look too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When two otaku get together, the purse strings loosen, a saying I just came up with. Should be apt, when you get into a heated conversation, you can’t help but pick more and more items. There was nothing much on my hands right now, maybe that’s a good thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Minato had said in one of the conversations that she usually reads at home. So that wasn’t a lie to cover up for shoujo manga, she was really into reading in general, it seems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After notifying Minato, who stopped at a shelf of paperbacks, I went to the hardcover section. The book I was looking for wasn’t hard to find. It was grandly displayed in one corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So this is what you’re after?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She caught up and stood at my side. New and crisp binding, I took the blue book and looked at it curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, I haven’t brought one of these before. I usually go with paperbacks.” She said, running her fingers on the hardcover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a frequent buyer either. I only buy this author’s.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Konomi? How do you read the kanji?” </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Kanji has many different pronunciations, and it could get a bit messy when it comes to kanji for names.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s ‘Kuchiru’. Konomi Kuchiru. All of his are romances, every one of them is legit good. I can’t wait for the paperback release, so here I am.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rock? How?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yup, just remembered that these kinds of things didn’t get through to her. No matter how much she likes subcultures, there are just simply too much of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In Konomi’s work, the mc usually has some strange power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By that… Like yours?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, and then, if the power really exists, what would they do with it? I think I like his work because he really explores all the probabilities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The kind that could wreak havoc if it falls into wrong hands. Completely different from mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, those are made-up stories, right? Yours are real.” She trifled through the pages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How can you be sure?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…” Her head snapped this way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hands still on the book, I continued, “I’m hiding mine from everyone but my family, Yukito, and you. There is no knowing whether other powers exist or not. Maybe we just don’t know about them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked thoughtful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, there might not. But when I watch supernatural phenomena or unsolved crimes on television, I can’t help but wonder, no, suspect. ‘What if those are the work of someone with power?’”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…Um… Yeah. With you having one, that sounds more plausible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grunted, “Well, it’s not like I have met one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation cut off there as we paid for our purchases. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, the plan was to loiter around the Aeon Mall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We returned to Kyoto Station and proceeded down one of the grand staircases. In the shadow of a pillar, I took a quick swipe of her cheek. Still the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we were past the west ticket gate, from the side, Minato asked. “Do you want to meet them? People with powers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I might ask them how they regard their power, how they lived their life…questions like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just ask, I have no idea about anything else. Neither any idea about how to deal with the answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I don’t want them to return the question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me? “Uh, I’m not necessarily a good guy either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t reply to my response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we went to the various stores in the mall and chilled out. Midway through, we took a rest on the gigantic cushions at Muji and took another touch of her cheek in the shadowy corner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around six, we ended up at Capricciosa. We had pasta and a drink there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since there was one person immediately after we started our operation as school, it should be safe to cross out the probability of her falling in love with someone along the road. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato herself did say that she had never experienced that kind of love at first sight, so this might be enough of a verification to completely disregard the idea. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup. And I want to check once before we part. Or, I’m fine with now too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato purred cutely and turned away. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Minato didn’t seem to mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I’m asking for your help here. Besides there are things that you don’t want to say and things you can’t say. I understand how that feels.” She regarded the café au lait curiously before sipping it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if I tell you more about what I do as the Angel in compensation? If you’re interested, of course.” I offered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hn? For example?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a bunch of trouble, yes. But I’m doing this because I want to. Besides, not asking for anything in return is actually convenient, all things considered.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I got something in return, we’re even, right? But if I got nothing, then the party will forever be indebted to the Angel.
