<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Angel and the Girl’s Long Evening</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Work mode: on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Voice changer: okay, camera: off. Call quality: the worst.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–”You there, Angel?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was probably either in Wi-Fi condition or site traffic. The voice froze, but well, it couldn’t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I’ll manage. We can switch to chat if it gets worse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“‘Kay”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what brings you here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makino was the one who asked to have this call today. He didn’t say what, but it was probably…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Um… I will confess to Yuzuki-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see… You’ve made up your mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to emanate a light and cheerful tone, but I guess it could get so far. Good there was voice change, I probably couldn’t do this face to face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–”It took time, but I finally got the courage to confess. All thanks to you, Angel”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you worked hard.” I still couldn’t shake off the gloom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Get it together, Kuze High’s Angel!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–”Is there anything?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. I’m rooting for you, Makino”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I failed to bit back the bitter thought. She was going to reject him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–”Huzzah! Although I’m not sure how to confess… hehe, sorry for relying on you ‘till the end…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t worry, that’s what my work entails”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Hoh? Back to ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">watashi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’? I prefer ‘</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ore</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">’ tho–.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Yep, those problematic pronouns again]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll pass. The more I use it, the more likely I&#8217;ll slip again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Ahaha. I see, that couldn’t be good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmph, this is no laughing matter. I need to keep my identity a secret here. Having a gender neutral image serves better in easing up the atmosphere of consults too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–”Ahh– How cold. I thought we could have been friends.” His tone sombered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, he wouldn’t know that I was in the next class. Or that he just had a tennis match with the Angel a few days prior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But sorry, sorry for urging you on a love that would never come true. Alas, I have no regrets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry.” Of course, he won’t know how many things I’m apologizing for.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–”It would hinder your work, right? So not your fault.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… Thanks.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought we could have been friends…</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Makino, I’m afraid I don’t have any right to be your friend.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next few days passed in a haze. Went to school, took classes, that was it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hadn’t met Minato ever since. I hadn’t even exchanged a single word with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also took a break from my Angel work. I had cleared Makino’s consultation, so what was left was the other new girl, whom I had already sent an apology to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everything fell into a routine, my thoughts too, were in a circle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where did it go wrong?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or was it unavoidable from the start?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know–</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">couldn’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> know. She avoided me at school, and my messages were left on read. I even tried going straight for her. It ended with her rebuffing me with the scaries glare I had ever seen. I was rattled. Never tried that again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had done everything I could think of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when I thought this might turn out to be okay. I had thought that I might have a chance. It might not be my speciality, but I had the will and determination. Heck, I even have this weird power. Surely, something would work out, or at least, to some acceptable level…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah〜〜”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up. Your sighs are making my nuggets bland.” From the opposite seat, Hiura chided.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afterschool, Hiura skipped her club and dragged me to a McDonalds along the prefectural road. A bit further west from lake Biwa where I first talked with Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, Shiga people were crazy about McDonalds. Well, we’re in Kansai, that’s how things work here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura crossed her legs dangerously on the chair, her hands busy lobbing nuggets and fries. The last time I reached for one, she quickly slapped my outreached hand. Now, they were on my knees. I am a man of patience. Humans are susceptible to pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re dying a lot lately.” Bits of…whatever it was, flew from her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to be reincarnated as a clam.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Agreed. You might finally shut up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiura〜”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How cold… and how kind. Is this the duality of Hiura? By the way, why did I feel refreshed when treated this way?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well? It’s that certain someone, right? You were rejected?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she would know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was on the mark?” she continued when my silence prolonged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course you’d care about me〜”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gross”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, got it! I’m gonna turn into a clam!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Complain whatever you want, I’ll be the wall.” She waved exasperatedly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hiura-sama!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you just get done with this quickly?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yup, yup, she was probably a tsundere…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sorted through my mind, my thoughts a jumble. To admit, I wasn’t sure where to even start.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She was… desperate, you know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura was silently experimenting with the two sauces, dipping the fires and tasting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t reckon any wall doing that, but fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like I need to do something, I can’t leave things like this…the other times I would respect their choices, but… this time’s different.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said I would do anything to help, yet things turned out like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought I could build a relationship of trust. I trust her, and I thought the same goes for her. That was the only thing I thought I got right. Consultations rely on trust.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing can beat barbeque sauce.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if things are impossible. Even impossible, surely, at least something will work out. I thought we could at least do that if we’re together… I was wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But mustard once in a while is delicious too…” she muttered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought too lightly of this,” I concluded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait wait, what if I mix them?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What I do is just lead people to confession. No, all I could do is that. Still, I want to see this to the end, even if it meant intruding her space…” A semblance of confidence returned. “There must be something she wanted to keep hidden… Something that is worth the cost of not curing the Peculiarity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t help her without knowing more about her, and she knew it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not something I can just get her to say. And I perfectly understand how that feels.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like how I got defensive when Reiji or Yukito mentioned Ayaha. She must have had something like that too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–There’s nothing you can do with your problem, but you think you could do with hers?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, Reiji, you’re right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–No, you’re the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe you were right, Yukito. I can’t do anything.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not ask the person in question?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was looking at the sauce dispenser hungrily, no indication that what she said was directed to me. Keeping the “wall” act, I suppose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it your fault? Or just just don’t want to get involved any further?” She shook her head and used the nuget to wipe her sauce tray. “Thinking would only get you so far. Just ask her and decide what to do. Disrespect to her privacy? Hell, you have the right to know, don’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, the sound of her slurping the remaining milkshake sounded lonely. I popped open the lid of my Fanta Grape and swigged the ice, the soda long gone. I chew with a satisfying crunch, and prickling pain at the sudden cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiura…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I eyed the fries, not daring to reach. “Can I have one?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She grunted and the red-yellow bag was held out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the longest one, glanced up to check her reaction, and stuffed it into my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sauce too?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mustard.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want barbeque sauce.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mustard”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I coated it with the yellow sauce. A lot of it, just to spite her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Delish”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She watched me eat expressionlessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see… I’ll try asking.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her attitude was brash. Yet when it counts, she was unexpectedly helpful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiura.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?” A grunt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another grunt. “Hm.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A report came in: Makino had confessed and was rejected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was a bit down, but also somewhat relieved. When I apologized, instead of blaming me, he thanked me over and over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–Thanks to you, I could finally get over this. Ahh, it’s like I’m freed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He also said that he would repay me someday. </span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, our counseling ended. I was relieved, yet frustrated, and most of all, ashamed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I steeled my resolve, and,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chime rang and the school day was over. I immediately rushed to class seven.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time to meet Yuzuki Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was greeted with the current of leaving students and when the crowd thinned, I walked in. Minato was still at her seat, looking outside absentmindedly. In the corner of my vision, I also saw Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, I won’t back down–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuzuki,” a snicker, “Hmph, I see that you’re behaving.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dyed hair and perfume, Yamabuki Karen stood with her back to me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Finally know your place? So ashamed you’ve kept to yourself? Pfft.” Her titter still hurted my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A disquieting atmosphere seeped through the classroom. Everyone that hadn’t left froze momentarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki sat on the desk next to her. “It’s refreshing. I’m so glad you stopped that, it’s been an eyesore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gritted my teeth. She was talking about the operation I suggested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But… So she thought that the incident earlier made Minato stop. Unable to resist the urge to brag about her presumed success, like this, she pushed her luck. Oh, Yamabuki, you’ve mistaken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you know, Yuzuki? You&#8217;re just a bitch, the fact that you’ve stopped means nothing? Hope you remember that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t watch this. This is so, so childish.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She thought that those hollow insults would get her the upperhand. Her words, her thoughts, what utter nonsense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sighed and shook her head. “You’re just scared of me, I know. Besides, I know what happened in middle school–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s it. I don’t care about the consequences. Just don’t goddamn mess with other people’s past.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before I could move.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Slap!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A sharp crack.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato stood, her hair streaming after as her body twisted at an unbelievable angle. Yamabuki lost balance and fell hard on the floor. The classroom fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you!! What the hell!!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That has nothing!! To do with you!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears rolled down her cheeks. Her face still in a snarl, Minato left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to go after her when I noticed a grip on my shoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akashi-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What,” I said flatly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujimiya looked at me with pleading eyes as she shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We need to talk.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400"></span>◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I led her to Cafe Proof. It appeared that it was the opposite way to her house, but it was also the only place we could discuss freely. Fujimiya also agreed to that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yukito patted me on the shoulder silently and gave an encouraging smile. I went for the usual seat, and had Fujimiya sitting at Minato’s seat.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually… I knew.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Knew what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What she’s struggling with,” she said, “I haven’t asked her directly, but I’ve seen enough. And that this time, it was about it too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice was…pleading.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yea. but she won’t tell me, so I pretended I didn&#8217;t know.” This time, her voice was sulky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was understandable that Minato wouldn&#8217;t tell Fujimiya, but from Fujimiya’s point of view…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Minato, she’s not well lately.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m worried. You don’t seem to be in contact anymore. So, something must have happened between you two, and that’s the cause.” Fujimiya turned a questioning eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, there was nothing to refute. Nor I was planning to. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noting my dour state, she smiled as if to say she wasn’t blaming me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I told her everything. It was easy, since she already knew about the Peculiarity, there was nothing to hide. I told her how I accepted her consultation, and how I ended up with the conclusion. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her of Minato’s ending of the consultation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also revealed about the Angel to her. If not, there wouldn’t be a reason for Minato asking for my help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time I finished, Fujimiya was sobbing while nodding. “I see,” she said feebly. The fact that Minato went for advice from a stranger insead of her must have been hard to bear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I did keep the power to myself. There was no reason in telling her anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand now.” She looked detached, her words came in between pauses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry… I should have done something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not your fault. You told me everything, and by that, I got involved with your secret. I have no right to put any blame on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sighed. As if in accordance, I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She… She must have known the reason she liked them.” She closed her eyes in concentration. “I think I understand now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… How do I bring this up? she clearly doesn’t want to talk about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She may seem so. However, she must have felt it, somewhere inside, the urge to confide in someone. She wasn’t lying when she said she wanted to get rid of the Peculiarity, I am sure about this.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “You don’t need to but…” Her head jerked up, the remaining tear glimmered. “If… If you haven’t given up on her… Can you please step in? She might not like it, she might hate you for it, but can you try talking to her one more time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shakily blinked several times. With her pursed lips, she looked like she couldn’t stand the frustration any longer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you’re okay with me.” I shrugged ruefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sighed. “If you can’t, then I’m out of the question.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her smile then was weak, yet cute and resolute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know her address?” I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Ah, yes!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Kay, I’ll go. Actually, I was going to go to her anyway, the timing was just bad back there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akashi-kun…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since it’d be two days wait with the weekend in between, I’ll update via LINE. You can send her address there too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went to the cashier and paid our bill. The bell rang softly as we left the cafe and began climbing Tokimeki hill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say,” she began, her tone was light and teasing, in contrast to her dire tone earlier. “Why did you touch her cheeks?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh… Nothing, I just want to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You like her? Minato I mean.” She smiled mirthfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s just…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehh? I’d recommend you to go for her, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, anyone would recommend her, she’s the freaking Kuze’s Top Three. And her good points didn’t just end there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s cute, stylish, and…” she listed. “Ah! She’s a good girl too, you know.” Fujimiya whispered collusively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you’re barely acceptable to me too, so you’ve at least cleared a level.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Acceptable’? And what are you, her parents?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujimiya was heading back to school once more, so we parted at the junction between Keihan Zeze and JR Zeze Station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned my back to her and walked away, she said, “I’ll let you hug her for today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My feet came to a stop. “I won’t,” I said quickly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, there’s a pause,” she noted gleefully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, take care of her!” she said as she waved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her back to me, I turned to hers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400"></span>◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato’s apartment was around South Kusatsu Station, Kusatsu City, the biggest city in Shiga Prefecture. Although this “Kusatsu” was not the same as Kusatsu Onsen, the onsen was in  Kusatsu Town, Gumna, whilst this was Kusatsu City, Shiga. There was no onsen, just a cold lake here. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sigh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. Who named these places?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, from here to Kyoto was an eighteen minutes ride. That made this area a strangely prosperous commuter town. Yep, strangely. This is Shiga Prefecture, everything defies common sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got off the train at South Kusatsu, and fiddled with the map application. I could cut straight through smaller roads, but to be sure, I decided to go along the national highway as far as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made my way in silence, all the while making another revision of what I had thought on the train. I reached a gigantic intersection. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the road, I saw a familiar figure. Even with the backdrop of a yakiniku place, she was beautiful. She still hadn&#8217;t changed out of school uniform. Her back was carried high with confidence. It would have been the usual Minato, only if it wasn’t for the dark frown. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Minato.” Miraculously, my greeting came out fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The frown was taken over by surprise. “Io?”  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She blinked several times successively and removed white earphones from her ears. The wireless ones I gave her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She let out a resigned sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shopping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head questioningly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Help me carry. We can talk at home later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We traced back to a Seiyu at the station building and shopped together. Minato picked up vegetables, instant foods and other groceries with practiced hands. I looked at the basket in my hand, the products here were what most highschool students would let their parents buy for them. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She paid at the self-checkout and I helped her pack the bags. After that, we went straight to her apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not a single word passed between us, saved for the “I’m sorry”, when she noted my initial dumbfounded expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her apartment was the luxurious type. Minato held up her phone and the auto-lock opened with a mechanical buzz. The IC card key was probably hidden inside the phone case. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait here.” She took the other bag from my hand and disappeared inside. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A while passed and she returned. “Come in.” Her face flushed a little as she urged me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The front door clicked close and I was led inside. We reached a living room with a low rectangular table with two cushions. There was nothing of note other than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You live alone?” I broke the silence for the first time. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, mother… Mom lives here too. Or at least, in the paper, otherwise I couldn’t enroll for Kuze High,” she said matter-of-factly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Kuze was a national highschool, so I suppose stipulation along that line exists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this is no time for small talk…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you came.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I’m here.” Her face was taunted with anticipation again. “I talked with Fujimiya.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With Shiho?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, and also once before that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I went on clarifying about what happened. This week was a week of explanations. Or rather, there were simply too many secrets between us, the bill has come due.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression was complicated. From shock, to guilt, to disbelief, her face was a mess of emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I’m not here on her order,” I assured, “I’ll be asking later. What is this about? What are you hiding from me? Think up your answer by then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Later?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You heard right, later. When I finish my story. You don’t need to pay full attention, just listen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, this was the first time I had told someone this by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was this or give up. How to make other people reveal a secret to you? You tell them yours. That was the concept of confiding, that was the concept of trust. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the story of how I decided to become the Angel of Kuze High.”</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>◇◇◇</strong></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a girl named Shiki Ayaha. </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a year older, a senpai at my middle school. Long hair, she was mature for her age,and of course, beautiful. Even so, inside, she was very childish. </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself smiling at the memory.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She was strange. Not that I have anything to complain about though.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She was dear to me. Every one would think like that, she just had the personality that makes you think so. </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She was always on the off-limits rooftop. She seemed to take her class normally, but I have only met her there. Lunch break, afterschool, I always met her there. </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">We would talk about whatever crossed our minds. We talked about silly things, joked around, we even got into fights sometimes.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm. What I did with her is irrelevant to the story, I’ll cut to the important parts.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, the thing was, I liked Ayaha. Of course, romantic feelings, nothing else. Not admiration, familial affection, camaraderie, no.  I was hopelessly in love.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I considered confessing, I planned to. But I wanted it to be a success, I wanted to move forward in a relationship with a girl I liked. I was a fool, but that was the only admirable thing about me at that time.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d prepared scripts, what was left was to find the courage to confess. Then, I realized.</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><b><i>What if I was rejected?</i></b></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that I wasn’t confident. Ayaha was certainly enjoying herself when with me. And the rooftop, I was the only one she let me in.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">But, a sliver of doubt remained.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What does the other party think about me? There was no way of knowing until the confession. No, even if you confess, you might not know their true feelings. You should understand this the best, Minato.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, I was scared.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If I confess, would this blissful everyday disappear? And what if I’m making her uncomfortable with this unrequited love?</span></i><i></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I was afraid of losing the time we shared. I was afraid of what confession would bring. </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">So, what did I do?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Did I say I was a fool? Even more of a fool than now. I was short, my voice was starting to crack, but there was one thing that was the same.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I had this power. Touch someone’s face and I’d know who they liked.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Did it cross your mind when you asked about my power? That this power would be a cheat item for anyone in that situation.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Even a fool could come to that solution. The fourteen-years-old me thought. No, I had been thinking since the moment I knew about my power.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Until then, I had never used it on Ayaha. As you would expect, I was lost. Is that okay? I shouldn’t use my power on someone I cared about, or should I?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a swipe, just to be sure before confessing. Or so I convinced myself.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">One evening, I managed to use it one her when she was taking a nap. My power activated and–</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">should</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> have been activated. I saw no face, none.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Remember? The condition for my power, nothing happens meant that the target liked no one.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayaha Shiki had no romantic feelings towards Akashi Io.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I went home right away and bawled my eyes out. I couldn’t confess. But this affection refused to wane. It was painful.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a break, clearing the haze in my mind with a long deep sigh. Minato was looking blankly at the table, her cheeks resting on her hand. Her lips protrude a little, but not so much as a pout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s ending soon, don’t look so bored.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pulled herself from the drooping pose. “N-no! I wasn’t! It’s… not like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. Just a boring tale of a lame middleschooler’s stupid screw-up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shivered.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, I was a mess. Naturally, I was devastated, I really loved her.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I could no longer see her, her voice now no more than a memory. I couldn’t accept it. In response, perhaps, I threw up for heavens know how many times.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I skipped school for a while. Of course, I didn’t dare go to the rooftop. There were too many things that reminded me of Ayaha. Besides, I might end up at the wrong side of the fence.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I think we had talked about what we would do if our loved ones died. Now that I had the experience for real, I just knew how absurd it was. There was nothing I could do.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">…This was a story about why I decided to be an Angel, right? You could say that this is the Angel’s martyrdoom, I guess.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Why didn’t I tell her? She didn’t see me that way, but then what? I still liked her. Scared? Scared of what? Scared of being rejected and losing this relationship?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, she died without knowing that I loved her. I would never see the look on her face when I tell her my feelings.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You</span></i><i> think anything could be any more painful than this? There was nothing to be done now. You can’t tell her your feelings, never. You think there would be anything worse than this??</i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I burst into another fit of laughter.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with the worst of rejections, it wasn’t the end of the line. There was a whole world of possibilities had I confessed.  </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, can you forget her? Can you give up on her?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t even properly have my heart broken. There was nothing I could do now.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, Io, why didn’t you say it? If you know it would turn out like this, would you confess? If she still lives, would you do the same thing?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">No, right?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have told her. Should have told her I loved her. “I’ve fallen head over heels for you,” I should have said that!</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter the result, I should have confessed! If I had said it, I would have been able to move on! </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Every moment spent might have been the last. That’s the truth that people never realize until it is too late.</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why I became the Angel.” I managed to hoarsely choke out the last words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have brought soda from Seiyu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘The angel will help people who were troubling about love’ was what spread. Words spread and the saying changed to ‘Agnel will make your love work out’” I licked my dry lips. “I help those who couldn’t take the plunge, even sometimes a little forcefully, so that they won’t regret it like I did. My responsibility is not to make sure their love is fulfilled, but accomplishment of confession. Whether the confession succeeds or fails, whether their love comes true or not, it doesn&#8217;t matter either way to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. But it takes courage to confess. Courage comes from confidence, confidence needs results. I’m more than happy to help their relationship progress.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afterall, there was no such thing as an absolutely successful confession. And at the same time, there was no such thing as a romantic feeling that was better left unspoken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m being selfish, I know. I understand that there are people with special circumstances like you. That’s why I let them choose, whether to follow me or not. And I told them beforehand that I don’t guarantee success. If they grab my outreached hand, then I will help them to the end, that’s it.” My limbs were heavy and my heart ached, it was as if I had lost all the strength I had.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato kept her head down and said nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, there’s not much to comment on. I get it, it was stupid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for telling me,” she finally said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, rather, I’m sorry for telling you something dark. And it was longer than expected.” It must have been a while, since my throat was all but parched. “So… Minato.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trepidation filled the air. The main issue was now here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What on earth happened? If you don’t mind, please tell me. Just so you know, you don’t have to. If you really want things to end this way then I’ll respect that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">A nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, personally, I don’t like this ending. I know I’m forcing myself on you but, you know, I’d like to at least end this amicably. I don’t know how you feel about me, but I think of you as a friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was all I had to say, the rest was now up to her. Secrets and feelings are yours and yours alone, Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to steel her resolve, she slowly closed her eyes and sighed. With a nod, she lay her hand over mine. Warm, soft, and trembling hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mine is dark too, okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My climax might be at the start though.” Another sigh. “My parents died when I was little. Their workplace caught fire.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s why you were crying?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She went on without answering. This time, she wasn’t crying.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I had nowhere else to go, so my aunt took me in. Yes, she’s my “mother” now. And no, I’m not left alone in this world.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a husband and a baby boy. So technically, they&#8217;re my father and brother. I was five then, I had just begun my kindergarten.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">My new mother didn’t get along well with my mom. Ah, rest assured, she didn’t take it out on me. Troubled would be the better word. They can’t figure out how to interact with me, even until now. Their real child was just born, so their attention was there, for the most part.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it couldn’t be helped. Babies are hard work. You never knew what would happen if you took your eyes off them.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I would know my place and behave. I owe them enough for taking me in, what else could I ask for? Yeah?</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, my parents were busy people, the professional type. They were hardly at home anyway. Even my babysitter was stoic. I am used to being alone.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">It was lonely and… sad. But there was nothing to do about it, so I just gave up.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hm? What do you mean by “Since then?”? Yeah, it was since then.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I was annoying or not cute– no, that are just excuses. It’s not my fault, it’s not theirs too, it was just how things were. They would fawn over my brother while letting me be. But how could you blame them? They were probably celebrating the birth of their baby when I came to their doorstep. They had no memories with me, no fondness, no affection or whatsoever. </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The difference between me and my brother was just so blatant that I can’t ignore it. So I look after my brother, do anything to erase my existence, so that they can ignore me, so that they have excuses to ignore me. I can’t afford them hating me too, so it was the only viable choice back then.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That was probably what I was thinking back then.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Like, what kind of kindergartener thinks like that?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She laughed feebly</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">But I understood how they felt. I, too, can’t bring myself to love them. But I’m still grateful for what they did. They took the responsibility to raise me, the daughter of a sister whom she despised. Raising a child wasn’t an easy thing.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">After a few blunders, I learned to take care of myself, to play alone, and to prepare meals. Anything that would contribute to the “I’m fine” aura.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand though, the distance between us widened. Synergistic effect, so to say.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">They were quite wealthy, money was never the problem. They would give me allowances, and bring me things I needed. Still, there’s nothing I wanted, and I felt bad wasting it. In the end, most of the money just ends up at the bank.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I had turned down once, saying I don’t need this much. But they said “Please keep it”. “Please”, in a plea.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no way I could refuse, so I hadn’t tried again since then.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it was a way to lessen their guilt, like, “Here’s the money, forgive us.”</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">They occasionally ask if I need their help with anything. Sometimes, when I ask them a favor, they would smile as if relieved and go on with the favor.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking back, it was like a business deal.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">We went too deep into the back dealings, and have no choice but to continue. Instead of fulfilling our obligations, we used our rights and let the other side do the same. Telling them it’s fine, and being told the same thing.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, sorry, I derailed. Well, the point is, this is how I’m raised.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What you want to know is probably from now. Yes, this is how Falling-in-love Peculiarity came to be.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I told you that it started during elementary school, that I dated many guys to find the cause, that I don’t know the cause.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">But sorry, the last one was a lie.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was no longer surprised. She checked my expression once before letting her eyes fall to the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew the trigger pretty early. I know what kind of people I’m attracted to.” She said, “Yes, the same conclusion as yours. It was around two years back, so I had thought a lot about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it was right…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The cause too, it was easy from that point on. This Peculiarity was unordinary, then I must be unordinary too. I just need to trace back from there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head in disgust.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The contempt was directed at herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wasn’t loved.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, that way of speaking might be rude,” she corrected, “I just can’t feel I’m loved. I’m messed up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her fists began to curl. She began to pull her hands from me, as if she was afraid of messing me up too. But I didn’t let her, I sought her hand and gripped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So when I feel like I’m liked.” Her eyes still downward, she went on. “I had to like them too. It just feels like I’m obliged to. I mean, they </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">like</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> me, they are giving me what I’ve always longed for. Even though it wasn’t familial love… I still… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Still</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Gratitude, loyalty and faithfulness matters a lot in Japanese culture, so by Japanese context, liking several men simultaneously, speaking bad of one parents, and so on are bad. Sorry for not clarifying this earlier. ]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah…yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A droplet spilled from her eye, followed by another, and another. The drops joined into a stream, rolled down her cheeks and fell, disappearing behind the table’s shadow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, my hands intertwined and connected with Minato’s. Which one of us initiated, I couldn’t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then wiped her wet cheeks with her sleeve.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…Is there even a way to know? Something like that,” she sobbed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That?” I echoed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I might be wrong. I might look over something. It was like blaming my parents, saying it’s their fault when all they did was take me in. I might just be me. I don’t want to put the blame on anyone… So I needed someone who could find the real reason, that way, I might… I might…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I found you. If it’s the Angel, then surely, the answer! The reason I’m messed up is me, I want that answer!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not their fault! Not Mom, not Dad, not my brother, not anyone’s fault! It’s mine…It’s mine!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice cracked and she crumpled, I kicked the table away and caught her. She clung to me like a child. Her voice rose into a shrill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t wanna,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> hic</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, be a bother to anyone!” she wailed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looped my arms around her, patted her head, trying to anchor her, to stop the trembling. I failed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cried too. Her guilt was immense, it just felt natural to be crying after seeing her crushed like this. She took the lead and I followed. Her sobs continued forever. We didn’t talk, what to do next, we had no idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m sorry, Fujimiya, this is all I could do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Minato”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but… I see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hugging her was the right choice.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was already night when the crying stopped. We strolled through the chilly national highway together. The bobbing lights and the swooshing of the cars were a lullaby. I rubbed my eyes sleepily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We veered into a chain ramen shop. The sign in fron read, “Shimoto Shogun”. The hot bowls of shio ramen were carried, the warm soup roused me from my daze. The occasional clang and clatter from the kitchen was nice to the ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s no longer the problem, then there’s no need to care about the reason, right?” she mumbled, “So it won’t be their fault, I’m not crazy, then… we could all forget this… and…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I can’t do anything, it’s not getting better. If I want it gone, then I should do fix the source of the problem. But… but I don’t know how… What should I do, I–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing her face becoming pale again, I cut in. “Hey, Minato.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t you go slower?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At last, I could find the word I wanted to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can’t you take more time? I understand that you are frustrated with how you can’t be committed, I understand that you don’t want to blame anyone. I know you want to fix it right away and forget about it. You have been thinking, suffering, fighting on your own.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Io…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But can’t you take it slow? Five years, ten years, maybe twenty. But by then, things might have been alright. You’re not getting better anytime soon if you keep on like this. Don’t hurry, just little by little, you can change.” I smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She scrunched her face and immediately set her eyes downcast. Her glossy bangs fell and closed over her face like a curtain. I heard sniffing and wet breaths coming in gasps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll help. I’ll listen to you anytime, I’ll think with you. And if it helps, then let me use my power on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un…yeah.” she nodded repeatedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be at your side, so just relax and hang in there.”</span></p>

<p><b>Ayaha Interlude</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Ayaha”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My last memory of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before we parted for the day, we watched the orange in the sky being swallowed by the purple of the dusk. We were wrapping up the conversation about mind-reading power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it wrong if you don’t use it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were talking about how we would use it until now. But what I had wanted to ask was this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean the power?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I have the power for real. Because I don’t know how to use it. It was a question with no answer in sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not?” She looked at me earnestly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had expected her to tease, but she looked serious. And thanks to that, I had the courage to speak further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t see how using it could make you happy. You might know something you shouldn’t and end up feeling bad.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Like I did</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words died on my lips though. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I don’t use it, then it is just as good as not having one. And I’d be just another ordinary person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, that’s true. You have a point.” she pondered, “But still, that’s depending on how you use it, no? It’s all up to skill.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha…You might manage that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm? I’m not so sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if it’s like that, then having the power might not be as good. God must have flunked so badly at the lottery if we happen to get any power.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And a terrible coincidence at that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or perhaps God just couldn’t imagine I would screw up this hard when he gave me this power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, good or bad, it’s up to you, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t look this way. I, too, didn’t look her way. And so, I could never know what kind of expression she had. She, too, couldn’t see my expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, the topic just happened to be about supernatural powers, so it might look dramatic. Actually, wouldn’t it be the same for other things too? Like how tall you are, how big your chest can grow. Even your gender when you were born. Everyone is born different.” She spread her arms. “And that’s what makes us us. How would we perceive ourselves, how would we act. That’s all according to us. No, others can decide for us, but I’d hate it if someone did that to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why I just want to like myself no matter what I am. I want to be someone who can like myself. Everyday’s more fun to me this way.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, you might be right.” Somehow, when she said that, it sounded convincing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Or I might be wrong～”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, can’t you be sure to the end.” I said despite knowing that it was just how she was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, I don’t know the right answer. Maybe I’d die without knowing it, the right way of living, I mean.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d like to know it before I die though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Agreed”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, if you happen to find it one day, make sure you tell me, ‘kay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re the older one here, be a good example.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We fell into another silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I think of it, it was a bit strange , but at the time, I felt like there was no need to say anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, I saw Ayaha smiling happily, holding up a plastic bottle. She then opened the bottle and proffered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wanna drink? Calpis soda.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t like soda”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, why not? Try a sip.” She held the bottle closer to my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said I don’t like it… By the way, isn’t this indirect–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s newly open, don’t worry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess it doesn&#8217;t hurt to try.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, or you’re disappointed you don’t get an indirect kiss from this mature, older sister?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no! You idiot!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, suspicious”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ignored her banther and quickly gulped down the soda. My hot, blushing face cooled down. It was much sweeter than I imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She waited for my response. “Hey, it tastes good, doesn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Not really.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehh, why not. Hmph, I’ll make you see the greatness of soda.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thanks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the chime suddenly rang, signaling the end of the school day. School closes shortly after this chime, we had to go home. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the very last memory I had that day, with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayaha.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… the superpowers we talked about were entirely hypothetical, yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Enveloped by the ringing chime, lighted by a setting sun, I said, as if to remind myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, hypothetical.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she lived,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What would I be doing now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What would we be doing now?</span></p>
