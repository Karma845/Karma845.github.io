<p style="text-align:center;" class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">Minato Interlude</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Down the stair landing, a girl stood tall. Her almond hair reached her waist, her skin translucent almost indistinguishable from her uniform’s white. All of them were dyed to pale reddish from the rays of the setting sun.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It had been an hour since the classes ended. The school building was cleared out, the only sound accompanying us were only distant shouts and soft air instruments.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yuzuki Minato-san, correct?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Crisp and supple she pronounced her query. As if to soothe my questioning glare, she added an amiable giggle.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I spared a glance to the surroundings before giving her a brisk nod.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yes, what can I do for you? …Mikage-san, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Actually, there was no need to confirm. She was </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">the</span></i><span class="calibre17"> Mikage Saeka. She had well surpassed me in terms of popularity.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sry for the callout. If you don’t mind a few min, I have a favor.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: So, Mikage’s Japanese is different. I can’t quite place it but uhh, it’s different. Kinda a little curt, I guess, so the english equivalent would be internet slangs? ]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her choice of words were unusual, but suited her well. She looked straight at me and I couldn’t help but to draw a breath. She was… beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t mind… what is it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After the incident a little while ago, aside from my few friends, I still couldn’t muster up the will to talk to someone.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Still, I was willing to at least listen to her piece this time because she was clearly giving me space. Her tone and even until her slightest movements, I could feel that she was trying to make me comfortable.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks. There’s this one thing I’d like to ask for you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup… Before that, one thing. I don’t think we’re on the same page rn.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then her back dipped, slow, deliberate ninety degree angle, apologizing for a reason unknown to me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“U-um… what is this supposed to mean? That’s sudden…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It was inexcusable for me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My bewilderment doubled.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Last week, when those rumors of yours spread…” she looked up a little, her voice trembling. Strangely, I didn’t mind her bringing up the topic at all. “I couldn’t help you at all.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Worse still, I had begun to believe them even a little. I feel that it is inexcusable for me to ask for a favor without properly apologizing.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She then bowed again rigorously. The light that gleamed in her hair flowed with her motions, showcasing how silky her hair was. Even though I can’t see her face, even though I was a girl, she was truly beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m terribly sorry, forgive me.” Not a bit of acting, not a bit of falsehood, she was really sincere…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You haven’t done anything wrong. Rather, I imagine not giving in to the rumors for that long is quite hard as well. On a personal level, you’ve done nothing wrong to me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, wasn’t it tough for you?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s…. It’s already over, I don’t mind. Thank you for thinking that way, I appreciate it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She slowly lifted her head, and broke into a&nbsp; grin. Not the reserved, meek smile, but a relieved, ear-to-ear grin.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks. You’re a lot stronger than I imagined”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, I owe this strength to a boy. He was rather clumsy and stubborn, but kind above all else.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No… I’m not,” I said to myself softly, before asking in a louder voice, “And, what’s your favor? I have to hear it before promising anything.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Right, right.” She puffed out embarrassedly, as if she had completely forgotten about it.At that, I almost laughed out myself too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even though I said I promise nothing, I have already thought that I would help her if it was anything in my power.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If she was acting, then I had completely fallen for it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s this, I want you to introduce me to someone.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Introduce?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I began to list the people I know in my head. It wasn’t much of a list, though, if I limit the scope to just within Kuze High, then there would be Shiho and then…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I felt my cheeks burning hot, my heart clenched as if someone put their hand over it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The Angel.” her words carried a surreal reverberation to it. “I want to meet the Angel of Kuze High. If you could&mdash; no, no matter what, let me meet the Angel”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Maybe I should have gone home right away today.</span></p>
