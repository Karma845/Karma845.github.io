<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hello, </span>Maromi Maroyaka who only drinks milk tea when writing.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nah, I sometimes drink coffee or tea too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, nice to meet you. Well, this might not be our first meeting as this is my second series. But whether you know me before or not, thank you for picking up this book. It is a pleasure to meet you.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: He had another series, Bishojo to kyori wo oku houhou, TLed by my fellow Travis slave, axed at vol2 tho.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, let me start by how this story came into being. This “Angel Only Drinks Soda” came from a message, “Maromi, let’s publish a book (shortened) !”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, Nakajima-kun came to my house, Katsuo-kun’s house. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I lied again, my real name’s not Katsuo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nonetheless, Nakajima-kun is a real person. My dear editor, Nakajima-san, thank you for calling out to me back then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll talk about Nakajima-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are two Nakajimas. Really, no cap. They were my editors assigned to me for this series. Both of their names are Nakajima.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just as surprised when I first knew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It started with a message like this: </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nakajima : On behalf of Nakajima-san, I will take care of today’s meeting</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, several question marks floated in my head. Nakajima-san too must be like, “Why did the higher ups send us together.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was when I began appreciating my pen name. Heavens above, what would happen if I used Nakajima as my pen name too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, no, Nakajima is a good name. On the contrary, Maromi’s kanji is a pain to read.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:”Maromi” kanji has several possible pronunciations]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few words about my work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a story about a boy who has been through a lot, and a girl who has been through a lot. The theme is “love counseling,” but the content is a little different. The main character, Io-kun, is, not by any means, normal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He loves soda, and is also a psychic. Moreover, he is a bit of a drag. Hmm, I should stop insulting my own character.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he’s a wonder to work with, so I decided to go with him.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I like serious people and secrets. Also twisted men like Io or Miwa. But cool and strong girls are the best. (Hiura stan) </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I like quiet places. I like lively places. I like emotional scenes, I like logical thinking characters. I like soda. I like Shiga, I like Tokyo.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put all these things I like into this book, hoping that you could enjoy it as much as I do. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My dear character went through a lot in this volume, and will in the next volumes too. Youth, love, trouble, to name a few. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether or not I will be able to continue the story depends, frankly speaking, on </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">your</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> response, but I hope to write a lot more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last but not least, I would like to give my acknowledgements. Thank you very much, Nagu-san, for always drawing stylish, cute, and cool illustrations. I felt like entering Nirvana every time I got to see your illustrations. You’re my reason for living, Nagu-san, a big fan of yours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t thank you enough, Editor Nakajima and Editor Nakajima, for finding me. Thanks to their enthusiastic, sharp, and careful advice, I believe this work has become way better than I could write alone. Above all, I got to learn a lot, thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to become a better writer so that one day you can brag about raising this humble Maromi.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also to my beloved friend, Mr. N who accompanied Maromi’s machine-gun idea pitching. I’m counting on you. Thanks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, to every reader. Thanks to all of you, I am able to do my job as a writer. Thank you. I love you all. In return for your time and money spent, I will do my best to write an entertaining story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to see you all again for a long time to come. So, I hope to see you again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">January 2022 Maromi Maroyaka</span></p>
