<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; The Embarrassment Goes Both Ways</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what am I supposed to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s that “Eh?” for…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school the next day, at a cafe called “Cafe Proof”. Yuzuki Minato, who sat across from me, tilted her head in confusion. It’s shockingly cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But whatever with that. It doesn’t matter, Io. Focus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must have some theories you wanted to test with my powers right? That’s why you came for me,” I elaborated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no. You see… I’m not sure about your ability, what could you do with it. I can’t fully grasp that.” Her voice gradually became muffled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So it seems that she plans to leave that to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, no slightest clue. Yesterday&#8217;s hunch is now confirmed to be true. How fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chose this place for the consultation because the manager of this cafe is my cousin. It’s a good distance from school, ideal for secret sessions. I also use this place occasionally in my normal Angel activity. That the said cousin likes to get involved was a fly in the ointment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that&#8217;s the case, your consultant doesn’t have to be me in the first place,” I noted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not true. You can do things other people can’t. Besides, the Angel takes their consultant’s concerns seriously. That’s what the rumors say.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, but I’m the one who let out that rumor. It’s a stunt, a stunt.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh… B-but! I already believe it so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?” Well, now’s too late to back out. And I’m a bit glad that you trusted me. “Then, let’s get to it”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yup!” she nodded nervously, but her eyes were determined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, this is not my speciality, but that doesn’t mean compromise is acceptable. If you’re doing this, then be serious, Io. Compromise is unacceptable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, I’ll explain what I can do.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Across me Yuzuki gulped. I took a sip of the cider. The sweetness and the prickling acidity cleared my thoughts. When I&#8217;m using my head, this must be the best way to go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s simple, almost the same as your hypothesis yesterday: Touch a person’s face and I’ll see who they like. If multiple, then I see all of them.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clink,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> the cider’s ice rings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By ‘like’, I mean romantic feelings. It doesn’t work for respect, admiration, familial love, nor does frienship,” I went on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s quite amazing, hearing it all again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To tell you the truth, not really. I can only see their mental image of that person, no profile, no age, no name, only their face. Identifying is possible only because we’re in the limited space of school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She only raised her beautiful arching eyebrows at that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, “not really” was an overstatement. Even with these limitations, it’s still a supernatural ability. I have had this power since birth, so I might have taken it for granted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And if the target doesn’t like anyone, then nothing will happen. ‘There’s none’ or some notification like that would be better. It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle in these cases.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I add a negative feature, Yuzuki was still silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But yeah, discerning between that I had failed to touch them and that they like no one is a pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And what about the power, what’s it even? How did you get it?” she suddenly asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that necessary? Knowing what I can and what I can’t should be enough.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered, she looked away awkwardly. “Y-yeah… But…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that my voice had inadvertently turned cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, It’s not a pleasant topic. If there’s a need then I’ll tell you then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I asked too much… Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Awkward… No, this is my fault.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s natural to be curious about such a kitschy superpower. In fact, I should be grateful that she&#8217;s this reserved.  </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed my eyes for a moment, let out a long breath, and said, “I’m really sorry. I’m not used to having people knowing about my power. There’s many things I don’t want to say, but you can ask me anything, I’ll answer whatever I can.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, got it. I’ll be careful,” she nodded slowly a few times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s reasonable, and probably able to put herself in other people&#8217;s shoes too. That’s what I learned about her character. Our conversation at Lake Biwa yesterday too, was like that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, I shouldn&#8217;t be too uptight either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To make the consultation more effective, gaining the other side’s trust is a must. And to achieve that, it’s important for me to trust them first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, that’s all about my power. Next up is about your situation…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki&#8217;s shoulders jerked up at my words. Her expression stiffened. She was extremely agitated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t get grossed out, okay?” she muttered, her slight blush hard to notice in the shadow of her downward glance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have heard that a beautiful girl’s upturned eyes are destructive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this, this is more than I imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I won’t gross out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you were hesitating! Is that a lie?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no. I mean, I already know most of it, so I was wondering what’s left…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was gawking, I can’t just admit that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rocking her body, she protested. To evade her blame, I returned my attention to the cider. Save me, cider-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It was from the very beginning,” Yuzuki saaid in a whispery, feeble voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The very beginning?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since elementary school, during that time when you start having crushes. My Falling-in-love Peculiarity has been since then… My first crush was five people at the same time…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. So from the very beginning…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-isn’t that strange? I can’t be earnest…insincere…” Yuzuki cowered in embarrassment and guilt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was easy to reassure her, but she surely doesn’t want that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have told herself that everything’s fine, that she isn’t wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But words alone aren&#8217;t convincing enough. So she hates herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I could understand that feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was desperate to an extent that she chose to hunt down the Angel from baseless rumors, six month spent at that. Her  anguish isn’t anything that can be alleviated by words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since then until now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, and… Perhaps…It’s getting worse.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And any idea of what caused it?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No. I have thought about it a lot, but I can’t figure it out,” she agonized bitterly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when all seemed hopeless, she heard the Angel’s rumors, it seems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So all’s on my shoulders, huh? I’m the one who decides her fate…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, we need to find out the cause first,” To boost our morale, I denoted firmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Right…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And in order to achieve that, I need an assessment of your current situation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s a cause to every problem. To solve it, you need to deal with the cause.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to understand the cause, having a good grasp at the problem is necessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With that, here.” I offered my right hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” She eyed my hand suspiciously</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you “what?” about? You’re unexpectedly dull for a top student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me touch one more time”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hii?!” Like before, she pulled back and hugged herself tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This girl… Is she really determined?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot, I want to see who your crushes are, so I can investigate who they are.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-if that’s so then say it clearly! You surprised me, you know!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it, got it. I’m sorry. Then, come on.” I waved my hand, beckoning her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I don’t just touch her face, I’m a sensible man, you know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, hurry up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I mean, it’s not necessary, right? I know who my crushes are, so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How sugarcoated. Didn’t I say a good grasp. Precision is important, you know!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you guarantee that you are aware of all of them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t falling in love without noticing one of the most common aspects of love?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And thanks to this damn aspect, Angel’s work is harder than it should be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But! We’re in a cafe…” she fretted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine, my cousin knows about my power. And this table is separated from the rest. We’re all set here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But–” she moaned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘I’ll do anything!’” I reminded her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nghh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my trump card, Yuzuki shrank, eyes downcast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having that commitment sure is convenient, good thing she said that yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the one who said that, so not my fault.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, making a beauty like her blush is a guilty pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pervert.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, don’t be rude to the Angel.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perverted Angel!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re saying Hentai Shinshi?”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: </b><b>HENTAI SHINSHI CLUB, a Japanese trio formed in 2017.]</b></p>
<p><b>[TN: The pun was about the similarity between Tenshi (angel) and Shinshi]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What is that even?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, nothing.” I looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So that doesn’t get through, huh? Well, okay, noted.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She put her hand on her chest and let out a long breath of resignation. Then she brought my right hand to her face timidly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I too leaned forward and braced for my power to activate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand slowly touches her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a bliss to be able to touch a beautiful girl’s soft skin, but for me, my hand felt nothing while my power worked. I only felt a soft sensation the first millisecond, with the rest blank. Yeah, my disappointment is immeasurable. Once again, for the record, I am not a pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the lips of her pouting profile were damn sexy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yup… Nothing out of the ordinary, I can see them just fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why do we look like a couple who just started dating…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I almost forgot the faces. Shoot, what are you doin, Io!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-then what’s next?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, just wait,” I said while taking out a notebook and a pencil case from my bag. “I’ll note those who I know, and I’m going to draw a portrait for the rest. Then you tell me their names,” I explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can draw?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I said that, I don’t think being able to draw was something that normal. All is the result of practice. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To make the most use of this power, being able to draw is crucial. I could only see their faces for a second, and it’s not like I can take pictures. It’s better to fill in as much information while I still remember them. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly jotted down sixteen faces whose names I knew, and got on drawing portraits for the rest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no good, I forgot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it, I can’t finish in one go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I can just take another look. Target knowing about my power sure has its perks. Usually it was one chance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I offered my hand again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Yuzuki didn&#8217;t grab my hand. Instead, she just rolls her eyes and looks at me blankly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? There’s a lot left, one more time.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki pulled back in an exaggerated manner, shaking the table with a clatter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a lively fellow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t tell me you expected me to finish it in one go…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course! Why again…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Too many faces. To be precise twenty-three people. Most are boys from school, but I want to confirm, there might be some from other places.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked away.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Anything’”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The code phrase made her shoulders slump as if she had given up. Her grudging glare was a perfect balance of cute and mature. You’re making me giddy, you know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And you’re not the only one embarrassed. Ugh…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From then, I repeated the process. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Yuzuki insisted on being uncooperative, so I had to touch her cheek myself. Time-efficient. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just so you know, I’m not enjoying this.” I mean, I need to clarify.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I already know!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then please stop glaring.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Still!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But honestly, her cheeks are pleasant to the touch. Hella smooth. Sometimes I even got to feel her smooth silky hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was a separate matter. This is a necessity. Really, I’m speaking the truth, you know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took us an hour to identify all of them at last. By then, we were both exhausted and decided to call it a day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cafe was located near the second station from Kuze high, along the Keihan Ishiyama Sakamoto Line. This station is also near the JR Zeze Station. Yuzuki seems to use that one. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heading to the station lies the Tokimeki hill, a narrow, bustling inclined street with stores flanking both sides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I forgot to mention.” I broke the silence.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki, who had been looking around with interest, suddenly turned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a possibility that my cousin from the store or the Angel’s associates might know your situation. Do you still wish to proceed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her expression became strained. I could read anxiety, fear, and a hint of curiosity from her</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All of them are tight-lipped. They won’t just let out other people’s info just for the fun of it. Of course I’ll leave your name out. Is that okay?” I added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Got it. If you deem it necessary then do it… If you trust them then it’s fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. Thank you.” I nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I don’t get their consent from the start, it could jeopardize my credibility later. Just the same as in normal Angel’s work.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahead of us, a truck came slowly. I pulled Yuzuki to the side and shielded her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tokimeki hill could be a bit dangerous if you’re not used to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-thanks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her meek reaction is so cute, this girl… She usually looks calm and collected, what a splendid gap. If she showed this side of hers, her popularity would be unprecedented.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, why did you turn down Matsumoto?” I suddenly remembered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Matsumoto had confessed to Yuzuki sometime ago, but was turned down. However, he showed up in one of the faces I saw.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, didn&#8217;t you two have feelings for each other? Besides, you turned down every confession. Pardon my way of putting it, but have you ever tried dating them?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She went silent for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, self-deprecatingly, she forced herself, “Of course I tried,” her voice quivered, “Maybe I could finally be faithful if I dated someone, I wished. Back in middle school. But…” she grimaced. “But it didn’t get better. No matter who I date, I keep falling in love with other people… and it keeps growing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that rude? I’m the worst. Maybe I can hide that fact and continue dating, but I just can’t forgive myself. Five times I tried, none worked out. I won’t date anyone until I am cured. I’ve made up my mind.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And those five?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I apologized to them properly. I broke up soon after dating, I’m sure they were troubled. Of course. They weren’t wrong in the slightest, but I took advantage of them just because of my situation…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m really the worst,”  she finished.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hand that gripped the hem of her skirt shook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So turning down their confessions is her own style of showing her sincerity…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In short, I’m a selfish JK, the very opposite of being faithful. Aren’t you disgusted?&#8230; What an idiot.”</span></p>
<p><strong>[TN: JK business, the practice of compensated dating with adolescent girls. Jk is the abbreviation of Joshi Kousei, or high school girls]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I understand’, the word stopped on the tip of my tongue. But her feelings, I could somewhat understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How frustrated she is, I could understand from her disgusted voice and her pained expression. Yeah, I understand it painfully well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she doesn’t know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About me, about herself. And about love.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Am I supposed to be disgusted? With that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?” She looked at me in surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, we reached the railway crossing in front of the station, with the boom gate descending in front of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deafening clanking of machines rang. A train approached us, followed by a clamor. The sound of rushing wind swallowed us whole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I could only hear her voice. And surely the same for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Love is not something you can control. Even if you don’t want to, you fell in love. It’s not your fault.” I searched her eyes. “And from our interaction until now, I’m sure you’re a good person. I don’t regret accepting your request. I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">will </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">help you, just hang in there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her short reply made me uncontrollably embarrassed. I shook my head to cool down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, there’s no voice change nor closed camera here… I can’t just go around saying corny things…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The train in front of us slowly departed. The warning whirring stopped and the boom gate lifted slowly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked her to the JR ticket gate and said goodbye. But she stood there, fidgeting. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not because of what you’ve just said earlier…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes still downward, she continued. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the gaps in her beautiful black hair, I could see her cheeks. It was as red as cherry fruit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I…um…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I might… I think I like you too…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/S__13410309-2.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I should apologize now… Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No…umm…Well, it’s fine…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then turned away. Her hair and her skirt swayed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared absented-mindly even after her back disappeared behind the ticket gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;How troubling.” I muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still absent-minded, I made my way to a bench and waited for my train.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400"></span>◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Work mode: on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Voice changer: on, camera: off. Call quality: decent. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuzuki isn’t dating anyone right now. I’ve been searching around, I’m pretty certain,” I announced.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Really!” On the other side of the call, I could hear Makino sigh in relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But not just pure relief, impatience, nervousness, and foreboding mixed, I suspected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, of course, this means that he has no excuse left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But whether she likes anyone…” The events of the last few days played at the back of my mind. “I couldn’t tell. Sorry”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Uu…I see…” Makino grunted, but didn’t say anything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s probably waiting for my response, undecided, stuck in the pre-confession predicament. The most common prelude to a confession. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s where the Angel brings them to resolution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makino”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Hm?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve said this before. No matter how Yuzuki is, you should confess. Even if it doesn’t seem to go well,” I concluded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“It’s not that… easy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not that easy. No one wants to be rejected. That’s natural. I know exactly how you feel.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“I-if that’s so!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even so, telling her how you feel is the right call. Definitely.” I said firmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side, Makino inhaled sharply. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Angel’s words were probably more forceful than ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Being rejected is painful. Being told that they don’t share your feelings by someone you like is scary. But if you don’t, you will regret it for the rest of your life. ‘If only I confessed back then’ the possibility that would never come true will haunt you forever.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like how it haunted me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Uu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that doesn&#8217;t mean I want you to just charge in and get rejected. To minimize the possibility of that, you have done your best until now. That, I (<em>Ore</em>) know the best.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Io slipped a <em>Ore</em>, manly version of “I”, while until now Io used “<em>Watashi</em>”, gender neutral “I” (Although a bit inclined to femaline) when being the Angel]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sh…hss</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">” Soft static voices accompanied his silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But there’s no such confession that guarantees success in this world. No matter how confident you are, no matter how promising things seem, the possibility of being rejected is still there. That’s why you need to overcome that fear in the end. That’s what confession is all about.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Angel…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not saying that we need to do this right away. Let’s conquer your fear slowly, until then, I’ll accompany you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Yeah…Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And in some cases, getting rejected isn’t the end of the line, you know? You can confess again. There’s a limit to that, of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Haha. Yeah… You’re right. Yeah.” His voice had brightened up completely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a long breath and tried to relax.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart was thumping, my throat was parched. Before I knew it, I got too intense. From my trusty cup, I drank the coke. Prickling pain and chilling cold made my calmness resurface.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Thanks, Angel. Somehow… I feel better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, sorry I rattled on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“It’s nothing. But, that. After all, Angel’s a man,” beamed Makino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And why did he know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m hanging up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Oh. Then, I’m in your care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah. If there’s anything I’ll call you.” With that, I ended the call myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lied to Makino about one thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki likes someone, a lot of them. And one of them is Makino, I confirmed that from the session at the café today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I won’t stop his confession. Even though I know full well she can’t return his feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Forgive me, Makino…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From now on too, forgive me, Yuzuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But a feeling that should be kept in, there’s no such thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ayaha…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A name I</span> unintentionally whispered.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face came to my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Forcing myself to choke those memories down, I sloshed down the now fizzless cola.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400"> ◇◇◇ </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, Yuzuki and I met up at my cousin’s café to decide our next action. At the usual seat, after picking up the drinks we ordered, I touched her cheek again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Isn’t this more than last time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my interrogation, she looked away embarrassedly, her cheeks flushed pink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seems that she is self aware. So this is why she looked unusually nervous when I was about to touch her cheek today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, she’s really easy to fall in love…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, it’s… that… Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, you don’t have too. Just tell me the reason. That guy’s Aoki, right?” I questioned. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The latest member of the “Crush List”, Aoki, is of class eight like me. Pardon my way of putting it, but he isn’t the most memorable guy around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if I recall, he’s one of the Yuzuki fan club. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why… I don’t know either.” She frowned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t know? Something that you’re attracted to, anything?” I continued probing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her frown deepened, “&#8230;He picked up my handkerchief for me in the hallway. We chatted a bit then, nothing in particular before that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“His appearance is your type?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The probability is low, but I asked anyway. And it’s to protect what’s left of Aoki’s honor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think so… Among people I’ve come to like, their appearance varied, so…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” I noted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was true. From the twenty three… No, from the twenty four people in this list, none of them have something in common in terms of appearance. Some good-looking, some plain. Some burly, some lanky. In terms of height or body types, the deviation is also high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So is it okay to assume that appearance has no influence? For all of them, I mean.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps… I think so. But if not then what? Why have I come to like them? I don’t have the answer…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So you know nothing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hoh…” I let out a breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is going to be more troublesome than I imagined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… I suppose that’s true.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, I did say it myself that romantic feelings aren&#8217;t something you can control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a point. But just that, the fact that there’s too little data is still there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if there&#8217;s no pattern, surely there must be a reason why you like them. Like in this case, being treated kindly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have considered that. But if that’s the reason, then I think the number would be absurd. Besides…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides?” I repeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s so, then there’s no way that I wouldn’t… like… you.” Her voice faded away steadily.</span></p>
<p><strong>[TN: It&#8217;s a bit confusing here, in the later chapters, Io said that didn&#8217;t see himself when he touched Yuzuki, contrary to Yuzuki&#8217;s declaration at the end of chapter 1]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned and saw my jolly cousin. An apron over his shirt and denim, his exuberant grin annoys me to no end. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And he dared show up when it’s the embarrassing moment. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm. Are you sure about saying that? I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">did</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> look out for that seat?” He pouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah–, I’m sorry. I’m forever grateful–” I pulled my hands up in surrender.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center;m display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy…I <em>did</em> owe him a favor, but he’s always messing around with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what are you after?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nahh–, I saw you talking with a girl, so I thought I&#8217;d join in,” he chortled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about going back to work? Work?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay, it’s not that busy now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t “It’s okay”, your part timers are complaining…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, um, I’m sorry we stayed here for a long time…” Yuzuki bowed her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s thorough when it comes to this, huh? As expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope, it’s totally fine, totally fine. This happens all the time, thanks to Io. Besides, having a cute girl like you like here makes the store seem stylish.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, no. Not that much…”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: In Japan, it is a normal practice to deny the praise in order to show humility]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh! I almost forgot to introduce myself. I’m Akashi Yukito, Io’s cousin and CEO of this Café Proof.” He flashed another grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re just a manager,” I reminded him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had already checked the definition of CEO, I meet qualifications.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How convenient of you. You just like how that sounds, don’t you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yukito is seven years older than me, a cousin from my father’s side. He knew about my activities as the Angel and was willing to lend me his place when I needed it, just like now. To be honest, he helped me out a lot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it would be great if he stopped these annoying interruptions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m Yuzuki Minato. I’m Akashi’s friend from school,” she introduced herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Friends. Hmm, friends, huh?” Yukito put his hand on his chin and bobbed his head. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yukito-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoa. Stop that &#8216;Yukito-san&#8217;, it’s kind of embarrassing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just call by the first name, Yuzuki–”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be silly,” I cut in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering that our surname is the same, the logic’s  kinda understandable, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And if you’re going to call by first name, do it with Io. Ah, and Io too, call Yuzuki-san by her first name. What a perfect timing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eehhh?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Yukito…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s unnecessary…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Io’ is just two letters. Besides, there’d be many more occasions to call him, so that makes sense, right? And girls can’t call the guy’s first name one-sidedly.” argued Yukito with the smirkiest grin of the day. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is what makes this guy so annoying. He looks like he’s joking around, but he’s awfully good at logically validating his pranks.  　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no way… We need to talk at school too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not that rare nowadays, right? You always call people by their names, you don’t like it when it’s your turn?”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: If you pay attention, Io never uses honorifics.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Urgh…” I groaned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen to what your patron says, Io. I’ll be back to check on you, just so you know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that, Yukito went back to work. From the counter, he sent us a jovial wink. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy…I’ll remember this!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so what next?” she asked, baffled. A normal reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a pain… But Yukito’s serious at times like this. Better follow what he says, better than listen to his complaints…I guess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s good at poking at people’s weak points, and even more at getting people to follow his suggestions. With that in mind, listening to what he says without resistance is the best solution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The part timers here too must be troubled. I can imagine their daily struggles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, I think he’d be satisfied with making fun of me. Earlier, you were just used by him in order to achieve that. That’s why it’ll be fine if you let me call me by your first name, you don’t have to call mine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He probably won’t corner Yuzuki like he did with me. He tends to keep his outward appearance good, after all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But still, if it’s only you it would be strange, right?” she noted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm? Nah… Well, it might sound unbalanced, but that’s it. You don’t need to worry about that,” I refuted</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I said that, Yuzuki was deep in thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s serious, no… upright in a weird way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, yup. After all, I’ll call you too… by your first name,” she insisted</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U-um, okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face flushed red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to stop her as she says so, but isn’t that pushing herself too hard?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, what about calling that only when we’re here? Sorry, Minato.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Minato is Yuzuki’s first name] </b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hya!&#8230;Umm. Uhhh…I-Io!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like how people make contracts in anime, we called each other’s names once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it shouldn’t be a big deal. Just change the way we call each other, that’s it. But the thing is, Yuzuki– Minato– looked squirmy, her cheeks even redder than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don’t have to, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no. It’s okay…! It’s just… I’ve never called a boy by the first name…” she mumbled in a muffled, fading voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That reaction, if you can, stop please…</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400"> ◆　◆　◆ </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you after?” While wiping the dishes at the counter, I glared at Yukito who was closing the register.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, we discussed our course of action quickly and adjourned. Minato went home, while I went straight to help out the store until the café closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was one of the conditions for renting the place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I do get paid, I was basically called in to fill in shifts as Yukito wanted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing–. I was just trying to support my cute cousin in befriending a beautiful girl,” he replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What support? Adults don’t play around with high school students. It’s gross.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m still young, just twenty three. Unfortunately.” His voice was somber, his usual glee was nowhere to be found.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever meaning lies in those words, that was for later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yukito’s behavior was worse than usual today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re always helping other people’s love, what about yours? I just want to shine light into Io’s lonely youth, what’s wrong with that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, totally wrong. You already know that I have yet–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Io.” Interrupting my argument, Yukito stared at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With his soft smile still on his face, he continued in an admonishing tone. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too, wouldn’t it be better if you stop giving that girl special treatment?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something painful, you’d be better off if you forget it, you know? You still have to live on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Shut up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just shut up, Yukito.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know. I know this the best.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Io-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my memory, that lass said merrily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like the sky and the clouds seen from the rooftop, she was like the breeze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If, hypothetically, okay? If you had some special power, what would you do?” she asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with that, out of the blue…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like usual, we talked about a lot of things and nothing in particular, just idle chit-chats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to me, the time spent on this rooftop was more important than everything else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The drama I saw the other day was about that. I just wondered what Io-kun would do,” she elaborated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that fiction? It’s impossible anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The topic for today, however, was a bit unsettling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I was the only one who knew that it wasn’t impossible.</span></p>
