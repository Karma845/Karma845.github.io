<h3>Chapter 2: The Angel in Plight</h3>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“My relationship with Hibiki-kun’s what you’d call a childhood friend.” I sipped my cola without making any noise as she went on. “He’s three years older than me, now a second year uni student. Our places are close by.” her voice dropped. “He’s moving there though, the university’s in Osaka, quite far from here.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And hence the rush?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yeah. Less time to meet, if it’s when, it needs to be now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If anything, Mikage’s request was rather a mundane one. She has a crush, can’t confess yet, simple.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Anyway, an older childhood friend, huh. I had never thought such a cliche romance would belong to Saeka Mikage. It wouldn’t be surprising at this point if the Kuze’s Top Three, Minato excluded, were to be girls in love. But to be honest, I didn’t think someone of Mikage’s caliber had anything to be concerned about. Unless there’s something missing in the equation, I’d say that the other party will readily say yes…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even better yet, there was a really high chance of their feelings being mutual. That she might not know it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;“To start with, why haven’t you confessed yet? If you’re on good terms, then there’s plenty of chances?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Not like that, Hibiki-kun’s a</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17"> celebrity.</span></i><span class="calibre17">”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph.” Isn’t that applicable for you too…? Hmm, better not say that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“he’s fashionable enough to be a magazine model. His university’s also prestigious, he’s also </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">really </span></i><span class="calibre17">kind.” She said as if his spec was that of an electrical product.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Love blinds people, so of course, that’s what this Hibiki-kun was with a filter on. Although he was someone Mikage fell for, so that in itself means something.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So you’re not confident enough to face him?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It sounds a little pathetic, but that’s it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hoh…” That’s surprisingly timid, Kuze’s Top Three.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, no, it wasn’t my palace to judge, if she felt unconfident, then that’s it, she’s the one who was with him, while I don’t even know this Hibiki-kun.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“He’s always treating me like a friend, y’see. He doesn’t like our relationship changing. I’d only be bothering him if he didn’t have the same idea.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see…” The closer, the trickier, or so the saying goes… “So, you’re worried about what’d happen after the confession in case of a no. You’re unsure and feel guilty to the other party. That’s what’s holding you back, am I correct?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Whoa… Exactly. I should expect no less from the Angel of Kuze High.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I smirked. I’ve told you, this was completely in my turf, unlike with Minato.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, back to topic at hand. Next…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“So, if only I could have your help, I have a feeling that all’d go well. What do you think? Can you lend me your strength?” All at once, her tone became fervent.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I sucked in a breath and rested my chin on my propped hand. This…wasn’t a situation where I can take her plea lightly. True, the contents was nothing out of the ordinary; to make Mikage confident enough to confess before he moved away. If she wasn’t confident, then make her be, if she felt guilty to the guy, then take that from her. I’ve had everything planned out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But this consult request in itself was in conflict with Shida Souta, whom I had already promised to support him. I can’t help but wonder about the inevitability of the situation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Naturally, I felt bad for Shida, but I would feel just as uncomfortable refusing Mikage’s request on that basis.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No matter the scenario, one of them will ultimately fail, and there was no way I could help them equally mechanically like that. But…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tell me, how long do you have before he moves?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Actually… It’s less than a month away. I’m running out of time.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mmm” Hey, isn’t that too short of a notice… and don’t sound so desperate, I’m feeling guilty.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I know. I wanted to talk to you earlier, though? Can’t help but wonder when will the letter come every time I open the shoe locker. Not like I can walk up to you either.” She said apologetically and… resentingly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On that part… well I’m sorry, ‘kay?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If it’s any solace, you’re on the list too, albeit of less priority. With Shida’s consultation underway, hers was postponed for the time being.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Though, I try not to pick favorites when it comes to this. But this was certainly a dilemma, there were only so many consultations I could do at once, and then I needed to manage all the schedules so that it wouldn’t interfere with the other’s.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Actually, that was one of the hardest decisions I needed to make as the Angel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“but then there’s the broadcast. I feel sorry for Yuzuki-san, but that was my only chance of contacting you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uh-huh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That’s her only chance of contacting me…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What should I put upon the scales, on which criteria should I use to decide… Both sides seemed just as equal in importance.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To help Shida, aid his confession, if possible, make it a “yes.” Or to support Mikage in her last desperate scramble before her crush moves away, significantly lowering Shida’s chance of success.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, taking a step back, the Angel shouldn’t be worrying about who to support. The Angel’s duty was to help people confess, in the form of counseling. That said, there was one thing that set the Angel apart from friend’s love counseling; fair judgment without personal feelings.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And so, if I treat these two confessions equally, then there was no reason for me to refuse Mikage’s plea.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I muted the microphone, exhaled and closed my eyes. As an afterthought, I drank the rest of the cola. The miniature </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">hiss-fizz</span></i><span class="calibre17"> exploded at once in my mouth, and then regrettably faded away to oblivion.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There was no answer for me in the soda.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Without any regrets. A choice that I wouldn’t hate myself later for.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My goal wasn’t to make their love come true, but to bring forth a conclusion, be it good or bad. To not lose the chance to say it forever like me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And if… if I don’t accept your request, what’s your plan,” I tested.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’ll confess on my own… I have to, no matter what. I don’t know what will happen, tho.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh…you just have to say that…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I can’t let her go alone, after all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Got it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Forgive me, Shida.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Then…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yep, I’m taking on. If you agree to my terms, that is.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Really…?! Thanks… thanks a&nbsp; bunch,” said Mikage, her relief obvious over the phone.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the contrary, I slumped back on my chair, in my chest bubbled an odd mix of distress and determination.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I considered a single consultation to be quite exhausting, but I guess I would need to keep up even more in the next coming weeks if I were to be in a dilemma like this.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In the end, Mikage readily agreed to the number of conditions I said, and became my consultant. From the following day, I proceeded to consult with Shida and Mikage on an almost daily basis.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Given her ability, the high competition, lack of confidence, without any defined relationship, and the final nail being that Mikage already likes someone contributes to your slim winning chances and hesitancy towards confessing. We’ll go over all of these during the course of the consultation, understood?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Oh… wow, that sounds even more hopeless when you said it all together at once like that…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s the same for every other consultant.” And me too, back then. “But, saying it out loud like this has its uses. You need to face your own feelings to conquer your own fears.” My eyes ran through the note I wrote once more.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Aahh” precedence brimmed Shida’s voice. “It’s just like that time when we have to face off against the high ranking schools. But when we had a fair share of grumbling, it did feel better”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, something like that.” What a matching metaphor from a sports man. “Anyway, the point is, how do we solve those points? Or at least work around it. And then there comes the steps of actualizing those, of course.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“R-right… actualizing.” He gulped. Yes, Shida, there are exercises in store for you. “But that’s unexpectedly… systematic.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You prefer me to go spiritual? I have things to consider upon, dedication, motivation, but that’s not in the picture, for now. What we need to do depends on the situation.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Whoaa… How persuasive…! No doubt you’ve become an urban legend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As a matter of fact, I was aiming to be an urban legend.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Back to matters at hand. From the said issues, the easiest one is…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Is…?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Your contact with Mikage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Uguu…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, hey, what’s with the groaning? We’re just getting started.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I’m not mistaken, you two practically haven’t talked. Do you know that she has any friends or groups?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“No, sir.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then make one.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Is that the only way…?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yes, it is. Actualizing, actualizing please.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Having a small talk, or getting opportunities to talk regularly, you’ve done that before, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Actually, no～ I’m always watching her from afar… Bleh, I’m disappointed in myself, that’s plain creepy…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nonsense, that’s what one-sided love is, afterall.” Although this would prove to be an obstacle, he had no contact with her…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“But she doesn’t seem to have any friends in the first place?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose. But it doesn’t have to be close friends, we can get to her through her acquaintances.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“‘Kay… Still, there’s the image of “our Mikage.” She’s friendly to everyone, but not more than that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmp, so he noticed that too. For this case, building a relationship was certainly a challenge.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s two things we need to do. Right now, you’re afraid you’d be troubling Hibiki, and you’re not confident of the result. So before you confess, you would like to make sure of these two?” I summed up the session.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yep.” If I’m allowed to comment, her voice, even over the phone, was </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">beautiful</span></i><span class="calibre17">.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ve been wanting to ask, why are you so unsure? Does he have someone he likes?” I had forgotten to ask the first time around, so this was my chance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Whether there is a rival or not generally has a significant impact on the course of consultations, the odds of winning the confession and reluctance to do so would fluctuate quite wildly in cases like that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ngggh…? How do I put it? He hasn’t talked much about romances. Pretty embarrassing, isn’t it?” Unexpectedly, Mikage said nonchalantly, like it did not concern her at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s unignorable,” I stressed, ”Didn’t you say he’s popular? What’s more important than that is whether he has taken a liking to someone or not?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hm, see your point. Still and all, he’s single despite the approaches.” Her voice was even, almost disinterested.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That’s… since a while before, her strangely composed intonation prickled me oddly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ahh, and then. Hey, Angel?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“From what I’ve heard, you have some powers, right? Curious if that’s true or not.” Contrary to the moment before, she sounded excited.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ehh… She’s so direct. But more or less, I’ve become used to this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Like, y’know? Mind-reading, knowing who likes who, stuff like that&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, unfortunately. And naturally, that’s a made up story” Apologies, Mikage, but you’d have to make do with my template reply.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At times like this, I once again appreciated the practice that went in so that I could deliver a smooth denial. Be prepared, always.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I did squirm a little when her analogy was almost on point. Then again, nothing compared to that time with Minao.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You could say it’s an exaggeration. My hunches and predictions are usually correct, not actual supernatural power. If anything, it’s a necessary lie to get the rumors going.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And that’s a lie. I had a hundred percent authentic supernatural power. I could see who the person liked by touching their face, that’d certainly earn me a laugh in the face, no merits, and tons of risks. Better keep things like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hmm, I see, I see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Disappointed?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yep, I’ve been hoping somewhere, silly, but well.” She giggled jokingly. I needed to admit, it was cute.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Though, sorry for lying. And if possible, pray I won’t have to use it this time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Since we’re here, I’ll ask. Can’t you ask him directly? Like, does he like anyone?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wah, didn’t I just say? That’s freaking awkward. If it’s not then I’d have asked him long ago.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On that behalf, you don’t sound embarrassed in the least, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Argh, I can’t read her emotions at all.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Angeeel… hear me out</span><span class="calibre17">~</span><span class="calibre17">”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As soon as the call connected, Shida cried feebly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“She’s… Mikage-san’s confessed again…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hoh, as popular as ever.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Why are you so nonchalant! Angel!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s left to be surprised? And the result?” Well, the question was more of a rhetoric than anything else.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Rejection…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm. Then good.” Again, I said for the sake of the conversation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“It’s not… I want to quit, goodbye, everyone…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It took no more to tell that Shida’s spirits had been shattered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This was to be expected, more or less. Your emotions would be up for a swing when the confession date closes up.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You can take a leave today,” I offered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Eh…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This is not the time to push forward. Take some time, give your mentality a rest, rushing now would only be counterproductive.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“A-Angeeeelll…!” Shida cried out in tears.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">U-um…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, there was a limit to taking it slow. There were two ways of taking it slow: taking it slow so that you can continue in the long run, or procrastinating and ending up at nowhere. I would need to make sure Shida won’t fall into the latter one, that was my role as the Angel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But,” I added, “Even Mikage has someone she likes. Make sure you don’t forget that.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Geh…t-that’s…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just like how you’re trying to confess, Mikage herself might be trying to make some developments of her own too. You can never know what will happen.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That’s right. Besides… what, when, and who fate decides to take is beyond human capacity. So, tell her, Shida. No matter what, don’t get stuck in what-ifs like me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had my responsibilities to her privy, this was the most I could tell you. Be warned, please.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“In the end, what’s important is how you match your pace with your feelings. So, if you’d like to, we can call this off today.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“No… I’m doing this! You’ve restored my spirits! Let’s gooo! Rawrrr!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s…energetic.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Rawrr!! I’m doing this, let’s gooo!! I love you, Mikage-san!!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No offense intended, but that’s creepy as hell. And you sounded like an ape.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Shut your trap!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">His gaiety hooting made me wonder if the sulking was an act or not. Well, if he’s ready to continue then this will save me a few days.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Say, Angel.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Today, the guy who got rejected…” His voice dropped a tone. “I wonder what he’s expecting.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How could I know…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Did he feel afraid?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh, so that’s what this is about.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why wouldn’t he? But despite his fears, he chose to confess, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Right…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, or the alternative. He might not be that committed, so it was a half-hearted gamble of no great loss. Something like that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Okay…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I feel you, Shida. She has someone she likes, and you’re well aware of that fact. There is no way you can avoid this fear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shida”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re great enough just by wishing to move forward. I promise you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Another Ore (俺) here.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Angel…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Another emotional breakdown?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Did you just call yourself ‘</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">ore</span></i><span class="calibre17">’?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nngh?!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Again?! Get yourself together, idiot!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, you can’t be certain whether Hibiki has someone he likes or not. Then what about him with a girl, alone?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I started our third call with the question.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage paused for a moment, then sniffed endearingly, &ndash;”Hmmm…Not that I remember. But there’s no way of being sure either. He might be keeping secrets.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait, you’re not that close?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Remember, we’re three years apart, when he’s in highschool, I’m in middle, when I’m in high, he’s at university.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Aah, that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That said, childhood friends with three years apart were a rarity, they weren’t even in the same kindergarten. Well, reality is full of surprises.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;”But, does Hibiki-kun’s romantic experience have anything to do with my confession?” Mikage asked the obvious in a doubtful manner.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Of course, why won’t it…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If he’s had a girlfriend before, then there’s a lot more to take into account. It might be that he’s not interested in romance, needs time to heal, etc. Besides…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Besides..?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“He might have someone he likes, but can’t confess, just like you are.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hm…I guess so. Not sure I’d like that.” Again, her tone didn’t match the meaning. Don’t you ought to feel anxious, even a little? Or was she just dense?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Think like this, it might be you. Each liked each other, but the other side didn’t know it. Double one-sided love.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Aah, that. That’s my first time hearing ‘double one-sided love’ though, but you have a point.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm, you don’t? That’s the trending romance genre nowadays though.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, work first.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shouldn’t you be happy? If that’s the case, when you confess, everything’s as good as resolved.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Optimistically, that may be the end of the case. And it wasn’t much of a stretch either, with Mikage-level, it was easy for Hibiki to fall for her. At least my judgment as the third party said so.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Umm… but I think, unfortunately, the chance’s slim.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“May I ask why?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“From our interactions. He didn’t even seem upset about moving away.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uh-huh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Pretty devastating for me though. Seeing him like that didn’t help, either.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I shouldn’t have asked.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I don’t mind, it’s within your rights”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm, sp this was the reason for her lack of confidence. If so, then this talk was necessary…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll say this clearly.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Go ahead.” Again with the unconcerned voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Now that I had been with expressive Shida, Mikage was different in every way. How can you be so calm!</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We have three weeks left until Hibiki leaves, during that time, it will be hard to improve your image. Understood?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“So…?” This time, as expected, Mikage stiffened a little.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ve known each other since childhood, your relationship has already been solidified to a certain extent too. You know him well and likewise. In short, there’s no much use in trying to appeal to him.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Worse, from what she said, Hibiki was a model, and was already busy as he was. Consequently, they didn’t get to see each other often. That lessened the opportunity for approaches.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’m sure that’s true. But still, I&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hn…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, confidence has nothing to do with the result of the confession. You might succeed even if you don’t think you will. No, you </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">will </span></i><span class="calibre17">succeed, that’s what my personal judgment says at least.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Thanks… Anything else?” As if she knew that I was going to continue.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ve thought a lot. However, in the end, the only thing I can do in your case is to encourage you to take the next step. We’ll find a good way to confess your feelings.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Right. Hm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Naturally, I did feel apologetic to her. The moment I knew about her time limit, I knew that I couldn’t give her a full consultation course.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Nonetheless, I felt that she made the right choice in coming to me. And I too, made the right choice of accepting her request. That might be selfish of me, but that was my genuine feelings.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“So…no getting around it, confessing head-on. And whether I can do that or not depends on my courage.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yes. Although I might not be able to help much…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“No, I’m the one who made absurd demands in the first place. It’s like what you’ve said, that’s the only way.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I ran out of things to say, but Mikage seemed to have a different idea.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?” I asked, still not believing the laughter from my earphones.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“haha. Sorry lots. But I think you shouldn’t have said that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Say, what if I got scared? Even the Angel of Kuze High told me there’s nothing to do, isn’t that something to be panicked about? Haha, really…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah… that’s how it is.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Wait, for that matter, aren’t you laughing way too much for someone who’s scared?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I get it that this is now too late to increase the chance of success, but other than that, you can talk to me any time. Better talk it out with me than getting cold feet there.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yep, yep. Roger.” She said after giggling, her breath still came in gasps.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, I’m being serious here…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ahh,” she yawned. “You’re so serious. I didn’t expect you’d do this much”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Likewise, I didn’t expect you’d be this laidback.” </span><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Heh? I’m not, though, I’m anxious in my own way.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Really…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, I had to admit it was a lot smoother and more helpful than the emotional ups and downs type, though.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahhhh～ I’m beat～”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I reached the rooftop, fell down, and cried out at the top of my lungs. Even so, my voice was sucked into the sky and faded away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Nonetheless, I felt the strain lifting, just a little.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just say it, what’s bothering you. You’ve been going on for quite a while,” saying such a heartless thing, Hiura shooed me away from the entrance. I rolled away, giving her space.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But she didn’t step away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“One, two, three!” she narrated the sharp slaps on my cheeks.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ow! Your nails, Hiura!</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I plead you to stop.&nbsp; I’m trying to recover my meager energy. Be considerate.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why should I? ‘Tis the Angel thingy anyway, right? Boring.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s not boring. And I’m in trouble, in many ways.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was the alternating days of talking with Shida and Mikage. Plus, I had also gone back to continue some of the consultations I paused during the Minato case.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yes, I had done multiple consultations at once before, it was, to a level, a normal occurrence. But what was not normal was the contents of consultations. This time around, there was a lot to think of and advance with delicacy. Now, it had reached a point that was beginning to overwhelm me both physically and mentally.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I was doing this because I wanted to, so there wasn’t much to complain about.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You just like meddling in others affairs.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm. Ah, or is it that you’re upset that I didn’t go with you yesterday? Hmm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shut up! I was just in the mood for arcade! And then you! Akashi!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yea, yeah, I’m terribly sorry. Forgive me, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Good grief, she’s upset. By the way, her sulking was cute.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura was generally haughty, but in fact, she couldn’t stand being alone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re going this time, right? The place in Kyoto&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There! Akashi-kun spotted!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With a feeling of deja vu, I turned.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujinami stood at the rooftop entrance, a little behind her was Minato. Exactly like the other day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, hey, how often do you plan to show up…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Good afternoon, Hiura-san. What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What else could it be? Lunch. We eat here almost every day.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmmm? Just the two of you? Where’s Miwa-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Reiji’s not in the mood today. He’s a fickle fellow.” Why’s her voice like that? Wait, you’re already eating, Hiura? Ah, she’s properly covering her mouth, well done.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We’ll fill in the gap&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Only then did I notice Minato. She stood as still as a statue behind Fujimiya, looking beyond tense.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Heh? A-ah! Nothing! Yup, I’m fine!” She shook her head sideways violently.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, if she insists.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what do you guys want? I thought I asked you two to keep our distance. I’m sorry, but please.” For good measure, I went to close the door.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry. But…”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya jumped in. “I don’t see a problem here? There’s no one here besides you, right?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That’s a valid point… but why were you so forceful, Fujimiya…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll allow it for today. What’s the matter, then?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s you, Akashi-kun, the key man behind our success. Don’t we ought to do something for you?” Fujimiya folded her hands behind her body and beamed. “What if we get you a present or something of sorts. We’re here to ask what you would like.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hehh…I’m not sure about that, I kind of messed up halfway, didn’t I?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm～? You did?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, I appreciate the sentiment, but…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I did. And didn’t tell you from the start that I don’t want anything?” I asked Minato.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-huh? N-no, this is separate…!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Suddenly, Minato gilded closer and looked at me with upturned eyes. Her usually sharp eyes were opened wide and wavering a little, like a pleading kitten. Seeing her face closely for the first time in a long while made me realize how beautiful she was.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I flinch involuntarily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uh… what’s it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m grateful for what you did. I thought we were f-friends… let me thank you,” she said, her voice fading little by little.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">W-why did she seem so desperate? In the first place, I wasn’t particularly helpful in getting rid of her Falling-in-Love Peculiarity…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, and, you see, the earphones… Y-yes, the earphones! Don’t I owe you that much?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh…? Well, at that time… It’s no big deal…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Awkward!&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura looked half amazed, and Fujimiya was starting to look creepy with that grin. Was she smiling like that the whole time?!</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This is bad, at this rate, if she talked about my powers…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If anything, let’s just accept her gift, no harm done.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Got it…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I accept your present, if that makes you feel better.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh… thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Are you okay…? Why are you thanking me for letting you buy me a present?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya appeared out of thin air. “Then it’s decided!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Saturday or Sunday, Akashi-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This week? But I have part-time and…” I glanced at Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yes, understood, Your Highness.” Yes, I do understand, so please don’t glare at me, Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato stepped up, no words sounded. Fujimiya quickly came to her rescue. “What’s that?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m afraid I have a little bit of an appointment. What about next week?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun and Hiura-san, you two are going somewhere together?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya’s wide eyes darted between me and Hiura alternatingly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She’s going shopping in Kyoto. I’m her escort.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not just any shopping, I’ll be having ‘the world’s strongest matcha gelato’” added Hiura protectively.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘The world’s richest matcha gelato’? You mean Nanaya?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: <a href="https://unborderedlife.com/nanaya-matcha-ice-cream-worlds-most-intense-green-tea-gelato/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre2 pcalibre">https://unborderedlife.com/nanaya-matcha-ice-cream-worlds-most-intense-green-tea-gelato/</a>]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You know?” Hiura’s eyes sparkled.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why wouldn’t I? It’s in Sanjo, right? I used to go there with Minato in middle school. Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She put her finger on her chin and nodded. “Yeah. Bring back memories, doesn’t it? Nanaya…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Right, these two were from Kyoto.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But, why do I know where this is headed…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s decided.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Decided.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uh, what’s decided?” I asked.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fujimiya and Yuzuki’s going with us. They’re locals, that will save time. The schedule’s for one day anyway.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“As you wish…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Uhh, you have a point, but shouldn’t you wait for my opinion first, Hiura-san? And you too, Fujimiya-san.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Nonetheless, it was true that neither me nor Hiura had been to that area. We might not so much as get lost, but having locals with us is all the better.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Also, it would be more cost-effective and time-saving if we could combine the present business with gelato trip. Two birds with one shot.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmmm, nice idea, after all. But won’t Hiura have to wait when we were shopping? But she didn’t seem to mind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Is it okay with you, Minato?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yep. And if it’s Kyoto, it’s unlikely we will see any one from Kuze High.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I see… so there wasn’t any reason to refuse.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While I talked with Minato, the other two had already gone on with the preparations.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then good. Fujimiya, here’s my LINE, take care of the group.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Leave it to me!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And why do they get along surprisingly well…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Io?” Minato tugged my sleeves. “You and Hiura-san go out like this often?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, maybe? Once in a while.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“O-oh…” Minato shrunk back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her long hair blocked her face, so I couldn’t see her expression.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Normal things, I guess. Ice cream, lunch… No, maybe only ice creams…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, what’s the ‘hmph’ for!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Aren’t you the one who asked?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By the way, have you decided the date for the confession?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I drank a mouthful from the glass that began to bead with condensation. My companion for today was Orangina.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The citrusy astringency and the refreshing fizz of the orange cider was just right for today’s mood. Orangina, in particular, had a perfectly adjusted sweetness and a slightly exotic fuzz that made me want to drink every once in a while. It was the silver lining of the carbonated world.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hmm… haven’t put in much thought” Like usual, she sounded unconcerned. “But you’re right, I need to look for days when he’s free from lectures and modeling. Seems that he’s getting busier by the day.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then quickly do so. It’d be all for nothing if you can’t find the timing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yeah, will do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Again, painfully suspicious nonchalance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Every one of my counselors were, to an extent, reluctant in following my words out of embarrassment and fear. Only in due time did I coax them to take action. That was because people generally fear that their relationship will change forever, </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">that</span></i><span class="calibre17"> was the natural reaction.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And yet, Mikage showed no signs. She didn’t seem to panic, get embarrassed, and more importantly, desperate. It wasn’t all bad. In fact, I was impressed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But what was unnatural was unnatural. I wonder if it was only because of her personality.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Angel. Down to earth please”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, ah…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I take it that you don’t doze out often. Maybe I shouldn’t have called.” She chuckled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I really wanted to say that it was your fault. Sigh…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage.” I pulled myself back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What would you do if Hibiki’s were to reject you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Perhaps sensing the change in my tone, Mikage kept her response cryptic.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I… I try not to think about it”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I understand, but try to.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was a topic that would normally make every one uneasy, including myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, Mikage breezed through the topic.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;”You never know until then, I think. I can’t say much for my future self, but I’m planning on accepting the answer, whatever it would be”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s optimistic…” In truth, it may even be the model answer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m just saying.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Go ahead.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You don’t have to give up this time.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I wonder what you mean?” her dubious voice came through the earphone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You have too limited time and opportunities to confess. We’ve talked about this before.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Right.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If he moves away, securing time with him will certainly be a hurdle and he might grow apart. You wanted to confess before it came to that and reestablish your relationship. I can understand that.” I picked up my glass again and sipped the Orangina. Listening carefully to the faint sound of bubbles popping, I slowly downed it. “On the other hand, that means I can’t give you my all before you can confess. Consequently, the result of your confession , strictly speaking, is only the result of the limited time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I waited for her to respond. None came, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That also means you haven’t done your best yet. This will be the window of opportunity to have his attention. It doesn’t end at the confession.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t have time.” That was what she said on the first day. But the truth was, there was no such thing as that. There was still plenty of time left</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s focus on how to convey your feelings properly. Even if you don’t make it this time, you will now have the opportunity to come clean, he’d have known where your feeling was by then, so you can make all the approaches you like. It’s a waste if you give up after only a month with me, don’t you think?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Right.” She pronounced slowly, as if unsure. For the first time today, I caught a flicker of emotion in her voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But don’t worry, I don’t think you’d fail. I was saying just in case.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I know.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, if you lack confidence, try thinking like I said. Oh, and sorry for babbling.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“No, I understand, you’re just doing what I asked you to. By the way, thanks, Angel.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was my turn to falter. “Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But if she understood what I wanted to say here, then the objective cleared.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I let out a long breath and adjusted my seat. A good pop sounded when I rolled my shoulders.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You’ve outdone yourself, y’know.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-huh… That’s just a part of being the Angel, sort of.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I blinked, calming down my beating heart. You’re Kuze Top Three, don’t throw around praises like that…!</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Then know that we appreciate what you do. At least I do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh… maybe not. Some didn’t end well, after all.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I saw the name list the other day.” her voice told me that was the end of the line.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, the list…” She was probably referring to the haphazard cluster of papers pinned to the bulletin board the day after the school broadcast.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Remembering the names filled me with unbidden happiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">Although couldn’t you guys be more discreet…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“The broadcast too, it was… amazing. If it’s you, then maybe I don’t have to worry any more, that’s what I thought.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A slight deja vu. It was the same line Shida said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, what set Mikage’s apart was the underlying bleakness, or even guilt.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What could it be&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“By the way, what should I say? Like the actual confession script, I’ve never confessed before.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm… Then let’s go over that, shall we?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I wanna practice with you in person tho.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Only if it’s absolutely necessary.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Whoops. I’m kidding. But you’ll do it if necessary?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What did I say about teasing me…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Later, we would go on with her confession script until late. During the process, the little oddity slipped my mind completely.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Our journey for matcha gelato began.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Here! Hiura-san, Akashi-kuuun!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Unlike the previous visit with Minato, our meeting place was at the underpass of Kyoto Station. When I and Hiura got down from our train, Fujinami called us.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yo.” Hiura held up her hand.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Were you waiting?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We’ve just had our lunch here, so no worries!” beamed Fujimiya, enigmatic as ever.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">By her side, Minato smiled a little and nodded. For some reason, though, her lips twitched a little.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Good morning…Io.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hi. Good to have you today.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yep…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hm? What’s with the dialogue? Awkward!</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Natural, I guess, this was the first time we got out together as friends. The last time was, after all, for the consultation.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I shook my head, but my feet got the better of me. I walked away from them a little, just where all of them can be seen in my frame of vision.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What a sight.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato was wearing a tight-fitting light blue knit with a high-waisted flare skirt. With bright floral emboss on the sides and a luxurious belt, it was a perfect combination of glamor and elegance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya was wearing a simple, cool white one piece, topped by a pink vest. The overall color was pale, but her red-rimmed glasses and camel bag accentuated the exquisite cuteness of her outfit.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura wore a loose-fitting white patterned shirt of three-quarter length and a moss green cap with a star motif. Her slender legs were made shown by the denim shorts and folded hem.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: There’s an illust later, so don’t worry if you don’t get the image.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And well… that might be too intent an observation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“They’re slaying it…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There was no denying. Minato, a Top Three, Plus Four’s Hiura, and the Plus Four candidate Fujimiya. The lineup of these three beautiful girls was simply glorious. They transcended such mundane things like types, tastes and vibe. They were manifestations of beauty. I wouldn’t be surprised if they were to have a halo.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’ve given them too little credit. I was pretty nervous last time, and that was one of them, let alone three…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I thought about disguises like last time, but Fujimiya shouted at me through LINE message, if such things can be done, it was terrifying.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura-san, your outfit’s cuuute!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She tugged the collar of her shirt. “Really? Just throw whatever looks comfy on.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She’s careless again. Hiura’s neckline and collarbone are out for the world to see…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, stop, stop! Akashi-kun’s watching!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">cough, cough</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi? Cut it off.” Hiura said in annoyance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Io?! You looked?!” For some reason, Minato sounded even more concerned than Hiura herself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I…” I’d be lying if I said I didn’t.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh! Why don’t we take a picture?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya’s not-so-obvious attempt to hold everyone together worked and we went to a wall with painting on it. It was the station’s iconic “Get on! Kyoto city subway.” advertisement.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi, crouch. Piggyback me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Here?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want to be taller than you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can I go stand next to Fujimiya? Surely you don’t&ndash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Piggyback.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She stood on tiptoes, trying to pull me down. Seeing no alternatives, I bend forward for her. She got on smoothly, her chin digging into my head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh, God. Childish.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fujimiya? We’re clear here.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh? Okay…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-hey! What are you doing, Io!” Again, Minato got mad at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What do you mean? I’m getting on him?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I bit my teeth, enduring the weight while they went on at it. Well, she wasn’t heavy, I was just weak.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Y-you can’t just ‘getting on him’! In front of…! Insolence!” It was Hiura’s idea, why are you pointing at me? Your sharp glare is also destructive, put it away please.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, but “insolence”, really? Are you a samurai?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Come to think of it, Minato and Fujimiya were still not Hiura-tolerant. “Ahh… don’t worry about it. She’s always like this. Ack… Heavy.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi, minus points.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘A-always’…” Minato echoed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato seemed to be in no small amount of culture shock. Fujimiya didn’t look better either.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura, her sense of personal space and a lotta things are wacky. To someone she’s comfortable with, that is.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura began to yank my cheeks. “‘A lot of things’? Hm? Spill it.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Stop, that hurts!</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And you welcome it?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hn? Noway eye an enchoying dis.” She pulled and folded my cheeks like how a baker would do to a dough. I let her, waiting for her to finish, then, “I’ve learned to give up. There’s no use.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-hmm… You’re so close…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Maybe. Or she just has a few screws loose.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But I don’t recall her doing this to Reiji, though. Or she was just picky about her prey? Or do I seem to be an easy prey?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, hurry up and take the picture. I don’t think Akashi could hold it any more.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yes, please kindly do so.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘K-kay. Get closer, will you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After that, we took a few pictures with Fujimiya’s amazing selfie skills. The images posted on the LINE group were gorgeous, thanks to the quality of the three girls and their aura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Also, one of the pictures had Minato glaring at me…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From the “Get on! Kyoto city subway.”, we got on the subway to Karasuma-Oike station. On the way, I was taken by the number of people getting on and off, Minato got dizzy and almost got lost at Shijo Station, Fujimiya showed me pictures of Nanaya. The journey was six minutes that seemed to be forever.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even if I include the time I took from Shiga, it was only sixteen minutes. Shiga was, after all, very close to Kyoto.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just like the old days?” Minato said to Fujimiya as we climbed the stairs.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I stole a look at her. She seemed to be lost in her own memories, while still maintaining a glint of expectation for nex memories. It was a look that could make any man dreamy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Your middle school’s around here?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, a little away from here. But Shiho and I’ve always hung out around here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Because you can find everything here!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya led the way as we walked east along the wide Oike Street. A little more until Nanaya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The whole town of Karasuma Oike was black, a chic Kyoto-esque design. The sidewalks are paved with tiles, and the wide, multi-lane roadways stretch straight across the street.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The buildings were all squat things, as if cut from the Edo-period. The blue sky was in contrast with the dark and somber buildings. The trees planted in equal intervals helped create an illusion of space in the tight-packed former capital.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You know, elegance is almost the law for buildings. We don’t even have flashy billboards in the old town district.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, so that’s why the McDonald’s sign was black?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While my chatter about the cityscape with Fujimiya went on, Hiura, who was, by nature, uninterested in architecture and history, was listening intently to Minato’s review of each flavor. Minato too, was unexpectedly enthusiastic, showing pictures at appalling speed, making wide hand gestures.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, the seventh’s good?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That depends. It’s not that sweet, just pure, thick matcha.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then the sweet ones?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Until the fourth are the sweet ones. The go-to is third, so you might want to try that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, third. And there’s more than matcha, right?” Hiura peeked at Minato’s phone with apparent annoyance.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Because of the height difference, I might have thought of them as sisters.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On a side note, Hiura had quite a sweet tooth. She was a sucker for ice cream, cakes, and every sweet.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hojicha’s good, strawberry and milk are passable. But Nanaya’s known for tea, so better keep it to that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You have a sound reasoning, I will adopt your approach.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why so puffed-up?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It doesn’t matter.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Isn’t that my line??”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm…they’re settling along well. As her guardian, I could say I’m proud of my daughter.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fufu, Minato’s enjoying herself.” said Fujimiya with the relief of parents. “As you can see, she’s not good at socializing. I was worried.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Same goes for Hiura. She either likes or hates you outright. I never imagined she would invite you guys.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura who never showed any special treatment, and Minato who only had Fujimiya. I wondered how it would play out, but it seemed that Minato’s coolness was just right for the brash Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In retrospect, weren’t they made for each other?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She turned her face back to me. “Not an easy job having a problem child, eh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Easy is an understatement.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oof, that much?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Also, Fujimiya sure had guts. No one in their right mind would call Hiura “problem child”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This is a little surreal, actually. I thought Hiura-san would be a little more…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“More of a ruffian? I can assure you she is.” The only ones holding her leash were probably me and Reiji. “But I can say that she’s reliable when it counts. She helped a lot last time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm” Fujimiya had a sly grin. Her eyes narrowed, as if seeing what I can’t. She leaned in and whispered. “You like her? Hiura-san.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, if you’re asking about romantic ‘like’.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh? Hmm, I see… That’s how it is…” She dropped her tempo all at once.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You think I do?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Half-half. I was more or less expecting that answer. And if you do, then your body language will tell me anyway.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, I was used to being asked that. Mostly by Yukito, by Yukito, and sometimes by Yukito.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, nothing at all?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, not at all.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ooooh, ‘Not at all’” This time, she had an exaggerated amusement. Before her expression began to darken. “But Hiura-san’s&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashiii.” A voice drawled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My left arm was suddenly yanked. I struggled a little for balance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura…” Not much to my surprise, I no longer felt exasperated. “I said stop doing that. I can fall, you know?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ll have a double scoop?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then listen to my plan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘Plan’? You didn’t even listen to my complaints.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From there, I humored Hiura’s plan with occasional grunts until we got to Nanaya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoa&mdash;!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the first floor of an apartment building in the middle of a residential area, there was a sign for Nanaya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Passing through the curtain with “七”&mdash; the number seven, the ice cream counter was in front of us. In the glass-walled freezer case, there were a dozen flavors of ice cream lined up in two rows.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, half of them are green tea flavored, though.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I patted Hiura on the head, who was romping excitedly, and looked at the sign nearby. I ran through the lists of flavors and their prices.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll have sesame and the fifth. Minato?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Seventh and a strawberry. I don’t want to get rid of Gyokuro tea, though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm, that’s a good combo of sweet and bitter.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Beside the two experienced professionals, Hiura and I groaned simultaneously.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Which one to eat&mdash;no, which one to give up, that was the question. The green tea flavors, from one to seven, were arranged by ascending thickness. It was nothing short of the name “Nanaya”, the store was indeed obsessed with green tea.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll have triple.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What a coincidence, me too.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Third, Hojicha, and milk. You get something other than that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But I want the third…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura didn’t bulge, so I had to go with fourth. She had a sweet tooth, so I’ll let her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And then…</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you for your patronage～”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With a pleasant Kyoto dialect call behind us, we left the store with our ice cream.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In the end, I decided on fourth, Hojicha, and chocolate. I had a hard time choosing, but I was confident this was the ultimate balance. The brightly colored ice creams looked so perfect I had doubts about eating them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya snapped another picture of me and Hiura itching to eat. As expected of a selfie expert, she was skillful.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Our next destination was already decided, so we went on leisurely.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Delish&mdash;!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura, keep it down.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Delish&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Can you say anything other than that?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But the truth was, I knew exactly how she felt. “Delicious…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not only the tea flavors, but all of them were extremely good. For one, it was thick, the strong aroma and the kick of every bite. The aftertaste was refreshing too. It was as if it was a food of gods.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The taste never changes.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yaa, I wish there’s one in Shiga.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hurry up, set up one in Shiga, I’ll allow it,” muttered Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, here it is, Hiura-sama’s permission. Please, open one already.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato, give me the seventh, trade with my sesame.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“”Kay, here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With the fluidity of comrades, they quickly shared half of their flavors.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi, we’re doing it too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, okay…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Trade, the crystallization of human wisdom and rationale. And it was the very thing Hiura said earlier, our strategy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We followed the other two’s example and scooped the ice cream. Yes, for this reason, we both got three different flavors. With this, we have obtained six flavors each.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What a genius.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hoh? The fourth’s really more bitter than the third! Still delicious!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah. The third’s sweet… I don’t think anything will top Hojicha, though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This was beyond satisfactory…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Unlike Hiura, I wasn’t fond of ice creams, but this was something I could get used to.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun, Hiura-san, you’re trading…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya suddenly whipped around and asked incredulously while Minato just froze.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What’s happening…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We are. Top stratagem, right?” Hiura sniggered proudly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She dug another spoon of my chocolate. Hey, let me have my Hojicha.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s… indirect kiss, right? No, it’s an indirect kiss.” Fujimiya’s smile became a plastered one.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato’s eyes hooded as she slurred, “Insolence.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There’s the samurai again.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But, indirect kiss? No, well, it is, but…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, that. Haven’t thought about it. Do you, Akashi?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh? Uh… at first. You did it so naturally, it feels idiotic if I’m the only one minding…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Whatever the reason, the rate at which she stole my drinks and sweets threw me off balance.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I mean, you girls are going to, no?” Hiura began to shift the blame.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Surprisingly, Minato stood up, “We’re women?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, double standard? Aren’t your grades the fourth place in our year? That doesn’t sound logical.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not everything needs to be equal. You’re the Illogical one here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Whoa… Minato’s not holding back. And a match with Hiura to add… Well, she just slapped Yamabuki a few weeks back, this much should be expected.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Scensot__.jpg" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, okay… I get it, but can you be a little more self aware?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Of what?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Of your insolence.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Um, why the obsession with “insolence”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uhhh, let’s eat before the ice cream melts…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujinami clapped my shoulder. “Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiiiee! My pardon!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura, Fujinami, Minato, I’m surrounded by scary women…</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After that, we walked southward to the big intersection of Sanjo-Kawaramachi and took the rooted sidewalk.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Unlike Karasuma-Oike at the beginning, this area is a shopping district and quite crowded. The human density was enough to run into people if we didn’t pay enough attention.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I let Hiura and Fujimiya take the lead and fell back with Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s crowded… is it always like this?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s weekend. It’s probably the most crowded place in Kyoto.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see. …… I’m starting to miss Shiga.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The only time people come to Shiga is for the summer fireworks display…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Kya!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We squeezed through a rather narrow street, and when we pulled out, Minato bumped into an office woman. I quickly grabbed Minato’s hand and pulled her to the side of the road. We both leaned against the roadway fence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The office woman disappeared into the crowd without a trace.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That was… Hey, are you okay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“A-ah, I’m fine. Sorry”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The lady should be apologizing, not you. I think she was walking on her phone.” Typical city people…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Um, Io…? Your hand.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? Ah, sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I quickly snuck my hand into the jeans pocket. Minato averted her eyes. Her white cheeks turned peach pink. She sent me darting sideways glances and said nothing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I, who didn’t think anything of it until then, felt increasingly embarrassed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That… felt different from the few other times I had touched her hands.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato, Akashi-kun. Hurry up&mdash;!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Looking back, Fujimiya and Hiura were already at the other side of the mass of the pedestrians.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s go.” We nodded to each other once and then followed Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Insteading of walking side by side, I drove through the crowd like a wedge, clearing the way for Minato. And so that she wouldn’t see my blushing face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, here you are. What happened?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“N-nothing. Someone bumped into me…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We walked a little more past the UNIQLO on the first three floors and reached our destination, the LOFT. Rechecking its signature yellow sign, we went in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">LOFT was a chainstore that mainly sells household goods. Although most of its stores were concentrated in the Kanto and urban areas, it was a popular store with a solid nationwide presence, or so said the internet. Afterall, it was my first time.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Also, why there’s one in Nara, but not in Shiga? Shiga is better than Nara… Really, Shiga is better.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN:The author’s Shiga-obsession again…]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Our procession abruptly stopped at the first intersection of the store. “Akashi-kun, is there any specific thing you’d like?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope… Anything would do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, as someone who did part-time I had the money to buy things I wanted immediately…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nevermind, we can take a walk.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah, I want new stationeries too,” chimed Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Also, Hiura had been looking bored since a while ago, but she hadn’t said anything. Look at how mature she had become.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then! The store’s pretty large, let’s split up! I’ll go with Hiura-san～”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We took turns in gaping at Fujimiya’s proposal.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Before anyone could say a thing, she immediately took Hiura’s hand and forcibly hauled her away. In front of the escalator that went up to another LOFT floor, Fujimiya bowed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now then, good hunting!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We watched in awe as they slowly ascended the escalator.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Phew…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As headstrong as ever…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I could see her reason. Hiura herself was already almost bored to death.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I finally realized we should move. “Should we go too…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Probably,” replied Minato.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato and I took turns checking out the shelves. Office products, miscellaneous decorations and mysterious items.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In the end, each and every one of them was so interesting I couldn’t decide what to have. If I had brought more money, I would have a cart full of goods.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, a nice shark”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Without any specific thought, I jogged up to it. It was a pair of pink shark-shaped slippers. The design made it look like it was biting the wearer’s foot.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You like it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not me, Riku does…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, I haven’t told her about Riku.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Riku…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Huh, Minato, why are you glaring at me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“My younger sister. Shark’s her favorite”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Especially shark slippers. It looked alike to the ones she talked about earlier.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah…Sister. You have a sister? She likes sharks?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She’s in middle school, third year. Right in the middle of the rebellious phase, as her brother, I… I’m no longer needed by her…” I mumbled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Y-you’re the big brother…? That’s unexpected…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t look like one? I’ve been the big brother for fifteen years.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You don’t look like one…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph, a true veteran brother can disguise people’s deception! Like how a master assassin can blend with the surroundings, a true bro is the same.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s the reference…” deadpanned Minato</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then, should I buy this…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll see if it’s what she wants. Wait a sec.” I flicked open the phone and sent the picture to Riku.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While waiting for her reply, we went over more miscellaneous goods. This time, I tried to find what I actually liked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s this?” She held up an oddly shaped glass in her hand, inside, colored feathers slowly twirled. A sort of snowglobe?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, by the way, Minato.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her shoulders jumped, almost dropping the glass.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Y-yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The rumors, do you still hear any?” By now, those who owe me should have toned it down. But I thought I should check just in case. “I don’t hear any, but I thought I should ask.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, that. I haven’t heard a thing since then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, glad to hear that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Good, I don’t think I want to see Minato being utterly helpless ever again. I expect better from you, my fellow Kuze High students.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s no such thing as completely gone with rumors. Let’s appreciate that I got past it, yeah?” she smiled warmly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then… What about the people around you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“They’re leaving me alone, alright, but that’s what I want. I wouldn’t feel comfortable if they try to make up with me or something.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re amazing, holding up like that.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I-it’s not me… I know you’d be there…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If she’s doing fine at school then that’s a consolation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It might not be none of my business, but…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If there’s anything I can do to help, please let me know.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was as if her gaze increased its intensity tenfold. On the other hand, she seemed to be on the verge of tears.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">“You said it… that you’d be by my side. Then, why can’t I do the same for you?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">For some reason, my mind dug up that specific memory. The day I went to her apartment and bargained with her with Ayaha’s story.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay. Understood.” Not so soothly, I accepted her goodwill.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We stayed like that a little longer, waiting for the other side to say something. Finally, strength drained from Minato and she shook her head feebly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“S-sorry, I shouldn’t have brought this up right now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I mutely shook my head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We carefully resumed checking the shelves. The giddy atmosphere persisted, But I found it not so bad, after all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What was she thinking? For sure, I could never know, not that I could ask her either.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Whatever it would be, if it comes to this girl, then I think I could trust her with it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So ‘anything’ from back then still lives?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph.” She poked me lightly.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m home”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The front door clicked closed. No response.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The living room was empty, but the bathroom was occupied, probably Riku. It should be a while before dad could come home.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I sat down on the couch, unloading the gifts they had brought for me. A tall stainless steel tumbler with a dull, deep blue painting. The “soft drink friendly” tag immediately caught my eye. The steel was silky and luxurious. Looking at it again, I couldn’t help but grin.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It is insulated, so you can keep soda in it for quite some time. Also, the tumbler doesn’t form condensation,” Minato had said after reading the tag.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Looking back, the condensation that clung to the glass usually soaked my table, and the drink got lukewarm pretty fast at room temperature. If the tag’s claim was true, then this tumbler would see some heavy use.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I immediately rinsed out the tumbler and filled it with the cola in the fridge.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoa…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Just pouring in the cola got me hyped. This was just great.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why hadn’t I bought it before? Why?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I jovially grab the tumbler and head upstairs. But before I could enter my room, I remember the bag that looped on my right arm.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I hooked the bag on the doorknob of Riku’s room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I fell on the bed. My body was heavy from the fatigue of walking around all day. I had no Angel session today, so a bath and I would probably go to sleep…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A few moments later, the thumping of someone climbing the stairs could be heard.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Kyaa&ndash;!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A scream.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Cute ─────!!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Another scream. Hey, you’re disturbing the neighbors.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then silence, before the door opened and Riku, who had a towel wrapped around her head, poked her face inside.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yo, I’m home.” I said my belated greeting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“W-welcome back.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks for the slippers…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Good manners.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ugh…You’re not supposed to…”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Riku bit her lip in frustration and pulled her face back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm, still rebellious.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Onii-chan</span></i><span class="calibre17">?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmp?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Did she just call me “</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Onii-chan” </span></i><span class="calibre17">?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How are you doing lately?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Lately?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fine. Not bad.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, okay…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Riku then disappeared.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After listening to the sound of footsteps moving away, the cry continued, “Cute ──────!!!”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ayahamark-e1668329375345.png" alt="" class="01" />

<p style="text-align:center;"><b class="calibre16">Minato Interlude</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato, what do you think?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Sternly, she brought up the topic while pouring milk into her coffee.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We were at an eat-in cafe near Shiho’s house. It was probably the best place to stop by after school and have a chat. The design, the price, everything.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“About what?” I asked back, and then took a bite of the soufflé cake that came with the drink.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">White patterns trailed in the glass as Shiho’s straw stirred.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She wasn’t the type to put syrup in her coffee.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“About Hiura-san”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ngh..!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Almost choked on cake, I covered my mouth in panic, the other hand reaching for the hot milk tea to slosh it down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re deliberately trying to surprise me,” It was more of a fact than an accusation, knowing Shiho.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What? Why is it so surprising?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shiho. I’m getting mad.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiii. Ehehe, sorry, sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You don’t look guilty at all…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I sighed for her to hear</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, they’re very close,” she stated.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Body touching… they’re even used to indirect kisses.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura Aki-san.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She had once helped me with the little scuffle in the gym. She was a strange person, but cute nonetheless. Same class as Io, a good friend of his…</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[TN: See the vol 1 Minato-Yamabuki match for the gym incident]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“They’re close, that’s it. Why do I have to concern myself?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, you’re acting strong.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I-I’m not! I…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I don’t have a right to say in his relationship. With the past Kyoto trip, one thing was clear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I still didn’t know him at all.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I didn’t know he had a sister, or how he was like with his actual friends. Up until now, it was him helping me with my problems. Just because he told me his past didn’t mean I would suddenly become close to him.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Didn’t I say? I don’t know…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But when you figure things out, it might be too late, you know? Early bird gets the worm.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s less than a week left, why haven’t you studied for midterm yet, then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wow. Souffle cake is so delicious.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So she can run away like that when the conversation gets ugly. What a sly girl.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, you’re not curious about her?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m not…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, is that so?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The truth was, I do. I tried not to, but there was no helping it. But I was really trying not to, so that doesn’t count as a lie.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Umm, I’ve asked if Io like Hiura-san or not. But it seems that you’re not interested…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?” My heart dropped.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What did he answer, naturally, I was curious about that. However, another thought preceded that; Shiho didn’t know about Ayaha-san, what if she asked inappropriately…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What did he say?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fufu, now you wanna know?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shiho.” This was no time for jokes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hn? Minato?” Shiho instantly mirrored my straight face and blinked several times.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Misinterpreting my concern, she dissolved into a warm smile. “They’re totally friends, that’s what he said.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How was he like when saying that?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? Hmm, he seemed uninterested, no surprise, no embarrassment, surprisingly so.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was terribly relieved by Shiho’s affirmation. Perhaps the “Who do you like” question was common enough it didn’t remind him of his past. Maybe that was an unnecessary concern.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But I didn’t get to question Hiura-san, though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I appreciate your concern, but next time, don’t.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ehh～ Yessir, will do.” Contrary to her words, she didn’t look the slightest bit satisfied. Although she would still adhere to my request until the end. That was who she was and why I love her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah… Mikage-san.” Shiho gestured to the cafe entrance. The name hooked my attention. “Her house’s around here, it seems. I saw her here often too,” she added.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She bent down by the display shelf and scrutinized the sandwiches. Her hair bobbed as she swung her head up and down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shiga Prefecture, a dingy cafe in a train station. Even in a place like here, her presence made it as exquisite as any fairytale setting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, cute. Nothing short of Kuze’s Top. Our Minato’s better, though,” As if she was a beauty pageant judge, Shiho muttered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Stop it. And on what basis are you judging her?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By how close we are!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You can’t let me win only because I’m your best friend…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Idly, I stare at Mikage-san’s profile.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Did she get a consultation with the Angel? What was her reason to do so? I could have easily asked Io about them, but I still couldn’t bring myself to. My conflicting feelings compelled me to do both things at once.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But one thing, she was earnest. Her image overlapped with when I cornered Io a while ago. Also, she’s&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She’s amazing…” After seeing her off, Shiho whispered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I had talked with her once, I was spellbound. My heart was pounding… If I was a boy…!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That, I could agree on. Otherworldly atmosphere, the smoothly changing facial expressions, and that look…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Talking with her was like a dream.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah!!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A customer receiving a tray tripped over a signboard and lost his balance. A loud </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">clang </span></i><span class="calibre17">followed. Coffee burst from the broken cup, pieces scattered in all directions.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What should I do? Let it to the waiter? Would a handkerchief do any good? Do I have a tissue?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, my hesitation soon became meaningless.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Are you all right?” Mikage-san had returned to the store.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Contrary to the horrified customer, Mikage-san took out a handkerchief and even a hand towel. She immediately began collecting the shattered pieces. Before the panicked waiter would come, she had already begun wiping the floor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her white towel was stained coffee-brown, her clothes stained a little, too.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sir, are you hurt?” asked the waiter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Um! Thank you very much…!” thanked the waiter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No worries. Good thing I wasn’t that far.” she bobbed her head politely before leaving the store for the second time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Cooly, without frustration, without asking for return, she walked away. If it was me, I’d have felt incredibly flattered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s… just like her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah, amazing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Of all people to help, she was the furthest from the scene, yet she was the first one to jump in.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, talk about popular people. Not just the boys, she’s taking the hearts of girls like us too,” complained Shiho.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I know, she’s the ideal samaritan.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Although she refused every confession though, having someone she liked already.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Someone she liked… surely, that was what the letter to the Angel was about. If so, then, take care of her, Io.</span></p>
