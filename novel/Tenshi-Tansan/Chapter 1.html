<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; When the Secret was Found Out</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Work mode: on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Voice changer: on, camera: off. Call quality: good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Consultant, Makino Kousuke. Second year, class seven. Consultation period: four months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the dark room, I said into the microphone in front of the PC screen after clearing my throat.</span></p>

<p>“Well, It’s time.”</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My voice would be replaced by an artificial one, my gender unidentifiable. So no matter with how much authority I speak, the other side would only hear an idiotic monotone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“U-Uh, you know…” said the other side of the phone after a pause. The voice was unaltered Makino’s, he had no need for a voice changer any way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I know. You were unsure about this. Good grief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;”A-after all, isn’t that impossible…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still not confident?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“I mean… Me, with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Urgh–, really? What a wuss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">do</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> understand how that feels. Painfully well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if you stop now, it would be all for nothing. I’m sure that was not what you wanted either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You two had no zero contact in the first place, but now you have come to be able to talk to her regularly. I’m sure it’ll be fine,” I used a soothing tone, knowing it would be pointless anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“B-But…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shallow relationship with target: resolved. Low self-confidence: unresolved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem was, changing someone’s fundamental personality is never easy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just once. Just for one day, just a leap of faith, then all would end well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Besides… Didn’t Yuzuki-san turn down every confession? She must have had a boyfriend or someone she likes. If that’s so, wouldn’t that mean trouble?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Justification for stalling. Subconscious self-preservation. Why must I look after every single one of them?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Didn’t you already know that giving up is unacceptable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So if she already has someone she likes, then you would give up?” I pressed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“T-that’s…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want to give up, then there’s nothing I can do. If not, don’t you remember how hard you have worked? I’m sure it will turn out fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“But…”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No good. He’s totally freaked out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this situation, being forceful is counterproductive. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I’ll just have to do “that”&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood. Can you give me some time, then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Eh? W-what are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll find out whether Yuzuki has a boyfriend or someone she likes, and also why she rejected every confession so far, if possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Really?! You can?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, hey. Why are you cheery all of the sudden? Just how greedy could you be?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just don’t get your hopes up. There&#8217;s a limit to my investigations, just so you know.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Oh, of course! I’m sorry that you have to do this for me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, I already knew it would come to this since the start. It&#8217;s part of the job.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, you wouldn’t step up to the plate if I don’t destroy your escape route like this. That, I didn’t say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“&#8230;Hey.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“After all, why don’t you tell me your identity? You’re a student here, aren’t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily narrowed my eyes. Well, there was nothing wrong with that. It’s natural to be curious.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that’s against the rules, Makino.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s by absolute necessity, I would. But now’s not the time. Please understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“B-but! You have helped me out so much, I just want to thank you personally.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makino”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Y-yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your confession, hope it turns out well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“Yeah”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s it for today. I&#8217;ll call you again when I know something.”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;“‘Kay… Thanks, Angel.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that, I hung up, then removed my earphones. After confirming Makino’s disconnected, I logged out of the chat room as well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s a limit to my investigations,” I had said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to me, that was different. For me, there is no such limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a sip of the cold cola, crossed my arms, then closed my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well then, let’s go through the plan one more time.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Kuzeyama High School, there is an angel who will lead your way to love. It has been about a year since such a rumor started to circulate at the school I, Akashi Io, attend. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here’s the gist of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, a person troubled by love suddenly received a letter from the Cupid of love. The Cupid has a supernatural power, if the person followed the Cupid’s words, then their love would bear fruit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An utter nonsense. This unrealistic story should be no more than a made up story. It is natural to think so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To begin with, this kind of urban legend was long out of fashion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the development of the internet and science, these kinds of stories are extinct. Ghost stories, the Seven wonders, psychic powers and so on. Those were all bullshit, no one takes them seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Probatio Diabolica. You can’t prove something that’s impossible, that in itself, is also impossible. Although there are some people who muse the idea “It would be interesting if it exists,” despite everything. But just that.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Just google Probatio Diabolica, I don’t think I’m capable of a brief explanation]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why Angel doesn’t exist, letters won’t come. There is no such thing as mysterious power. It’s only natural.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–But if that’s the case, then why has this rumor survived an entire year?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was it because Kuze High students were a bunch of dreamy kids? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, high school students nowadays are not that stupid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, Kuzeyama High School is one of the top preparatory schools of Shiga Prefecture. Students here are realistic and mature.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, why?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The answer is quite simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, the students were dispersed into two main groups, one going to their respective club and the other heading home.</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unceremoniously grabbed my bag and quickly left the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, I don&#8217;t have that many friends to stop me. I’m not unimpressive nor shadowy, but neither do I stand out in a crowd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And such a position is convenient for me in many ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reaching the front gate, adjacent to the shoe box, I fiddled with my phone while waiting for the moment to come. Just like a police on a stakeout.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here and there, students from the go home club came and went, only stopping to change their shoes here. I kept my face down, searching for the “target” with only my eyes.</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…No</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… how could I miss.” Seeing her, I couldn’t help but shudder in admiration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki Minato is a beautiful girl. Damn beautiful. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has deep, glossy, straight hair, and as black as the night sky itself. Her eyes are as sharp as an icicle. In combo with her voluminous eyelashes, her eyes have an exquisite charm. Her eyes, her proud yet delicate nose, and her small pink lips are in perfect harmony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To add, she is tall for a girl, maybe ten centimeters shorter than me. Despite her height, she has well-defined curves throughout her body. Especially the convexity of her chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And lastly, her piece de resistance, her otherworldly elegance.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How she carried her back high, her skin a white crystal. And her forever melancholy, mature expression. Even in an ordinary school uniform, she reminded me of a high-born lady.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/lwlzza3pgaa81.webp"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I might have praised her too much. What a creep, Io. But Yuzuki’s appearance is just perfect. I could imagine the smug look on the face of the god who created her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What an unfair god. Thank you very much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, her grades were top of the class, that was truly amazing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, she is also very popular with men. She is also one of the “Kuze High’s Top Three”, the official ranking by the student body. Just imagine, “Kuze High’s Top Three”. You know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Then she walked her way to me– more precisely, towards her shoe box, which is right next to me. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No time to gawk. Let’s get to work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki came close, almost shoulder to shoulder with me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clack, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">her shoe hit the floor. The moment she bent down to change her shoes, I lowered my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The power to know who the target likes by touching their cheeks, that’s the power I, the Angel of Kuze High, possesses.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this power, I lead my consultant’s love towards a surer and more successful conclusion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did the Kuze High students believe this ridiculous rumor?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, because it is actually happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how unrealistic, the Angel does indeed exist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why the rumor stuck around. It’s that simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Timing perfect, my hand brushed Yuzuki’s cheek, just for a moment, but that was enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just according to the plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a soft touch on the back of my left hand. Contact initiated. The contact was no more than an unintentional brush, unaccountable for sexual harassment. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can’t you believe me? It is unavoidable, since it was the trigger condition of my power, so I’m innocent, you know. </span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the target likes someone, then I will see their face in my mind, like a flashback. I won’t get tired nor be in pain. But I&#8217;m only nervous from time to time. It’s something I have gotten used to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugeh?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m terribly dizzy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if the world suddenly turned upside down, then back to normal again. At the same time, a torrent of flashbacks hit me. What should normally be a single image, a few at most, floated in and out of view. Dazzling, too many, like a climatic firework display.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Familiar faces, unfamiliar ones. Total of twenty…? No, even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s this? What the hell?!–</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Urgh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like expecting a ping pong ball, but only found a bowling ball thrown at my face instead. My head buckled, my body shook, I felt like throwing up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, calm down. Get a grip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The plan was now completely awry. I was to apologize, and be on my way. Just a normal accident where my hand happened to graze her cheek, nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the plan…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While trying to stand upright, I forced myself to sort out the situation. However, it seems that I don’t have that luxury.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides me, Yuzuki asked, her face suspicious. Well, it is only natural, I suddenly screamed and staggered, after all. That irregularity is something I should be concerned about, but right now, getting no unwanted attention from Yuzuki is top priority.</span></p>l


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How to cover this up? For now, I need to run.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah… Well, I suddenly have a stomach pain… Ahaha…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at her face. I had expected a dumbfounded look, troubled look, or even a boubtful look, anything but–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, her eyes suddenly widened in surprise. As if she had unexpectedly found something she had lost, her face was like that, a mixture of surprise and relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would she make that kind of expression…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that too, I have no time to find out. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shoved my feet into my shoes and hurried out the front gate. Like that, I ran to the station and hopped on the Keihan Line train. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I had slipped up. The other passengers eyed me warily. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I had a stomach ache, it would be more natural to go back to the school building, you idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, my head wasn’t working at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh…” Just what exactly is going on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled what happened while trying to calm myself down with the rhythm of the train.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

n style="font-weight: 400">The class on the following day was harder to get my head around than usual. Listening to the Japanese history teacher&#8217;s chant-like voice, I ran through my thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are two questions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One, was of course, there were too many people who appeared. Normally, there’s one. Even the irregularities have two to three, that’s it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, that twenty people… to be exact, more than that. I don’t want to criticize other people’s romantic preference, but isn’t that too much?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, Maybe I should question my power first. Maybe something resembling a bug happened. Is that possible? Given that loss of smell during a cold is possible, perhaps…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nope”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, from birth until now, there has never been something like this. I couldn’t guess in the slightest. Even when I tested with some people in the class, nothing unusual happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, nothing was wrong with my power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mentioned in the conversation with Makino two days before, Yuzuki has turned down every confession until now. In fact, it was this rigid wall that had doubled her popularity. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For her to like that many people…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strangest was one of the faces I saw.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost all of those faces were gone before I could memorize. It was unexpected, to begin with. But I recognized one of them: Matsumoto from class five.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some time ago, he confessed to Yuzuki, and she rejected his confession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That means Yuzuki rejected Matsumoto even though they both have feelings for each other. Of course, there’s a possibility that she started to like him after rejecting… But that doesn’t seem to add up.</span></p>
<p>[TN: I&#8217;m sorry for this interruption, but please read this at Travis translations to support me, the translator. Other sites are aggressor sites]</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… What a mystery.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this what you call mysterious beauty? As expected from that level of beauty… Wait, no.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The saving grace was that this mystery has nothing to do with me. It’s her romantic preferences, not my business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only problem is how to tell Makino about this. That’s the only question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But yet…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s all for today. Class rep., bowing ritual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the teacher’s words, the chime rang, marking the end of the school day. After bowing, the class was over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly left the class, continuing my thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s still one more question:</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is, the look on her face yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither confunfused nor bewildered, just excitement and relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s not talk about how that face was also beautiful…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–Why did she make that expression?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akashi Io-kun.” My name was suddenly called from the corner of the school gate. The voice was clear and cold, but stringed with amusement. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before me, Yuzuki stood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I finally found you, the Angel of Kuze High,” she declared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? What are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reply was immediate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken by surprise, no doubt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I have already rehearsed what to do in this kind of situation a thousand times over. As long as my identity remains a secret, I can deny it reflexively and naturally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why I was suspected or why I was approached. From where to when, since yesterday, nothing makes sense. Whatever, I’m starting to get tired of this. But I needed to get out of here without an incident first.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Keep your head cool and get through this, Io.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop coming for me with that weird reason, will you? I have something I need to get done, bye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By touching my face, what do you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I was completely at loss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Farewell, my calm self. Even I can see the grimace on my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh- what? Don’t–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The people I like.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“–––!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cold sweat broke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can tell that by touching?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Give me a break.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:Yeah, give this poor man a break]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to ask you something,” said Yuzuki, as if dealing the finishing blow. She turned and walked away briskly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave up and silently followed her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A short walk East from Kuze High leads to a large park. The park surrounds ruins of a castle, along the promenade lined with cherry blossoms, painting the scene with diluted red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Yuzuki on the lead, we walked past a space with large playground equipment. At last, we reached the largest lake in Japan, Lake Biwa. We walked to the grassy knoll by the lake and sat down on a nice boulder we found.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see the little kids playing and the old couple on the bench looking at us. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So… here? We stand out here, really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a funky sight, with me and Yuzuki facing each other. But despite that, against the dusk sky and the glittering lake, Yuzuki was otherworldly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The concern is about anyone listening to our conversation, which these waves had already taken care of.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” Yup, her logic did make sense. In the worst possible case, there might be a rumor that I tried to confess to her and got rejected. Which is unrelated to the Angel, so whatever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it starts to get out of control, I’ll take care of it. How about that?” she continued</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… Well, okay.” I nodded. There’s no need for that, but if she insists. I’ll just nod along here. I’m in a weaker position. No use in worsening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the atmosphere is somewhat different from what I thought. I had expected blackmail, but… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That you came here with me, I take it that you have already accepted it?” Yuzuki was unexpectedly nervous, her expression rather tense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm, so straight to the point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coming to think of it, this is the first time I’m talking to her. She appeared calm and collected, with an air of intellectualism about her. As expected from a top student. Well, she is beauti–, (redacted)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “No, not like that. I’m here for what you have to say, so I can clear your misunderstanding,” I denied.</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Half lie, half truth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That I’m the Angel, and even about my power, I can’t just let her go. Somehow, I need to convince her. But the situation was undeniably unfavorable. You could say that she has a hold on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite her advantage, she was quite reserved… that’s strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“October, last year,” she began.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said like a detective unveiling the truth behind a horror mystery. No, seriously, it&#8217;s too scary. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nagao-kun from the ping-pong club confessed to Yamabuki. He was rejected. Remember?” At her words, those days started playing at the back of my mind. Yeah, that rejection was Angel’s– my fault. “Nagao-kun wasn’t into the careful type, nor the flamboyant type of girl. He set his sights on the fashionable, popular Yamabuki. They don’t match in the slightest. She would surely reject him. A daredevil. When someone heard the rumors, these were their thoughts, is that right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh-huh.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, she’s right.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Nagao did his best. He believed in my words, and he had the courage to tell Yamabuki how he felt. Being rejected is just the result.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But why this story now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Only if he believed in the Angel’s word,’ some people joked. ‘If he did that, it would have gone well, what a reckless fellow.’. But I thought–” She looked at me “–That Nagao-kun was able to confess, that was because of the Angel, wasn’t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A chill ran down my spine. How do I refute her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From then, I observed Nagao-kun’s surroundings for a while. Were there any changes? How did he contact the Angel? I needed to find out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if someone was tightening their hand around my heart, my breath became shallow, my face a painful grimace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So this is how culprits in mysteries felt…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet her expression doesn’t look like a detective who had cornered the criminal.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That day, Nagao-kun walked past a boy in the hallway. That boy was in a different class, and with no apparent relationship with him. That person patted Nagao, as if to console him. That person was—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was me. Nagao was one of the few people who I, the angel of Kuze High School, exposed my identity to. There was a necessity during the consultation process.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So…I was too relaxed?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, if there weren’t any suspicions in the first place, that should be seen as a simple joke among the boys, no matter how you look at it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, he was doing his best.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But anyway, that action caught the eye of Yuzuki, who was looking for the Angel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I shift my attention to you,” she continued, “There were other suspects, but you are the most likely. I gathered every rumor when someone had confessed to someone, then compared them to your behavior, for half a year.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Half a year…” I repeated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her suspicion was more deliberate than I thought. This is not some fluke guess but a more elaborate scheme of unmasking me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kept my gaze on the tuft of grass at my foot, but she just continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I noticed a particular pattern in your behavior, that is, touching other people’s faces. Practically all of them are involved in the confessions, one way or another.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, hey. Isn’t that too much? Are you insane? What is this beauty trying– </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sometimes accidentally, some by lending an earphone, the rarer one being wiping smudge on the face. Maybe I was just imagining things, but it was still too often.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She even noticed my special technique? How perceptive can she be?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smudge wiping was the best method in my arsenal. But due to the suspicion it raised, I haven’t been using it much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And if the rumors were true, then the Angel of Kuze High would have a mysterious power. Normally, I wouldn’t believe that kind of nonsense. I can’t fully believe something like that&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes fixed on the grass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, if there’s no fire, then there won’t be any smoke. It’s worth a try.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t be ridiculous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I’m ridiculous. That’s why I can just joke it off if I’m wrong,” despite her statement, she has no slightest shadow of a doubt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What she had said was an investigation based on a rather unreasonable theory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to think that someone would carry it out… There’s no way I can see this coming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But what happens when you touch someone’s face? </span>Observation alone wasn’t enough. Information transmission? Knowing something about them? That, I didn&#8217;t know. Until yesterday, when you touched my face.”</p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The identity of the Angel being known was still manageable, something I had prepared countermeasures for already. But my power, it was unrealistic anyway, no one would believe it, was what I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was what I believed. And I don’t think I was that laxed. It was strange to assume that someone would come at me with that persistence and outlandish reasoning in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the school gate, she said, “I finally found you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why would she go that far to get me, no, the Angel to…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She ignored my troubled expression and continued yet again. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seemed to be fine, but yesterday, you were shaken all of a sudden. In short, I am different from other people, majorly different, from your reaction.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, you’re different, completely different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I was shaken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My hypothesis is that, ‘Akashi Io can tell who the person likes, down to the number of the people they like, by touching their faces.’ The difference between me and other people is there.” Yuzuki huffed out a heavy breath. Her brows furrowed, her eyes grim.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this woman even aware of what she’s doing? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for the final blow to be dealt like this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I should just come clean. There was no point in trying to hide it anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have thought a little of what I should do when I come to this. But still, the fact that this is the worst possible situation is still the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there&#8217;s still one thing I don&#8217;t understand. To make sure of that, I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, what are you going to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that’s the case, I think you already know it,” she parroted back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But yeah, I kind of understand what she meant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Yuzuki was able to arrive at this conclusion was because of her precise deduction, but above all, because of her unusual obsession with the Angel. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, she was aware that she likes several people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For someone like that to come to me and say, “I finally found you.”, that means–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want you to cure me from this cruel Falling-in-love Peculiarity.” Her determined face and her hopeful request no longer surprises me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, this girl was also after Angel’s love advice. That was why she was so desperate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, her cautiousness makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see… I have a rough idea of your situation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so… you are the Angel, after all,” she gulped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. And your hypothesis is correct; I have that absurd power you mentioned. I use it for my Angel activities. And the one who started the rumor about the Angel was me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so…” Yuzuki seemed to be shocked. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, of course, when someone in front of you admitted that they have a supernatural power, that would be the normal reaction. Rather, she took it in quite promptly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I now understand her situation, her purpose. My true identity was also unveiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I’m sorry, Yuzuki Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As the Angel of Kuze High, I decline this request.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the final verdict.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha? What? Why?!” She stood up, her face anxious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That face was so painful that my resolve wavered. Can you stop that…? I’m really sorry about this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I help my clients in taking the plunge so that they can confess their feelings. That’s the only thing I can do. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s all I want to do. Who will be my consultant, I decide that by myself. I can’t help you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, that kind of thing, it’s better to consult with your friends than a complete stranger like me. I’m sorry, but I can’t take on this.” To make my decision clear, I repeated it one more time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t do everything related to love. I have my own specialty, and I am not going to get involved in something other than that. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if…” Yuzuki whispered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if I tell everyone your little secret? About your power, about the Angel. Does that sit well with you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being hit where it hurts, I leaked out a pitiful voice. Damn, I was cool just a moment before…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So you’re using that to the fullest in this negotiation, huh?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s surprisingly devious…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you do that, then I’ll too. I will reveal who your crushes are. All of them.” I punctuated. “Does that sit well with you? If not, I beg you, turn back now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then we are going down together. I don’t really care. If you don’t accept, then I’ll do that for real.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, hey. Do you really know the consequences of your actions?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, she was just that desperate…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our eyes locked on each other for a while. Her lips were pressed thin, and were quivering a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her will was too firm. That glimmer in her eyes was enough to tell me that she was serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mutual destruction, the most foolhardy option. No gain for anyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is legit blackmail, she had thought this through. Is every top student this scary?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But… Yuzuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okey-dokey. Got it.”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN:What a con man]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-then I…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, do whatever you want. I won’t help you anyway.” I shrugged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki&#8217;s eyes widened in disbelief. I guess my response was the exact opposite of what she had expected</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But yeah, seems like none of us can back down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t take on a request with an ambivalent mind. Especially with how serious you are,” I explained.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… Wouldn’t it mean trouble for you if your identity is revealed?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, troubling. Disastrous, even. Do you know how much effort establishing the rumors about the Angel took? And for it to take root?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A feat of extreme prudence where you couldn’t be wary enough.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, this conversation is for later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But yeah. If it comes to that, then I’ll be skipping school for a while. When I’m gone, people won’t be interested anymore. And I don’t really have to go to school to continue working as the Angel. This is an online era now, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chat rooms, voice change, and all that civilized stuff. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I can’t keep a secret half-heartedly, not me. Troubles of love are not something to be taken lightly. And the Angel, that’s something I can’t compromise.”</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was her turn to be silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t expect her to understand my commitment to be the Angel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understand or not, my answer to her plea remains the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be assured. Do whatever you want, I won’t tell your secret. I’m going to prepare for the shut-in, bye.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She remained silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And don’t go around blackmailing others, okay? It’s effective, but so is its risk. And that… that Falling-in-love Peculiarity? Hope you get well soon.” With a heave, I stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was because I could finally get over this, my tension began to dissipate. It was a nice feeling when you could finally decide on what to do.</span></p>
<p>[TN: I’m sorry for this interruption, but please read at Travis translations to support me, the translator. Other sites are aggressor sites]</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I should go home then review my Angel consultation schedule…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her sharp voice made me turn back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki casted her eyes downward, her lowered hands clasped tightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rippling, glistening surface of the lake, the swaying trees, the setting sun. In front of it all, she looked more an angel than I could ever be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess I am a disgrace to my alias.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there anything you want to say?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry… I&#8217;m sorry that it seemed like a threat. I didn’t mean it. I just… I just really want your help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Enough with that…” Don’t speak in that quivering voice of yours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand that it’s not your specialty. I understand that it goes against your principles… But I have no one else…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She walked over, then slowly looked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see my pitiful, troubled face inside her tear-stained eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, hey, don’t give in. You’re the Angel of Kuze High, remember?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akashi-kun, look at me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Yuzuki suddenly took my right hand. Her hand that touched mine was soft yet terribly cold. She pulled my hand towards her face, then brought it to her cheek.</span></p>

 <img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/minatocry1.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken by surprise. I could only watch as the scene in front of me unfolded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My power activates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha? Hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had already braced myself for the impact, so it wasn’t as bad as the first time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what happened was the same. Faces flickered in and out, in a moment, it was over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many did you see?” she laughed derisively, “don’t you despise me? Do you think I can tell my friends about this?” Her voice rose into a shrill, her face a mess of tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wasn’t asking me. It was Yuzuki that despised herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s nothing wrong with being in love with multiple people. But she sure has too many of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hates that, she hates herself, more than anything, that’s why she–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I want to be cured. I’ll do anything. So, please,” she sobbed. Tears flowed down, then stopped as they reached my hand. </span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she held herself, even though crying, she looked strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said no blackmail, but tears are just as foul…” Moreover, tears of a beauty like her…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Troubles of love are not something to be taken lightly, I said that… myself?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…Hahh. What a stupid Angel. Damn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“R-really?” Her eyes flew wide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. You’re a special case, really,” I sighed</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuzuki wrapped her hands around mine. Then lowered her head to her hand, as if praying, her damp breath moisturizing our clasped hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t promise anything though. It’s still not my expertise. No slightest experience in that area, even. Are you understood?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, yep. I understand. Got it,” she sputtered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I&#8217;ll do anything in my power. And the ‘I’ll do anything’ earlier, don&#8217;t forget that,” I reminded her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yep, yes! Of course. Thank you… really.” Relief swept over her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that I have taken on this, I’ll just have to do whatever I can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just so you know, I wasn’t baited by a beautiful girl’s “I’ll do anything”, just so you know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I wasn’t baited by that, but I’m gonna use it anyway. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, the first of that ‘anything’, here’s my first instruction.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?&#8230;A-already?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You said that yourself. Going to break your promise right off the bat?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“G-got it… So what do you want me to do?” said Yuzuki anxiously, her cheeks flushed red. Her arms crossed as if hugging herself as she watched me. Her tear-stained eyes were incredibly amorous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with that expression that seemed to say, “I’m ready,” stop it, will you? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t be so suggestive. Don’t do that to high school boys, please.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, but… Let’s go somewhere inconspicuous… Here is…yeah?” she stammered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you thinking, idiot. I was talking about the Angel’s identity and my power. Those are to remain a secret. That’s all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah. Yup… got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Good grief.  I can&#8217;t wait to see where this goes.</span></p>
