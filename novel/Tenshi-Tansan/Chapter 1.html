<h3>Chapter 1: When She Stepped Down the Train</h3>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The door to the rooftop swung open, letting the relentless sunlight beat me down mercilessly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Feeling the dull ache behind my eyes, my pupils contracted reflexively. Only when I was shoved forcefully did I realize I had been standing still.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi, speedy, speedy, young man!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, right. Sorry.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I staggered forward and turned back to glare accusingly at her, only to be glared even harder. She was snarling a little, showing her yaeba teeth mischievously.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From behind, Reiji gave her a look and slipped by her side. He loosened his uniform as usual, silver earrings shinier than usual under the noon sun.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We walked to the center and sat in a triangle. We laid out the plastic bag and pulled out our lunch.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Here, strawberry au lait and coffee. We’re even now, understood?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, I don’t mind drinking on your tab, you know?” She inspected the au lait pack curiously as if she hadn’t been drinking it everyday for the last week.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup, yup. Don’t say like this is the last time. I’m going to miss these free drinks.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Brazenly, they took their drinks from my hand.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Back to the events of last week. A malicious rumor about Yuzuki Minato spread throughout the school. I, the Angel, couldn’t stand the injustice. With the help of these two, I have successfully carried out my retribution, or in simpler words, settled the manner passive-aggressively.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So here I am, repaying these two for their assistance. And that ends here, today. No, I didn’t feel any remorse in ending this at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘Don’t sully people’s past and their love with your fillllthy handsss!’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“<em class="calibre14">Acchhack</em>!” I choked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She shrugged slyly. You…! Give back my au lait!</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘I will always look over your love, gentlemen~’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Reiji! Not you too!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘</span><span class="calibre17">When you’re troubling with your romances, please expect my helping hand’”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wha-!! Stop!! Don’t!! Not a single word!!” I screamed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ignoring my cries of despair, their cruel impersonations went on.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, that wasn’t me. Right, the Angel! That was the Angel of Kuze High speaking! Wait, I’m the Angel!! Ahhh!!</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: kinda unrelated, but a reminder that the school’s full name is Kuzeyama High School]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Reaally, that was hella fine performance.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That was soo sick.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shut up!! And give back your drinks!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Free coffee. </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Pwahh. </span></i><span class="calibre17">Delicious.”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Gwahhhhh!!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I despairingly wolf down a cream bun, hoping to swallow it down together with the shame.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What’s more was that I meant every word I said. That was my true feelings, raw and unaltered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, the sheer embarrassment was terrifying. Even when they didn’t mention it, I could feel it hanging in the air.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">‘Kay, forget this, my dear brain. Also, forget this with me, you bullies.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, Akashi-kun’s there!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Our heads snapped to the entrance all at once.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There was a girl standing in the shaded entrance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fujimiya?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The intruder, Fujimiya Shiho, waved her hands in wide arcs. Her calm, laid-back atmosphere and unconcealed glamor were still there. When I jogged up to her, she put her hands on her hips and stooped proudly.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sir, Fujimiya Shiho reporting! I have been pardoned from house arrest, and am back in action!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Right, right. Thank you for your invaluable service.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She made a peace sign and resumed her pose.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She was caught as my scapegoat and got suspended for three days…I imagined a mental calendar. With the weekend in between, yesterday was the last day…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If Fujimiya was here then… “You alone?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope.” She pointed her thumb to her back. “Eh? Heyyy, come out already.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">One, two, three… nothing happened.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Just when I was about to give up waiting, Minato’s head poked out from the doorframe. Her cheeks were a little red…but probably so did mine, it was hot up here.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yo, Minato.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s been a while… Io.” Her voice gradually lowered until I could barely hear.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Reluctantly, she stepped onto the rooftop and took her place beside Fujimiya. She also took a leave for two day, with yesterday at school, we didn’t meet though. So this was our first time meeting in a few days.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I found myself unconsciously taking the sight of her in. Even in broad daylight, her hair was as black as the night sky. Her eyes adjusted to the brightness, her long eyelashes flowed naturally as she blinked. Her thin nose, her rosy, pouty lips were all enchanting as ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But contrary to her usual grace, her eyes darted around awkwardly, as if she couldn’t decide where to look. The hand dropped at her side too, fumbled the fabric of her skirt restlessly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She’s acting strange.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Considering our last meeting at the cafe, anyone would be acting like that. I don’t think I could look at her properly in the face either.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Anyway, I went to close the door, and while I was at it, locked it too. We were lucky that it was Fujinami and Minato, I thought grimly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What happened? There’s a reason you’re here, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I gave the other two a sideways glance. While Hiura looked at us disinterestedly, Reiji looked outright bored with his complacent smile. If you’re faking a smile, can’t you at least make it good?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now that everything’s cleared, we thought we should thank you properly. You’ve helped us tons.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya stride past me while Minato followed somewhat submissively</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura-san and Reiji-kun, right? I’m Minato’s friend, Fujimiya Shiho, as you must have already known. Thank you for your assistance on her case.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Both of them bowed and stilled, waiting for a cue from the other two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">By the way, I had told Fujimiya about their involvement in the Minato case. Since everything was over already, and I had deemed them trustworthy, there was no longer a reason to hide anything.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, I don’t mind at all. I’ve lost count of the number of times Io had come crying for my help.” Aside from the infuriating content, Reiji’s reply was surprisingly amiable.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, he was acting nice only because they’re cute girls.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I was doing it for Häagen-Dazs.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ice cream as usual… and an expensive one at that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm, come to think of it, this was the first time they met, huh.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I saw you last year! ‘</span><span class="calibre17">Male and Female Indiscriminate Serious Relay’! That was so cool!” jabbered Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In response, Hiura yawned cutely. I guessed she was used to hearing that, afterall, that was the thing she was best known for. Who wouldn’t find a girl who outperformed three men cool.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura-san, Miwa-kun.”&nbsp; A clear, piercing voice cut through the chatter. Minato regarded each of us with a nod and said gracefully, “Thank you. It was you all who saved me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She carefully intonated each word. As expected of Minato’s unparalleled manner.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At that, I felt slightly embarrassed and sought refuge from Minato’s glance by looking at the others.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya was all smiles, Hiura sat back, looking half-asleep while Reiji cocked an eyebrow at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I really appreciate it,” said Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And then the conversation shifted to other matters.</span></p>

<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;◆　◆　◆&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We ended up spending the rest of the break talking about nothing in particular. Fujimiya and Reiji lead the conversation, with the rest of us jumping in occasionally. The rooftop became much livelier than usual. That was a change of pace I could get used to.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And Minato, Fujimiya,” I called out before leaving the rooftop.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-hm?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Just… Can you two keep a distance from me at school?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh…” Minato froze, her face becoming pale.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya’s eyes darted to Minato then asked, “Hehh? Why?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Everyone knows that you two are in contact with the Angel, right? If we’re seen together, you know.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Especially Minato, she knew no male students. If I was seen with Fujimiya, then I might still be able to pass it off.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, I see… Right, right.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Our case’s finished, and we’re in different classes anyway, so I think there’s no need for this warning, but just to be sure.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Um… B-but!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then the sound of the bell washed over Minato’s protests. With an urging call by Hiura, we hurried through the door.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the stairs down, Minato tugged my sleeves. “Io, can you tell me until when?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? Uhh, long enough to throw people off track? There might be persistent guys like you, so until I can make sure.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“O-oh…” she sounded a little dismayed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Eh, she wants to meet me? But didn’t she say that our consultation was over? Or was there something left?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Remember what I said? I do an aftercare, so if your Peculiarity mutates or something, LINE me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll see you to the end, I said that, didn’t I?” At the ramen we went together that evening. I waved my hand. “I think my power could be of some help.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Will do… Thank you, Io.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The Angel does aftercare, after all. Every business does this nowadays, gotta stay up to the trend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Only when I said it did I hear how corny that joke waas. Well, whenever I said any joke, the only reaction I got was just a soft “Hmph,” anyway.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And yet she chuckled softly instead this time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;◆　◆　◆&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[To Shida Souta.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I am aware of your precarious position with love. If you wish for my assistance. If you wish to move forward with this love…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Come see me tomorrow night, </span><span class="calibre17"><a href="https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre3 pcalibre2 pcalibre">here</a>.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The usher of love, the Angel of Kuze High.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No typos… hyperlink functional… ‘kay… the message was read.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was on twitter, checking the message once more before logging in to the chat room. Yep twitter was the best when it comes to this. I had tried many sites, but twitter was the best of them all. I got into the chat room and patiently waited for my consultant.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Bruh, Discord’s better.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I sat back, sipping the Pepsi in my hand. I usually save Pepsi for special occasions, just like today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Please, Shida…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I put my hands together in a praying pose and wished on the screen. I felt exactly like when I was waiting for an entrance exam announcement.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even with Minato’s case over, my work as the Angel continues. I was just returning to the same routine as before, that’s it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To push the backs of those who can’t take the plunge, so that things can end without regrets. That was my passion as the Angel, what I seek to accomplish. Finally, I could be back to my own grounds.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Come to me. Trust the Angel, I will lead your love…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Since the broadcast, the Angel had changed from an “urban legend” to “reality” in the eyes of the students. That has its own merits and demerits. Nonetheless, my job remained the same.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So now all I could do was to pray for him to accept my invitation. “Come on, come on…There!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I held my hand in the air in a victory pose when I saw the notification.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[A guest has entered the room]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had cleared the first step.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Um… You’re the real one?] came an anxious message.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmph. No need to be scared, I’m the real Angel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Do you mind calling?]&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">First message, call suggestion, it was all about tempo.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In the past, I preferred text over call, unless there was an absolute necessity. That way, the Angel would be more like an enigmatic being.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But I had to throw the procedures away at this stage. Here comes the first advantage of being “real” in the eyes of the students: I could call with them right off the bat, no beating around the bush.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The guest, Shida, replied with an [OK]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm… that’s fast.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I took a breath, tested my voice change and proceeded.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I know I had been acting high and mighty a moment before, but yes, actually, I’m nervous.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Okay, work mode: on.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can you hear me?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After a rustling from the other end. &ndash;“Ah, um,” he cleared his throat. “I can hear you… woah, you’re real…” said Shida excitedly, oohing and ahhing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was… a better reaction than I expected.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shida Souta, third year, second class, male. Vice captain of the basketball club. In reality, he was my senior. Well, as long as I’m the Angel, that doesn’t matter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I guess it was since last fall… It was love at first sight…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Naturally, I had every information necessary on him. But the perspective of the person in question is always welcomed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ah! But I liked her for real when I got to know her more! Really, I swear!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why are you trying to excuse yourself…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ukuk..! R-right. But, don’t you think people who fell in love just for the looks feel wrong… you get that, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah, I do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So… he’s mad in love.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He’s a communication monster at heart, he can hit it off with literally everyone and be compassionate at the same time. However, he was unassertive and easily bended.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That amounts to his popularity with the quieter girls. But unfortunately for him, he had no girlfriends throughout high school.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">End of the report by Reiji. That lackadaisical guy… he’s way more observative than anyone would give him credit for.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I know, she’s one of the Kuze’s Top Three, supre cute, but that’s not all to her…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Kuze’s Top Three. As the name goes, the top three girls in Kuze High. At the keyword, my head habitually referred to Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But it wasn’t Minato this time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Waah… Mikage-san. Just by thinking about her…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Second year, room ten, Mikage Saeka.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She was my&ndash; our target this time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tell me the exact reason or event that made you like her when you finish fantasizing, then,” I sighed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“O-oh… Okay. be back in a sec.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As soon as he said this, I heard a rustling. What was he even doing? Meditate?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That’s… by any standards, over the top. But well, he might have liked her just that much.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While waiting for Shida’s return, I ran over Mikage’s profile. Her looks alone would prove to be a good match for Minato. I saw her in the hallway today. Her long braided light brown hair looked smooth and silky. It was said that her skin was so pale that you could see the veins underneath if you looked hard enough. Even from a distance, it seemed soft enough for me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her eyes were almond-shaped, the bridge of her nose high, and her lips plump and thicker than most people, all contributed to her unique charm. She was neither cute nor beautiful, but rather, she had her own unique type of beauty.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She was tall, perhaps not as tall as Minato, but remarkably tall nonetheless. Her shape was sleek and slender, ideal in its own way. Unlike Minato’s regal and poised image, Mikage Saeka was a well-rounded beauty without any dominant attribute.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, maybe I’m saying too much here. To justify, her appearance did indeed deserve my every praise. Kuze’s Top Three are really a different breed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Fuu…,” he breathed, “What was it again?”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How did you fall for her,” I prompted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yep, yep, that.” Aside from her looks, her real charm was elsewhere. “She got down a train just to help a lost child.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Lost child?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“It was around the final exam that time, so there was no club act. I had nothing better to do and decided to go home, at the Zezehonmachi Station.” Zezehonmachi, a Keihan Line station near Kuze High. Almost all students who commute by train use this station. “Because of that, I got there at the same time as Mikage-san. We’re going the same way, so we waited at the same platform. That might not mean much since it was packed back then though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But she stood out among the rest?” I suggested.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Of course, why wouldn’t she. People from the opposite platform were looking at her, station staff, everyone. Me included.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I thought you’d be better than that.” Well, that’s creepy but I probably do so myself. How could you not look at her?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“When the train came, well, I kinda thought, gotting on the same car as her wouldn’t hurt. Ah, no, no, don’t say I’m disgusting! Not just me, everyone thought the same thing! That car was the only one crowded.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘Kay, ‘kay. Just get on with your story.” Really, I’m waiting for this lost child of yours to appear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Just before the door could close, Mikage-san jumped out of the train.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I was in a daze, kind of, but I got down too, and was stunned there, not knowing where to go. She knew where she was going, though. She went out the ticket gate and out of the station, there was a boy crying there.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmm, I see…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With a sudden burst of excitement, Shida went on.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That was amazing. Every one of us saw the child, but who would go down? There’s people on the other platform too, or even the station staff. Besides, it was so far that we can’t really see if the boy’s parents were there or not.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Perhaps everyone thought the same thing… At least I think so, there’s nothing I can do. We might have felt a little concerned, but that was it. We’re already on the train, someone will probably help him anyway. No one would have thought of jumping down a train that’s about to depart and help a lost boy”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And yet… Mikage-san, she got down the train without any hesitation, ran out, and comforted the boy. She threw her bag on the ground and crouched down, patted his head and gave him the cutest smile in the world. While I stood there, staring at her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He ended the story with a note of bitterness at himself, and an evident admiration toward Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And then?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“At last, a lady appeared. From the looks of it, she’s the kid’s mom, she came running not long after. So the child wasn’t lost, not actually, but it was dangerous enough. There was a railroad crossing there too. She got thanked again and again, that’s it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s when you fell for her?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Not actually, but that has quite the damage, so almost.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then the exact reason…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“She got back to the station. I was still there, my eyes were glued on to her, afterall, our eyes met. Hehe, she remembered me as the one that got on the train, then she blushed, her mouth quivering shyly. Ahhh, that was the cutest thing I’ve ever seeeeen, ahhhhhhhh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wasn’t the smile earlier the cutest?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Update, update! Even the world record must be updated, right?!” Is that so, Shida-san. “Then, she said, I still remember her exact words!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;Thank the stars, he wasn’t lost, I’m just an oaf.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And she smiled.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/S__17113091-732x1024.jpg" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh… ‘kay.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That was it for me. Not just cute, but cool too. Mikage-san… she’s my goddess.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shida sighed audibly. Since a while before, his actions were like that of someone drunk.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As a boy, praiseworthy actions like that have a lot of points to begin with, double if the girl doing it was cute. Quadruple if it was Mikage-level, essentially a cheat technique.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But to tell the truth, Shida’s story wasn’t all too surprising. Next to her looks, she was known for another thing. And that was what reinforced her “popularity”, making her stand out over the other Kuze’s Top Three. I believed that was what all Kuze High students could agree upon, her ever present aura of charisma.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She was always surrounded by people, as if she had her own centripetal force. She treated everyone equally and did not belong to any specific friends or group. She was like a saint amid the mundane populace.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, I get why you have a crush on her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yep, a perfect one-sided love”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why do you sound so proud of it…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then, why haven’t you confessed, I wonder.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Uuk! Do you really need to ask…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s my work.” That might be an unpleasant way of asking, but I needed to get him to face the reality of the situation.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“For starters, I’m scared, Isn’t she sooo popular?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“And… I heard she’s already got someone she likes…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hm… So he had done his research.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ve heard the same thing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Right? It’s always a perfect no in her track record…” He sighed sullenly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage Saeka has a crush. That was a well-known fact in Kuze High. As far as rumors go, this one’s reliable, Mikage was the one who told everyone in the first place.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Do you know who that person is? If it’s the Angel then you might know..?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“They’re not dating as of yet, for all I know. Or that was what she said, all the information came from her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“O-oh… I think I’ve heard of that somewhere.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From my speculation, it was one-sided love for Mikage too. Even a beautiful saintess like her has her own trouble, it seems.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, that amounted to the endless confessions from the boys. As long as she’s single, then there’s a chance, or so I’ve heard. Well, that way of thinking was valid in its own ways. Better do like that then ending up like me…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shida, never choose the same thing as me…Let me be the only one who regrets not confessing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Last thing… We’re in different years, see?” He said anxiously&mdash;guiltily</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Year?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ehh, like… Well, it depends on the person, but wouldn’t it be troubling if a random senpai confessed to you…heh heh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Senpai…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;Hey! I’m the older one here?!</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;This older sister here will give you an affectionate hug!</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t worry.” I shook my head at the unnecessary memory.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Angel?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Forget about grades, about age gaps. You’ll be fine, I’ll make sure of it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“O-oh… okay… yep, thanks!” Shida returned to his cheerful self. Being cheerful in itself wasn’t bad, but.. Uh, this is getting annoying. “Whoahh! I feel sooo much more confident!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“My ear. I’m wearing earphones!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ah, soz. But aren’t you the same? That broadcast, the whole neighborhood heard it, not to mention the crackling! </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Bzz, pzzhh, sss</span></i><span class="calibre17">! What about our ears!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shida… even you…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“All good though, that was so heated. I was moved.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Thank you.</span></i><span class="calibre17">”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, don’t get mad, I’m complimenting. You really care about us, don’t you? I’m really glad you mailed me. I’ve got a feeling that you’d be serious even for me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not knowing what to say, I searched for a harmless injection. “Okay…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hm, this could merit consultations from now on. Note, note…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But can you refrain from the broadcast, Shida, no please do so.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Next, I explained to him about what my counseling entails. Never discuss this with others. Do not find out about me. When deemed necessary, I may disclose his situation to my collaborators.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And finally, the last item.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“My role is to counsel your love, up until confession. I never guarantee success. Are you okay with these terms?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“No objections. Almost forgot that you’re human too. Besides, about the last one, it would’ve been absurd if you guaranteed success with Mikage-san” He chuckled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Great.” That was fast. “But rest assured, I’ll help you with everything even if I don’t guarantee.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Oooh, okay. If you don’t mind this klutz who can’t confess, glad I could work with you”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Likewise.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thus, my next consultation began. Whether Shida could confess or not, half of it was now on my shoulders.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But our target would be Mikage Saeka. She’d probably&mdash;certainly not an easy opponent.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, that doesn’t matter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shida.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s do it, the confession.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Oooh! I could feel your heat even from here”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, don’t get off track…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Just joking, just joking.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A few seconds of silence before our first call ended. The next time would be laying out the details, and…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s wrong with being passionate about my work…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’m not joking around here, that’s why I’m passionate. And we’re talking about love, isn’t that what it’s all about?</span></p>

<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After school the next day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you for taking care of Minato, we are in your debt.” At an inconspicuous corner of Cafe Proof, Fujimiya bowed to my cousin, Yukito, politely.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The receiving end, Yukito, dressed in his usual attire of denim, t-shirt, with an apron over, replied breezily, “No, don’t be. We are grateful to have a cute regular at our cafe. You’re welcome anytime.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Like always, he kept his outward appearance immaculate.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">By Fujimiya’s request, I introduced Yukito to her. Another person to thank for the Minato case, she said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The two went on about other things. The university students working part-time glared at them while quickly changing positions, filling in for their slacking manager. As one of the part-timers, we were already accustomed to this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Tearing my gaze from them, I returned my attention to the beauty in front of me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what’s this about?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was here for three purposes today. Fujimiya, part-time slot this evening, and…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s this… read it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And Minato’s mysterious request for audience. She LINEd to me this morning, saying we need to meet, face to face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“A letter…?” Minato held out a simple, elegantly designed letterhead. The seal was not yet torn. “For me?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup, I was asked to pass this,” she explained, “But not to Io…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But to the Angel” I finished for her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She nodded uncomfortably. “Sorry… I know you’re hiding your identity. I had planned on refusing…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No worries, I’ve been expecting this, more or less.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato and Fijimiya were in contact with the Angel. I couldn’t do the broadcast without exposing a contact to me. If anyone wanted to contact the Angel, now they could have just gone to these two.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Rather, sorry for the attention.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“N-no. It’s not something you can control.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Anyway, I’ll take this and figure out the rest. Leave this to me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmph, now…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I flip the letter and back. After playing with it, I set the letter down, eying the seal, exasperated.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There wasn’t much to guess. When it comes to the Angel, all people want is love advice. But I prefer to choose who to take myself. There were many things to consider, such as how tight-lipped they were, how long they were stuck in the confession limbo.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“U-um… Io?” She tested.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“May I ask something?” with an earnest preamble, much to my surprise, she began talking.</span></p>


<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Io, did you change the garbage bag?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A little past eight in the evening, some time after the last customer left the cafe. Yukito took care of the register, while giving me a cursory review.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Already.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The dishes?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">“Washing”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Cleaning the tables”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“When I finish this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yukito grunted curtly and moved on to clean the counter area.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It has been more than a year since I’ve started working here. I have memorized most things and can function on my own. Frankly speaking, I was a pretty nice source of income. The only complaint I have was…</span><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">“But still, Io.”</span><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">“What?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re so lucky, having all the cute girls.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He said to himself, “Fujimiya-san’s a really gooood girl. She’s probably popular…” Then he turned back to me. “She is, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Probably.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, of course, why not. I wanna go back to high schooool, enjoying my days with all the cute girls,” Yukito lamented mournfully.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I gave him a sidelong glance. If he ever gets caught, I’ll gladly testify. “Yes, I firmly believe he’d do it” Like that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, who’s your endgame?”Fujimiya? Aki-chan? Or is it Yuzuki-san?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shut up. Do your work”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m doing～ Multitasking, you know～ Wait, aren’t I the manager here?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wow, power harassment. Say something, I’m recording”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope～ This is just me a my cousin vibin’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Good grief…</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">“But, what’s wrong with discussing girl type. Isn’t it a healthy small talk topic for boy like us?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You know full well I don’t want to. That’s just creepy, if you’d ask.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Haaahh… That’s my loyal cousin for you. Good grief” That’s my line. Good grief. “Even so, Io, what’s that chitter-chatter in low voice with Yuzuki? Hmm? A date promise?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why would we. Angel’s work, nothing for you.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph. What a let down.” Yukito lost interest and began stretching. “Ah, but if it comes to a date, tell me, ‘kay? I’ll tell you some good spots.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">“Unneeded.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even at my refusal, Yukito still grinned while humming happily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre13"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Back at my room that night, I read the letter Minato gave me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[I have a favor to ask from you.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The letters were beautiful.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But it was practically a blank letter. Next to the said sentence was the sender’s name, and a string of letters that seemed to be an email address.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It seemed that I was to send her an email.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph, how suggestive…” I muttered, “But a good measure considering the risk of falling into the wrong hands…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Usually, I’d be the one sending letters, albeit digitally, it was a little quaint to be on the other end…&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, don’t think about it, there’s a better thing to do…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I scowled at the sender’s name, wishing it’d be another name. Anyone but her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Like Minato said, it was Mikage Saeka, one of the Kuse’s Top Three, my consultant’s, Shida Souta’s crush.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This is going to be complicated…” I sighed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In ways more than one, complicated. I couldn’t be sure until I got to talk with her, but considering the information I had on her, this would be…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Giving up, I slumped against the chair. “Still…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ignore her, that was an option.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was against my principle, the Angel chooses its own consultant, for my sake, for the consultant’s sake. Minato’s case was, of course, an exception.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, what Minato said remained in my head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage-san, she really was desperate…”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">“So, if you don’t mind, at least listen to what she has to say. I know it’s a selfish request, but…”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato had clasped her hands together and said pleadingly. According to her, Mikage even apologized for believing in the rumors, even just a little, saying that they couldn’t be on the same page otherwise.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“To the mail, huh…” to break my indecisive silence, I said out loud.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If Mikage went that far then I should give her at least a chance, whether I would help her or not, that’s an entirely different matter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Just in case, I plugged in the PC charger and logged in to one of my numerous emails. I kept my mail concise with the subject of “Regarding the letter” and a chatroom link as the body. I clicked the link myself too, and waited in the chatroom. Yes, I’m doing this in retribution to her letter.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Found the account hoarder]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She probably wouldn’t come immediately, so I got up to get my drinks. Pepsi, with three cubes of ice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hoh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With the glass in hand, I came back to find that a guest had entered the room. She had already sent me a message there. [Thank you.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, thank you for your quick response.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Can you call?] I typed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Tempo, tempo, get the conversation moving.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But before I could hit send, the guest sent a message.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Wonder if we could call.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoa…” That was real fast.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I stuffed the earphones to my ear, selected the voice changer, and pressed call.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You’d better be gentle with me, Kuze’s Top Three, no more Peculiarities, please.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yaa, evening”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Yep, she greeted with this “yaa” throughout the book]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">For a second, I doubt my ears. How could her voice be so clear over the phone? Then I sniffled a chuckle. She’s a Kuze’s Top Three.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But didn’t I pray for her to be gentle…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Srry. Figured this’d be against your rules.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But you still went on with it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yep. Don’t have time. No matter what, I need your help, tee-hee”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ehh, firstly, thank you for putting this much trust into me…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But still, there was something about her that gave off a unique air, earnest yet playful, serious but not overbearing… was it her voice, the pace when she speaks, or… her word choice?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even through the phone, her presence bore into me… this won’t be easy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Let me introduce myself once more. I’m Mikage Saeka. Thank you for coming.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This might be a weird introduction, but I’m the Angel of Kuze High. First, I’ll listen to your story.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Keeping my eyes on the screen, I brought up my Pepsi and took a sip.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Burning acidity, then the cool sweetness. The sting made its way down my throat, my mind snapped into its place.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’m ready for battle.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, wait.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“What’s it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Teasing me is forbidden…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Probably not her too, but just in case.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;" class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">Minato Interlude</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The night of the same day I gave Io the letter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Say, Minato, you like Akashi-kun?” Over the phone, my best friend said such a thing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With a soft</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17"> crack</span></i><span class="calibre17">, the thin lead of my mechanical pencil snapped mid sentence. I clicked the button for more lead.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After quelling my beating heart, I parried. “What are you saying, Shiho? I don’t have Falling-in-love Peculiarity anymore.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup, last I checked. So, you like him?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fumya!” I shouted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Dunno what this is supposed to mean. A muffled “Fujimiya”?]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then I realized how loud I was, and that the new lead broke, again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Really… this girl…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“This has nothing to do with the Peculiarity. No more excuses, please,” she said mockingly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah! It’s time for a bath.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“If I reckon, I gave you a waterproof phone case,” said Shiho innocently.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shihooo…” I moaned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With a sigh, I closed my notebook and took my phone. On the call screen, Shiho was wearing yellow Gelato Pique pajamas. My best friend was still as cute as ever.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Gelato Pique, Japanese clothing brand, known for those comfy-looking pajamas.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although she was very mean on the inside.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Come on, come on, Minato-san, there’s only ‘yes’ and ‘no’. If you would?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I took the phone to the bath. The camera was, obviously, turned off on my side. Just for today, I set the temperature a little higher.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yes, or no…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That I… and Io… l-lik&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How could I know…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hmm. I see, I see.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had expected a pursuit from Shiho, but her soft response was anything but anticipated.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Repeat, not a ‘no’ but ‘not sure’ right, miss contestant?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“T-that’s…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: warning, NSFW illust coming up]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Now that I thought of it, there was a difference between the two.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I suck in a deep breath and let my head spin. I dipped my face into the water and said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Du&ndash;</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">blop, blop, blop</span></i><span class="calibre17">” I gurgled.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Eh? What did you say?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I lifted my face. “I don’t know…” I thought I heard a faint giggle from Shiho’s side…</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/529C090E-0D5D-4C59-90DA-5737FD985B41-717x1024.jpeg" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
“S-see…!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Right, see?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“See… it’s completely different from the ones up until now.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Different from my past crushes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ever-present anxiety, impatience, I had never felt something like this before.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Right, raight, serr” she drawled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You seem to be enjoying this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“How can I? Just appreciating your cuteness, ehehe”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shiho”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I gave my smartphone a glare, but of course, to no effect, the camera was turned off.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;”fufufu” her amused giggle leaked through the speaker.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hmph, while I’m struggling with this feeling…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Weeelll, to you, it’s always been like that, that must be a sudden change, I get it.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How kind of you, considering the moment before…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hey, I’ve always been kind.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t think you are a few seconds back.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Wha? Really?” She deadpanned, then burst out laughing when I didn’t react. “But you’ve got to find out for yourself whether it’s love or not, yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Right…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“The Peculiarity that has plage you since forever’s cured, there’s no need to rush things this time around, got it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shiho…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hmph, if you have any worries, let me help you,” said Shiho smugly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;I take that back, Shiho’s always kind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ah, and you two are my main ship, and I intend to stay that way, thanks～”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘Main ship’…?” What’s with that smutty word choice…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Why not? Akashi-kun’s actually kind under his cold exterior, if there’s anyone I would trust to take care of my Minato, it’d be him. I think he’d be a good match for you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“G-good match…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shiho’s voice was oddly serious.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then, the picture of me walking side-by-side with Io came to my mind. My chest tightened while the corners of my mouth twitched up.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The tepid bathwater was suddenly scalding.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I-I don’t think it’s like that…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Reaaally? Your height difference is just perfect though. Not to mention your hobby.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“S-stop! Enough of that! That’s all for this talk!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Ehhh, thought we’re getting lively.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Haah… Oh, dear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I cut my call with her at that, and took a long shower. I stepped out and dried my body with&nbsp; a towel, put on a light loungewear and went to dry my hair. The low, dry roar of the dryer and the surging heat directed at my head made me a little fuzzy. While enduring the process, I recalled.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;“I said no!! That’s all for today! I’m going! Dummy!”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was what I said. And then…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;“I’ll check, give me your cheek”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;“N-never!! Don’t you ever!!”</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I mean, if he touched, his power would have activated. And the only thing he’d see would be…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Haahh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Whether this feeling is love or not, I can’t understand. What I said to Shoho was my honest thoughts.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But if it wasn’t love, then what could it be, how did I get rid of the Peculiarity?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To be madly in love with someone, that was what Io&ndash;no, Io’s cousin, Akashi Yukito’s, theory. It would’ve meant that his theory was incorrect, and my Peculiarity was gone by pure chance, without any supporting reason, just precisely that timing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was, of course, too absurd.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I shook my head, turned off the hair dryer, and combed my hair with my fingers. When all was done, I staggered to the living room, then fell straight to bed, buried my face into the soft pillow, and groaned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If this is love.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If Io knows of this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’d be causing him even more trouble.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No good.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I flipped and faced the ceiling. I closed my eyes and sighed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That’s enough for today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Like Shiho said, I can now finally take it slow, right?</span></p>
