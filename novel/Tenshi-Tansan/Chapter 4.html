<h3>Chapter 4: If I Bring the Glass Closer</h3>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The plan itself went well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thanks to Minato’s diversionary efforts, my deliberate stumble was not seen. Although it didn’t matter much since no one would really think I would have superhuman abilities.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The concern was whether I could touch her face or not.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I… don’t know anymore,” I mumbled.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato who sat across from me raised her eyebrows quizzically and stirred her lemon tea. Since I called her over, it was on my tab.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato, can I try it on you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pfheh! W-why! No, certainly not!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, I see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Of course, our consultation was done, why would she let me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was highly unlikely that my power malfunctioned. It has been working fine ever since. Last time I doubted my own power was back with Minato, too many faces. And now Mikage, none at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Soo…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then it means Mikage doesn’t like anyone.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What are you going to do next?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Figuring that out.” I sighed. “I’ll list some random ideas I have.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato nodded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She’s bored after a week of dating.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s… not impossible.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Aah, yup, it’s hard to rule out this one. But I think the second one is more likely: she doesn’t like anyone from the start.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Maybe she had reached the same conclusion; Minato didn’t look surprised at all.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She frowned. “What do you think?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“None of them are better than the other. But if I’m to choose, the latter.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her frown deepened as she drank the tea. The clinking of the ice filled the silence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And it made sense.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I could still remember my sessions with her. The nagging feeling at every turn of conversations. There were no feelings when she talked about Hibiki.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She was calm, too calm. She lacked the normal reaction of Angel’s clients… She was too cool about everything.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Isn’t that just her character? She really is like that all the time…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That might be, but it adds up to the theory perfectly.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Everything was consistent, no contradictions at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But this is nothing but a guess…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although it was the most solid guess.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then why go to such lengths? To date someone she doesn’t like?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pseudo couple? That sounds like a rom-com plot, though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She nodded thoughtfully.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Maybe for relations? He’s a model… Well there’s not much to say until we know who Hibiki is…” I babbled. “Their family might be pestering them to date someone… There’s too much we don’t know…”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Or to reassure her family? It’s Mikage-san, afterall.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, no, this isn’t a rom-com. We can spend all day speculating and get to nothing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[TN: In fact, this is a rom-com…]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm, but why would she go all the way to find me? Why bother with the Angel?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She might want some advice from you? Or she wasn’t confident it would work? Your reputation precedes you…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Normally, a pseudo couple should have talked that out already? Like, ‘I need to pretend I’m dating, could you help me?’ And that should be the end of the line.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“W-well, she might want to start from fake to real love…” That was probably the Shojo manga enthusiast speaking, not the usual logical Minato.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She went</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17"> all the way</span></i><span class="calibre17"> to you to get to me. That is certainly strange.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was odd. There was no proof, but I am certain.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm… change of plans. Thanks for today, Minato.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We’re going in circles at this rate. In fact, there’s even more mystery. So I think that instead…” damn it, the bad feeling I had when I accepted Mikage’s consultation was right on the spot. “Seems like I have another excuse to talk to Mikage again.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At night.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I emailed the address she had given in the letter and she immediately popped up in the chat room.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[I’ll call] she wrote.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not waiting for my reply, she called me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I checked the voice changer and changed my posture. Time for more work.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yo, Angel.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Aah, it wouldn’t be a peaceful call today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks for the fast reply.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Pfft. How convenient of you. What was it?” A few clicks “Ahem, ‘If you’re available, come to this chat room, I’ll wait.’ If I don’t ask you when, you’d probably wait all night, no?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I wrote that?” I played dumb.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She sighed in return.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The truth was, I deliberately wrote like that. If not, she’d have ignored me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Let’s not waste time. What is it that you want to know? I’d prefer pleasant questions, though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I hope it’d be a pleasant question too. Alas… That you said you like Hibiki, that’s a lie.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What kind of expression would she have right now, I wondered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“It wasn’t.” After a considerable pause, she answered. “ I love him so much that I ask for your help.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Is that all?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You aren’t curious why I come to such conclusions?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At this point, there weren’t any spare cards left to play. The only way to avoid stalemate was to hit her with the truth and watch her reaction.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had prepared a response and probing for all denial situations. To think that she would answer head-on and prematurely end the conversation…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’m not curious. I see why you’d think so, but I assure you, you’re reading too much into it. Does my answer satisfy you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You don’t have to trust me. Although that doesn’t mean I wanted to be doubted. This is the truth, Angel, whether you’d trust me or not.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And why were you so calm during the past month? You were going to confess to your longtime crush?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Huh? I was pretty desperate?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And then you suddenly find the courage and confess?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;&ndash;“It was your words and the momentum of the moment. Didn’t I tell you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">To the very end, you’re going to stick with that guise, huh?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If she was more roundabout in her refutation, I would have pinned her down. As things were, she made it solely the issue of trust, and I’m stuck here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“What I couldn’t really understand is why are you so confident in your reasoning? Trepidation before confession should be relative, what made you doubt me this much.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I can’t talk about my power here, can I? Tch! There was no remedy for my stance here…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Well. I’m not interested. If that’s all then, if you would excuse me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“W-wait!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There goes my pointless bid for time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She must have known it, but she hadn’t left the call yet. Unlike face-to-face, you can hang up unilaterally at any time in a call.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But she didn’t.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then I might have some hope.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I wasn’t trying to blame you. I just wanted to know why you would confess to him even though you have no feelings for him.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Firstly, why are you speaking on the basis that I don’t like Hibiki-kun? What lies do you want me to confess when I had spoken none.” A note of irritation crept into her voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, now she’s annoyed at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In other cases, in a world where superpower doesn’t exist, I wouldn’t have pushed further, it is your liberty to say who you like or not. But no, Mikage, I know.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You liked no one. I saw nothing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And there was someone who wanted to tell you his feelings.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Say, Mikage”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Silence, but she was still there on the other side.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Now, I play my last card.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can I have your time?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Why&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s talk… in person.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Meet me at this location an hour from now, the cafe isn’t hard to find.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After texting Mikage, I quickly left the house. The street was quiet, the bright moon and the streetlights competed to provide light. The asphalt crunched a little. It smelled like a summer night.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Before I got to Zeze Station, I called Yukito for the key.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Don’t lose the key and be back by eleven.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘Kay”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Don’t make a mess, not a single stain, and then&ndash;” After thoughtfully breaking off the sentence once, “Don’t bring a girl over, my cafe’s not a love hotel.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll report to you, Yukito.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s my line, trespasser”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Good grief… I won’t ever grow into this kind of adult. But well…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Even on short notice, thank you, Yukito.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’m grateful, stupid cousin.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Well, whatever you’re doing, good luck.”</span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There was still some time left before the appointed time. I left the “close” sign on the door as it was and turned on the lights. I sat at the counter and idly looked at the hands of the clock on the wall.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Why do I have to go?” Mikage had said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll wait anyway,” I replied.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If it turned out to be a wasted trip, then so be it. It wasn’t a long walk anyway.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fuu…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had done everything I could, this was my last gamble…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The previous time was Fujimiya, the first being&ndash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Ring. </span></i><span class="calibre17">The bell rang.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re insufferable.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My heart flopped a little at the unexpected visit. It wasn’t the appointed time yet…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm? Akashi, Io-kun. Second time we met today… or rather, the third”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Some strange coincidences today, huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, the second one wasn’t a coincidence, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The Internet says this store’s way past closing time. You’re not up to something shady, are you?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“My cousin owns the place, if that helps.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage walked toward me, one step at a time, as if to make sure, and stopped about three meters away.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then, after looking at my face and my whole body closely, she said, “You’re a guy. No wings nor halo.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m afraid mortals can’t take on my full splendor, you’ll make do with this form.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At my joke, she puffed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Now it was my turn to study her. She was wearing a thin white blouse with a deep slit on the side. Her cotton shorts and light blue high-cut sneakers went surprisingly well together. Her rough and simple outfit in a cafe at night was nothing short of amazing. The disconcerting difference between the model and the background made her look like an angel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sit down as you like.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If you say so.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I moved to the nearest table and she swiftly sat down across from me. The shutters were down, so there was no need for the usual secluded seat.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m glad you came.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t want to. You guilt-tripped me.” If she wanted to convey her displeasure, she failed. Her pouting face was like a sulking child’s: cute.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ve helped me out with the consultation… there’s no way I could bluntly refuse.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I’m to say, I’ve been expecting you”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re stubborn.” She shook her head. “Since I’ve come all the way here, let’s get the formalities out of the way.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you for helping me with the confession. I’m in your debt.” She smiled placably, as if we weren’t arguing just a second ago.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So you can do that even in this circumstance.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nothing would change the fact that you had helped me. I am grateful as much as I’m annoyed by your actions. I like to keep my feelings separate.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, really?” As expected, or perhaps I should be impressed…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Although you’ve successfully called me out, don’t think that my answer would change. You should have known that, didn’t you?” In an eyeblink, her eyes were sharp and critical.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, here comes the ordeal.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She probably wanted to finish quickly. Hmph, let us see whose resolve will be stronger.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fine, but I’ll ask anyway. You came for my advice to get together with Hibiki, despite having no romantic feelings towards him.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s not it…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s it. I know. So, I want to know why, that’s all. We all hide things, tell a lie once in a while, I’m not blaming you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She put her chin on her clasped hands. She frowned, but her eyes were unwavering.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Silence reigned for several moments.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“A question, please,” she finally said.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Go on.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why are you so bent on this? What’s your motive?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That question was natural. Why was I so fixed on her feelings? That was the first thing anyone would have thought.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although she had been saving this as the last deterrent since she knew that by most probability, I wouldn’t answer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, there was no way I could betray Shida.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I can’t say.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, you want me to reveal my secret while keeping yours?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I know. It sounds unreasonable.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmp…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She seemed calmer than I expected. Another silence fell.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She heaved a big sigh. “Then, I shouldn’t have come,” she lamented.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She stretched and deflated. It was a spectacle. Her shoulders had dropped only a little, but her atmosphere changed completely.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can we relax a little? No games, no probing. I’m tired.” She chuckled tiredly. Her voice sounded a little sweet.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My body relaxed, flushing out several hours worth of stress and anxiety.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah. Good idea.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We went out and got some drinks at the convenience store.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I waited until we got back to the cafe so I could pour it into the glass I had there, fill it with ice and stick in a straw.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I used that timing to send a thank you message to Yukito, he replied with a weird sticker. I’ll take that as a yes…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At last, a cup of Calpis soda and oolong tea was on the table.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If you would let me ask.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Go ahead.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If anything, it was an improvement to our earlier conversation. I could tell that her tone was lighter.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How do you want the situation to be?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? I want to continue my relationship with Hibiki as it is now. I also want everyone, including you, to believe that I really like him, and then…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t want to fight with you either. That’s all I want.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, I get it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was, more or less, what I expected.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, it was more refreshing when she put it into words like this. My thoughts could run more freely and, above all, kept me from getting tired.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want to know what happened, why did you lie about your feelings towards Hibiki. And if the reason for that interferes with my objective, I want to do something about it. And I can’t tell you about the said ‘objective’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see… the more I hear the less fair it seems.” She laughed amusedly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Okay, I admit this, this sounded ridiculous.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, I can’t change your mind? You really think I don’t like Hibiki-kun?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She stared at me. From the depths of her eyes, something glowed. Our eyes met.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah. I won’t change my mind.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I chanted silently in my head, “I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then I’ll fess up now…” she smiled weakly. “No, I have no feelings for Hibiki-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hoh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m sorry I’ve been lying to you this whole time…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m not blaming you. What I want is to know why. Save your apologies.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her face wrapped. She looked terribly apologetic. She then drank the tea and put back a little of her usual cool.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why? I… I made you go through all that trouble, why aren’t you…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now that you say it, I guess I do. But whatever the reason, you seemed genuinely desperate, right? Then I forgive you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Besides, no matter how unreal it may seem, she was the perfect samaritan. She hopped down a train to help a lost child, she apologized to Minato for believing in the rumors, and so on. Her good conduct was without blemish.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You know how to cozy up to someone, huh?” she mused.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had no comment on that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, the problem is, my reason you’re dying to know. I can’t tell you about it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I figured.” Ahh, what am I doing? Sticking my nose into people’s affairs, their secrets…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Everyone has one or two. Even me or Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, I have to hear it. I’m sorry, I can’t back down.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah… you don’t seem to give up,” she said faintly. “I have a lot of questions, actually,”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll answer what I can.” Because who knows what would happen if I don’t. Better establish an understanding while we were at it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why have you revealed yourself? Only for more time in convincing me? Only that?”</span><span class="calibre17"></span></p>
<p class="calibre8"></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“More or less.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t you think this is risky? What do you have to guarantee I will keep my mouth shut? I would like, check your face and walk away.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m out of options,” I admitted dryly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But from what I know, you keep your identity a tight secret. Until now, you’ve stressed that quite a lot, be it the broadcast, be it the conditions of the consultation. Such a precious secret for a bet? Such high stakes for a losing gamble?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well… like you’ve said…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Do I seem to have any choice?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, Angel… what could you possibly want with me?” It was a rhetoric. She had already decided the answer. “Or was it someone else?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll let you imagine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose you won’t tell me who?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She threw her gaze down at the floor and fumbled with the straw of her oolong tea.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“One of your consultation clients?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I can’t say.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why?’</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: Lmao. Have mercy.]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I have secrecy to keep.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her face twitched, the expression of someone having a suspicion confirmed as truth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see. It’s him…” she muttered, fidgeting the straw. “It makes sense. You’re the Angel of Kuze High.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She pressed a palm to her forehead and fell silent.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, I get your intentions now. I’ll take that in mind”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thank you for contemplating.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, I can’t tell you. It won’t work.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But you’ve come this far. And I’m not that merciless.” She closed her eyes, drawing her lips into a thin line. “Two conditions.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thank you, Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m listening.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then&nbsp; she said with the brightest smile of the day. “I’ll tell you everything you wanna know after clearing these two, ‘kay?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I gather the empty glasses to the counter. “So, let’s hear it”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The needle of the clock went over ten p.m. Considering commuting time, best we wrap up right now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“First, you’ll have lunch with me at school every day for the rest of the week.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Excuse me?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoa, you’re backing down now?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“N-no not like that. It’s… more mundane than I imagined…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, good for you then,” she said cheerfully, leaning on to the counter. She propped her face on her hands.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The tips of her slender fingers sank softly into her soft cheeks.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I honestly doubt if I’m lucky.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And why the request?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thaaat’s a secret!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Did she know I would ask? Well, let’s conclude the deal while she’s still in the mood.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s the second thing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm… let’s see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait, you haven’t thought about this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I couldn’t help but wonder why she would ask for two. Like, cut the unnecessary part, cut the unnecessity.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s save it for later. You’ll need to clear the first condition first anyway.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay… got it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Let’s conclude this already.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Deal”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Nodding in satisfaction, Mikage held out her right hand. She tilted her head and waited for me to respond.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Until the end, I’ve been surprised by an astounding number of turns of events.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I sighed inwardly as I shook hands with her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Looking forward to working with you, Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“For the rest of the week” seemed to mean precisely five days counting from Monday.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On Monday, the board at the back of the class already had next week’s exam scheduled up. Ahh, double predicament week, huh?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As soon as the chime for lunchtime rang, that girl came in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yo…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage crouched in front of my seat, resting her chin and arms on the table. She was grinning as she looked me up and down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The class </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">rustled.</span></i><span class="calibre17"> I felt countless stares.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why the long face? I came all the way here to pick you up.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I spared a glance sideways, “I’d prefer less attention.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From my position and in terms of personality. This was nowhere in the image of “The Inconspicuous Akashi.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t you expect this to happen when you accept the deal?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I didn’t. Thanks for letting me know, but I can do whatever kind of face I want, it’s nowhere in the deal.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, point taken. My bad.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She seemed to be enjoying this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then” She swung her head to the left. “One more condition: Don’t make a sour face.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, that’s not fair.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmp, you’re not doing this, then?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Argh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“C’mon, what are you waiting for? I’m hungry.” She sprang up.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why do you look so excited…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I grabbed the bread pack I brought and followed her to the corridor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Where are you going?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Cafeteria. Pray we have seats left.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Do you want everyone to see us?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She ignored my protests and quickly led the way.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As expected, the cafeteria was packed with students. I fell back and kept a distance from her as she made for the empty corner seat.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It wasn’t even three paces when she noticed my absence and beckoned me. “Keep up. We’ll sit there. I’ll go and order, wait for me.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“As you wish…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I took my place at the table and watched her making her way to the ticket machine. She stared at the menu so hard that I thought I could hear her groan. Come to think of it, she was like that when we bought drinks at the convenience store together. A girl who takes every choice seriously.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I and Hiura weren’t so different at Nanaya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There you go. Let’s dig in?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage eventually came back with a tray of mackerel with grated radish. The choice of food was austere, but somehow suited her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She clasped her hands and muttered “Itadakimasu.” Her etiquette were impeccable. Forced by an invisible pressure, I did the gesture too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: People nowadays don’t say “itadakimasu” that much now, well, that depends on the person, but some elected to go straight to the eating part.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The attention, I noted, was different from when she was alone. It was… brimming with curiosity. Yeah, this combination makes no sense, I know, Mikage Saeka and an unknown mob.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">How will I live through this week?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This is awesome…” she gasped.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Uh, what do I say in this situation? “Good for you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage slowly drank the miso soup, her eyes narrowed in happiness.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hm, she was also holding the chopsticks exactly like how a perfect example in a textbook would be.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, this doesn’t seem fair. Why am I the only one eating cafeteria food?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fair? What are you even talking about?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I said you’ll be having lunch </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">with</span></i><span class="calibre17"> me, not buying it beforehand. Hmm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This is what I have everyday. And please specify your demands, not everyone can read your intentions.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm, then, from tomorrow, I expect you to buy with me.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whatever you say.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh my, don’t make demands as you like…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That reminds me, why don’t we exchange LINE? It’s hard to contact you if there’s to be any change in plans.” I suppose I could have used the mail she had given me, but that would be a hassle, wouldn’t it?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, ahh…unnn” She put her chopsticks down and made a difficult face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry, I don’t have LINE.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…” She took it as </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">that</span></i><span class="calibre17">? “I apologize for my imprudence.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I put my hands on the table and did a table version of </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">dogeza</span></i><span class="calibre17">. Not repenting for one’s sin is a sin itself. I must properly&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Dogeza, traditional Japanese apology etiquette.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, no, no! I’m not refusing you! I really don’t use LINE!” She hastily added.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: For context, asking for a girl’s LINE is a widely used pickup trick. And to avoid this, “I don’t have LINE,” has become a popular excuse.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“O-oh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thank goodness, I almost died of my own cringe. To begin with, there’s no other intention or ulterior motive. I was merely suggesting contact, no , I swear.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Just in case… “Then how about Instagram or Twitter?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry. I don’t have either…”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I knew it. If there is, I would have known already.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I sucks at social. If something comes up, I’ll mail.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, don’t worry about it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks,” she muttered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although… “I sucks at it,” didn’t sound like it was her actual reason.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By the way, have you told your friends that you will be spending time with me? Won’t they worry if you suddenly disappear…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh, did she mean Hiura and Reiji? “Hm, uhh, my fault, but I don’t know how to break it out to them… I only told them I’d be off for a while. You’re okay with me telling them?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why wouldn’t I? I feel sorry for taking you from them… hope this doesn’t strain your relationship with them…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Uhh, the truth was, it </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">did</span></i><span class="calibre17"> strain my relationship with them. Hiura went off saying, “I’ll go with someone else then!”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Sorry, Hiura.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll be fine. I accepted the deal knowing that it would turn out like this. Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“R-right.” Still apologetic, she nodded nonetheless.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Strange, I mean, a moment before, she had been adding conditions like crazy. I couldn’t grasp her sense of reservation at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, what about you, don’t you have someone you usually hang out with…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m fine.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m mostly alone anyway.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She said it so easily, with a faint smile, like the fact didn’t weigh on her at all.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That reminded me of Hiura’s question&mdash;why doesn’t she have any friends?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage…” As I was about to ask.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why?</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">What could possibly be the reason?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? Anything on your mind?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nothing…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Seeing her smile like that made me think twice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s wait until your two quests are over, ‘kay?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As if guessing my intentions, she said so. This time, she chuckled, making the </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">shhh</span></i><span class="calibre17"> gesture with her finger.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>




<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The next day, Mikage took me to the cafeteria, empty-handed today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I fumbled with the ticket machine a little, recalling how long it was since I last used the machine. By luck, I caught up to her as she waited in the queue.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She turned back to me. “Lemme see yours.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I waved the ticket “Karaage set.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Good choice. Mine’s a chinese chicken set.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Is it good? Maybe I should have those too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“A trade it is, then?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She put her hand on her mouth and whispered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I have a bad feeling about this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re cruel.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh? Cruel? You were&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, everyone’s watching…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Itadakimasu.</span></i><span class="calibre17">”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Itadakimasu.</span></i><span class="calibre17">”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It has been ages since I have been here daily. Perhaps the last time was the first semester of last year. Lost in the mysterious emotional nostalgia, I quickly eliminated the sesame sauce cabbage salad.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: I swear, school cafeterias serve those cabbages almost every meal. It was nice at first, until the fourth time, after that it was pure torture.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In my book, the least delicious food was to be eaten first.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Here, there you go.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A Nanban chicken landed on my plate.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The unexpected intrusion of a new power had the karaage chickens scared. No, not the chickens,</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17"> I’m</span></i><span class="calibre17"> scared.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I won’t exchange…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m giving it to you for free.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s not what I meant…” I swept the canteen with my eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No matter how many reasons she stated, it would look like we were exchanging from anyone watching nonetheless…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, it would be even worse if they knew she was giving it for free.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I give up, exchange it is.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yay! Can I have the little ones?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“As you wish.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The Mikage quickly reached for her chopsticks, plucked the fried chicken she wanted, and took it away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Farewell little karaage crusts, you have lived a good life. Well, you’d probably be happier being chewed in Mikage’s soft mouth than mine.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yuck, what am I thinking?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmmm… Thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Isn’t an exchange supposed to be even?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“A mutually beneficial trade deserved its gratitude.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If you say so.” If anything, I wanted to try the Chinese chicken too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Also, we had just argued two days prior at the cafe, how peaceful things were progressing here felt strange.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So midterm’s next week.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh please don’t bring that up…” I groaned. There goes the peace. Why did she have to mention it?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not doing well?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not at all.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“In numbers?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Count from the bottom of the scoreboard. That said, there aren’t many people under me either.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Haha. Really? Guess we’re comrades, then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait, what?”</span><span class="calibre17"></span></p>

<p class="calibre8"></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m just like you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She looked pleased. Well, I’m glad there’s someone sharing my fate too. Dropouts have a strong sense of camaraderie, they say.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I still can’t believe it. You? Don’t you look super serious?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Being serious has nothing to do with grades.” She made a mock grumpy face. “Was barely scraping by in middle school, seems like high school will be the end of me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Kuze High’s a gathering of geniusius. We’re frogs in a well.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Wait, “Middle school”?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;I felt like she’s changed?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;There was a time where she stopped coming to school.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Come to think of it, I was occupied with Shida all this while. I should have seen, should have known, that I could no longer turn a blind eye to what happened to Mikage back then.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This was not just for Shida’s sake now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Seems like they’ll stop having club activities tomorrow too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why wouldn’t they? The test is around the corner.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Enough about clubs, get to study, that was the school policy. Although that bore no effect on the go-home club like me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Are you in any?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You mean club? Go-home club, of course. I have </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">that</span></i><span class="calibre17"> to do.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Aah, </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">that</span></i><span class="calibre17">.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, if you exclude the Angel work, I had no intention of joining one either way. Let people who have passion pursue their dreams.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">For the sake of conversation, I asked. But like social media, I have never heard of her being in any club.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Go-home club. There are some interesting clubs, but in the end though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Do you work part-time?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sometimes, taking it slow and easy. Mostly I eat good food and watch movies.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s unexpectedly normal… I thought you’d be doing something more glamorous.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoa, why so?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re Kuze’s top Three.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmmm, what a prejudice.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ah, she took offense…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And no, it’s an image, not prejudice. Now that she said it, Minato was like this too, huh.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Speaking about part-time, you work at that place, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, yes. Only when my cousin calls me.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That sounds like fun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Unfortunately, it is not.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The job itself is superb. The problem was the manager who thought he knew what’s best.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her cheeks softened into a smile. “I’ll make sure to go there next time, as a proper customer.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I tried imagining it. Mikage in school uniform entering the café. In all probability, she would be alone, peacefully drinking tea happily. It would be nice if there’s a customer like her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll let you know which day I’ll be there.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks.”</span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We finished our lunch, returned the trays, and parted at the cafeteria entrance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There was some break time left, but the condition she set was that I took lunch with her, after that, I’m free.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll get going. See ya later.” She said goodbye in a small voice and left first.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not only me, but many of the students in the cafeteria watched after her. As was the case yesterday, Mikage did not seem to want to detain me for any longer than necessary. We had a normal conversation, and after lunch I’d be free to go.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I didn’t feel like she was pushing me around nor testing my limits. That was the only thing that I could glean out of my interactions with her. What could possibly be her goal?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the contrary… she seemed to be genuinely enjoying herself.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After a few moments, I too started walking towards the classroom.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But then I noticed something off.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I felt eyes on me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not just one person.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I spun around. Several people turned their heads away. I don’t recognize most of them. The attention itself wasn’t my concern. Being with Mikage promised attention. I’ve long given up on the attention.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The thing was, the way they looked at me, their gazes were steely.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Who’s that punk?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I caught such a whisper.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, this is bad.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not knowing what to do, I hightailed it back to the classroom.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The “see ya later,” Mikage said at lunch had a reason for it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“&ndash;So, that’s how I’ve come to have lunch with Akashi-kun since yesterday.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Me, Hiura, Minato, and Mikage gathered at the rooftop afterschool.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Two of Kuze’s Top Three, one Plus Four. This was too luxurious a view.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want to tell them myself,” was what triggered the meeting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Participants were decided by hand raise. As a result, these two came. Think of this as a daily update on the Angel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage, the main speaker, explained the situation in great detail.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Q&amp;A, if there’s any,” Mikage ended the presentation with a smile.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura was clearly giving her looks, while Minato had a complicated expression on her face. Then they both turned their heads toward me and stared silently.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">W-why me?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I get it now,” Minato said in a small voice, “But are we allowed to ask?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun here’s gonna interrogate me anyway, no harm in establishing an understanding, don’t you think so?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You have a point…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">How compliant Mikage was probably tipped Minato off balance. I get it, until now, she had been so tight-lipped that it was hard to imagine the forthcoming Mikage of the present.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She really was intending to keep her end of the bargain, it seemed.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If you have any questions, I’ll answer them. As much as I can, of course,” she assured.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura, with her knees up, showered Mikage with a cold gaze, “I’m not interested in you in the slightest.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then why are you here, I thought silently.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Make sure you give Akashi back next week,” she commanded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pfft…” Hiura… you can be cute at times, huh? All right, all right, maybe I’ll get you ice cream sometime.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, with me gone, it would be just her and Reiji. The rooftop key too was mine… wait, was that what she was after?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I will, I will. Akashi-kun’s second quest won’t take that long,” said Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph.” Another glimpse at my future. I’ll have to do it anyway, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yuzuki-san, I’m really sorry… Can I borrow Akashi-kun for a little while?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-heh?! W-why my permission?! You can have him as much as you want!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Am I that useless to you, Minato? And I want to get this over as soon as possible, so don’t say ‘as much as you want.’</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm… You two look closer than I thought,” noted Mikege.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">During the way here, I had briefed her that I and Minato became friends through the consultation, and that we only keep our distance at school to avoid suspicion; we still meet up outside from time to time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Actually, I was a little worried when I asked Yuzuki-san to be the intermediary. I thought counseling is supposed to be a one-time thing. ‘What if Yuzuki-san doesn’t have Angel’s contact?’ And so on.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, it’s supposed to be a one-time thing. Even people I had shown my face to are not like this. Exception among exceptions… a lot happened.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If anything, she was the one who had blown my cover.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">How many times had I used my power on her…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm? You have shown your face to others too?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Rarely. If it’s unavoidable.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait, then does that mean when Yuzuki-san called me out has something to do with you?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Oh, not good. She’s connected the dots.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, that time was to use my power on her. The power that’s not supposed to exist. I can still get out of this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“W-well, I wanted to check up on you. Yeah, I called up Minato. Sorry, I wasn’t intending to crash into you at that time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, no, I didn’t bring that up because I want an apology…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I met eyes with Minato. We’ll need to sync up later before Mikage could ask any more questions.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And then, do you come here often? Last week I found you with Miwa-kun and Hiura-san here.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Um, that, I guess. We usually eat lunch here. Once in a while Minato and Fujimiya join us.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fujimiya Shiho-san?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I nodded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I would like it better if those two come here less often. What if someone saw us like Mikage?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Say, Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The next moment, Mikage was looking at me with glittering eyes, like a cat begging for a snack.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can I ask you something? Yuzuki and Hiura-san too.”</span></p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What she asked for was, naturally, separate from the two conditions she had set.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The moment I began to feel fed up with her unending demands, she made this cute request.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoaa. You’re really here, Mikage-chan”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wha! Mikage-san!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At lunch the day after.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">All members were present to greet Mikage this time. Reiji and Fujimiya, who weren’t present yesterday, had the most reaction.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As it turned out “I want to have lunch with everyone” was her request.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Six people in total, twice the usual number. Considering the risk involved, I could have refused. Although when I saw Mikage’s smile when I let her join, I was glad I didn’t refuse.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, she said it would be only one day. My life has been full of exceptions of late anyway.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks a bunch. Hope I’m not bothering anyone by being here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No problem, not at all. Cute girls are always welcome.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There goes Reiji</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage masterfully took that comment. “Oh? I’m glad I’m born cute, then.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was surprising she didn’t take offense, and how natural her response was. If it was anyone else, I would have said they were bragging, but this was Mikage, her beauty was a fact, leaving no room for complaints.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ve always wanted to get to know you. Nice to have you here, Mikage-san,” said Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Likewise, Fujimiya-san.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And this affability. How many times had she smiled in this short time? Her sincere charisma was something to behold.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On a side note, I had told Reiji and Fujimiya about the situation. I’d prefer to get complicated talk out of the way first, so that I could have a peaceful lunch.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura-san, Yuzuki-san, you have my thanks, yesterday included.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It was nothing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Unlike Minato, Hiura grunted with bread in her mouth, “Hm.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And let’s not forget Akashi-kun here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you, for going through with my self-indulgence.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I couldn’t help but turn my face away. “It’s fine…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was reminded yet again of how destructive these girls can be…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato? Don’t you look upset?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m not.” She raised her voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Perhaps Mikage’s introduction might be overboard, the meal itself was ordinary, and so was the conversation that followed.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun, are you studying for the test?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s a fast reply.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Io’s on the verge of failing. Or has he already?” Reiji smirked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t want to hear that from your mouth.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I, Hiura, and Minato were bread eaters. Fujimiya had a bento, while Reiji had a convenience store onigiri today. Mikage brought her own sandwich.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m confident Hiura Tutor would save me from my peril.” I puffed up my chest.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t remember becoming a tutor.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh… Why, our benevolent savior, how could you abandon us?” You’re my lifeline, help.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I wouldn’t mind teaching someone that’s not a blockhead like you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm? Hiura Tutor? Can I enlist too?” asked Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait, Fujimiya, you’re not doing well?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Minato spoke up, “Shiho’s beyond saving, despite her looks.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No way. Fujimiya had the looks of an honor student.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That includes me too, tee-hee.” Mikage smiled wryly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Even Mikage-san?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She flashed a confident smile. “Have never been to a make up class yet, will probably get to this time ‘round.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, too bright. How could someone’s smile be this bright?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t cha guys go to Yuzuki Tutor or whatsoever. She’s better grades than me.” Hiura made a shooing gesture.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No! Don’t come here, there’s a monster&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shiho, you’re expelled.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Bweh! Wait! Minato! I was joking! Please!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t care.” Minato snorted and turned her face away.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Scrsh.png" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Seems that Minato wouldn’t hold back if it was with Fujimiya. Hmm, interesting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Isn’t that because she cared about you? Hiura Tutor seems to want us to drop dead.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Miwa, you’re expelled. You too, Akashi.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why me!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was just nodding along…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pffttt…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When our bickering started to die down, a snicker grew louder.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahaha! Pftt!” Mikage desperately tried to stifle her hiccups. The corners of her eyes even leaked tears.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uhh, I think Mikage-chan’s in pain?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What a sense of humor she got…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Doesn’t this mean we’re good at comedy?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh? But the expulsion part isn’t a comedy, though, Shiho.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato-sensei?! I’ll forever be your disciple!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahaha! S-stop! Hahaha!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, Fujimiya’s vigorous pledge renewed Mikage’s fit. Somehow, it was satisfying to watch her convulse on the floor…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;“Phew… You guys are hilarious. I completely lost my composure there.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Come to think of it, no one has ever mentioned seeing you laugh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I haven’t been in a group in ages, let alone laugh like this.” And then her face spasmed again as she giggled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Everyone purposefully avoided the first part of her comment.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From that, we went on about nothing in particular for a little while more…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage stood up. “I’m going back first. Had fun talking with you guys.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We had fun too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why don’t you come tomorrow?” suggested Reiji.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She smiled wanly. “I can’t. I appreciate the sentiment, but I’ve errands.” She looked pointedly at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Everyone nodded wistfully.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“See you around. Thank you.” With a smile as bright as a sunflower, Mikage spun around, turned her back and left the rooftop in quick steps.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The rest of us waited for the pre-bell to ring in a stunned silence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There were two more days left to go until I fulfilled Mikage’s first quest.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thursday. Today, Mikage and I were out for lunch again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage had oyakodon and I ordered a fried mackerel set. At this point, it had somewhat become a routine to me. Apparently, the crowd didn’t seem to think so as they showered stares at us.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, four days did wonders to me. I never thought I could get used to this sight this easily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That said, there’s more to you than meets the eye,” she chuckled.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Is that how you start a conversation? I wondered for a moment. And what did she even mean?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What do you mean…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yuzuki-san, Fujimiya-san, Hiura-san. How will you explain your relation with these three cute girls?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Having no excuses, I silently bit into my mackerel. The crunching of a fried fish sounded dumb and embarrassing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s do a headcount. A Kuze’s Top Three, a Plus Four, and a Plus Four candidate. What luxury is this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Can’t deny that either. Although those girls were so sparkling that I looked pale in comparison. Sometimes I felt a little uncomfortable in such a company…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But, Reiji’s there too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“He’s… different from you.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Specifically?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She cocked her head, looking into the distance. “Hmm…can’t quite place it either.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So she can’t point it out…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Say, Mikage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I wonder if I should ask this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But I get a feeling that Mikage wouldn’t mind.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What…what do you think about your title? About being in Kuze’s Top Three?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Besides, I was genuinely curious about what she would think.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“See…Don’t you feel uncomfortable? Being selected against your will and so, everyone is paying strange attention…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Neither Minato nor Hiura were fond of the title. Especially Minato who had come to despise the accolade. Strangely so, Mikage appeared to differ from those two.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm…s’pose it is. There’s that side too, yes…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But I kinda like it. If possible, I would never give it up.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, people have their preferences. Even Yamabuki Karen went to such lengths to get the title… Controversial, controversial.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t know how they select one, but if it’s by looks, then it’s like a beauty pageant, no? I’m happy to be selected along with Yuzuki-san and Towa-san.” Her eyes narrowed fondly, as though she sincerely felt glad to be selected.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I…I’ve never thought of it that way. I thought the burnden society put on good looking people are unreasonable, but…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I mean there’s that too, but don’t you feel good when someone acknowledges you? Don’t you feel happy when your hard work pays off?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You worked hard for this…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup.” She nodded without delay. “I want to be beautiful, both on the outside and inside.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So that people can appreciate me. And so that I can like myself.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re&mdash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;You want to be someone you can like?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? Did you say anything?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, nothing.” I shook my head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She reminded me of someone, of blue sky, of passing breeze. Of her smile. That’s the same line of thinking Ayaha had. And those were the words that saved me from my own self-hate.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;You’ll enjoy yourself more that way, right?&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Until then, I hated my useless power. How could I use it to help anyone when it couldn’t even help myself.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">&mdash;What’s good ‘n what’s bad, that’s for you to decide.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was a line that I had seen and heard many times before. But it wasn’t until then, when she said so, that it finally resonated with me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That’s why…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had thought of berating her. I couldn’t help but think so.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If you’re trying to live like that, then why do this…?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage-sannnn!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A call broke me from my reverie.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was like being doused with cold water, the world around me suddenly regained its contours.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Next to the table were a group of four people, two pairs of boys and girls each.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hello, hello.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hi, it’s been a while.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup, I think this is the first time since we switched classes.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage seamlessly whipped up a smile and confronted the leader of the group.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The group itself was… good looking. From how they manage to make uniforms fashionable to their makeup, you can immediately tell they’re the center group of the class.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From how their conversation went, they were quite familiar with each other.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Really, I haven’t got to talk to you, haha.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re in class ten right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Really? I barely saw you anywhere.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Gradually, the other guys began to mix in. In a sudden, a chat group was formed around Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what are you doing?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Like a whip, the leader’s attention fell on me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, I’m having lunch with him,” Mikage explained.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh? Who’s he?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’ve gotten glared at a lot by Hiura, so I had some sort of an immunity… but why would you look at me like that?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun from room eight.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi…? You hit it off with him? Saw you around with him a lot lately.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Our interest kinda matched.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Really? He doesn’t look the type though.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Now was the obvious disapproving look. The rest of the group mirrored the leader’s doubtful face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If you say so… Don’t forget about us, alright?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, okay…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With that, they went away.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I could virtually feel the whole cafeteria’s attention on us now…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s eat,” she urged.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We hadn’t said a word about what happened. I knew too well that their talk wasn’t with Mikage.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As I was leaving the cafeteria, someone bumped shoulders with me, knocking me off my balance. By the time I looked up, whoever bumped into me had disappeared.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At last, we were on our last day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was as if someone had set up a trap for me, rigging an anvil of attention above the door, waiting to let loose the moment I entered the class. That split second of scrutiny I was subjected to when I walked through the door was more intense than the day before.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Phew…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I fished out and began rereading Konomi Kuchiru’s novel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: Io’s favorite writer, mentioned somewhere in vol.1]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But for the better part of the time I had, I ran my eyes through the text, my mind wandering off to Mikage. And also a little about Ayaha.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When lunch came, Mikage would come to pick me up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I felt like she looked a little glum today.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yaa, good to go?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yea.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When I stood up, someone came in between me and Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was Hiura.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“G’day, Mikage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura-san?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura scowled at her accusingly. “I’ll go with you too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m afraid that’s not an option. Sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t care. I’m going.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She lowered her head, lifting her shoulders. Her posture reminded me of an angry cat, ready to pounce. I couldn’t see her face, but she was probably baring her fangs.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This is between me and Akashi-kun, not you, Hiura-san.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi’s problem is also my problem.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The murmur around us became louder. Of course, pitting Top Three with Plus Four and you’ll get this attention.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I looked at Mikage. We both knew why Hiura was here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hiura.” I put my hand on her head, and gently pull her away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What,” she demanded, less aggressively than a second before.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She really acts like a wild cat, doesn’t she? I mused.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll be fine. Today’s the last day.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m worried about you, you know that?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I know, I know. Thanks.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She stared at me, contemplating.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph,” she grumbled and shook off my hand.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Do whatever you like.” Dismissively, she walked away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The two of us exchanged glances and quickly left the classroom.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She really likes you a lot,” Mikage noted as she set down her tray.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She’s a busybody, despite her carefree looks.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Didn’t expect her to admit that she’s worried about you though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m surprised by that too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">For the better or worse, Hiura only says what she thinks. In other words, she was genuinely worried. I might have to apologize to her later at this rate.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I sighed. “Last time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Last time.” Mikage nodded.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">One week&mdash;five weekdays, to be exact.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This would be our last lunch.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you. I had fun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A lot happened. I’ve got the chance to get to know her.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My initial goal was to find out why she was avoiding Shida’s confession. But even so, that was still an awful long way to go.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And yet, even if Shida got to confess, I no longer felt that that would suffice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What ‘bout you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I cocked my head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun, did you have fun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, now that I’ve come to know her. To know what kind of girl she was.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well…can’t say I didn’t enjoy it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And until I got to the end, I felt like I would have to learn a great deal about her.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And if the time comes, what could I do? What </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">should</span></i><span class="calibre17"> I do?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, that’s until I learn the whole store. For now…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, really? Good to hear.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">For now I only hope that everything will go well.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Shida, Mikage, I wish happiness for them both. I want to do something </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">right</span></i><span class="calibre17">. Will you let me do this, Mikage?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll mail you on Sunday night about the second condition.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s no preparation needed, so do whatever you like.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Alright. I’ll be waiting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, s’pose I should say this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s prioritize the coming test, yeah? I don’t want to be accountable if anything happens.”</span></p>
