<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Yamabuki Karen and Fujinami Shiho</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">New week began and I was back to observing Minato at school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she likes someone, I would write down their interaction and the surrounding at that time, as detailed as possible. All the while trying to deduce the hypothesis by recording her feelings at the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slow but sure-fire process. Little by little, we uncovered the Falling-in-love Peculiarity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or that was the plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m out of ideas”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We came to a complete standstill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the usual café, with her facing me across the table. Around ten days had passed since the start of the operation. The catch was more than I had imagined, an astonishing speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I’ve got no clue from them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you did a good job. Rather, sorry…” I ruffled my hair in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if synchronized, we both shook our heads and sighed. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I thought it was going to be easier than this. Or at the very least, hore hint would come to the surface. Unfortunately, the more data there was, the farther we were from the answer. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing resembling consistency in the data.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead of falling for ikemen whom she talked with several times a day, she would fall for a plain guy she hadn’t even talked to. And yet, she never fell in love at first sight, or that was supposed to be, until she fell for a boy from another school who walked past her on her way to the café.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like I was thrown into the air. The earth was blue, the expanse beyond black.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no helping, I’ll preserve and keep going. In the meantime, I’ll try poking at other possibilities.” I leaned back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yup… yeah, I’ll do something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere was heavy. But there’s no helping with that either.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both talking to people she wasn’t familiar with and visiting another class to make observations every break were onerous tasks. And despite the effort, the absence of results could be discouraging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, how’s Fujimiya taking it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, yeah… She noticed something was off, but nothing yet,” she answered, lacking her usual confidence. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to her, a few days ago, her best friend, Fujimiya Shiho, noticed her unusual behavior. Well, given the length of their friendship, that was to be expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You two are sure close,” I mused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup…She’s, that girl&#8217;s important to me. I don’t want to hide anything from her but…” She screwed her face a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From her point of view, coming clear of her situation– the Peculiarity, the consultation– wasn’t a choice for her either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I sent her back by herself and helped out at the cafe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait and see, that was the conclusion we had reached. However, the ideal scenario and reality are different, there was no luxury for such things, it appeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was, she would get involved in an incident some time later.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Phweee!! </span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shrill wail of the whistle signaled the end of the match. Students shuffled in and out of the courts as they swapped places. Each of the courts now hosted two students facing each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The afternoon class was gender-segregated badminton. Two classes were combined then divided into several groups for the matches. This was one of the lighter classes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And class seven and eight were paired in this joint class. Thankfully, the courts we were using were right next to each other. Thanks to this, the observation was way easier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whistle blew again and the next match started. I, who just switched out, looked sideways at Minato’s court. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato was dressed in a simple navy blue jersey with her hair in a ponytail. The contrast between her white nape and black hair was dazzling. Even in a plain outfit, she clearly stood out from the rest with her elegant glamor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I– o—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reiji’s calling pulled me out of my stupor. As he sat down beside me, I noted the missing earrings. With that out of the way, his well-shaped face made him look like a proper sportsman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, he was in the basketball club, though not in a good standing due to his tendency to slack off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yuzuki-chan again?” He nudged his head her way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with that ‘again’?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, don’t think you can get away this time. You’re always looking at her lately. No, more of going to see her.” He grinned his sly smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well… As expected, Reiji can’t be fooled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Work, like usual. Take a hint,” I scowled.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Like usual’, huh? You’re cute, Io.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He smirked and asked nothing more, probably because he knew he would get nothing if it’s about the Angel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a sharp cracking sound came from nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In succession, the “Oohh”s came from the surrounding area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato had just released a smash that grazed the corner of the court.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oooh, nice shot. She’s like someone from the badminton club,” commented Reiji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That court’s getting a lot of attention,” I observed.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s the matchmaking,” he shrugged, “the other side’s Yamabuki.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other side, Yamabuki Karen, was just as attention grabbing as Minato. Short explanation: She’s one of the Plus Four, another beauty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes were large and almond-shaped, her outline shapely, and her lips thin. Her atmosphere resembled Minato’s a little, they must be in the same lineage. But she didn’t stop there, she armed herself to the fullest with makeup. In terms of image, she was no different from that of idols.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, her semi-long hair was around dark blond to light brown, and unlike Reiji, she kept her red earrings on. Combined with her pink jersey on top and bottom, she was a true gal. Her popularity among the boys was different from Minato’s but she was quite popular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last year, I had a consultant who wished to confess to her. And that was what made Minato hone on me</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Callback from Ch1 P3]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki deftly scooped up the shuttlecock with her racket and glared at Minato at her opposite. Her mouth mounted something. Probably “Sod off”.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From her serve, the shuttle soared high. Minato also returned with the same ferocity, trying to pin Yamabuki. However, Yamabuki stepped back and jumped, smashing the shuttle back.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bending at almost an impossible angle, Minato barely managed to return. From there, Yamabuki took offense and scored a point. The glee in her eyes was as if to say that this was payback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other side was also a fine opponent, it seemed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Minato reached down to grab the shuttle, Yamabuki looked down at her. Her mouth moved again. Maybe “Yuck” this time. On the other hand, Minato retained her cool expression as she prepared for the next round.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uhh, what’s with this tension in the air?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooh, she’s crackling. Well, she doesn’t want to lose to Yuzuki-chan and all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Reiji only laughed amusedly. It was as if everything was fun and games to this guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl, she hates Minato. She usually faults her, gossiping behind her back. Well, Yuzuki-chan seems unaffected.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And the reason for it?” I urged for more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dunno. Maye jealousy. She’s Plus Four, Minato’s Kuze’s Top Three. That doesn’t sit well with  the princess-type Yamabuki.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, she hates her because M–Yuzuki’s more popular ?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, and better in terms of grades and sports despite Yamabuki being in the sports club. She loses to her all round, so to say.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, one-sided jealousy from Yamabuki. You sure had it tough, Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, match point.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The match was eleven points to win, and before long, the scores were already ten to nine, with Minato leading and one minute left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the same composure, Minato hit a long serve. Yamabuki, who was pitching forward, was caught by surprise and her return ball was weak.Minato smashed the shuttle that came to her fore side but Yamabuki returned with tenacity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato caught up just in time and raised a lob to buy time. Good strategy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, Yamabuki jumped, reached out and forced a smash.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sharp strike went straight for her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwah, body!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Too late. I thought so. However, Minato changed her stance, leaped and redirected the shuttle. It was as if she could see it coming</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shuttle landed with a thud, even before Yamabuki reached the ground. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just then, the whistle signaled the end of the match. The matches that were still going on were forced to stop and swap places with the rest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With one fluid movement, she left the court quietly. Signaling to Fujimiya, she sat down on the bench.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Yamabuki on the other side was still glaring at Minato, unbeknownst to the surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some time later, the chime for the end of the school day rang, students lined up and bowed. At Kuze High, homerooms were held after lunch break, so students were free to go. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
The students listlessly put away the nets and rackets, and the number gradually dwindled. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me too, when I had finished cleaning up, I decided to leave quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re a freak, seriously.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I headed for the corridor, someone said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice was heavy with overbearing and malice, a provocation that instantly made me stop in my tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I registered what happened, I quickly searched for the voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the corner, three girls, Yamabuki included, were facing Minato. I hate it when my foreboding comes true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop with that clout chasing, will you? Don’t push your luck just because your face is nice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hid in one of the shadows within earshot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki’s eyes were like that of a snake, the other two were just as bad, their spiteful grin made my skin crawl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato just stared at them in disappointment and quickly switched to resignation. However, she didn’t seem to stand tall like usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I’m not sure that the appropriate action was either. I’m the third party here, and I’m not sure I can deal with these three.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, highschool feuds were not that simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But pretending nothing happened was out of the choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really, emo queen, it’s so obvious you look down on everyone. What a psycho.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s psychologically impossible–. I can see why she has no friends–.” The two cronies closed in on Minato from the side. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crude rant made my head hurt. But the outright hostility was enough to hurt the other party. Put it simply, totally infuriating.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ugh… I could barely stop myself from jumping in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you realize you’re hated? Not just us, everyone else too,” The ringleader Yamabuki snarled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Minato didn’t flinch. Rather, she let out a mournful sigh. “Are you done?” she asked softly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah?” Dumbfounded faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that all you’ve got to say? I’ll be on my way then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki’s expression darken that instant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You! You want a fight?!!” Her bark went over the corridor. Instead of Minato, the two cronies flinched back instead. A few remaining students came scurrying after the voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This couldn’t be good…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see through you! Going around seducing boys!” The snide appeared to hit home, Minato paled. It was as if she could burst into tears right away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I, too, lost my cool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Smashing around, no cap, disgusting! You wanna be an emoqueen that much?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was visibly shaking, her face pale, her eyes downward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki, who had gotten the response she wanted, continued with glee. “Enough with that pretty face! You bitch! I can see through your thinking!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something snapped. Cold rage took over me</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I can’t let this go on. No, never.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What do you even understand about her, Yamabuki?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi” I found myself stepping in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I had no plan, just this boiling, seething anger in my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cronies quickly looked away uncomfortably. Minato looked at me in surprise.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her body still facing Minato, Yamabuki turned only her face to me. “What’s your deal?” she demanded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“None with you. Yuzuki, let’s go.”</span></p>
<p><strong>[TN: Oohh, the burn]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took her hand and pulled her. Minato followed with powerless, wobbly steps. However, Yamabuki sidestepped, blocking our way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing? I don’t have anything to do with you,” she demanded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve got a headache listening to your whining. Keep your nonsense to yourself, will you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha? By the way, what? Tryin’ to be cool?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I tower over her by ten centimeters, her demeanor remained the same. Appearance and physical power did not determine the ranking in society, it seemed.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey–, Akashi–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, from behind Yamabuki, the corner from which I came, a girl appeared out of nowhere. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Short, refreshing hair. Large, slanted eyes. Slightly disheveled green jersey. Her yaeba teeth flashing, Aki Hiura made her entrance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing–. Let’s get back to class–” she said casually like nothing was happening the moment before. And unlike against me, Yamabuki thought twice before speaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hn? What? I’m just picking up this idiot and Yuzuki. They say they&#8217;re gonna treat  me to ice cream.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When did that happen…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But thanks to her, things seemed to settle down. That was getting quite dangerous even for me…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whatever with that dumb guy, but we’re talking, Yuzuki and I,” claimed Yamabuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “That was a talk? I thought you’re barking by yourself.” Hiura shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An awkward triangle formed as Hiura took both our hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t make yourself my enemy. Do you know the consequences?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If there’s any consequence, it’d be your side. In the first place, assaulting people because you lost a tennis match to them, what are you, a neighborhood brat? That’s precisely why you stop at Plus Four.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh!? I-if that’s so then you too!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not trying to anyway. Why would I have any interest in a fancy title that can’t buy me lunch?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;!” Yamabuki finally backed down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We quickly left the place and broke up. Hiura asked me nothing, “Give me ice cream tomorrow–”, and she was gone. Looking at her slender back, I realized how dependable she was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t just go off without treating her one now.</span></p>

<p><strong>[TN: There&#8217;s no redemption for Yamabuki, so feel free to hate her]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The other times aren&#8217;t rowdy like that, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just to be sure, we left the school separately before meeting up at Cafe Proof.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The topic was, undoubtedly, the ruckus earlier. Minato seemed to have calmed down and began explaining the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Except for the occasional glare, there’s nothing like this…” her tone was matter-of-fact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In short, the confrontation today was because of the operation, with the tennis match as the trigger.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that’s my guess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both sipped our drinks there. Mine was cider, Minato’s lemon tea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry about that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It wasn’t like this was out of my expectation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The act of widening her human relation to attain more crushes, the surrounding wasn’t aware of that. It wouldn’t be strange if that caused unease to some people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with the whole Kuze’s Top Three thing to consider…</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That things turn out like this, it’s totally my fault. And earlier, I just jumped in without thinking…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head weakly. “N-no, we decided to do that together. And for jumping in… you saved me, so thanks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if the aggression continues, I need to prepare some backup plans for them too. My hands were full as it was, I couldn’t let this spiral out of control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most importantly, she was already shaken as it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just making sure this doesn’t weigh on you.”</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hn?” She tilted her head slightly in response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn’t sure that she would still hold on to it or not, but better get it out the way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">not </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">a bitch”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Her eyes widened for a moment, then she muttered, “Yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not like you’re going around and making people fall for you, it’s the opposite, you’re the one falling for them. You’re just getting to know other people as your classmate, if they’ve come to like you, that&#8217;s just the result. No matter what, you’ve got no ill will, you’re not in the wrong.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… I know. Understood.” As if to convince herself, she nodded several times.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She might understand that by logic, she wasn’t wrong, but being condemned like that would make anyone uncomfortable. I couldn’t just turn a blind eye to it, taking responsibility was the least I could do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine, really. I’ve made up my mind, it’s okay. Just…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A deep, and a bit painful, breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just, it hurted more than I thought. Nothing serious though.” She gave me a wry smile.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you say so. Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No point in pushing the matter. Besides, she’s strong. Up until now, she had followed my instructions on her own accord. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only if other consultants could be as compliant as her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then, being in the Top Three must be a lot of trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that…” She screwed her face. “Yeah, nothing but a nuisance. I’m not proud of the title, with those demerits, I’d be better off without. That’s not including what happened today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard Hiura saying the same thing,” I recalled, “Annoying nuisance or something. And that’s just Plus Four alone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coming to school one day and finding out about the entitlement. No chance to refuse, nowhere to resign, just like a cursed item.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hoh, that’s an unusual analogy for a top student. By any chance, she’s a gamer?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then again, Kuze’s Top Three and Plus Four are more troublesome than it seemed. It was a kind of a proof of popularity, and quite prestigious at that, so I thought most of the girls probably longed for it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Hiura-san, why did she help us? A friend of yours?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hn? Yup.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I forgot to mention that. Yeah, this is a good opportunity to tell her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She knows I’m the Angel. She must have guessed that you’re my consultant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Okay…” Her face flashed with anxiety, and a little of surprise. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From then, I explained that she was one of the collaborators and had helped in this case too. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura probably thought of Minato as my consultant’s target, but now she must have noticed that Minato herself was the consultant. And hence she came all the way to help us, I suppose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also Miwa Reiji from the same class, I ask for his help sometimes. I’m not sure how much he knows about your case, though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Miwa-kun…” She muttered and threw her eyes upward, trying to remember.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was quite popular, so his name might have ring some bells.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you tell them? About the Angel thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm… I’ve been friends with Reiji for a long time, so hiding things from him isn’t an easy task.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He might have looked like he was fooling around, but his guesses were spot on. Better tell him the whole thing than waiting for him to find out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And Hiura-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiura? Well… A lot happened. Nothing confidential, just a long story, so next time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay… Somehow, you and Hiura-san make quite a strange combo.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I think so too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, we seemed like the type to live in different worlds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Almost forgot. Let’s check today’s catch.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A… Unn. ‘Kay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing that she nodded, I offered my right hand. After a deep breath, she took it to her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How many times had my palm touched her face, I wondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And from now, how many more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Distracted by these thoughts, I missed most of the faces I had seen</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇ </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s drop the pace, I came to that conclusion, until the tension from the Yamabuki incident cooled down, but she refused, “Then we’ll never get anywhere”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, I continued to observe her. If that was what she wanted, then I won’t stop her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had something to do after school today, so the meeting would be a short one on the rooftop. The door clicked effortlessly and Minato pulled me out, the rest was as usual. The number remained the same today. Finishing the business, we headed back down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She went down first while I hung around. After a good time had passed, I exited the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm, unlike at the cafe, touching her face inside school was somewhat agitating…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Akashi-kun, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the school gate, the corner of the first block heading to the station, someone called my name.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is this called?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, yup, yup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dejavu” I sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We need to talk. Important one.” Soft, yet carried through clearly and confidently.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The owner of the voice, Minato’s friend. The red rimmed Fujinami Shiho was scowling with her lovely face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t waste your cute face with me, and, that’s scary, stop please!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to ask, “What would it be…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You knew. Minato,” she pronounced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, damn it…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes darted around cautiously before beckoning me to follow into an alley. Fortunately, it had been a while since school ended, so no students were around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it also meant that she had gone all the way to wait for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a final glance at the outside world. “So… What’s with Yuzuki?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Yuzuki’? How cold. You were calling her Minato earlier, no?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I breathed in sharply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She heard?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And by “earlier”, when?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rooftop. I saw you went in. You called her ‘Minato’ then”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you even there? I don’t think you’d happen to be there.” There goes my pitiful attempt at parrying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That girl, she was acting strange, so I’ve been keeping an eye. Besides, the same goes for you, what are you doing there?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, she was keeping watch. And she probably kept her suspicions to herself, since Minato appeared to know nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I hadn’t expected her to go this far. Moreover, I thought she would try to glean from Minato, not from a complete stranger like me. Speaking of thinking outside the box…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve seen what you were doing. Sorry, but I can’t help it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ngh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart tightened, just like last time. A wave of nausea hit me, I slowly moved to lean onto the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hahhhh… How far had the Angel fallen?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Too much confidential intel leaked. I couldn’t care less about the Angel now, that was my problem alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My concern was Minato’s situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rest assured, I heard nothing after that.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, you two were quite far from the door, and I didn’t intend to listen anyway. But I saw you touching Minaot’s cheek good and clear.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Loud and clear…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wouldn’t think that I was activating a superpower, right? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fijimiya’s expression was grim. On the bright side, she didn’t look like she was angry. Although it wouldn&#8217;t be strange if she told me to stay away from Minato, given what she had seen. Rather, I was pretty sure that this was the purpose of this meeting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lately, you’ve been to our class on a daily basis,” she observed, “And you were looking at Minato. That itself was normal, but your gaze was different from others, you have no feelings for her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not normal ones,” she agreed, “But I’m her best friend, I’ll go that far for her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She faced me, unfazed. HEr eyes were menacing, as if to assimilate me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’d really like to avoid making this girl my enemy, but I just can’t explain everything…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I remained silent, she looked at me contemplatively, then continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re not harassing her. She doesn’t mind you touching her cheek, I can see it.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If she doesn’t tell me, then it must be something that she doesn’t want anyone to know. I respect her decision, I won’t ask her nor you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But if you hurt her in any way, I won’t let you off the hook. Even if she’s okay with it, I’m not.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And was that frustration?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clenched my fists. She came all the way here just for that? For the sake of her friend. Fijimiya was probably worried about Minato, yet still trusted her. And so she called me out to ascertain a liability like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could finally begin to understand why they get along so well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s all I have to say. Really, please. Support her in my stead…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will assist her, but that’s all I can. But you, you can support her feelings. You are her friend. And a good person. So, help her. If she were to act strange, or someone like me poking their nose around her, do like what you have done before, be her friend.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I only had this useless power, persistence, and experience. Angel was, in the end, a relationship advice, not the relationship itself. The one who could actually help Minato was Fujinami, not me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: Yeah, I want an illust of this ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll take care of tha I can! The rest I’ll leave it to you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hoh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave me a thumbs up with a goofy grin. Well, I suppose the negotiations were successful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, her character was a bit different from her image…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s more, things happened here’s a secret to Minato, ‘kay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? But, really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! And about that, I don’t really understand tho!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah?” What now…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t let you touch somewhere other than her cheeks, be warned, got it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, about that… “I won’t”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At times like this, answer immediately, will you?” Seeing my reaction, she then giggled and waved her hand to indicate that that was a joke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, she doesn’t trust me…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I probably won&#8217;t anyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if it was hands, we’re holding that quite often.</span></p>
