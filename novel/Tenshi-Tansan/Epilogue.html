<h3>Epilogue</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Three days’ suspension!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujimiya sent me the message as if it was something to be celebrated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still worried about her, I called. I flopped down on the bed and waited. She picked up soon after and began her tale grudgingly and happily, if those two emotions could coexist. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Whyyy, why only meee–. There’s a proprietor right there! Ahhh, I was used, why wouldn’t anyone pity mee.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I covered the phone’s microphone and sighed, Fujimiya better not hear that. “You did a good job covering me, thanks…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“That was rough too, hmph! The interrogating guidance teacher was real scary, like, dude.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did you even get away…” Really, this girl amazes me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“That’s where I, Fujimiya, the woman of steel, comes in! Besides, the broadcast got rid of the rumors on their behalf, good for them.” I could feel her pouting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, lucky. God bless their understanding.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“I kindly ask you to appreciate my hard work and suspension from school more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Kay, ‘kay. Thanks, Fujimiya.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, if I got caught too, that would be real pain…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or it could be all for naught if that bitch Yamabuki tattles. Better hope that blackmail was enough.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You talked to Minato?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Already. Another round of crying, ahaha. We’ve made up, maybe?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, good for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“She’s skipping school to play at my place during suspension. Keep an eye for us, yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah,” I said without delay. That way, she could have her long awaited rest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Thank you, Io”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“We’re comrade, right? Minato Elite Guard Squadron.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When did I sign up?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Address your colonel properly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Will you listen to me…”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to school the next day. From the lack of attention, my cover was still up. Hello there, I’m Akashi Io, nobody of import.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The damp, stagnant brooding of the rumor completely vanished. There was still gossiping, but none about Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You got to hear the broadcast yesterday? That was crazy!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I appreciate your sentiment, but, uh, have you been listening to the contents?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Never thought it would be real. No, not ‘it’, he, right? I hadn’t imagined that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ore </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">in the end, right? If so, then do you think he’s a student or one of the staff?”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Yep, the </b><b><i>ore</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>watashi</i></b><b> thingy again]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">F… why are you guys so obsessed with pronouns I use… Hmph, I need to watch my every word, don’t I? Also, didn’t I tell you not to search for my identity?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t tell over the voice change, that cracking the static was awful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hm? Sorry for your inconvenience, but I need that voice change precisely because of people like you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I reached the hallway, I noticed another crowd. I stood on my toes and got a better look. On the bulletin board, several sheets of paper were pinned. From a distance, it appeared to be similar to club advertisements…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some strange announcement?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[To Angel. We’ve got this!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don’t we all have a secret to keep? Are you guys an idiot…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmph, but thanks anyway. Thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my own smile, I pressed my lips together and quickly went down the hall. Can’t afford anyone noticing that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I need to apologize to Makino about the doomed confession, don’t I…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Three days later, Minato send me this message, [I’m at Akashi-san’s cafe]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I already had a shift today, so I’d have gone there nonetheless though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spotted a familiar figure at our usual table, so I headed there first. Minato was wearing the same clothes as the day we went to Kyoto. Bring back memories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I felt like she was avoiding looking this way. The pace at which she drank her cider was also fast, as if agitated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> Wait, she’s drinking cider?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have something to tell you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That is?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cleared her throat and turned to the side. Her mouth was twitching a little as she forced her eyes to look my way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was blushing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Falling-in-love Peculiarity, it’s gone.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What…?” Wait, what’s she saying?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said! It’s gone! The consultation’s over now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> “Huh, but, no… Really? That easy? How did you even–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cut over me. “Just trust me! It’s my mind, I know it’s really gone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t I tell you love isn’t about conscious thoughts only… I’ll check, give me your cheek.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-never!! Don’t you ever!!” She scrambled away from my reaching hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, at least–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said no!! That’s all for today! I’m going! Dummy!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She drank the remaining cider in one go and hastily paid the bill. The next moment, she was rushing away from the cafe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let my still outreached hand drop “What…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And what’s with the “dummy” in the end? Is it really gone?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Io–” Yukito called out to me with his usual smirk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your shift, get to work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it, got it” I grudgingly stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And then.” He flashed a knowing smile. “You’ve got to move on yourself too.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just the usual nosy cousin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know… But people have their own pace, right? I just have to go slower.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I’m still busy pushing someone else’s back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s what being the Angel of Kuze High means.</span></p>
