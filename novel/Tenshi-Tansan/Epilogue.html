<h3>Epilogue</h3>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was a blessing that none of us caught a cold that day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ultimately, I had hit my lowest score on that exam. I think I must have failed a lot. Well, with what happened, how could I concentrate on studying.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I heard the make-up classes will be during the summer break,” for some reason, Mikage remarked happily.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t wanna,” I groaned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m looking forward to it though, this is my first.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re too optimistic.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why don’t you study well in the first place?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“See? It’s a dilemma. I don’t wanna study, and I don’t want make-up classes either.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Goodness, you’re greedy.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, listen to me, I was only being honest here. She also has to take make-up classes too, so why was I the only one that looked bad in this situation?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I roll down on the concrete. Now that the test had ended, the hustle and bustle of students doing club activities echoed through the schoolground.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Say, Akashi-kun. Why did you care so much about me?”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The rooftop breeze brushed Mikage’s bright hair. Her white skin was dazzling as they reflected sunlight.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: Japan’s summer sunlight actually tunes up the visual contrast and brilliance considerably.]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ve come to know the real you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And you said you want to be someone you can be proud of.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I did.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Someone said the same words to me before, it kinda saved me.” If I hadn’t met her, I wouldn’t have come to terms with myself, with my powers. “But that person also said, ‘Life’s more fun this way.’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But you weren’t having fun. It goes against everything I know…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She then lay down on the floor next to me. My breath stuck. Flushing a little, she grinned.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Io-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, I like the sound of it, Io-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Want me to stop?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s not what I said…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then it’s decided, Io-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She giggled.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Despite everything that happened between us, she still remained a mystery to me.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s how…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hiura, Reiji, Minato, and Fujimiya. After explaining everything to the other four rooftop regulars.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nice to have your acquaintance.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Please take care of her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage and I both bowed our heads.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I could hear Hiura’s sigh of exasperation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what does this mean?” Minato sounded like she had a hard time believing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Fujimiya had a warm smile, and Reiji was smirking.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“He wants you to be my friend,” Mikage answered in my stead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And, of all things, she just had to choose the wording that made it seem like it was my fault.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Just in case, I said my piece, “Well, the more the merrier, don’t you think? Besides, I need someone reliable looking over her.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With Hiura and Reiji together, I doubt there would be any problem. If her charisma caused everyone to fight over her, then these two will be her buffer. For the other two girls, well, they might be of some emotional support.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“In short&mdash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Remember the last time?” Mikage quickly interrupted me. “I really had fun. So… I really want to be friends with you guys.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But well, there might be complications since there’s a group in my class that was pestering me to join. I’ll try to find a way around that, but&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Suddenly, Fujimiya flew in and grabbed Mikage’s hand. “Summer break! Let’s hang out!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“An ice breaking trip! Think of how fun it would be!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, yeah…” Mikage had a faint smile.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh, I almost forgot that Fujimiya had that effect on people.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I second with Shiho,” agreed Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Still, you think it’s a good idea? I’m fine with the rest of us, but Hiura? I don’t think pairing a refined lady with a brute&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Miwa, who helped you with the test?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“My innate instinct.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s enough, you two,” snapped Fujimiya.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The two quickly fell silent.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ooh, I think Fujimiya was doing great at solidifying her place in this group.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“First off, girl’s night at Minato’s place!!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I-I don’t mind, but I only have two futons…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yuzuki and Fujimiya can take the floor.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“W-why!? The futon is enough for four! If we squeeze a little bit…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But that’s my house…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t mind sleeping on the floor,” offered Mikage innocently.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No, no, you’re the main guest.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Engrossed in their own talk, I was left with Reiji.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Girls.” Reiji gave me a meaningful look. “Why don’t we do a sleepover too?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Do it with your dad.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then, Mikage pulled off from the group and&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, Io-kun, let’s go out after this, ‘kay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">““Io-kun?”” Everyone said in unison.</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/vol2enddd.png" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s this? What’s this? When did you two call each other by first name?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I just felt like it a moment ago.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I-Io… you’re… okay with this?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uh, huh? Umm, I guess?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmph.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By the way, you can call me by my first name too. C’mon, ‘Saeka,’ say it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll pass…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then I’ll, Saeka-channnn!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, thanks, Shiho.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ahh, you’re so cool! I’m melting…!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: What is this, Mikage-Fujimiya ship???]</b></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh, what a ruckus.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, I kinda asked for it.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Now, one last thing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hello, Io-kun?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A few nights after, as I was resting in my room after a hard day’s work, I got a call from Mikage, this time not from some roundabout obsolete messenger, but through her newly made LINE.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s up?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I got a confession today. Just so you know.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As expected.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Or rather, I had just talked to Shida.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He had described in detail how she rejected him, but there hadn’t been a shadow of regret in his voice.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now I can finally give it my all for my entrance exams, thanks a lot, Angel!!” With that, he cut the call.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Although I made him keep the confession secret though.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s not the point, is it? He seems happy with how it went.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yeah, a decent guy like him will find a girl in no time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I asked Mikage to let him confess, then nudged him a little… The result is as seen. I apologized to him for being late, and with that, my job was done.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks a lot, Mikage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You’re the one who did most.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I… not really.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“don’t be silly, you really did a lot. Right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well… I guess.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Perhaps so. But to be honest, I had committed too many blunders in this case. Even though I’ve managed to weather past this, I was completely strung out.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I need to have better plans for cases like this.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By the way, how’s the reception?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hmm, let’s see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A few days earlier, Mikage began to hang out with me, Hiura, and Reiji openly. Since she had to come to us during recesses, it was more than obvious. Considering that, I was a little worried about hostilities.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I think it’s Aki’s…uh, reputation? No one has said anything yet…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: Hiura Aki]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, so when it’s me, everyone can get mad all they want. When it’s Hiura no one said a thing. Great.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Seems like it. How can anyone be so cruel to such a cute, kind soul like you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Anyway, it was almost summer break, so there couldn’t possibly be any problem during this duration. I’ll need to think up backup plans during that time too…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And with Minato and co.?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“I’ve gone to that side too.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Did you cause a stir?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“A big one, at that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was to be expected. So far, there hadn’t been much interaction among Kuze’s Top Three, so that’s an incident to behold.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“You’re still keeping distance with Minato at school?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I plan to do that until the second semester. By then, no one would bat an eye.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“looking forward to being with everyone, then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s hope we can do that.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I could feel her smile on the other side of the phone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“By the way, you’ll keep up the Hbiki guise?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Yeah, for a while, it might be until graduation. I feel a little bad about it, but there’s no reason to take that down.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the contrary, if she suddenly opened up and said, “I lied,” that would be problematic. The lie itself said that he lives off-prefecture, so it was pretty solid.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Say, if things turn south, you will be there, right?” she sounded a little uncertain.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll do everything I can.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Thanks, I’m counting on you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although as the Angel, I still wish that people who secretly have a crush on her could confess, despite everything. I could only wish that everyone got to live their lives without any regrets.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait…” Didn’t Shida say… “Mikage.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Hm?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What did you say when you turned down today’s confession?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If I wasn’t mistaken, Shida told me that she said “I already have someone I like,” not “I already have a boyfriend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s…” she went silent.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When she spoke again, her voice somehow sounded like a mix between embarrassed and happy.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“That’s a secret… I guess. Argh, you have no delicacy, Io-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pardon my crudeness, then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;“Haha, well then, later.” For the first time, she quickly hung up the call.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My head was filled with question marks as I stared at the last message she sent.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Let’s hang out together during the break!]</span></p>
