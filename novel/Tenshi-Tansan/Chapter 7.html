<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; The Angel’s Wrath</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saturday, the day after the long talk with Minato. I spent the entire day working with Yukito at the store.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The influx of customers was more than usual today. But somehow, I welcomed it, being busy was better than the alternative.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the day ended, even the veteran Yukito was tired. Now, from the clinks in the kitchen, he was probably fixing a drink. After a while, he came carrying a tray.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I unceremoniously picked the melon soda and took a sip. The prickling in my mouth jolted me awake, and with it, went the fatigue. Soda is supreme. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s your fault we’ve got so many soda menus.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not thanks to me?” I asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no demand, your sodas are guaranteeing a deficit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And although he said that, he still made it for me. Well, I probably never say this out loud, but he was a good guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, good work, Io.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You already said that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not about today’s work. Yesterday’s, I mean.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grunted in accession.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her permission, I had told him what happened between me and Minato, briefly though. I also skipped the, err… emo parts. She probably won’t frequent here like before, so the explanation was like a courtesy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you’re pulling back… No, looking at the long term, right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it was understandable that she wanted to get over it, however, many problems are impossible in the short term.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the cause of her Falling-in-love Peculiarity was really from how she was raised, if it was from her past, then there was only one solution. The past was the past, the only thing that could be done now was what to think about it, how to face it. And to do that, it would be over a span of a few years, at least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because that was what you did?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart dropped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re saying that you need time to forget that senpai?” He stared at me with a calm stare. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still the usual meddlesome cousin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Going slow is okay, you know. But also, don’t mistake standing still as a slow progress, you’d only waste your time like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a hefty gulp of melon soda, swallowing back down a retort.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fizz, fuzz, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">the sorrowful fizzing sounded nostalgic and lovely then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet scent, the dreamy sweet, the coolness. All brought back Ayaha’s smile and laughter. Yes, I can’t move on. How can I? Sodas were just so sweet and endearing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yukito lets out a huff. Then he chuckled softly and stretched his arms. “By the way, if I may be so bold.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I told you…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">” My voice came in a snarl.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, this is to Minato-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To solve a problem, you have to address its cause. That’s a way of thinking. The point is, it’s not the only way.” A hint of smugness crept across his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He held up a finger. The motion was pompous, suited him so infuriatingly well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No offense, but liking someone back because they like you, affection like that are cheap, don’t you think so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her affection was “cheap”?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, it’s still real affection, and I&#8217;m fully aware that sizing someone’s feelings like this is presumptuous, so think of it as an anecdote. She has never fallen head over heels for anyone before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What does that supposed to mean?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My solution to her problem.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His eyes became saturated with childish smugness. Come to think of it. This might be the first time this guy had ever spoken about Minato’s problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She just has to be madly in love with someone. The sort of special someone that you love more than anything in the world. If she could do that, then the affections to anyone else would be insignificant, like how stars can’t outshine the sun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘More than anything in the world’?” I phrased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Silly word, eh? But that kind of thing exists, you know? I thought you’d understand this the best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm. That might actually work, then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It might not work, of course. You don’t just wake up one morning and become madly in love with someone, but there’s a possibility, no matter how slim. So why don’t you tell her that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yukito…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, you’re a better adult than I imagined.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, that didn’t make me happy in the slightest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We then lazily did the closing procedures and headed home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[I found something, let’s talk this monday,] I sent a LINE to Minato before bed.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unease floated in the air.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Monday morning. The atmosphere in the classroom—in the whole school, was off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see many students whispering in a low hush. It was as if a dark shroud of something dominated the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember this kind of atmosphere well. In elementary school, someone in my class got into a fight during recess, and without any conclusion, entered the afternoon classes. Tension, awkwardness, agitation. It was like this, an atmosphere intense with three equal emotions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I could finally rest…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took stock of the entire classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some clustered together and talked in whispers, some looked as dumbfounded as I was, and other reactions all over the place, observing gave away nothing. I racked my brain, coming up with conjectures, but the more I thought, the more mysterious it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In time like this…</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiura.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went for my confidant, Aki Hura. She was the only one with any sense of normalcy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something’s wrong”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She clicked her phone and put it to sleep mode. “Agreed,” she replied curtly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve got any idea? I’m at my wit’s end.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More or less.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whoah! Really?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just when she lit a spark of hope–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I won’t tell you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh? Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How cruel!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m verifying the truth. Everything’s a mess, give me until noon. Hold your tongue, don’t do anything rash.” Hiura then returned to her phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-oh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I didn’t understand why I would do anything rash, but if she said so… It’s frustrating, but for now, I’ll leave it to her. There must have been a reason for her words.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, am I overly reliant on her?</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The strange atmosphere persisted well throughout the morning classes. In fact, it was getting worse. Many curious faces changed to that of grimaces and curiosity. And then–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh, Yuzuki-san, really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That got my attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I half listened to that conversation as it went on, but I already knew what to expect. What Hiura said now made sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I had to agree, there was nothing I could do now. And I had to admit, I would have been running around, making a fool of myself if she hadn’t said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My anger rose until it was nauseating, my heart raced. Somehow suppressing it until noon, I went to Hiura. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumor, word of mouth and through LINE.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah? Contents?” I demanded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She raised her eyebrows. “Hey, calm down. And don’t snap at me, ‘kay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath, the dry rooftop air went in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmph… I got carried away. Focus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sit”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down quietly. We hadn’t brought lunch today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should have noticed by now, it’s about Yuzuki, and it wasn’t good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me about it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura nodded, “Yuzuki Minato is a bitch who toyed with several men in middle school. She came to Shiga to cover it up.” Her mouth twisted in disapproval at every word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A jolt of pain, and then a head splitting headache</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Its origin?” I urged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Working on it. Won’t take long, tracing’s still easy in early stages.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Early stages’? So it’s not today?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Two days prior, saturday. It blew up just now because today’s the first day at school, before that just a small circles like clubs and gossip groups”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…” Another throb of pain.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t even begin to imagine how she would be. Minato…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a question for you too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Question? “Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She furrowed her eyebrows. “If you can, tell me, the rumor, is it for real?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato went out with a few boys to learn more about her Peculiarity. In that sense, “Toyed with several men” was half right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, and she didn’t come here to hide. Although it might seem that way… that wasn’t the truth.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded a few times, looked up a little, and rested her chin on her hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With creeping dread, I asked, “Minato, how is she doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only when I finished the sentence did I realize that I called her name. If Hiura noticed, she didn’t say so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isolated. Everyone kept their distance, even though all they talked about was about her,” She chev=cked my expression. “Don’t even think of going.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damit!” Having nowhere else, I let my anger out with the fist that hit my own lap. It hurted, but that didn’t matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What would you do if you knew the source?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did she have to ask? WHat else would I do? “Make them stop.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How? I know you’re blackmailing master and all, but then what? You know how persistent rumors can be, people </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> gossip.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slammed my fist on the concrete floor hard. “Then what do you want me to do?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t even flinch. Seeing her like this cooled down my temper. And in its stead, helplessness washed over me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato is suffering. And if I mess up, there would be no one left to help her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sighed. “I’ll pin down the conspirator, or conspirators, by tomorrow. Remember, don’t. Do. Anything. Rash. If you try to mess this up, I’ll roundhouse kick your ass.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it… Thanks, Hiura.” I bowed to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it weren’t for her, I would have stormed Minato’s class and made a fool of myself, how remiss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bell rang and the lunch break was over. Through the afternoon classes, I didn’t hear a word.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could I tie this rumor up, how to get rid of a rumor, I racked my brain thinking. By nature, rumors weren’t spread because it was true, but instead the pure amusement of the rumor. No matter how hard I tried to deny it, as long as it was interesting, people would talk. Besides, the Kuze’s Top Three being a bitch, that was a scoop of a lifetime for Kuze High. The fact that Minato didn’t have many friends played in the rumor’s favor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Class ended, but still, nothing came to mind. All I could do was spacing out alone in the deserted classroom.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Can I call you?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ended up sending LINE to Minato. I probably couldn’t mess up if it was through a phone call. Besides, I needed to check on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[No.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The message popped up with a cute, useless, notification sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[And don’t LINE me.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Came another message.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whipped up a few messages to keep her on the line, but she didn’t read.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course…” I muttered. Of course, she wouldn’t want to talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I drained a glass of cola and began thinking. Contacting Fujimiya might be viable, but that wouldn’t help anything, if she could do anything, she would have done it by now. We were both stuck, there was nothing to be done…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Angel, what are you gonna do…” I lay on my back and spoke to the ceiling. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, no answer came.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damnit, think! There must be something I can do…”</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were allowed to say anything, the next day was worse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gone was the confusion and blank faces. Instead,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, her reputation wasn’t that good since before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yup, yup. And that she began talking to other people lately, that must be her nature leaking out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly, I thought so too. Like, back to men hunting business.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whole school was talking about her, labing her as “Bitch” or “Cheater” without any reservation or decency to use softer words at all. Especially the “Cheater” one, that was one of the results of the twisted facts. Already, the rumor got close to saturation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left my things at my desk and went for Hiura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without looking, she greeted, “Yo.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiura, I need your help.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah?” she finally looked up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll go see Minato, come with me, rein me in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay,” she promptly replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It turned out Hiura took my words literally. With my collar caught by Hiura, we went to class seven.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of people in class seven for early morning, the reason was obvious enough. No one talked to Minato, but the situation was bizarre on its own. All they talk was about her from a distance that was clearly apart from her, yet close enough for her to hear. And her position at the edge of the class only emphasized the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato herself was at her desk, staring out the window. I leaned sideways to get a better look at her,</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/minato.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her eyes glistened unshed tears, her lips were pursed into a thin line. The face of a girl in agony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Minato…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, bringing Hiura with me was the right choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing to do with this rumor, even if we were to deny the rumor, it would come to the impasse of credibility. To prove her innocence in this case meant revealing her aliment, and I doubt that would convince the curious crowd. So in the end, Minato must have reached the same conclusion as me and decided to accept the reality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That couldn’t be easy on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Someone sniffled a giggle and then gave up. She burst out laughing as if there was something hilarious. Minato’s shoulders jumped in fright.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah– what a shock. What a waste of Kuze’s Top Three.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My shoulders jumped too, when I realized who it was. My feet took a step, but then Hiura tugged from behind. She yanked my arms firmly and took hold when I didn’t give up. She was being gentle with me, but she had the strength of an athlete.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She narrowed her eyes and shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I say no.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, this is Hiura. “I guess so.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting hold of the situation, we headed back to our class. Before leaving, my eyes met Fujimiya, she too, was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We found our source.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I sat on the concrete floor, Hiura spoke up. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the sudden, I felt so, so tired. “Yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First year kid, anonymous.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And why is that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She was from the same middle school as Yuzuki. She provided information, not the one who spread it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you know who?” I asked, but I couldn’t expect someone else.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yamabuki Karen”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Figures”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wouldn’t put this past her. More so, Minato just slapped her last week, right before the rumor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first year was threatened by Yamabuki. I’m not sure that he ‘bitch’ was added by her or just the result of the process”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no point in finding out how much she exaggerated, people already did that for her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the slightest nudge by Yamabuki in the starting stages was enough to steer the masses in the direction. And the operation a while ago only worsened the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She did that even though she knew it would turn out like this…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And her goal?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Simply out of spite. Either that or–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Kuze’s Top Three,” said a voice from my right spat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miwa Reiji made his dramatic entrance once again. Although he didn’t look exactly happy this time. He was unusually serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Explain, Miwa,” urged Hiura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He frowned. “That’s what it’s all about. Plus Four didn’t entertain her, so she set her eyes on Top Three. Her beauty had already reached its max, so she just had to pull someone down. The humiliation from the slap didn’t sit well with her either. On the side note, she was the one who added that ‘bitch’, I checked from her cronies.” he puffed up a grin. “Being handsome has its merits.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered how he could look so grim even with a grin. Or perhaps, he was mirroring my own horrid expression. I couldn’t look good right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost immediately after I sent the message, the read tag popped, and a call came from her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Akashi-kun…” She was crying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello.” What should I say… “You’re not well,” I noted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“It’s nothing, carry on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You talked with Minato?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“By LINE, yes. She told me to stay away from her at school though. She told me she didn’t want to put me through it too… That’s all she said…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few moments of silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat back, thinking. Fujimiya must have felt the same thing as me, if not ten times angrier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Akashi-kun…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“I… What should I do?” she asked desperately. “How do I help her? How do you get rid of rumors? And why, why are they so happy talking about her! They didn’t even give her the benefit of doubt! Why?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fujimiya…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“They don’t even know her! They don’t know what kind of girl Minato is, what she thinks, or how she was raised! And yet! Hey! Tell me! Why?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ought to lower the volume, but I found that I didn’t care. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Akashi-kun… What can I do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t answer anything. I knew I should say something, I thought I could think something up during the call. I really am an idiot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, she cried on the phone for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What could I do… Rumors…Angel…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a surprise when something actually clicked into place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fujimiya”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–“Yeah?” she sniffled a trembling breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you say ‘Take care of her’ again?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My first emotion was desolation. The rumor about me was spread across the school in the matter of days. It was so absurd I couldn’t believe the person in question was really me. What have I done to deserve this? Who? Who did this? I had my doubts and anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every day would be a trial from now on… I noted absently. There was no getting around this, nothing to stop this terrible rumor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, let me steer my best friend Shiho and Io, who saved me, clear from this mess. I could never let these two get involved. I limited my contact with them to bare minimum. I was left alone, but that was for the best.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I sat at my desk, doing nothing, maybe they would even lose interest in me. Until then, I just have to endure this until then.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Every time I heard them, it was like small needles picking at my skin, cold, cruel. Tears welled up, every time I managed to stop them was a miracle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I knew, I was thinking about him. How couldn’t I?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kind, so kind. Maybe too kind. Even after the loss of the girl he loves, he didn’t give up–couldn’t give up. How hard must it be for him to be standing like this. How much strength does it take to help others like me, even if he himself was in pain like that? </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I had lied to him. And yet, he helped me earnestly. He can’t change the past, Ayaha won’t be back no matter how hard he wept, he had said. My past was unchangeable. I was already raised this way, what I did in middle school was already done. The fact that I had dated several boys will never go away.</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Change how you face it. It will take time, but that’s okay, he told me. I was happy back then, even though nothing was solved, but it </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">did </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">help. He was right, it’d be okay, everything would turn out fine, in due’s time. </span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I’m sorry, Io.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, it’s her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a small shrine next to Kuze High, we went to the playground there. It was surrounded by hedges the height of a grown person.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A part of me didn’t care. What’s worse than this rumor? Perhaps by being beaten by Yamabuki might get me some sympathy, might make the rumor stop. A part of me hoped it would happen. There was no end to this, at the very least, I should get used to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alas,  her voice lacked her usual arrogance, she seemed subdued, even. “You now understand? Now hand me the Top Three.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A shadow against the hedge, moving towards her. A voice I had come to get used, pitched lower than usual in an over-the-top manner. The voice of the person I wanted to hear the most, the person I wished he would come.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fixing the little microphone on his lapel, he entered the playground.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Tch, tch</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, he clicked his tongue. “Be careful, okay? We’re in the middle of a live stream, okay? Let’s not mention each other’s name. Well, you can’t possibly know my name though.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki paused, trying to figure out what he meant. Me too, sagged against something, but I couldn’t care.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took his hand off the mic and spread his arms as if giving a speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nice to meet you, club people of Kuze High, I suppose the go-home club will have to catch up to this later. No, no, not ‘nice to meet you’– It’s been a while since I have seen some of you. This is the Angel of Kuze High speaking. Hm, thinking back, this is my first time speaking in public, so maybe ‘Nice to meet you’ was proper.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the school building peeking from the trees. A moment later, an echo of his speech reached her ears. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Either ‘The Angel was real’, or ‘Someone’s faking’, think about this however you want, but let me say my piece. Let me borrow the broadcast room for a moment. Sorry for using a voice changer, but it’s my policy. Also, I am not inside the broadcast room, so there’s no point in going there. Think of this as listening to a radio and resume your club activities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He covered the mic again and took a deep breath, once, twice. Sweat beaded his forehead and neck, his knee and fingertips were trembling. He was just as scared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if that’s so, why was he doing this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Minato. I’m late.” He gave me a faint smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And on another record, sorry. I should have asked for your permission, but it’s now or never. Get mad at me all you want when this is all over.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He eyed me apologetically before uncovering the mic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To the remaining teachers, I apologize. I know it’s your duty to stop this unauthorized broadcast, but I can’t stop. You might come across Fujimiya Shiho standing guard, she was there on my order, so please refrain from harsh punishments.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiho? Even her…? And standing guard?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, let me tell you a story.” It was, by all means, dramatic indeed. He glanced at me once. “There is a rumor going around Kuze High right now. Yuzuki Minato, a student in the seventh class of the second year, was a bitch who switched men in middle school, and to lay low, she came to Kuse High. I am sure you all have heard that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />

</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Click</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. His earlier apology now made sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By my honor as the Angel of Kuze High, I declare the rumor falsehood.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki shifted uncomfortably, but like her, she was lost for words. Interrupting during this broadcast could have never gone well for her, she bit back her retort and watched grudgingly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, the truth was according to the rumor, but the context was completely different. This is what happened: I received a plea from Yuzuki Minato, a special case. It wasn’t a normal love consultation but about how she…liked too many people, and had trouble being single-minded.” Through gritted teeth, he went on, “Of course, it was absurd. ‘Kuze’s Top Three have such problems?’, I wondered. However, she was truly troubled. That was why she tried having relationships with men, to find a way of being single-minded. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> was what happened.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He continued speaking, and with it, more of my secrets came to light. But I found that I didn’t care. This was way better than this twisted rumor. This was the only way. And I knew that he did this because he cared for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But there was no cure for Yuzuki’s Falling-in-love Peculiarity, so she decided to remain single. She decided that as long as she still liked several people at once, she would never date anyone. That’s the truth behind the rumor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if I had been freed from a chain I never knew existed. Why did I even keep it a secret? What’s wrong with telling people. Like that, I felt…</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> free.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She had repented for her past. She regretted what she had done, she had called herself ‘the worst’ and ‘selfish JK’. Well, I thought so too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JK_business"><span style="font-weight: 400">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JK_business</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> ]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shut up, Io. There’s no need for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But she also said that she </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">will </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">get it fixed. She will do anything, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">anything</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, to become normal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And you said you would do anything in your power to help me too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wuzuki and I tried everything. We met up and thought about it over and over. In the end, we got no clue. She even cried when we concluded that there’s no way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, he cooked that part up. Bad guy. Hm, although I did cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the end, she’s still a ‘selfish JK’. However, she won’t answer to any confession and won’t date anyone until she gets rid of her condition. Please understand that she never had the intention to play with anyone’s emotions. To Yuzuki fans out there, confess to her all you want, but you stand no chance.” A smile touched his lips as he loosened himself. A bit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Idiot, that was unnecessary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way,” his relaxed posture disappeared as fast as it had come. He eyed Yamabuki dangerously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You guys have quite enjoyed that rumor, huh. Have you ever considered her feelings? I know,” he then said softly, “I knew people love rumors. All the more if it was in a bad way. How was it? The unseen face of the school beauty? Hilarious, wasn’t it? Amusing, no? Let’s add some spice, let’s assume, why not? It was the person in question’s fault, you’re delivering justice?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The earlier whisper rose into a crescendo. His cold rage was overwhelming. How would the students react, I wondered. Even I got goosebumps listening to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard it from someone else, if it’s false then it’s not my fault. If it’s true then all the more reason to spread the rumor. She can’t resist, so let’s get a peek. She deserved this, so let her hear when she walked past. It’s fun, isn’t it? Everyone’s doing this. What a pity, but that’s her problem, I don’t care!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been holding back all along, yet…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I had come to terms with this, yet…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have fun? After listening to me, is it still fun? You still dare call her a bitch? If you still then I won’t say anything, have fun with your club activities. Do anything you want, I don’t want to waste my time on creatures like you. But if you have any feeling of guilt befitting a proper human being, listen…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw his face. When I heard his indignant cries…</span></p>

<p><b>[TN: Pardon the language.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuck off</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">!!!!!!!!!!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears got the better of me. One… two… then a stream of tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She had struggled, had been tormented!! She had been blaming herself for who knows how long!!!! She had suffered more than she deserved to, and when she was about to move on!!!! What was done was done!! There’s a punishment, but it’s not your fucking role!!!! It should be between her and those men she dated, not you!!!! Face the truth!! Live with it!! Never say you didn’t know!! I’ll never let you trample on her feelings ever again!!!!!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gasped and blinked repeatedly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Against my will, I started whimpering. I can’t stop&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The past was hers and hers alone!!!! No matter what kind of love it was, it’s not your plaything!!!! Listen with your damn ears, those shits who started this rumor-!!!!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aah, Io…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You’re… You’re truly…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t sully people’s past and their love with your filthy hands—!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to take a good look at you, yet…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet the tears blurred your face…</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Io!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I wanted to scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to cry out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to say thank you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I just sat there dazedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not yet, the rational part of me said. The mic was still on. Yamabuki was still there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Io cleared his throat once. “Apologize, I went off track. One last thing,” he inserted quickly, “ if you really wanted a rumor material, then feel free to use me. The Angel is not an urban legend. I am real, and I have always been looking over your love. When you’re troubling with your romances, please expect my helping hand. However, I am not quite good with special cases like Yuzuki this time, so please be gentle with me. And if possible, I would appreciate it if you don’t search for my true identity, that should be the best for both of us.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silence. Silence of resignation and determination. It couldn’t be easy for him to come to light like that, but for my sake…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And those of you I have met in the past, please take care of the remaining Yuzuki rumors. With that, I’ll consider what you owe me even. Please, do me a favor. Now, if you’ll excuse me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He unceremoniously took off the microphone and shoved it into his pocket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, Yamabuki,” he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She winced. “Heih?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t forgive you, remember that. This isn’t me letting you go–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?! What’s with that cringe speech! Do you even have any proof that I did?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Didn’t you just admit earlier? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was probab;y rattled by Io, I sighed inwardly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Proof? Is there any proof needed? Do you, when you spread this rumor? I have no intention of listening to your excuses, so shut up.” He took a step closer. “Apologize to her. Grovel to her feet. If you ever dare do this again, and I’ll call the mob on you. Wanna headline? ‘Yamabuki, bitch who would do anything for the limelight’? I’ll show you a hell you can’t even imagine, and it </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">won’t</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> end. I’ll personally make sure that the label sticks with you until the day you die.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hell…die… I knew it, he’s the devil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-who do you think you are? Whatever with the Angel, but I already know who you are? I’ll make sure the whole school knows!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, that’s badd, pleasee, don’t!” he burst out laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s a waste of time, Yamabuki. I tried that once, didn’t work. Not at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He clutched his sides and laughed as if it was the most hilarious joke he had ever heard. “Ahaha, you can’t even comprehend how much trouble you’re in if you do that! What an idiot!” Another fit of laughter. He then continued between wheezes, “Hey, idiot, I don’t care, just apologize, will you?” There was a cold menace in his words, it was even more disturbing than plain threats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared back definitely like a cornered dog, but finally gave in to Io’s pressuring glare. Yamabuki gritted her teeth audibly before she slowly bowed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think I’d forgive you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry… I overdid it, maybe. I won’t do it again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wiped my cheeks, dabbled the corner of my eyes with the blazer’s sleeve. I leaned closer to yamabuki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Da───mn you!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that I was another idiot here. But, I see, it felt good, as if a weight was lifted from my shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki stepped back in surprise and her mouth was half open. She looked a bit like an idiot, as Io would say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Io sniffled approvingly and joined, “Well, I have one more bad news for you.” He sucked in a breath. “Even Minato fell from Kuze’s Top Three, it won’t be you who got promoted! Please, know your place!! You probably ranked last in Plus Four!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ngh!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yamabuki’s mouth worked silently, stunned. Her shoulders shook and her cheeks turned bright red. Her lips parted and she cried out, “T-tch! I-I am not! You two…!! You’re the idiot here—!!” Tears and makeup smudged her face. Seemingly unable to think of a better retort, Yamabuki ran away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Remember the headline! Don’t try anything silly!!” Io shouted after her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Io…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Finally over, I suppose.” he gave me a tired grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing his lopsided smile, my heart skipped a beat. When was the last time I met him? Days? A week? It seemed like ages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Otsukare</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, you did great.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, that’s right. I had been holding back ever since then. I…!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waaaaaaaaaaahhhh───── !!!!!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sorry. Thank you, Io. Io. Io. Io!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow! Minato! You’re strangling me! Don’t bury your face in my chest! Ahh…!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you come here! Why?! Why risk your identity! Why did you use all the favors for me! Why is Shiho even there! Why?! Why did you go to such length… for me…!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, oi, don’t ask me all at once. Today was a test run, just checking the broadcasting. Saw you going somewhere with Yamabuki, so I moved up the schedule. I don’t have the manpower, so I asked Fujimiya.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-oh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I told your secret to the entire school. But that’s the only way to counter the rumors. You weren’t responding to my calls, so I got the ok from Fujimiya… not that it excuses my actions. You can get angry all you want now, I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know… but what you did. I can’t blame you. And your secret…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m fine. I’ve taken precautions. Even if it manages to slip, then I’ll just hole up in my house,” he assured, “I have everything planned out.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But! You don’t need to…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn’t I say I’d help you? I’m fine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart squeezed. Somehow, my arms decided to hold on to him tighter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I need something with as much impact as Kuze’s Top Three. A speech from Angel was my only card strong enough to counter it. Like it or not, you’re damn popular.” </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, he laughed smugly. “Actually, the favor my consultants owe me, I can’t find a better way of using them anyway. I told you, right? There’s a lot who owed it to me out there,” he said amusedly. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His secrets, the favors he saved up until now… all for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He really is an idiot, huh? And–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, this should settle things down. So… cheer up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… Yep.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I might not be able to cheer up now, but at least I felt relieved. I can’t be sure if anyone would actually listen to him, but as long as he is here, maybe everything will turn out just fine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This person–Io, would surely see me to the end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Andd… When will you be letting me go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m still crying.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a handkerchief” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want you to see me crying”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a pity. I wanted to see a beauty’s crying face again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think both of us overused that word today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Io?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, really.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He put a hand on my back and began patting. With his motions, more tears came. I buried deeper into his chest and continued sobbing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How embarrassing it would have been, if someone saw us like this, I wondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that I’d pull away from him. Can I stay like this forever?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, Minato.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I sent you a message sometime before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The day before the rumor?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll talk about it, just listen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this really the time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It should be good news to you. I’ve been waiting to tell you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With us still hugging?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re the one clinging to me,” he sighed exasperatedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His hot breath fell on my head, my shoulders jumped. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since a while ago, my body’s been acting weird.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I talked with Yukito. He said that there’s another way of fixing the Peculiarity of yours.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“???” What?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh… You just have to be…” An awkward pause, “madly in love… with someone.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mad in love?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… Someone you really, really like, so much that others seem insignificant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, really like…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just a speculation. Just so you know there might be an alternative. I get it, being mad in love isn’t something you can do just by thinking. It might be a while until you find the guy, but… let’s keep trying until then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh…” A sigh escaped my lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is this emotion? Why do I feel so happy yet annoyed…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehh, you don’t look so happy. We got a new theory though?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not going to work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, why? The theory itself makes sense, it’s probability is also high too, despite the time it might take.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It won’t! We’re done with this theory!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could sense his quizzical look even without looking up. “Eh… Okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">sigh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I’m tired.</span></p>
