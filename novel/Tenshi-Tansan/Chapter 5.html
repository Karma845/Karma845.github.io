<h3>Chapter 5: So, As Friends</h3>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We had mathematics on Monday.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Like how messed up “Sangetsuki” was, I drew incomprehensible vector arrows in the vector field.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Sangetsuki or Tiger-Poet was a classic from 1942 that spoke of inner discordance and transformation, blah blah blah.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I noted the ring of the chime.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hoh? So it’s time?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, from the looks of it, I wouldn’t have to take make-up classes. My points should be just enough for math…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? Hiura?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What’s with that refreshed face…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While not as good as Minato, I had to admit that her scores were quite lofty.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re a free man now, don’t cha. Let’s have lunch.” She lobbed her pack on her back and grabbed me by the shirt. A short while later, Reiji joined us, yawning.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Normally, the three of us would stop off somewhere on the way home and study for a bit. That was how it was supposed to go.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry, can’t make it today either.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whattt? What’s with you!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage-chan?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Shh, a little quiet, will you?” Like, keep it down! I don’t need any more attention.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This is the last time, forgive me…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No shit.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Absolutely last time.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She let my shirt go like a child throwing away old toys.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I got back to my seat, rechecking the mail. At the top of my mail inbox, I had mail from Mikage last night. I took some time convincing myself this was real.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Can I have your time after school tomorrow? The entirety of it.]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I went home and quickly changed into my casual clothes. I put the bare minimum of my belongings in my bag and left the house again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">[Meet me at Kyoto station.]</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I did that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I stepped out onto the platform and looked at my phone again. She still hadn’t told me at which ticket gate I was to meet him.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ya, Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She smiled amiably at my befuddled face. The question died in my throat, seeing her in casual clothes had that effect.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She wore a white blouse, the type that exposed the shoulders. Her long, slender legs stretched out from a red flared skirt of softer color with a cinched waist. A combination of cuteness and maturity was quite different from the rough outfit she wore when I met her at Proof before. Besides, she looked even more stylish than usual.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She winked once and spun around to show her entire body when she noticed my gaze. Her skirt flared and her hair flowed. Her white thighs were exposed momentarily, followed by a sweet smell.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I felt a jolt of consciousness. With a&nbsp; whimper, I turned my head away.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, no, you have to look at me properly. I picked this just for you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t be ridiculous…”Seriously, that’s too provocative.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re early,” she noted, “Thought I’d have to wait a bit more.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re earlier than me,” I retorted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If I was right, she lived further from me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t you come early for a date?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“D-date?!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This was a date?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“When a boy and a girl go out together, that’s called a date.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s not always the case…” If I were to go by that definition, I’d have been on a date with Hiura countless times already.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17"><br class="rd_sidebar-name" />
</span><span class="calibre17">“Whatever you say. C’mon, this way.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hey, wait.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She walked off on her own. I went after her as she hopped up the stairs, then down to the opposite platform.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Wait, don’t you tell me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Where do you think you’re going…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm, I wonder where.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This girl… What’s her deal?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Mikage, one thing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm? What’s it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Didn’t you say ‘date?’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Hey, don’t just “yup.” Don’t you have a boyfriend?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I know that you don’t really have any feelings for Hibiki, but aren’t you dating? I don’t think we should do this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No matter the deal we had, there was no way I could go along with this. She should have known better.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It’s alright. Totes alright.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s alright?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘Hibiki-kun’ doesn’t exist.”</span></p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/mikage.png" alt="" class="02" />

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Doesn’t exist?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Doesn’t exist?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Pop, pop, pop,</span></i><span class="calibre17"> question marks filled my head like popcorn.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She frowned, her expression fuzzled a little.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Limited express, bound for Himeji,” said the announcer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was her cue.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s go, Akashi-kun.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘Hibiki-kun’ is a character I created.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Perhaps because it was a weekday afternoon, we practically had the train all for ourselves. We found a doorside seat and sat there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Appearance, character settings, name. I made it all up. I do feel a little bad for him, existing to be my scapegoat. Haha, why am I even feeling sorry for an imaginary character.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The train rattled on.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her shoulder bumped mine. I shy away. “Did you notice he’s too good to be real? I can’t figure out the right amount so I kinda maxed out his stats.” A tired, wry smile escaped Mikage’s lips.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Childhood friends, handsome, kind, go to a good university, and is a model. Maybe it really was too much. I wasn’t doubting anything at first since it was Mikage, but now… it did sound unrealistic.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, anyway, let’s get on with today’s date, ‘kay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So this was what I got wrong. She wasn’t faking a relationship, the other party didn’t exist in the first place.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So that’s how it is…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry, Angel. I’m sorry.” She wouldn’t look at me. Not that I would like to see.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was glad we weren’t sitting across from each other.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And sorry, that’s all I could say for now, the rest have to wait until the end.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s the deal. I don’t mind.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Whoooosh.</span></i><span class="calibre17"> The world plunged into darkness as we entered a tunnel.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you,” her voice almost lost in the wind.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The train dropped its speed as it entered the Osaka Station. As we inched closer, overhanging buildings increased in intensity.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">According to Mikage, this was today’s destination. As soon as I got down to the platform, I was almost swept away by the crowd. I raised my hand to signal who was a little further away. I waded to a corner and waited for her there</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whew.” She dropped by next to me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I can’t believe a station is this large…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup, amazing, right? A dozen kilometers difference between our rural school and this metropolis. Actually this is my first time around here,” she admitted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage was already back to her usual self, looking around with interest.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The ceiling had a dome-like roof, and a glass-walled connecting passageway crossed over the platform. A series of escalators run along this corridor and down to the underground floor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was already feeling confused by the simultaneous feeling of spaciousness and complexity. I thought Kyoto Station was a real deal. Apparently, I was still too naive…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, what’s next on schedule?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Y’know what? I don’t have a schedule.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh? And what’s to be proud of?!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She has no plan? Wait, she did say she hadn’t been here before…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s plenty of spots, cafes or whatever it is ‘round here. Might as well as go with my gut and walk around”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: She’s nothing short of chaotic energy.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not knowing how to react, I decided to let her take the reins. “You lead, I tag along?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s the gist.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t feel like I can trust you…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At her suggestion, we got off the platform and we went down the nearest escalator. After paying for the ride over, we both went through the central ticket gate together. The road quickly split into the north and south exits, and Mikage stopped at the junction.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Which way?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I thought you’re leading.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“My decision tells me to ask you. Will you, Akashi-kun?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whichever way you want.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now that’s just mean.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage pivoted her head back and forth from side to side several times, crossed her arms, and grunted again. After a while, however, she turned towards the north exit and began to walk slowly.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, another escalator.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose you don’t know where it’s going.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Everyone with an eye can tell it’s going up?” She quipped.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s not what I mean.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We appeared from between two buildings, LUCA and another LUCA, which I wasn’t sure what the difference was.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From there, there were several more options, including escalators, exits, and transfer routes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun, in times like this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“We get to the highest point and get a good look.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s pretty much the idiom ‘Fools and smoke likes to be up high’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So I’m a smoke? Sounds cool,” she laughed out loud.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Then, as if on impulse, she took my hand.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-hey!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Here we go, Akashi-kun!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Soft… no, focus. She led me to an elevator. It looked like an older sister pulling along a brother, so I shook free as soon as we hopped on. I had no qualms about experiencing the softness, but I needed to do that. I decided to trust that it was a wise decision.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Gee, you don’t have to be so reserved.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t think reservation has anything to do with this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Soft, wasn’t it,” she whispered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I take that back.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Pulling away was the right call.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, there’s a plaza this high up!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A sign that said “Plaza of Space-time” was in front of the elevator door. Like its name, it was a somewhat mysterious space with a golden pole clock erected. People sure go all-out when designing shopping mall resting areas, huh?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Most people here appeared to be waiting, there were lots of benches for this purpose.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“See that ferris wheel?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why is it so red…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There might be an amusement park here?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No… This place is called Hep Five… The ferris thing’s the only thing around, like a fancy ion, I guess.” Of course, I just got this information from my phone.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s take a break.” Without waiting for me, she sat down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I thought we’ve just got started.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m physically fine, but the crowds and the elevation changes are making me tired,” she complained.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Up high, the air felt fresher.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So walking around like this for the rest of the afternoon?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yup. touring Osaka afterschool during the test period, sounds like a delinquent,” she chuckled.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Wait, so this was why you told me to study plenty last week?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Exactly!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So you’ve already studied.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Nope.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Too bad. Me neither.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So this didn’t really hamper our study, because we don’t do one in the first place. Hopeless kids…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What a crew you’ve assembled.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage suddenly brought up the subject.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Crew?” Did she mean the guys at the rooftop? Probably them.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re quite strange yourself too,” she added.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Why do you think so?” I wasn’t much of a question.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You guys are so calm with me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…” That’s…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Remember when I thought you were a girl and my reasons for it?.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I do.” If anything, it had an impact on me. “I wasn’t interested in you.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And they weren’t?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Unlike last time, she was no longer guilty or cautious.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That day, she told me that everyone tended to pamper her. I could definitely see that happening. The more I got to know her, I could imagine that clearer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“They’re like that to anyone. For Hiura… well, she feared for her directness.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Despite her being such a cute girl?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Minato’s on the same level as you, and Fujimiya’s like that. So none of us had any reason to be overly conscious of you, do we?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You have a point.” Her eyes traced the ferris wheels. It was moments before she continued. “I had fun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hm…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I never knew. It was… That was my first time eating lunch like that&mdash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She said nothing more.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I remember the smile she had on that day.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From the plaza, it seemed that we could still go up.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although we felt like we would have a really late lunch if we went any further. It was our consensus to turn back here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m hungry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">It was something I could fully agree with. After all, I hadn’t eaten anything since the test ended. There must be plenty of places to eat, given how much entertainment there was around here. Hence, it shouldn’t matter where we go, everywhere is equally classy anyway.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Where should we go…” grumbled Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s too many, I can’t choose.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But as we moved on, every place was just as appealing. Not just restaurants, but also countless cafes and snacks lined the street.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pasta… Hamburger… Japanese food…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Conveyor sushi looks cheap enough. Set meals also don’t sound so bad… Anything you want in particular?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We read the signs as we walk past in low voices, as if chanting Buddhist prayers.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We staggered through the station. At this point, I wasn’t sure where we were. Were we still inside the station? Underground? Which way did we come from? I doubt Mikage knew the way better than me, but I let her lead.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I saw a Godiva cafe for the first time. We peeked into a small but atmospheric bookstore. I noticed a ramen shop that was featured on TV. We hurried through a Daiso store that is eight times bigger than the one in Shiga. I looked up at the Yodobashi Camera, which is also huge. There are so many places underground and above ground that you could spend hours just looking at them.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And yet, everyone was walking on quickly, with sure steps.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So this was Osaka…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Never felt like a country bumpkin until now…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I thought we had it good in Shiga…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Overwhelmed by the sights, we agreed to take a break. I slumped into an electric pole somewhere outside the station. Never had the sky seemed so blue.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh.” Mikage looked to the right.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A woman with a guitar was singing in front of the railing by the side of the road. That was probably a street life.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s Aiko’s song.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, you’re right.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not many people were listening. Perhaps that was how street lives were. The guitarist was singing happily nonetheless, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can’t figure out why her songs aren’t more popular.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After all, she is said to be the queen of love songs. Well, her songs were mostly from a woman’s point of view, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Old but gold,” she added.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“She’s still putting out new songs. Not that people listen to it, unfortunately.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Unfortunately.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The most unfortunate.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After that, we silently agreed to listen to the live quietly for a while. The guitarist went through the chronological tracklist. If I remember correctly, the next song would be Melon Soda.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was right.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I closed my eyes and hummed the song in my head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I like her melodies,” said Mikage, “but the lyrics? Can’t really relate. What’s love in the first place?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmm.” That’s another unexpected thing from her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s not count Hibiki-kun, ‘kay?” she chuckled mockingly. “What ‘bout you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re in love?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I found myself unable to answer right away. Which answer wouldn’t be a lie?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, I knew which, I was only afraid to say it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I am, apparently.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, guess so.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t ‘guess so’ me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Although I wasn’t sure that mine actually counted.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In the end, the more we thought, the more choices there were.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We ventured into the Hankyu Sanbangai underground restaurant district and entered a soba place right in front of us.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The waitress gave Mikage a second glance, and a suspicious one at me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I could tell what she was thinking. Why would this girl be hanging out with a guy like me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Excluded from the bustle of the outside world, we slurped the soba.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Zaru soba with tempura was just heavenly.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">After setting down the chopsticks and drinking some tea, Mikage whispered in awe, “This place is amazing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Agreed. This was even larger than Kyoto station.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No, I couldn’t be sure about that, but based on my judgment, Osaka is three times larger. And on that scale, way much easier to get lost.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“People call this place Umeda Dungeon, it seems.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Dungeon?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, it’s sooo big, even with everything cramped together. From what I heard, there’s several ‘Umeda Stations’ here. Umeda, Hankyu Umeda, West Umeda, East Umeda…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ah, that one about ‘People never show up when asked to meet at Umeda Station’?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Who thought about naming all these stations Umeda… the road is as confusing as it is.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I also heard that the road changes every time you go in.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“‘The road’?”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Wait, wait, isn’t that something in RPG games?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tons of renovation and construction work going on has that effect. The fact that these renovations take little time doesn’t help either. And so we have the dungeon,” she explained.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Let’s pray monsters don’t start appearing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She lobbed the last piece of the tempura into her mouth.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Coming without any plan’s another kind of fun, don’t cha think?” She said as we paid the bill.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I shrugged.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Before we got out, she asked me, “Akashi-kun, why are you doing the Angel?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hobby?” I scratched my cheek. That wasn’t a lie. It wasn’t the truth either.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What might give you the idea to do this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You don’t wake up one day and want to give love advice, at least not as seriously as yours. I don’t think the word ‘hobby’ suffices for your obsession.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Looks like you don’t want to talk about it.” She studied my face.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, I don’t mind. That’s what being human is. Just so you know, I don’t want to talk about myself either.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I know.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When put like that, no matter how I tried to justify myself, it still seemed unfair.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She chuckled, “A promise is a promise. I’d say your sheer dedication got the better of me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Whatever she said, guilt remained. Even though it was already too late to turn back.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Although that might not be all to it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Not wanting to talk, and scared of telling someone. I’ve just realized the difference between these two.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I suppose.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I wonder which am I…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her eyes left me and watched the bustle beyond the window.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At least, at least I should do something for her…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It might not be my place to say this, but I wish you wouldn’t regret talking it out to me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thanks.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We resumed our wandering through the underground shopping center, again, at Mikage’s whim. As we walked around looking at our surroundings, I noticed that passersby were frequently glancing in Mikage’s direction, like the waiter at the soba noodle shop we had just been at. Even by metropolitan standards, she was outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">However, among the gazes that were fawning over Mikage, there were more than a few that were clearly hostile toward me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’m sorry, I’m mediocre. I know I don’t deserve to be here.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Feeling somewhat ticked off, I tagged along behind Mikage.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On the way, we bought a donut each at Mister Donut and ate it in the eat-in area before setting off again. As we walked, the walls gradually turned red.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Hep Five’s theme color’s red.]</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I looked at a nearby billboard.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh, we’re in Hep Five underground territory.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The one with the Ferris wheel? It’s a shopping mall, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She quickly went off to the escalator and peeked at the upper floors. Then she rounded back and dragged me to the escalator.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ooooh…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What’s that…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">A gigantic scarlet whale decoration fixed in mid-air. It was ridiculously large. Vertically, the whale boldly strike through the atrium.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But why a whale in a department store?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now that we’re here, let’s see some shops”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Alright, alright, got it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With eager Mikage in the lead, we went around Hep Five. I noticed that people inside the store were significantly younger than those outside, not to say more fashionable.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I can’t read the store names… is that even a Japanese font?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Even the classy Starbucks looks normal here,” she commented.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: Starbucks is dubbed as “hangout spot for extroverts” in Japan]</b></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage repeatedly wandered into this store and that, looked at the shelves, and then left again, all the while making rural folks’ exclamations.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And then she suddenly stared at a pair of socks with an unusual design and took it straight to the cashier.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I couldn’t say if that was her being carefree or unreadable. But she seemed to be enjoying herself, so what could I do?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">By the way, the cashier’s eyes hadn’t left Mikage for a second. Oi, at least keep that down when working.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun, what do you think?” She tried on a black bucket hat.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What do I think…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Looks good.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Elaborate.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It fits you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How much?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17"> really </span></i><span class="calibre17">looks good on you”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Fufu. I see. Thanks.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Satisfied, she returned the hat to the shelf.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I had no idea what that was earlier. What kind of joke was that? Was she teasing me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I shook my head in exasperation and followed her.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What about this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She now had a beige cassock on. It has a one-point buckle on the top of the brim.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“This one looks good too…”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Which do you like better?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Decide for yourself.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t be boring.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I can be boring.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What I actually meant was that they both look ridiculously good on you, idiot.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Next, we went around Hep Five for a while. In spite of her reservations, I offered to carry the bags. Finally, we went up to the eighth floor and entered a small arcade. We played Taiko Drum Master and I lost. In air field hockey, I was leading until about halfway through when she caught up with me just in time and we played to a draw.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In both games, she was like an elementary school kind, yelling and screaming, arms flailing.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now, the penalty for losing.” And there she went, she hadn’t said a word about earlier being a penalty game.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She dragged me to a crane machine with a cat character I don’t know.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You want this?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want this. Cute.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You call this cute…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If anything, it looked weird.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh, or was this the latest trend, the “weirdly cute.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, whatever.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I let the topic drop and compliantly inserted the coin. The cat was quite big, the crane looked weak, but with this type of structure, I can take leverage of the supporting beam… Sorry, ugly cat, I think you’ll fall into my hands soon.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh! Wow! You actually got it!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At my third try, I got the one she wanted out.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Mikage quickly hugged it tight and jumped up and down in elation.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Stop overreacting. Also, your skirt’s short, stop it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun, I don’t think you’d be so good at this! Your drum was terrible! How?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Cough, cough…</span></i><span class="calibre17">it’s Hiura’s fault.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But instead of dolls, Hiura always goes for big packs of snacks and such. We put the cat in the bag the staff gave us and went down the escalator. We could have ridden the Ferris wheel, but Mikage didn’t seem to be interested.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s a lot of photo booths. I’ve never seen that many”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It probably took up half of the game center.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You know, I really want to get a photo with you. If only it weren’t for Yuzuki-san and the others.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t think they would mind?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Reiji might have complained about how it should have been him though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then wanna shot?” she asked.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No will do.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Hmp, see?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What’s with that knowing smile…</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When we finally left Hep Five, it was already dusking outside. Pedestrians and traffic looked like it was at its peak. The scenery was very much like a metropolitan evening seen in movies.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">With the help of signs, we somehow made it back to the Osaka Station. We traced back to the Luca and hitched an elevator ride to the ninth floor.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whoaaa” gasped Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, this is something.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">In front of us was a sizable Tsutaya Bookstore. The layout was a stylish cylinder-shaped loft surrounding the central atrium with the elevators. It even had a coworking space at the entrance.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Actually, I was the one who requested this. When I saw this place on the internet, I knew I had to come.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What is it that you want?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The truth is, I just want to check out the place. Sorry for dragging you here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t mind. I just did the same thing to you earlier, remember? Hehe.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Together, we went through shelves at random. Since we were completely clueless which genre is where, I had got to see a lot of books I usually wouldn’t bother to look at. Combined with the atmosphere of the store, it felt like traveling a foreign country.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">For once today, no one was paying attention to Mikage. I was also able to take it easy myself too. Everyone here was occupied with themselves, and it had an effect on me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I think coming here last was the correct choice.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Uh, Akashi-kun?” She set down the coffee “When I ask whether you have magical powers like in the rumors or not, you said no, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I did…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I braced myself. Why would she bring that up…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well, what if you have one, what would you do with it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Ahh. It was the same question…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&ndash;What would you do if you happened to have magical power?</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This has to be a coincidence. Mikage could never know about Ayaha, nor my power. This was Mikage’s personal curiosity, nothing more.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That depends…If it’s useful then I’d use it, if it’s something I’d get in trouble if found out then I might try to hide it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s…a good take. And what if it’s something you can’t hide.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“How?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If I can’t hide…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I clenched and unclenched my fist under the table. If I can’t then why not not use it in the first place… No, no one would have come to a conclusion about my power. Except for Minato.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What if everyone could tell at first glance that you’re special, what’d you do?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her white eyes pierced through the dim light of the resting corner.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was forced to acknowledge how pretty she was once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">[TN: And there he goes, my guy had no idea she was hinting about herself.]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span class="calibre17">◆　◆　◆</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can you walk me home?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The hour was a little late, so I purposely skipped my station and went along with her to her stop.&nbsp; It was drizzling lightly outside. From the rain clouds above, it wouldn’t take long for this drizzle to become a downpour.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Now what?” She regarded the rain.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">From her tone, I take it that she didn’t mind walking through the rain.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I rummaged through my bag.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The agreement was that I spend the after school with her, which wasn’t over yet. And then there was another reason for this too.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Ooh, a folding umbrella. You’re well prepared, huh.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“The forecast said it would rain this evening.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was the type to check those before going out for the day.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Here.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Thank you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">&nbsp;She easily accepted my umbrella and popped it open. She went outside, then turned to face me.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Well?” She left a space under the umbrella.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What now…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I asked you to walk me home. Is this my home?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Okay, okay.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I gave up and went in beside her. As a courtesy, I took the handle.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">We walked shoulder to shoulder in the small folding umbrella. Across the railroad crossing and down the main street with wide sidewalks, turning onto a narrow street, through it all Mikage hadn’t said a thing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Well, on that part, I hadn’t said a thing either.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">All we could hear was the sound of rain pattering against the umbrella. Eventually, we reached the bottom of an overpass.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">As I was about to walk through it, she stopped.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There wasn’t a soul in sight. This place was perfect for the discussion. Finally, down to business.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s talk, Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">This was what I was waiting for.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Okay, how do I say this?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">This is my first time opening up to someone, so…uh, let’s start from the very beginning.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I have been really pretty since when I was really young.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Hey, don’t give me that look, I’m serious here.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">All the other kids in kindergarten and all the adults, except my parents, always complimented me. Not because they were fond of me, but because I really was striking. It was all about my outer appearance.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I was well aware of my looks early on.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Actually, there are two types of beautiful people. Those who were conscious about it and those who weren’t. I’m not trying to say that one is better than the other.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">But I was definitely the former.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Everyone adores me.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">It was a happy childhood.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I grew up, got prettier, and made a lot of friends. In elementary school, I was the kind of friendly kid that has a lot of friends. I was even scouted as a child actor and model.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I don’t remember much, but I think I said no.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Not that everyday was sunshine and rainbows, though.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">But well, it was peaceful enough.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I got along with everyone… Until one day in grade five. That was the point where kids started to mature. It was then that everything spiraled downhill.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">“Saeka-chan, you’re selfish,” a girl in my class said to me, “Just because you’re cute doesn’t mean you’ll get away with anything.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Looking back, it was a completely baseless accusation.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Hey, stop it. I know that I’ve dragged you around a lot today, but I’m not that selfish, right?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">At that time, though, it was a terrible blow.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">If she only told me I was selfish, it wouldn’t have been a big deal. But criticizing that my appearance made my personality worse? That was the real blow.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Even at that point, I had met some pretty girls who were arrogant and rude, but that was just how they were, wasn’t it? Appearance doesn’t equate to personality.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">My expression might be harsh, but there are ill-mannered people everywhere, beautiful or ugly.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Yes, I know that there are influences, but set that aside for a moment. The point was&mdash;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I don’t want to be judged by my looks.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">That’s the only thing I hated.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I don’t want people to be disappointed when they know my personality. I don’t want to think that I’m like this because I was pampered.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I </span></i><span class="calibre17">won’t</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17"> let that happen.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I was born beautiful. I can’t let that go to waste.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I need to be beautiful, both inside and out.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s how I became the ‘virtuous Mikage’”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She leaned on the supporting pillar of the overpass. The rain had become a torrent, slamming heavily onto the cement. The scent of rain and earth enveloped us.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want to be honest, and kind, and amiable… I don’t know how well I did, but I want to be someone I wouldn’t hate. To be a person that I won’t regret, that’s what I’ve been doing until now.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her quiet, strong voice reached me through the sound of the rain.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">While I couldn’t relate to her feelings, I do see why she would reach such a conclusion.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">On that note, it was laudable that she had decided that since elementary school. Mikage really was amazing.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I think I did tell you something similar?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You did…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That time too, she said she wanted to live up to the expectations of being Kuze’s Top Three.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s just the premise of the part you’re concerned about. There’s more that made me into what I am now, so let’s get going, yeah?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">How she is now…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Isolating herself, creating a fictional boyfriend.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I wondered what happened.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">As a result, even more people gather around me. I got to know more and more people, and I doubt anyone disliked me.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">To put it simply, I had become very popular, among both the boys and girls.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Ah, that’s an overly conceited expression. Phew, at least it was only you here.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">That popularity continued. No, not continued, I got </span></i><span class="calibre17">even more</span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17"> popular.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I thought I was on the right track, until…</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Well, until another incident happened.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">It wasn’t with me, but my surroundings.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">The girls started to fight over who would get to hangout with me. Some went as far as asking who’s more important in my eyes. Groups began to compete in making me join them.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Everyone tried to pamper me.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Then the fights began.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">The girls would get into arguments. And then a guy who confessed to me got harassed by jealous students.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I was in three clubs. Carefully, I went to every one of them equally. That didn’t stop the representatives from cajoling me into quitting the rest.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Everyone was fighting over me.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Middle schoolers sure are notorious for being unnecessarily complicated.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Not that I was any wiser. Spending time with all of them was so fun. I got to go out a lot, talked about various things. I enjoyed those days.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I was so naïve. Not everyone was satisfied with the simple relationships we had. They wanted me all for themselves.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I didn’t know what to do. How could I make them be on good terms again?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">The situation worsened without me being able to do anything about it.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">By the last semester of third year, my class was in the worst shape.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">The feud had grown into something beyond me. The tension was divided among about five different groups, and the atmosphere in the classroom was always tense.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Groupworks? That was a better fuse than any gunpowder. In shadows and in plain sight, the competition raged.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">This wasn’t the middle school life I wanted, and I doubt they do either.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">There was nothing to do now, unfortunately.</span></i></p>


<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">One day, I heard that a guy who confessed to me was beaten up. That was my limit.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I skipped school. Imprisoning myself at home, thought over and over.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">How did this happen?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">What should I do?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Please, why can’t everyone just make up while I’m gone? I wished and prayed with everything I have got.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">At that, Mikage let out a heavy, damp breath. Amidst the pounding sound of the rain, I thought I heard a faint sniffle.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So it was all connected. Her mysterious absence during middle school Reiji reported… That’s what happened then…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“After a while, I came up with an answer.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And that is?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Do not get close to anyone,” she said resolutely, “I won’t belong to anyone, or anything. No clubs, no friends, no relationships.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It only happened because everyone wanted more time with me. No matter how equally I tried to manage my time, there’d be someone who felt unfair. That’s what leads to the hostilities, the arguments.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I know this sounds presumptuous, arrogant and narcissistic, but it’s true. I know it sounds like a situation right from a shojo manga, it’s ridiculous, I know… That’s why I made you hangout with me last week. You can see it, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">There was nothing I could say. Afterall, I could still remember the treatment I got last week.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I shouldn’t have done that. I don’t want to. But I need you to see that I can’t get close with anyone.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I found myself agreeing with her. The cold stares, the whispers, the increasing hostilities. It was all because I was with Mikage.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I thought a week would be fine…Maybe even a week was too much, from how things turned out… I’m sorry.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t be.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Phew, this takes longer than I thought.” Despite looking terribly tired, she projected cheerfulness to her voice. “If it’s too much then just tell me and I’ll stop, ‘kay?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Time skip to last year, when I entered Kuze High.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Not wanting to repeat the same incident, I spent my spring break devising a strategy.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">First of all, I won’t make friends, no exceptions. It was effortless, I just had to put up with being lonely, that’s all. I made sure I joined no group, no affiliations, no clubs.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">If there was group work, then I won’t make any more contact than necessary.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Next, I deleted all my social network apps. These days, it has become easy to keep contact via the internet, and easier to make invitations and such. By doing so, I eliminated the risk of private communications.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">You know, you’re an exception.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Like this, I became everyone’s Mikage. Surrounded by people, yet still alone. If I treat everyone the same, no one would complain.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">It went well. I had a peaceful year. At the price of my loneliness, I prevented the squabble.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">But one thing remained, the confessions.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Friendship is only possible when both parties are willing to. If I don’t accept it they can’t be my friend.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Romantic affections is a different story, though.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Competition is inevitable. It was only normal that you’d feel desperate if the girl you like got confessed by another guy.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I can feel it. This will only get worse.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Of course, I had no intention of getting into a relationship with anyone. I knew full well that if I did, that person would probably get hurt, one way or the other.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Nonetheless, as long as I remain single, it is only natural that people will try their luck on me.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">At first, I lied that I already had someone in mind. It was merely a stopgap measure.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I needed a better deterrent. If only I could do that, everything would turn out fine.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">The first thing that came to my mind was to become a jerk. If my personality is horrible enough, no one would have come to like me. I could also deal with my popularity this way.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I couldn’t do it.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">It went against everything I am. I can’t do that.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">I can’t be satisfied with that either.</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Sinking into a crouch, she buried her face in her knees.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I followed suit and sat down.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">And you’re satisfied with this?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I quickly stop myself from speaking. My words weren’t what she wanted right now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I patted her head.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Don’t touch a girl’s hair without permission.” She didn’t sound mad.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can I have permission, then.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Go ahead.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I went on patting.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I felt terribly tired after this long day. She probably felt the same. Well, we were not done yet, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“That’s why I made up Hibiki-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I pretend I have a boyfriend, no one would have confessed, right?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yeah…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But I can’t ask anyone to play that role, that’s beyond selfish. But what if it’s fictional, what if I could set him up in a way that no one would ever dream of competing with him. If it’s fictional, I can say whatever I want. I thought it was a good idea, to be honest…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“And why the Angel?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">If it was fictional, then why come for my help?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I needed something more.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“More?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“See? The setting is that he’s my childhood friend, and I’ve always liked him, and then with the blessing of the Angel of Kuze High… There’s no better love story than this.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I see…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I shouldn’t have done that. You might have noticed, but well…you might sense what was off, but there’s no way you would’ve guessed the whole story. Maybe I could have gotten away, or so I thought.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You sure were tight lipped.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“It went according to plan, for the most part. Your persistence got the better of me. You also got me to keep your secret. An utter defeat, isn’t it? Even my attempts at grasping straws like when I ask you not to accept clients who want to confess to me failed.” She shook her head. “You know, I really thought the confessions would go away when I told everyone I was dating. I’ve finally found an excuse to not accept confessions, all I had to do was to not be there…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">She buried her face again.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">That was it, my original goal, to get to know why she won’t be there for Shida’s confession.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Whew…” She stood up and turned to face me. “That’s all from me. Got anything to say?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Her voice was cold.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><b class="calibre16">Mikage Interlude</b></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I’d be lying if I said it didn’t make me feel better. Opening up to someone did help, just a little, though.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But that’s all I can say.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Let’s get this straight, Akashi-kun.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The boy in front of me had his face down. His bangs were a little wet from the rain, his expression unreadable. He looked drained, as if he could collapse any moment now.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What was he thinking, I wondered.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Would he be disillusioned, scoffing my foolishness, or just plain disgusted with me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I found myself no longer caring.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You said that you’d help me if you could.” To admit the truth, that made me happy. It was a saver. I almost clung on to his words. “But, there’s no other way for me…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I was the one who had thought about it the most. How can I keep everyone together? I could think of nothing, nothing but distancing myself from everyone else.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, leave me alone…”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He tensed a little.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m happy with the way I am now. I can be who I want to be, without hurting anyone. Akashi-kun, please give up. Let’s pretend that nothing has ever happened, and nothing will happen tomorrow. It’s the best thing for everyone.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thank you for caring about me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thank you for going along with my silly requests.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Thank you for listening to me. Maybe I really needed that.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You’re strong, kind, and earnest. Thank you for understanding me.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">So it’s alright now.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Let us&mdash;</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Oh, really, still trying?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’ll have to help you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He looked up, staring at me with fiery eyes.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I could feel my fists tightening. I could feel my teeth grinding.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Oh…” He’s not leaving me a choice, huh? “Had a feeling that this might happen, y’know?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Silence.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Guess I need to end this with a fight, huh.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Even though this was the last thing I wanted.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Inhale…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What the hell do you mean by no?!! Are you dimwitted?! This is the only damn way!!!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When was the last time I shouted like this?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I have no other bloody choice!! Leave me alone!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">When was the last time I was this angry?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What do you know?! This is for the best, what do you know about it?!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t. I haven’t said I do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then stop meddling!! I don’t need your help!!!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He should have known. He should have known…</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I want you to understand!! To see that there’s no way out!! I want you to give up… I </span><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">need</span></i><span class="calibre17"> you to give up&ndash;”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I’m not giving up.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Why?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then tell me!! If you’re me, what would you do?!!” Why must you be so stubborn? “If I don’t do this, people will get hurt!! I have no other choice!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Why must you care so much about me?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I were you…” Why do you look so…sad? “I wouldn’t be able to do a thing.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“See? Isn’t that it?! Then what were you thinking&mdash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“But I’m not you, so I can be your friend.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">What does that have to do now?</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You don’t know a thing!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Not a single thing.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’re the one who doesn’t understand!!!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Eh…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><i class="calibre14"><span class="calibre17">Me?</span></i></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You had fun, didn’t you! All along, you were having the time of your life!!”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He took a step closer.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I know that’s not what you wanted!! You want to have fun without any care in the world too, don’t you?!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Then tell me why must you call me out today? You wanted to have fun!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No. Say it’s not true.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If that’s what you wanted, then I’ll never give up!! I know you didn’t want to be alone!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“There’s no way but to give up!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Because that’s all I can think of.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I can’t think of anything else.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Listen!! I’ll be your friend!!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Tch!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I won’t try to pamper you. I’ll show you what genuine friends are like!! We’ll help each other out in need, because that’s what friends do!!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre8"><strong class="calibre16">[TN: Ayeee, the power of friendship.]</strong></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Stop it.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If there’s anywhere you want to go, anything you want to do, I’ll do it with you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">No.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I don’t care what others think. I’ll live through it.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Isn’t that ridiculous…</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“No one has ever done that for you, has they?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You’re too kind.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You won’t get anywhere worrying all by yourself. But if there’s someone to talk to you, I can guarantee that it will be a lot easier.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You’re making me doubt myself, Akashi-kun.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Of course, that won’t solve anything. But at least why not give it a try? No matter what happens this time, I’ll be there.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I can’t let this go on, I needed to say something, “But&mdash;”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Besides.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">His quiet, calm eyes drew me in.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Today, and last week too, I had fun hanging out with you.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My breath caught.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">I could feel myself being on the verge of tears.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“So, be friends with me.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">He smiled. It was an awkward smile.</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">My head was a mess. But strangely so, I knew what I was feeling right now. It was something I had been ignoring for a long time. What I wanted most and unobtainable at the same time.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“H-Hey!”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The rian was nice and cold.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“What are you doing…?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">The cool droplets helped a little.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Akashi-kun.” I called him. A thin veil of haze between us. He looked at me with concern.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ve said it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Yep.”</span></p>


<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You really meant it?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I do.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Can I hang out with you?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“If I’m free.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“You’ll be my friend, forever?”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“I can’t say. But as long as our friendship lasts.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">“Pfft.”</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">You really are an idiot.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">Yeah, but you’re right. I’ll give it a try. If it doesn’t work, it’s your fault.</span></p>

<p class="calibre8"><span class="calibre17">But, maybe I’m even more of an idiot than you are.</span></p>
