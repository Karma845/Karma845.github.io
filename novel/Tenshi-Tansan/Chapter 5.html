<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Yuzuki Minato Won’t Turn Back</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi–, the literature lad over there.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Konomi Kujiru’s book disappeared, and reappeared in Yukito’s hand. He then began turning the pages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, give it back.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just the usual romane story, huh” he sighed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong? Romance is superb.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m more into real life romance though–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He conceded the book. I did put a bookmark on the page, but it was still annoying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And? Don’t tell me you’re interrupting your customer without a proper reason.” I waved him away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh, the shop&#8217;s closed. Help me clean up or go home, choose one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh? Aah…” I switched the phone open and checked the time. It was indeed past the closing time. It seemed that I was completely immersed, as expected of Kujiru’s work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to help with the closing work, partly because of the guilty conscience of staying too long.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cleaned the floor and was now putting the dishes back on the shelves. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hii” I heard the door open and a chirpy voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who enters despite the “close” sign could be no one but the inner circle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yukito perked from the counter. “Oh, Aki-chan, it’s been a while. Back from club?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just finished my dinner, have nothing to do, and then here. It’s hot outside.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aki Hiura in her green jersey made her way into the cafe. With a thump, she sat down unceremoniously on a nearby chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her house was nearby, so it was probably true.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, I just cleaned it. Stop where you are.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Duhh, I cleaned my shoes already.” Why was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">she</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> the one who was exasperated? Why did everyone insist on annoying me lately?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura is acquainted with Yukito and visits the store from time to time. Although this was the first time she barged in despite the close sign. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, the way she spoke was the same, as if Yukito was her friend.  </span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Japaneses are strict about social hierarchy, so this is quite rude]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she said she came here for free air conditioning, she did her share of work. She was crass and sometimes hostile, but this side of her balanced it out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yukito and Hiura, what a strange combo. They both knew that I was the Angel…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood. “Can I ask you two something?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t slack off–”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as I was getting paid, complaining was a no-go. Although Hiura wasn’t getting any pay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Making someone fall for you despite having no intention of going out… Is that bad?” My voice made its way through the deserted cafe.</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Remember that TN long ago? Well, it’s here now. Minato said she likes Io since the end of the first chapter, but he never saw his own face when he checked, probably some plot point in later vol.]</b></p>
<p><strong>[TN: The author plans the series to be 10+ vol, so it might be a while before this got mention again]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them continued working in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t even know the context. You expect an answer from just that?” Hiura was the first to say something. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I suppose she had her point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm… Like, to do it for other purposes. Even if I’m successful in doing so, I would never accept the other side’s feelings.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normally, that’s bad. Maybe more on the creepy side.” Simple and concise, that’s Hiura for you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, Yukito kept his pleasant smile. He was not in the mood to talk?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought as much…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You already know that, but still asked anyway. The situation isn’t ‘normal’, yeah?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You never fail my expectations.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmph.” She snorted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another one who was sharp despite their fooling around. That was why she was both reliable and scary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She moved to wipe the counter. “Tell me what you can. Else, it’d be just a waste of time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, I had already informed Minato of this possibility. This was all for her sake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I filtered through things, omitted the names, and tried my best at explaining the current situation. By the time I was done, the cleaning process was already done. We were slumping at different corners by that time.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had a pretty good idea of who that playgirl is”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s not a playgirl.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, without a name to refer to her by, I guess it was unavoidable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it wasn’t like they had no idea who that was…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, how does she has anything to do with ‘making her fall’”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, essentially, to cure her of the ailment, getting her to fall for someone who has no intention of dating her. Was that justified?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop those unnecessary complications. Who’s making who fall for them?” She gestured exasperatedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for words. Like she said, that was complicating things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But… I just can’t…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“‘Make her fall for you’, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, it is.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, tell me more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hahh, she’s sharp. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If she likes me, it’d be the best sample,” I conceded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see,” she said flatly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We could narrow down things, it’d be better that way. She doesn’t like me yet, so when she does, it would narrow down the margin significantly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you think that is your best chance? But the earlier question, you’re unsure, no?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, something like that.” I let out a long sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was the conclusion I had come to over the last few days. If we were willing to give it our all, then this was irrefutable option. In fact, I should have thought of this earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And maybe, Minato too…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiura suddenly stood. “Well, back to your supposition earlier.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yukito retained his cool smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, you won’t accept her feelings even if that playgirl likes you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Absolutely?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I can’t”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm” Her look was half-frown, half-scowl. “But ‘like’ and ‘wanting to date’ can be separate things?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well… yes, but that’s not the point. Is it really okay to do so?” I get what she was getting to, but this was about feelings, not reason. You don’t use reason with romantic feelings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I probably wanted an affirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I couldn’t be confident about the results.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your events are a mess, so I’ll keep it simple.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please do…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She deliberately walked this way, then sat down on the opposite seat. She rested her chin on one hand, the other’s pinky to her eye. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As far as I’m concerned, your plan sucks,” she booed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spent </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">days</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> thinking, you know?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there any pattern when you like someone in the first place? You must have seen people doing 180° flips when it comes to love more than I do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have a point…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But hearing it from her was quite unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So even if she likes you, it doesn’t mean anything, or it could mean something. What if you’re a special case? It would only mess up your data even more. You can’t describe irregularity with regularity.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was frank, but that was logical. She was harsh, but that was what I needed. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, what would you do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s me, I’d start by setting high probability hypotheses, and then verify them. Although slightest miss might be fatal… Well, it’s not like I have done this before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh… You’re a genius, Hiura.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you’re the one whose thinking is too narrow. Like this,”</span></p>
<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/313225.jpg"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm… She had a point. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe my thinking became constricted by being with her. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And if that’s the case, how do I set hypotheses? If I might be an irregularity, then so are the others. In the end, is there anything reliable?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it was obvious. I mean, your logic until now makes no sense.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had thought that in order to understand her ailment, crossing out possibilities was the way… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if the condition was not in others, but herself? Bitches are bitches, the reason isn’t the environment, but themselves. What you should do is to find out more about her, not something else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-oh… Hiura-sensei”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a revolutionary statement!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, according to her theory, I was completely wrong. Until now, I had never doubted my own method. I had said that this wasn’t my specialty, but how could I be so confident in my ways?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What am I doing?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks, Hiura. Give me time to rethink a bit.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><b>[TN: short for Baskin Robbins 31]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave me a dazed, happy smile. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it was by conscience, I was glad she came here today. And I should tell Minato to meet tomorrow, things were about to change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The reason you haven&#8217;t liked me yet… Can I find out why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had told her briefly about what Hiura suspected. The process was more embarrassing than I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She crossed her arms. “Hmm” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The distant calls of the track and field club echoed from below. When mingled with the music club’s music, a lonely background music drifted through the rooftop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey! Don’t just leave off with ‘Hmm’!” I tried so hard to say that out loud, you know!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I mean! I… It’s embarrassing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, well. Yeah… I kinda understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was tinged red. A gust of wind swept by and carenessed her hair, sending black hair sifting from white skin. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">White, black, red. At that moment, this combination seemed to be the most beautiful thing in the world. She was that beautiful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… I myself don’t know either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… But you might have forgotten, I have told you before that… that I might have liked you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How could I forget? I will never forget that heart pounding event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was the first time we went to Yukito’s cafe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! I mean, not like that! But that’s what I think.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said I’m sorry! Don’t overreact…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like, ‘I&#8217;m terribly sorry, I don’t like you’, that’s too pitiful!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey! That’s enough!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah, I’m joking. I don’t really care.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was starting to feel bad for her, so let’s leave jokes here. I’m not sulking, really, I’m not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not like I want you to like me or the other way around. Actually, this helps a lot”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… we still don’t know the cause, even though we could have…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, indeed—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was— Hmm, I think this might be a breakthrough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, one last time, you have absolutely no idea of why you started liking multiple people, yeah?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a slight pause. “Yup”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That pause… It could be from her feeling of helplessness, but what was that wavering in her eyes?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really think so? No slightest idea?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To recite Hiura, bitches are bitches, the reason was with themselves. What I should do now was not to compare samples and data, but to dig deeper into Minato herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She kept her gaze downward. Behind the curtains of her hair, her expression was… dark.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don’t. I told you, right? Can you please understand that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah, sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to push further, but seeing her like this…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmph, another deadend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nah, it’s not like everything would  align miraculously by just changing the perspective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Minato, can I have some time?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need time to think more about this. Maybe I could see some patterns after clearing my head. That’s the best I can do right now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, go ahead. Should I do anything in the meantime? Like the operation?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, thanks. Take a break. But notify me if anything changes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, sure. Thanks.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation came to an end, I stretched my arms. Hearing a satisfying pop, my head became lighter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Io”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. And I want you to know that I appreciate what you did for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there…” anything? I stopped myself before completing the sentence. Maybe this was not the time to ask, she must have felt conflicted. Especially after telling her that what we did was for naught.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">–and,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“See you”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her heels and walked off. After watching her disappear from the rooftop, I sat down on the spot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blew by the winds, the cloud moved and revealed the sun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ow! Too bright</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A while passed, but I couldn’t bring myself up again. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was— wasn’t. It wasn’t that she wanted to say something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She didn’t want to say something, huh…” Somehow, the sky above compelled me to say it out loud. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never knew that things would get harder one sidedly like this.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A week passed without meeting Minato.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During that time, I made some progress with my Angel work after a long absence. I steered Makino closer to confession and also reached out to another second-year girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Compared to Minato’s, what I needed to do for them was simple. Not that it was easy though, but I knew what I was doing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But after meeting Minato, everyone seemed like slackers. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if it was that simple then the Angel wouldn’t be needed in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeahhh, spare!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head snapped up at the loud strike.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reiji returned from his bowl with a smug look on his face. We high-fived as I switched in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reiji invited me out for bowling today. I had no plans and was in need of a change of pace. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bowling alley was near Hamaotsu Station on the Keihan Ishiyama Sakamoto line. This was the only Round One in the prefecture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As one would expect from Shiga prefecture, only one Round One, the ultimate indicator of rurality. There was a saying that Shiga has only Lake Biwa. Which was true, in fact, Lake Biwa accounted for around one-sixth of the total area. For some reason, Shiga residents were proud of this.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And since the establishment was far from Kuze High, most of the people here were from nearby schools. Furthermore, it was still time for club activities, so only people free at this time were the go-home club members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, what a beautiful split. My victory’s sealed,” Reiji jeered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll definitely take them down. And you</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> will</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> miss the next round.” No, this was a hollow bluff, I’ll lose for sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hoh–, I’ll make sure I get to record this beautiful throw.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, trying a psychological attack? Not fair!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard a mechanical sound from behind, probably Reiji recording.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook off all my thoughts, with a mind as clear as the water surface of a zen garden pond, I let go.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmph, I’ll show you, Reiji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ball slipped past the pins without a hitch. With a buzz, the ceiling monitor reaffirmed my pathetic performance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, I lost. Well, there was still some hope, but better give up now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll send the video to Hiura.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, I’ll send it in class LINE”</span></p>
<p><b>[TN: Class LINE, a chat room for everyone in the class, a place where everyone reveals other’s humiliation. A place wilder than the Wild West.]</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s more of a reason to stop! And it would definitely become one of those ‘read, no reply messages’! And what’s the point since Hiura would see anyway!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Defeated, I sat down with a thud. In response, Reiji stood and went to the lane.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The loser buys a juice, just the right amount of student-like wager. However, considering how good he was, this didn’t seem fair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s milking me dry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, there was no progress on Minato’s case. There was no contact from the other side too, so like ever, it was a complete standstill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if she was hiding something from me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, that was the only thing I could think of. Even so, that was my speculation. From her expression and discomfort at times. So I would assume that it was true and dig for evidence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still—</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeasss, strike!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing has ever gone my way. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahh…” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing has ever gone my way. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even if my intuition was right… </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Minato was hiding something from me…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then it would be something she didn’t want to discuss. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, I knew that feeling too well. If possible, I wanted her to be the one who broke it to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it was my lack of forcefulness that blocked the progress.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a resting area near the entrance of the buildings. Among the numerous benches, we sit on the outermost ones.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Above our heads hung numerous balloon-like decorative balls, some big, some small, some transparent ones with smaller balls inside. It had been here for as long as the building, but I still couldn’t figure out what it was supposed to be.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Liking them back for…their affection?</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, in short, Io, no offense, but get over that senpai—”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sprang up. “I see!!” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head was working at an unprecedented speed. The more I theorize, the more it makes sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? That ecstatic expression…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Reiji!” I took him by the shoulders and chook him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll treat you ice cream too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Uh, well, if you insist?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let him go and raced to the door. I couldn’t slow down and ran all the way home, the excitement took away my fatigue for this past month.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took my shoes off and steadied my breath. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[The ice cream, one scoop, ‘kay?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sent a message to Reiji and threw it onto the sofa. I ignored the muted vibration of the reply notification and went through the events until now.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled the day we met, and what happened even before that</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">◇◇◇</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That saturday. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato promptly responded to my call. As usual, we met at Yukito’s cafe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wore a chic black blouse and tight denim jeans. Unlike our previous outing to Kyoto, her attire was clean and gave the image of maturity. Like usual, it really suited her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately though, there was no time for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I might have figured it out.” I began after taking a sip. The Sprite did a good job of blowing off the jittery.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Figured what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The condition of your ailment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A flicker. For a second, her eyebrows knitted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her reaction made me wavered a little, but there was no turning back now. “I changed my methods.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The hint was in the people you liked, just not what I thought to be.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s a connection?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, there was one thing I looked over. Fortunately, I happened to be the only one who could verify this theory.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my palm. She saw the gesture and her eyes widened in recognition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wasn’t sure at first, but I tried it anyway. There are thirty people you currently like,” I spoke silently, “I used my powers on them.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the process was grueling. But that didn’t matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn’t do much in other cases, but I didn’t let any of the Kuze students slip. Well, I could stop halfway if the tendency suggested otherwise. However, well…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thirty people, I checked on twenty eight. Twenty seven of them–”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her frown deepened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“–Likes you”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aoki, who picked up her handkerchief. That plain boy who had never talked to her. Third year senpai who talked with her during lunch break. Angel consultant, Makino. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them liked her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also tried on the ikemen that you haven’t fallen for yet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It turns out he already has a girlfriend, so he has zero interest in you. I also tried on the others with conditions similar to his.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But there’s a lot of people who don&#8217;t like me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And that’s precisely why.”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face flickered and she suddenly looked relieved. She brought her hand to her chest and closed her eyes. I was curious about her reaction, but I need to conclude first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Minato, you’re probably liking people back because they liked you. Or more precisely, you are reacting to the affection expressed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was my theory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All thanks to Reiji.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And that fell in line with the fact that you haven’t fallen for me yet, despite how much we have talked. I don’t have any romantic feelings for you, so you, in return, don&#8217;t either.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I drank the rest of the soda in one gulp. Because of how much I had drunk, the fizzing in my mouth was faintly audible. Although I smarted at the pain it brought, it did a good job at clearing my head. And I probably couldn’t stand this silence if I hadn’t drunk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Minato’s face continued to shadow as the somber atmosphere fell in between us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although this was a big step forward, it was still a long way until we can cure the Falling-in-love Peculiarity. I had thought that this would be a small respite for her, but she just looked down painfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And the guy from the neighboring school we walked past, it’s probably him falling at first sight and you’ve felt it. I can’t be hundred percent sure yet, and I need some time to test it out under different conditions. Still, when that is finished, we can move on to–”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay, there’s no need to check,” her tone was weak, filled with resignation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if she had to force it out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? You said you’d definitely have it cured?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I said that I’d do anything. And you would reach the same conclusion anyway. I had suspected the same thing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You have? What…?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since when?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And why didn’t she tell me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you, Io.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pain. Her face contorted in pain.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Crying, but no tears came. Her face was like that. Unfathomably poignant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is where my consultation ends. I’ll take care of myself from now on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah? Hey!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She put down a thousand yen bill and stood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before she left, she glanced backward once, telling me not to follow her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We might now know the trigger, but the cause is still unknown! Stick it to the end!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She ignored me and closed the door, the bell chimed merrily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes went across the counter and saw Yukito looking uncharacteristically concerned. Somehow, I was glad he looked that way. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pathetically, helplessly, I stood there like a fool for a long time.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hn?”</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“What would you do? If you have such powers.”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TN:From the last interlude, in case anyone forgot]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have the power to read minds, what would you do…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm–, me?  I–&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was me, I’d have still used it for my own gain. Just like how I used my power until now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things like “Use it to contribute something to society!” could only be spoken by someone who doesn’t have powers. And everyone says that because they do not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coincidentally, I got this unique power. How do I use it? That was a question I had given up on finding the answer. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I pretend, pretend nothing’s wrong. Coward. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I finally used it–</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don’t know what’s right and what’s wrong. What had I done, I still wondered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why I needed to hear her answer. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ayaha, what would you do?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see… hm. Maybe, I might succumb to greed. Ahaha” She smiled sheepishly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the most beautiful when smiling.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re no good”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, it’s my ability? Why can’t I use it? Too bad, god gave the power to the wrong person.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I’m an idiot, a simpleton.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if she understood me, being on my side. I was genuinely happy.</span></p>

<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Help people out, well, mostly my family or loved ones. Being able to read minds opens up a lot of possibilities, imagine what I could do. There might be something only I could notice, something like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, for example?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un–, here, if you’re feeling down, I would have noticed and done something, right?’</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Io-kun.” She smiled again. I hoped she would do that forever. “If you’re having a hard time, worrying, anxious, just tell me. If you do, I wouldn’t need any power to help you. Without power, yeah?”</span></p>
