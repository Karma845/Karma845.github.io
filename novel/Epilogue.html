<p class="calibre4">“Well, I mean, everyone knows her… Do we really need to introduce ourselves now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just after the summer vacation, the incident occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m Akari Namiki. Please take care of me from now on.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">[……]</p>
<p class="calibre4">After the senior members quit, there were only the three of us… me, Nanami, and Yoshiki, who eventually became the head of the club.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nanami was now the only female member of the club and I was hoping to get a new girl member if possible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’ve got a new member today. Everyone, please get along with each other… We’re all a family now!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">… Sigh, how did I get into this mess?</p>
<p class="calibre4">A few days have passed since then, and our relationship has changed a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">First of all, my relationship with Nanami was dissolved. We were now childhood friends again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, she had become more aggressive in her approach.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She always asks me out on dates after club, and even on weekends, she wants to spend more time with me… I know this may seem like an extravagant concern, but I don’t know anymore.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And most of all, Akari.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After that, she said that she would stop spying on me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She said, now that she can talk to me normally, she doesn’t need to look through the cameras anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was relieved to have solved my biggest problem at the moment, but I’m also surprised at how drastic her actions were.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And as for the note, it seems she’s still writing it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I say “seems” because since then I haven’t been able to sneak into her room to check, so I don’t know what’s going on in there.<br class="calibre2" />
Well, I’ve told Akari everything, so I can’t do what I’ve been doing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, because of the distant approach of the past, recently, perhaps as a reaction to this, she has become as bold as Nanami.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In her words,<br class="calibre2" />
“You’re the one who said it didn’t have to be normal. So I’ve stopped hiding it from you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she said, she started to follow me around outside without a care in the world, and whenever I hung out with Nanami, she always followed me, literally.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Every time she does this, it creates an awkward atmosphere with Nanami. I’d be happy if they could be a little friendlier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And the most important part is this,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to join your club, Onii-chan.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as the seniors left the club, Akari turned in her application to join the same club as me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At first, Yoshiki was quite surprised, but he agreed, saying it was a good thing because the number of female club members had been decreasing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thus, Akari Namiki joined our club as a new member.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s summer now, so there’s not much to talk about, but I’m sure it’ll be a big deal when the second semester starts. ….</p>

<p class="calibre4">I thought of all the people I’d seen the other day who were her fans to be fans and wondered what the future held.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lastly, her relationship with Nanami, which is the most important thing… did not get any better.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the surface, they were having a normal conversation, but it was obvious that they were giving each other fake smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The three of us have been spending a lot of time together on our days off lately, but now it’s going to be in the club, and maybe more so after school too!</p>
<p class="calibre4">… Well, it was my decision. So I just have to do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre4">… So everyone. Have you ever experienced being troubled by a woman who likes you?<br class="calibre2" />
Well, I don’t want to ask too much because I feel like I’ll just make enemies without a second thought… You know, I mean, I experienced it, “troubled by the person who loves you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t get me wrong, I’m not trying to pick a fight with you guys.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This question is not meant to incite you, nor am I trying to brag about my popularity to an unspecified number of people. I just want you to understand that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yes, this is not a boast or anything like that, but I want you to listen to this purely as advice for my problems.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My sister and childhood friend have been approaching me a lot recently, what should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre6">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. I never expected Akari to join the club.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I heard Onii-Chan’s voice through the headphones.</p>
<p class="calibre4">His video streamed on my monitor.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, Onii-Chan. I lied to you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Onii-chan, who thinks that all the cameras and microphones have completely disappeared from his room, was showing me his natural appearance today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was only a small discomfort until now, but Onii-chan did not check his room. Maybe because he was too relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But from now on…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I want you to show me all of you, Onii-chan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I want to see as you really are, not as you show me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I opened a blank notebook to write down my new… plan while looking at my Onii-chan.</p>
