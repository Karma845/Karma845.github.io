<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>One of the six kneeling people, replies.</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t know the exact details, but Sazaku is a member of the Hero’s Guild, and I heard that he was a teacher at the Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Gran Magia Magic Sorcery Academy &#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>In his eyes, a faint purple flame lit.</p>

<p>〇〇〇</p>

<p>After the battle with Elric, Haruto and the others reported the details of the incident to President Ernest. Of course, they didn’t not mention the Demon king&#8217;s half-body.</p>
<p>After that, a search for the teachers’ dormitories and inns in Grandia was commenced, but they couldn&#8217;t find Elric’s figure. Every boatman was also given a search, and blockades were set up to prevent him from leaving the island, but they couldn&#8217;t figure out where he was.</p>
<p><em>He&#8217;s probably already escaped to another country</em>—— it has been concluded so, on the day of the exam break.</p>
<p>But that very day.</p>
<p>Elric was found dead in a room in the academy.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>The room was a warehouse that stores unnecessary items, and several magic mirrors was stored there. Elric had fallen, surrounded by those mirrors.</p>
<p>The cause of his death is unknown.</p>
<p>The magic mirror, is a magic tool that allows an individual to talk to someone at a distance. However, they have no way of knowing where Elric was talking to or who he was talking to.</p>

<p>—— And then, one day, a few days later.</p>

<p>Iris was waiting for Haruto at the clock tower.</p>
<p>Although the test was launched within their respective group, she hadn&#8217;t celebrated it with Haruto.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, if Haruto had a red mark, it would be a comfort party, but &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>There was one more reason, why Iris wanted to meet with Haruto today.</p>
<p>Today is the day when they can see the famous meteor shower.</p>
<p>She wanted to see this romantic event with Haruto at all costs.</p>
<p>She heard that shooting stars will make any wish come true.</p>

<p><em>It would be coming down in large quantities. I can&#8217;t afford to miss this chance.</em></p>

<p>So, she was thinking that, but ——</p>

<p>&#8220;The rain &#8230;&#8230; won&#8217;t stop.&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p>It was pouring so hard that the sound of the rain hitting the roof was annoying.</p>
<p><em>During the day, I have given him the usual signal of brushing my hair, with the time and place specified, but Haruto may not be able to come to me with this.</em></p>
<p>Just when Iris thought so.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you wait?&#8221;</p>

<p>Up the stairs, Haruto’s figure appeared.</p>

<p>“Haruto-kun…… you came.”</p>
<p>“Iris was the one who called me, right?”</p>

<p>Rain drops glistened in Haruto’s hair, and his uniform was wet on its shoulders.</p>

<p>“You got this wet…… I&#8217;m sorry!”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>She hurriedly pulled out a handkerchief and tried to wipe Haruto&#8217;s body. But Haruto stopped Iris as if he was being embarrassed.</p>

<p>“I,it’s okay. With this much, I’ll dry quickly. I&#8217;m just a little wet, I don’t care, you know.”</p>
<p>“But &#8230;&#8230;. doesn’t it hurt your wounds?”</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the wound last time, it&#8217;s almost healed, so don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Haruto asks Iris, who still seemed to be concerned about him, as if he remembers.</p>

<p>“Apart from that, how did the test go?”</p>
<p>“Ye,yes. Unfortunately, I lost the top spot to Clara-san, but I came in second.”</p>
<p>“……That was, a shame. I mean &#8230;&#8230; amazing.”</p>

<p>Different from his own, Haruto thought that it was a battle in the heavens.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun said that he might get a red mark, but…… how was it?&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p>Haruto broadly smiled, and gave a thumbs up.</p>

<p>&#8220;I avoided a red mark!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris was as happy as he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since I had such a disappointing result, I&#8217;m so happy that Haruto was able to achieve his goal!!”</p>

<p><em>That’s strange in various ways</em>—— he thought, but Haruto decided not to care.</p>
<p>If it had been someone else, it might have seemed sarcastic, but Iris is 100% serious.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there were some dangerous subjects, though. On average, I was over the passing score, so I think that it’s all good.”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>However, Haruto was supposed to have a supplementary lesson with a red mark.</p>
<p>For some reason, the exam graded by Fatima-sensei, was a hundred points. That&#8217;s one of the reasons why Haruto&#8217;s average score was pushed up.</p>
<p>No matter how one looks at it, his answer sheet was below average. But he got a hundred points.</p>
<p>Haruto wanted to think that it was just his imagination that the 0s in the number 100 looked like ❤.</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t see the meteor shower, but we&#8217;re celebrating tonight.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Nn? But you want to see it, right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is &#8230;&#8230; but, this rain &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Easy peasy”</p>

<p>Haruto began to climb the ladder attached to one of the pillars. Then, when he reached the top, he came out on the roof of the clock tower.</p>

<p>&#8220;Haruto-kun!? It&#8217;s raining outside!&#8221;</p>

<p>Iris also climbed the ladder in a hurry.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>When Iris took out her face on the roof, a slanting rain struck her face.</p>
<p>Haruto turned his hand upward in that torrential rain, and——,</p>

<p>“『Ultima Zeno Inferno』!!”</p>

<p>Blaze&#8217;s ultimate magic pierced the heavens.</p>
<p>The tremendous explosion punctures a hole in the sky.</p>
<p>A huge explosion spread, and the flames of hell that scorched the heavens dyed the sky red.</p>
<p>It was like, the sun appearing in the night sky.</p>
<p>The flames and the shock waves of that, evaporated the rain clouds and destroyed them all at once.</p>
<p>From there, the starry sky—— and, the perfect circle moon peeked out.</p>
<p>When the flames die down,</p>
<p>The sky was full of stars, as if the downpour of a few minutes ago had been a lie.</p>

<p>&#8220;……Amazing&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p>Iris muttered unintentionally.</p>
<p>The starry sky seemed to be falling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, shooting stars&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p><em>The stars are really coming down. It was the beginning of the annual celestial show of the season.</em></p>
<p>The stars pull their trails and fall. It increased in number, portraying a shower of light in the sky.</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s an amazing meteor shower &#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>Before anyone knew it, Iris put on a smiling face and leaned by Haruto’s side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah. I guess this will make my wish come true.&#8221;</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>From either side, they held hands.</p>
<p>Looking up at the shooting stars all over the sky, Iris repeated her wish over and over in her mind.</p>
