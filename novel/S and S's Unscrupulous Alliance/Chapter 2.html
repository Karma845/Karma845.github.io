<h3>Chapter 2: Sickly and Beautiful Young Lady in the Rabbit Hutch - No way, That's my Insolent Comrade. </h3>

<br>It's rainy day, it's one of the annoying season.<br>

<br>The rain makes my body sticky. And also the most depressing season of the year.<br>

<br>After school, as always, I go to art room. Aimoto Lucia, the cool and beautiful schoolmate, who were drawing a picture across from me, said something.<br>

<br>"I have crush now."</br>

<br>I'm sure I just did stupid face right now. 'You have crush?'</br>

<br>I closed my wide-open mouth in a panic, then I wrinkled my brows and gazed intently at Lucia's luxurious golden hair that spread out like a beautiful wave, her face as cool as a large stone, and the cool, refreshing expression on her face.</br>

<br>Fortunately, Lucia was looking down at the sketchbook on her lap and continuing to create some kind of messy, surrealistic picture that is incomprehensible to ordinary people, so she didn't seem to notice that I had stopped kneading the clay across from her and, even if only for a moment, revealing my stupid face.</br>

<br>This is bad.</br>

<br>I showed even the slightest flutter, she would look me dead in the eye with a deathly S look and S comment that would pierce my chest. (Note: S means Sadistic.)<br>

<br>So, I pulled my face even tighter and said, "Is that so."</br>

<br>I mumbled in a mature voice that will gave an impression that I don't really care.<br>

<br>But inside, I was not feeling quite right.</br>

<br>Wait, Lucia Aimoto, I thought you were in love with me.<br>

<br>Or at least on the verge of falling in love with me, if what you says is true, It'll be weird.</br>

<br>By the time, When I and Lucia become friends is like rollercoaster. Drawn by our hobbies and preference that we couldn't say out loud to others.</br>

<br>In the past, we both have a person we like.</br>

<br>Both second-year students, Ogasawara Shinobu, For Lucia he is like an ideal angel. While on me, Chifuyu Misono, an slender second year student in music club, That for me, She's a fairy from dreamland.</br>

<br>Until then, I had only known Lucia by face and name. She was a second-year student like me, a quarter Japanese with only one-fourth Japanese blood, a tall, beautiful woman with rich platinum-gold hair, lapis lazuli eyes, and a dashing, fresh look.</br>

<br>I am attracted to petite, frail-looking girls like Misono, and Lucia is not my kind of girl.<br>

<br>I thought the only thing that existed between Lucia and me was a sense of camaraderie as an accomplice.<br>

<br>But when I found out that Lucia had confessed to Ogasawara Shinobu and had lost her heart, I felt a pain in my heart at the sight of Lucia trying to hide it from me and act as usual.</br>

<br>And then I thought, 'So she's also a normal woman. A person who gets hurt from rejection.....' Anyway, Lucia flickered a lonely face.</br>

<br>While Misono, who I like the most, recieve a much more damage from my rejection for her.</br>

<br>'--I'm really sorry.'</br>

<br>I apologize. Right after I confessed to her and reject her.<br>

<br>When Lucia confided this to me, her lapis lazuli eyes remained cool.<br>

<br>'You idiot.' She said.</br>

<br>She also told me that I was a disqualified member of the art club for being notice by the target. I was depressed, but she bluntly told me that I was done with the appreciation club, and somewhat happily said that I could stay in the art club until I could find something new to devote myself to.</br>

<br>'--A department that studies gender equality would be a good idea.'</br>

<br>So I answered in all seriousness,
"--I'm sure you can find a way to make a very hot curry with a lot of red pepper and tom yum kung with a lot of green chili peppers."</br>

<br>At that time, there seemed to be a tingling feeling between us that was both similar to and different from that of comradeship.<br>

<br>In beginning we hate each other, and after started exploring ways to coexist as a man and a woman, or perhaps we were about to enter a trial period before becoming an official couple.<br>

<br>I thought Lucia was in the same mindset as I was.</br>

<br>Indeed, for the past two weeks, we have only been sitting across from each other, painting and kneading clay, and not making much progress.<br>

<br>"I'm still in red rope, but lately I've been thinking about black, and black wax candles are also intriguing, and I didn't know there were such things, like collars and anklets, and now everything is sold by mail order."<br>

<br>We were just talking like maniacs lately, and there was no sweetness in the air between, nor we did look happy at each other, nor get a thrill from each other, or blush at each other.</br>

<br>Yep, There's none of that.</br>

<br>When Lucia told me she was going to stay in the art club, her cheeks seemed to be slightly stained, was it an optical illusion of my eyes?<br/>

<br>Or maybe she was just sick and had a fever.<br>

<br>So you're saying I was making a huge misconception?<br>

<br>No, wait.</br>

<br>Maybe the person she like is me.</br>

<br>Lucia, the cynical one, she would put it in such a roundabout way.<br>

<br>So I asked her in a calm and collected tone.<br>

<br>"Who did you fall in love with this time?"<br>

<br>"You, in front of me, Sanada Daiki-kun." Lucia was cool.</br>

<br>Nothing words comes from my mouth.</br>

<br>"He's the replacement for the maternity leave teacher, Kurebayashi Junpei. He is the ideal Adonis."<br>

<br>After confession. She suddenly uttered the name of unknown man, while Lucia's expression was the same as that of the ice sculpture, but her voice was cooler.</br>

<br>What do you mean Adonis?</br>

<br>And who's a substitute teacher?<br>

<br>"He is also a temporary advisor for the music club. You see, he's that beautiful young man with the slender glasses standing in front of the teaching platform."<br>

<br>Lucia's lapis lazuli eyes sparkle as she turns toward the window.</br>

<br>Still, I stared at him with a furrowed brow, wondering which one of us was Adonis.<br>

<br>Then, my eyes met Chifuyu Misono's eyes, my former crush who was playing the flute by the window of the music room.</br>

<br>I suddenly adjust sight, maybe because of the rain, my eyesight is not not good as in past. I suddenly feel unpleasant feeling. I turn my face side ward.</br>

<br>I suddenly remember my confession, when I saw misono's face sad and suffering. She still probably remember how I reject her,<br> 

<br>'I also like...' </br>

<br>Instead of saying 'OK', I said 'Im sorry.'<br>

<br>'Dont be silly.' The guilt is striking me.</br>

<br>For a while after that confession, Misono didn't show up on the windowsill, but lately, she's playing the flute on the windowsill, sometimes raising her eyebrows and staring at me.</br>

<br>And then, When my eyes and her eyes met, I can't help myself to get pissed.</br>

<br>That graceful, shy, weak Misono--</br>

<br>No, from the quiet appearance of Misono and the appearance of blushing and shyly looking down, I just thought that Misono had that kind of personality, and the actual Misono Chifuyu is a actually a strong person.</br>

<br>Or is it my fault that she change.</br>

<br>While having mixed feeling about Misono. 'Wait, Focus on the adonis guy, not on Misono.'</br>

<br>A man with frail-looking glasses, which would blow away in a gentle breeze, stands with a shrug of the head, looking very frightened.<br>

<br>His light brown hair was slightly wavy, as if it was habitually curly, his shoulders were narrow like a girl's, and his waist was thin. He wears glasses on his small face and lifts the frames several times with his thin fingers, as if he is restless.</br>

<br>I could not see his face clearly because it was hidden by his hand, and I was not sure if he was a beautiful young man or like Adonis or not, but I knew that he was a man with not much masculine charm, which Lucia seemed to like.</br>

<br>Next to me, Lucia says in a voice that is both plaintive and passionate, but which she can't quite suppress.<br>

<br>"Junpei-san is a fresh graduate of music college, and since last week he has been teaching music classes and coaching the ensemble instead of the music teacher, It was three days ago, after school, when I first saw Junpei-san's supple and innocent figure. I happened to pass by the music room and saw Junpei-san, covered in powdery white, on his buttocks in front of the door. I was so moved by his fragile, tearful expression as he took off his glasses."</br>

<br>Hey, wait.<br>

<br>Misono just looks at me with a scary face again, this time, pointing her thumbs down.<br>

<br>I wonder if she is cursing me in her mind, saying, "What are you looking at, you pervert."<br>

<br>Let's leave that aside for now.<br>

<br>"Why was Kurebayashi covered in powder? Is he some kind of pervert who plays like that in the school hallways?"</br>

<br>"No. Junpei-san, as the name suggests, he's still innocent. Eventually, if he can feel joy in shame, he has potential."</br>

<br>Perhaps she imagined that future, Lucia smiled like an S.</br>

<br>"Maybe Junpie-san getting bullied?" I said</br>

<br>"Huh? Getting bullied? He's teacher you know."</br>

<br>"It is not unusual for a new teacher to be bullied. Especially when a sensitive, and beautiful young man like Junpei who can easily frightened, you would want to put tacks in his shoes, smash raw eggs into him, and love him to pieces."</br>

<br>I'm aware that I'm no saint by any means, so I'll just say that, just in case.<br>

<br>"Well, maybe."<br>

<br>But isn't it too soon to be doused in powder less than a week after being assigned to a new position? What have he done to make the club members hate him so much? Or is there an S like Lucia in the music club?<br>

<br>Lucia's eyes, rimmed with golden lashes, narrowed in a bewitching gaze.</br>

<br>"As soon as he opened the door of music club, chalk dust fell on his head, which is too classic a trick, but when I actually witnessed it, it was an irresistibly beautiful and intriguing sight. A beautiful young man covered in pure white powder, coughing and weeping, as fragile as snow. I couldn't help but feel a sense of destiny."</br>

<br>Apparently Lucia is legit in-love with that Powdered-glass lad. As a same S person, I kinda also feel the excitement she's feeling right now.</br>

<br>"Aimoto, did you say before you hate a person who change her mind easily?"<br>

<br>"It's been two weeks since I fell in love with Ogasawara." Then Lucia, like the queen of ice, had a dignified voice with a frightening expression. "I'm not a masochist who clings to a one-sided love. Rather, I wants to slaughter the wounds of the other person and bully him. You have the option of looting Shinobu-kun from her female college student, defeating her, and defeating her, but I think you should choose a more expansive path. "</br>

<br>"That's true, but ......"<br>

<br>You've been through this completely from earlier, but what about with me? Was I the only one who was aware of it? It's true that I'm not Lucia's favorite M, but rather Real and legit S.</br>

<br>"So I'm bringing back the Appreciation Club."<br>

<br>As I mumbling to myself, Lucia turned the chair she had positioned across from me toward the window.<br>

<br>She turned to me and said, "Also, I'm going to make some changes to the rules of the viewing club to make it easier for you to come back."<br>

<br>"Changes?"</br>

<br>"Yes. Under the previous rules, the object was to be viewed only, never approached or touched."<br>

<br>The appreciation club is a club where we can gaze at desirable and beautiful things to our heart's content and savor them in our imagination. At the same time, we must only "gaze" at the object from a distance, so that the object does not know we are there.</br>

<br>That was the absolute rule I set for the appreciation club.<br>

<br>"When Shinobu-kun was taken away by a college girl, I realized that I wasn't prepared enough."<br>

<br>Lucia's voice was bold.</br>

<br>The profile of the girl who has set her sights on a new goal is so divine that I couldn't help but to admire. She is a gorgeous beauty with blonde hair and blue eyes, so when she makes this kind of expression, she is too beautiful</br>

<br>"What we have been doing is like looking at a painting in a museum as a spectator, and that's what the rules are for. But from now on, we will become the owners of the paintings. In other words, we are going to own the model, appreciate it as much as we want to, and elevate it to the rank of admirer.<br>"

<br>"I see."</br>

<br>She continue, "You will cooperate with me, Sanada-kun. If you help me this time, I will assure you, you will have an ultimate M girl to stimulate your S mind."<br>

<br>'I think I could fall-inlove with this girl.' But now that it turned out to be a complete misunderstanding on my part, it is too embarrassing and shameful to talk about it, right now.<br>

<br>And I am not the kind of M who takes pleasure in embarrassing things.<br>

<br>After all, putting both Tom Yam Kung and curry together is just spicy and not tasty. Curry should be tasted as curry and Tom Yam Kung should be tasted as Tom Yam Kung.</br>

<br>So I sealed the futuristic vision I had imagined two weeks ago deep in my heart, tightened my cheeks, and with a grave tone of voice, I began to think of a future where I would be able to see the world as it is today.<br>

<br>"...... I approve it." I replied.</br>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<p>Five minutes later--</p>

<p>I and Lucia, turn my chair toward the window and observe the target.</p>

<p>As soon as I turn my chair around, Misono, who was by the window, looks at me, her face turns red, and then she glares at me, but I keep it in my heart to tell her that I am not harassing her.</p>

<p>Sorry, Misono. Think of me as a life-size Namahage doll, a souvenir from Akita, sitting on your window sill.</p>

<br>Kurebayashi, on the other hand, always shrugs his head, lowers his back, and moves restlessly, as if he is frightened of something. He seems to be instructing the members as a teacher with a music college background, but he has none of the dignity of a teacher and often jumps up and down on his shoulders.</br>

<br>The main issue was due to the violin-carrying female members of the club who were stationed in front of Kurebayashi raising their hands and shaking him instead.</br>

<br>The girl with glossy chestnut-colored hair, curled at the ends, and a sharply defined nose and eyes looks like a second-year student named Hinazaki Yumi. She is in a different class from me, but I know her name and face because the boys around me are making a fuss about her, saying she is a beautiful girl and that she is petite but has large breasts. She is shorter than Lucia, and if Lucia is a cool queen, Hinasaki is a sweeter princess.</br>

<br>Of course, I have never paid attention to Hinasaki, because such a strong girl is not my cup of tea.<br>

<br>Whenever Hinasaki raises her white hand, Kurebayashi is clearly startled. While Hinasaki raised his well-defined eyebrows and glared at Kurebayashi with a hard look on his face, Kurebayashi just shrank back and stiffened up.<br>

<br>Hey, come on ...... would a teacher be that scared of a high school girl? The most important thing to remember is that you should not be afraid to ask for help.</br>

<br>I looked at him in disbelief, but Lucia seemed to think that was the point where she was moaning.<br>

<br>"How cute ...... you are, Junpei. It's like a pure white rabbit left in front of a lion."</br>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Wz4H0m8/Screenshot-20220616-124701.png" alt="Screenshot-20220616-124701" border="0"></a>

<br>And Kurebayashi close his eyes.<br>

<br>Well, I would have moaned, too, if I had seen a frail-looking, innocent-looking female being teased and freaked out by a student during class.<br>

<br>Anyway, there seems to be no doubt that Junpei Kurebayashi is being bullied in the music club.<br>

<br>"Yumi Hinasaki's father is a rich and influential man who also serves on the school board, and Hinasaki herself is the next head of the ensemble club and a central figure in the club, so no one can talk to her face to face, and Hinasaki's cronies are also sympathetic to the bullying." Lucia says coolly.</br>

<br>So she's bitch.<br>

<br>"It seems that the chalk powder was planted only once, but Junpei, who is as delicate and shaky as a dandelion's fluff, will shrunken easily. Every time he has a break, he goes to the rabbit hutch in the corner of the backyard to watch the rabbits and console himself."</br>

<br>"Unlike you, Junpei-san has a heart as soft as a loaf of bread before it goes into the oven."</br>

<br>I'm not your favorite, slouchy M-man, after all.<br>

<br>"So? Aimoto. What's your plan after this? Are you going to save him from the bullies and return the favor?"<br>

<br>"I wouldn't be able to appreciate his weakness. And that'll be boring."</br>

<br>Lucia says, as if to say, 'No way.'</br>

<br>"I will not let anyone touch him. If ever he becomes mine, I will punish him severely if he shows such an intriguing face to anyone other than me, but for now, I want to enjoy that artistically fragile profile of his to my heart's content. Don't tell me you don't understand this feeling, Sanada-kun."</br>

<br>I choked up.<br>

<br>'Well ....... isn't that a human sadistic, to want to appreciate something that is desirable for as long as possible?'<br>

<br>"What would you do then?"<br>

<br>"I'm going to pretend sickly, beautiful girl."</br>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>The next day, too, the sky was overcast, and a light rain was falling like mist.<br>

<br>It was recess time. In the backyard of the school building, Lucia, holding a neat light blue umbrella, whispered to me, holding a orange human like, carrot in her white hand.</br>

<br>"Then I'll go now."<br>
 
<br>"Okay."<br>

<br>I off on the scene and hide behind the school building.</br>

<br>Lucia straightens her back and proceeds to the rabbit hutch, still no sign of Kurebayashi.<br>

<br>When Lucia reached the hutch, the two rabbits, who had been taking it easy, suddenly let out a cry of "Pi!" And when Lucia offered them a carrot, they rushed to the corner of the hutch and huddled together, shivering.</br>

<br>Hmmm......... I wonder if a weak herbivore instinctively senses things that are dangerous to them. Lucia is a perfect carnivore after all.<br>

<br>When Lucia was trying to win the frightened rabbit's heart with a carrot, she gave it a cool look and said, "I'm not going to let you do this to me."</br>

<br>As scheduled, Kurebayashi appeared from inside the school building with a dark blue umbrella, shoulders slumped and a weary look on his face. His loose light brown hair was disheveled and he was sighing while walking.<br

<br>For me, unlike Ogasawara, he is not a beautiful young man at all.</br>

<br>When I saw Ogasawara for the first time, Lucia had praised him as an angel and a beautiful boy, so I was a little disappointed by Kurebayashi's normal-looking face.</br>

<br>Kurebayashi looks.... kind of.... gaunt?<br>

<br>When Kurebayashi saw that there was a visitor in the rabbit hutch, he stopped in his tracks, his eyes darting about, wondering whether he should wait for the visitor to leave or not.<br>

<br>Perhaps he had been bullied so much in the music club that he had developed a fear of students themselves.</br>

<br>When Lucia turns around at the perfect timing.<br>

<br>I was so impressed.<br>

<br>Under a light blue umbrella, her platinum gold hair shimmers and her mysterious lapis lazuli eyes softly look up at Kurebayashi.<br>

<br>That's what I'm talking about, Lucia.<br>

<br>No woman can be so beautiful while dangling a carrot in one hand.</br>

<br>Lucia was so beautiful that Kurebayashi forgot to be intimidated and instead he's so focus on Lucia's face as if in-love.<br>

<br>Also, although Lucia was expressionless, her usual air of pomposity and arrogance was well hidden, giving off an air of loneliness instead.<br>

<br>"Oh, ......."</br>

<br>And with red lips, he mumbles fleetingly.<br>

<br>Seeing the fear in Lapis Lazuli's eyes, I can't help to mumble.</br>

<br>"You can be an actress you know, Lucia."<br>

<br>Kurebayashi, who was captivated earlier by Lucia's charm, answers in hurry.<br>

<br>"I'm sorry.... for startling you. I'm here to see the rabbit, too. I always spend my free time here."<br>

<br>"But ... we've never met ... until now ... right?"<br>

<br>Lucia asks with a cautious look. I can't blame you, Kurebayashi. Today's Lucia's voice usually sounds great and modest.</br>

<br>"I've been at this school since last week, replacing a teacher who is on maternity leave. My name is Kurebayashi, I teach music."<br>

<br>"I see. I was resting in the nurse's office during morning assembly because I wasn't feeling well, so I guess I didn't get a chance to say hello to the new teacher. I'm sorry."</br>

<br>As she bowed her head politely, her rich platinum-gold hair swayed fleetingly. She looked like a mermaid who had just landed on land.</br>

<br>Kurebayashi's cheeks, now showed a faint blush, and based on that reaction, I know that he's not nervous or anything, he's throbbing.</br>

<br>"Do you come here often to see the rabbits, too?"<br>

<br>"Yes, I do. They are my friends."<br>

<br>Kurebayashi's interest was further aroused when Lucia answered about rabbits. While the rabbits were so frightened of Lucia that they were huddled together in the corner, but Kurebayashi did not seem to notice it.</br>

<br>Lucia started the conversation again.

<br>"It's strange, isn't it, that I came here ...... every day and never saw you until now?"<br>

<br>"Yes, You....right."<br>

<br>But actually, it was Lucia's first time in the rabbit hutch since entering the school, so it was only natural that she didn't noticed.</br>

<br>"I have to go now....... You can feed this carrots to the rabbits."

<br>Lucia gently places the carrot in Kurerin's hand and walks away.(Kurerin is Kurebayashi's nickname for Sanada.)<br>

<br>"Um..."<br>

<br>Kurebayashi calls out.<br>

<br>"Your class and your name."</br>

<br>Lucia stopped and slowly turned around. With a quiet expression and a hushed voice, she whispered, "My name is Lucia Aimoto, class 1, year 2."</br>

<br>Then she left, hiding her beautiful appearance under a wet umbrella.<br>

<br>Kurebayashi, holding a ginseng in his hand, looked at her neat figure as if he had seen a beautiful vision.<br>

<br>"That's an award for my acting performance. Thank you." This witch.</br>

<br>Lucia's arrogance was on full display as soon as she joined me at the back of the school building.</br>

<br>"So next is me."</br>

<br>"No, Not yet. You'll have to wait 2 more days, before you."</br>

<br>Lucia said that, with eyes glowing fearlessly.</br>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>For the next two days, Lucia spent her time in front of the rabbit hutch, playing the role of 'a quiet high school girl with a lonely atmosphere'.<br>

<br>Once Lucia's started to go to the rabbit hutch, the rabbits would always retreat to a corner of the hutch, and when she picked them up, they would get scared to the bone. While Kurebayashi would only watch lucia and rabbit, trying to break away from lucia.</br>

<br>"I feel at ease when I'm with these kids." While gazing at them with inspriring look.</br>

<br>"I see.... Me too." As always Kurebayashi said that shyly.</br>

<br>Lucia started to left, Leaving Kurebayashi behind. Then,</br>

<br>"Im counting on you." Lucia said.</br>

<br>"Leave it to me." I replied back.</br>

<br>In the small rain, Kurebayashi who's in front of the rabbit hut, looks pondering something.</br>

<br>"Hey, teach."</br>

<br>When I deliberately called out in a rough tone, Kurebayashi looked back with stiffened expression like a herbivore in front of a carnivore.</br>

<br>I'm taller than Kurebayashi, adding with rough tone, means intimidation.</br>

<br>"Teach, Did you just talk with Aimoto Lucia just now? Well, actually we're pretty close... so, what's relationship do you have with her?"</br>

<br>"Re-relationship? No-no, I mean Aimoto-san is student....so..."</br>

<br>Kurebayashi says in a rubbing voice.</br>

<br>After being suddenly entangled by a boy student who seems to be unsightly. I raised my eyebrows and threatened Kurebayashi, who seemed to be want to run at any moment.<br>

"....Is that all?"</br>

<br>I turned my head to the side.

<br>Kurebayashi's eyes widened, probably because I made a disappointed face. I continued to ruffle my hair with one hand, expressing my annoyance.<br>

<br>Kurebayashi freaked out again.<br>

<br>"Ah, shit! I see. ...... I see now, Teach,  I mean, it's fine if you're a Teacher. But..."</br>

<br>And again with a raised eyebrow and a serious look on my face.<br>

<br>"You're the first time that Lucia's ever been so open with someone other than a rabbits" I said.</br>

<br>"Eh?"</br>

<br>"She always have blank expression on her face, and her speech is so dark, seems like you guys getting along."</br>

<br>"No, no, no, that's not true"</br>

<br>"Actually, when I was in elementary school, she was bullied because she was too beautiful, so she stopped going to school for a long time."<br>

<br>"What?"</br>

<br>Was it necessary to set up that she was too beautiful? It is obvious that Lucia is indeed beautiful.</br>

<br>In reality, Lucia is not bullied nor a normal bully. She just like to grab others weaknesses and teased him down, but if the target is not cute nor beautiful, Lucia will only left him alone because its boring to torture someone who is not her type.</br>

<br>On the other hand, Kurebayashi has serious look on his face and took the lie easily. For him, Lucia is just a beautiful girl with lonely expression in a rabbit hutch.</br>

<br>"Even before the time she come to this school, She still have distrust towards other people and don't talk to anyone in the classroom. The only person she could talk to was a rabbit."<br>

<br>"I didn't realize that." Sympathy comes into Kurebayashi's eyes.</br>

<br>No, Well actually Lucia has proper female friends.<br>

<br>Like me, she is aware of the fact that her tastes and preferences diverge from those of the general public, and she knows that keeping them to herself is better.</br>

<br>"She hasn't spoken to her parents for more than half a year, and when she gets sick, she stays in bed all by herself, with no one to help her."<br>

<br>"......"</br>

<br>Talking about Lucia's parents, I still haven't talk to them either.</br>

<br>She has one younger brother, though. Lucia says that he is a quiet boy. when she said that she put a toy cockroach in his desk or a clipboard from a horror comic book under his pillow, it didn't scare him at all.<br>

<br>Well, they must be a close sister-brother relationship to be able to play such pranks. Their family is normal.</br>

<br>The same also for my family. It's because we have normal family, we can make calm judgement for ourselves.</br>

<br>"Lucia was born weak so she often got anemia, and irregular heartbeat."</br>

<br>"I heard that she was at nurse office when I moved into this school. No wonder she didn't meet me when I speech in assembly."</br>

<br>Kurebayashi is completely pale.</br>

<br>Well, the other day, Lucia's bragging about 'Not catching cold since fourth grade.'</br>

<br>And when I was at the school assembly, but I was asleep from start to finish and didn't hear the new teacher's speech.<br>

<br>Despite my playing with him is amusing, I was feeling more and more downcast by his reactions.</br>

<br>"In school, Lucia was misunderstood that no one in this school nor outside school believe what she really was."</br>

<br>"What? What about you?"</br>

<br>This is first time he ask question. Even this time, he's still believing words without doubt, so I was bit shaken into his first question. </br>

<br>"It seems you're really familiar with Aimoto-san, its because you know her since childhood right? If you're Lucia's childhood friend, can you help her?"</br>

<br>In the back of his glasses, I stared at his eyes. Even he is already 22, he has still innocent eyes.</br>

<br>Kurebayashi's eyes is too innocent, I feel like a shit guy who is currently scamming this man.</br>

<br>Instead of getting guilty, I feel surprised.</br>

<br>'This is bad.'</br>

<br>I still have a hazy, not convinced about helping Lucia with her new love life.<br>

<br>However, now that I have accepted the role, I am determined to give a performance as good as Lucia's did.</br>

<br>So I hastily turned my face away and let my shoulders tremble with grief and anguish.<br>

<br>"No, I've been ...... watching Lucia since elementary school, but I ain't no childhood friend or friend of Lucia. Lucia doesn't know me at all."<br>

<br>"What?"</br>

<br>"Since I'm not a decent person and my hands already filled with evil things I've committed. I don't have privilege to go near at Aimoto-san, all I can do is to look from distance."</br>

<br>"Distance?... A juvenile training school? Or a flight to a foreign country ...?"</br>

<br>"Please dont say this to Aimoto... And also I'm only leaving this for you, As teacher" </br>

<br>"O-Ok." Kurebayashi nods.</br>

<br>Oh god, I'm glad, that this guy is easy to fool. Or is it my acting skills just good?</br>

<br>After that, I put my hands on Kurebayashi's shoulder as sign of handing Lucia to him.</br>

<br>"So please Teach, Please help Aimoto-san. You're the only one I can ask for."</br>

<br>"Because Lucia has ......"<br>

<br>He nodded painfully, growled low, and shook his head.<br>

<br>I shouldn't have said that. Lucia has that personality, so I'm sure she won't say 'I'm in love with him.'</br>

<br>"Bye, Teach."</br>

<br>I turned my back, but Kurebayashi called me.</br>

<br>"He-Hey"</br>

<br>I was expecting him to ask for my class and name, but instead he said in a tone of gratitude and respect, "Thank you for telling me all about Aimoto-san."<br>

<br>He thanked me.</br>

<br>I looked at Kurebayashi, who was holding a navy blue umbrella in one hand, and bowed his head deeply.<br>

<br>I murmured in a bitter voice.<br>

<br>"Damn, Now, he got me."<br>

<br>Junpei Kurebayashi seems to be a truly pure person, just as Lucia had expected.</br>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

</br>"Good job" Lucia said while handing a towel.</br>

<br>"Do I even need to do that? That teacher already believe that you're serious, kind, but lonely highschooler you know." </br>

<br>"Ofcoure, unlike us, Junpei-san is pure person." Lucia proudly says.</br>

<br>Then she look serious again. "Junpei-san is teacher, so he'll absolutely not going to touch his students. That is why we give him a push."</br>

<br>"And the push was me...right?"</br>

<br>"You're right. You really did a great job back then. Once he start to protect me, Junpei-san will probably start to change from serious person to the person who'll fall to his student."</br>

<br>Instead of looking frail and sickly highschool girl, she looked like a evil queen who's plotting something bad.</br>

<br>I'm serious, she really look like evil queen.</br>

<br>"Hey, Aimoto. What if you guys really did start going out as couple, are you still going to act like frail person?"</br>

<br>"No way." said that with delusions on his eyes.</br>

<br>"I'll reveal everything once we start to goint out. He'll probably regret how dangerous I am. Even if he wants to get away from me, I'll tied him up and torture him and enjoy that pleasure."</br>

<br>I started to smile wryly. 'This devil'</br>

<br>However, I wanted to see the look on Kurebayashi's face when he learned the truth, so I kept my mouth shut.</br>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>The next day was sunny.<br>

<br>Kurebayashi starts to exchanged words with Lucia in front of the rabbit hutch. Perhaps because he was aware of Lucia's difficult circumstances, he seemed to care for her and treated her more kindly than before.</br>

<br>While in music club, he was still getting bullied. Because of that Kurebayashi's mental support to Lucia seems not effective, or more like Kurebayabashi is the one who's getting mental support.</br>

<br>It was obvious to me, watching from the back of the school building, that for Kurebayashi, Lucia had risen to the rank of more than just a student.<br>

<br>Someday those two are will start dating, walking in hand to hand, or going to seaside inn or something.<br>

<br>Can I continue to watch over them like this?<br>

<br>No, as Lucia's fellow S's, shouldn't we congratulate Lucia on being united with her ideal M? But .......<br>

<br>"Kuuuuu..."</br>

<br>Suddenly I heard a moan, that looks like a dog who lose to another dog.</br>

<br>Looking next to me, there was a woman who was staring at the couple, Kurebayashi and Lucia with a grimaces look just like me.</br>

<br>A petite, big-breasted, strong-looking woman with chestnut-colored hair. Hinazaki Yumi, a music club member and also the leader who's bullying Kurebayashi.</br>

<br>'Did she didn't like Kurebayashi talking with beautiful girl like Lucia?'</br>

<br>Hinazaki was staring at Kurebayashi and the others with her biting her lip while grabbing her skirt that cause to wrinkle. Her face looked so tense and pained that I was a little concerned.<br>

<br>Should I warn her that her skirt is slipping up and her thighs are showing?
</br>

<br>"Hey."</br>

<br>Hearing my footsteps, she suddenly got surprised.</br>

<br>"Wh-who are you? If you're going to pick me--."</br>

<br>"Why are you staring at Kurebayashi and Lucia?"</br>

<br>Hinazaki gasped, clutching the hem of her skirt in alarm.
</br>

<br>"You ......you know those two?"<br>

<br>"Aimoto and I are club mates."</br>

<br>However, not the art club, but member of appreciation club.<br>

<br>Hinazaki's eyes grew steely. After looking at me with a jealous look, he turned his lips into a pout and asked me a question in a brusque tone.
</br>

<br>"Is Kurebayashi..... and Aimoto Lucia.... are they dating?"</br>

<br>Why do you care such thing?</br>

<br>"Nope, Not yet."</br>

<br>"You mean someday?"</br>

<br>"I dont know."</br>

<br>"Is Lucia ever goes to the house... to Kurebayashi's house... to visit......."</br>

<br>"Well, If they started dating, they will."</br>

<br>There are some things you can only do at home after all.<br>

<br>For some reason, Hinasaki looked very shocked, put more pressure on her hand holding her skirt, and glared at me sharply.</br>

<br>"I will not let them." And ran away.<br>

<br>"What the hell was that?"</br>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>After School. As always in art club room.</br>

<br>"Hinazaki Yumi might be same kind as us." Lucia, after hearing what I just say, said with a chilly look on her face.</br>

<br>"The same kind? You mean she's S too?"</br>

<br>"Yes, but we can say she's low tier S. If Hinasaki-san can only make pranks on Junpei-san like making him cry with powder, I don't want to admit she's also a companion."</br>

<br>"Didn't you say, you feel blessed when you saw Kurebayashi covered in powder?"</br>

<br>"That's not our topic. Anyway if Hinasaki Yumi is also aiming for Junpei-san, I'm not going to lose to a low level S."</br>

<br>Then Lucia flashes her phone display that show this week's weather.</br>

<br>"This week, Friday. In this rainy day, my match with Hinasaki Yumi will be decided. On this day, I'll make Junpei-san fall for me!"</br>

<br>She declared it confidently.</br>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>The next day. I was in the train, while being crowded, which is normal in every morning, I saw Lucia's first love, Ogasawara Shinubo who is in midst of the crowd while being grope by a pervert.</br>

<br>"Hey, You." I suddenly grabbed the man on his shoulder, but the pervert salary looking man shook my hands and ran through the crowds.</br>

<br>Good grief. To think that an educated salaryman would grope a highschool boy...</br>

<br>"Thanks, Sanada-kun"</br>

<br>"You're a man, so don't just stay silent while you're you're ass getting groped."</br>

<br>"Uh...yeah, there's a lot of people in the train so It'll bother them, and also I'm a guy so it's fine."</br>

<br>With deep red in his face, I can't help to get disappointed.</br>

<br>Smooth black hair and smooth white skin like a woman, this kind of man is Lucia's cup of tea.</br>

<br>The current man who Lucia likes, named Kurebayashi,  the guy who is exact opposite of me. I'm tall, black hair. and my limbs are muscular and stiff. It is said that my eyes has nasty look on it. And likely molester in future.</br>

<br>'Nope, this is not time to give up.'<br>

<br>"Sa-Sanada-kun, are you fine? Is it my fault. I'm sorry."</br>

<br>Ogasawara suddenly apologize in the crowd. While getting a lot of attention, I get embarrassed and unable to explain.</br>

<br>Apparently this kind of man can only make Lucia's S heart flutter. And a technique I couldn't emitate.</br>

<br>"BTW, Do you have girlfriend right? College one." I changed the topic.</br>

<br>Ogasawara turn red.</br>

<br>"Well, I heard it from Misono."</br>

<br>Yeah, I heard also from Misono that in her house, Ogasawara and Misono's older sister do some suspicious things. Well, talking about this guy, they just probably do kiss nothing more nothing less.</br>

<br>"Yeah, I have a date with Kiyoi-san every week. Kiyoi-san's room, my room, Kiyoi-san's friend's room, etc."</br>

<br>Isn't that always room.</br>

<br>"Wait, what do you mean your girlfriend's friend room? Is that even normal?"</br>

<br>"Eh....Ah... That's kinda.... strange room, with.... room with no window....chains... and some candles."</br>

<br>Ogasawara's voice slowly getting smaller.</br>

<br>"Is that really your girlfriends friend room?" "Did you do something while you are in your girlfriends room?" That's kind of question what I wanted to ask but, it's probably better to leave let him alone.</br>

<br>In the first place, how did Ogasawara, an ordinary high school boy, and Misono's older sister, a female college student, start dating? It seems that the information from Misono is not really reliable.</br>

<br>So I asked him about it.

<br>He replied, "Kiyoi-san was there to see the music presentation last year. I didn't know that she was Misono-san's sister, but she happened to have anemia and collapsed, and I accompanied her to the nurse office. After that, Kiyoi-san came to the school to deliver Misono-san' forgotten things, and we met several times....... Kiyoi-san was very frail at the time and often had anemia, so I accompanied her every time she came to see me. I was worried when she told me she didn't have long to live, so I told her, "I'll be right by your side, so hang in there and do your best." Now she is healthy and no longer suffers from anemia. She says it is the power of love, but I guess such things really do happen."</br>

<br>No ...... isn't that trap made by Misono's sister. She pretended to be anemic to draw sympathy, or to stimulate a man's desire to protect her so that he would confess to her.</br>

<br>Perhaps Misono's older is same kind as us, and she fall in love with Ogasawara in music presentation, and she slowly charm Ogasawara until Ogasawara also fall for her.</br>

<br>"When Kiyoi-san finally got better, she suddenly became energetic?.... Or like she do a lot bold things, but still I'm still really grateful that she beat her illness." Ogasawara said said in a bright expression.</br>

<br>And I'm loss. What do you even mean bold things? Why do you suddenly get red face by telling me that?</br>

<br>"Sanada-kun, You're dating Aimoto-san right?" Suddenly asking me.</br>

<br>"Does we look like that?" I also ask him back.</br>

<br>While I was finding a way to make her become my girlfriend. I feel embarrassed to myself watching Lucia conquering Kurebayashi in-front of my eyes.</br>

<br>I suddenly want to erase my memories from the past two weeks in the art room.</br>

<br>However, from other people like Ogasawara, we looked like a couple.</br>

<br>Come to think of it. Last week, I was asked by my classmates whether me and Lucia already did it. (About S*x, but still misunderstanding by his classmates.)</br>

<br>So, in the end, it wasn't my misunderstanding.</br>

<br>But everyone's misunderstanding LOL.</br>

<br>Still, its still misunderstanding. There's still no changes between me and Lucia, so its useless laughing at them.</br>

<br>And Ogasawara cheered me up once again.</br>

<br>"Ahem!!" With loud and powerful voice. "I think Sanda-kun and Aimoto-san look good, Like you have same aura something like that."</br>

<br>Aura? You mean being both S. Being both S is not good thing. It's because Lucia is S, she's only interested into her opposite M, and being same S as her will only lead me to being as comrade. In other words I can't be lover.</br>

<br>My chest is throbbing. Maybe I'm throbbing because Ogasawara says 'We look good.' Is it possible that I'm already in love with Lucia?</br>

<br>"Sa-Sanada-kun, Did I say something wrong again? Your eyes kinda scary."</br>

<br>After that, the train stops, that all of the passenger got out from the train, Ofcourse we, Ogasawara and me also got out. </br>

<br>"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Sanada-kun." bowing his head</br>

<br> Coincidentally "Don't get close to that person, Ogasawara-kun." Chifuyu Misono is waiting for me. Her arms is folded like a gaurd standing besides the king. (Note:  'That' is about Sanada.)</br>

<br>"Ogasawara-kun, Go to school now." Misono said that with rugged voice.</br>

<br>"Uh, yeah ... It sounds like a serious story, so I'll go ahead then. But Misono-san, you shouldn't hit Sanada-kun with a bag. Okay?"</br>

<br>Ogasawara left with traumatized looked on his face. I don't know why but, I think he already saw Misono hitting other person with her bag? Or is he the who get hit with the bag? I'm not sure.</br>

<br>Since the confession, it's first time that we talk to each other. But for me it's not really long time since then.</br>

<br>When the time I was 'appreciating' Misono in the art room, I don't really feel we gotten closer, but now I think we already gotten closer. Well, I'm the only one who's probably thinking that. If I said that to Misono, I feel like she's going to hit me in the face with her bag.</br>

<br>"What do you want from me?" I ask her casually.</br>

<br>But Misono is silent.<br>

<br>"There's a lot of people here, Let's talk while walking." Misono said while walking passing me.</br>

<br>There are two ways to get to school: back streets and front streets. The back street is slightly farther than the front street, narrower and lonelier, but less crowded, and it is said that this is the couples love spot.</br>

<br>And Misono goes to love spot of the school.</br>

<br>"And?" I growl a annoyed voice.</br>

<br>"What are you planning stalking our advisor?"</br>

<br>I cut out.</br>

<br>"Stalking? Kurebayashi?"</br>

<br>Well if he gets fired, I'll be thankful though.</br>

<br>"There was an eyewitness report that you were watching Kurebayashi-sensei from behind the school building with an unusual look in his eyes. Not just me, but many."</br>

<br>"Oh....That..."</br>

<br>She must have misunderstood my observation to Kurebyashi that is actually regarding to Lucia's matter.</br>

<br>Sigh...</br>

<br>"Dont sigh at me. Even me, I dont want to talk to you anymore, but how the way you look at our teacher, its just too passionate. Even the time when you're still looking at me, I always get embarrassed, I feel like I'm going to get melted.... and I admit it, I like it too."</br>

<br>Misono continued, "Anyway, Kurebayashi-sensei is neutral. Right now, I don't really know, what are you thinking. I don't know if you're just pervert or you're just prioritizing your club."</br>

<br>Misono shakes her head.

<br>Her white cheeks were dyed bright red, and her moist eyes were so lovely and pretty that I marveled at them in my heart.<br>

<br>Misono Chifuyu. You are a very capable woman.</br>

<br>Your appearance is just like what I always wish for. Oh, I want to make that wanton, innocent face even redder. Not only the face, but also the ears, the neck, and the bottom of it.</br>

<br>"Hey, what are you shaking this time?"<br>

<br>"No, I'm just upset."<br>


<br>"Because I'm right?"<br>


<br>"You could say that."</br>

<br>Misono, with her cheeks dyed and her face looking weak. She was really my type. She really got me.</br>

<br>"So, I'm right." Her voice tremble. "You're also okay even...... with a man."</br>

<br>Wait, I'm okay with a man? We're talking about  Lucia who likes Kurebayashi in the first place, and I have nothing to do with it.</br>

<br>"What about..... Aimoto-san?"<br>

<br>"Aimoto?"</br>

<br>"I always see you both flirting everday at the side window."<br>

<br>"I'm sorry I don't know we looked like that."</br>

<br>Apparently, base on Misono's perspective. We looked like couple.</br>

<br>"Getting along with another girl in front of the girl you just rejected, you're really tactless."</br>

<br>"Im so sorry. You're really observative."</br>

<br>"Im not, Aimoto-san's blonde hair and Sanada-kun large body...... Ahhhhh, I know already, everytime I remember it, I get annoyed."</br>

<br>"I'm really sorry, but were not like that. To Lucia, I'm just club member and Lucia also like another man."</br>

<br>"Eh?" While walking fiercely, Misono suddenly stopped.</br>

<br>"Sanada-kun, Did..... Aimoto-san dump you?" Looking at me intensely like she wants to confirm something.</br>

<br>"That's likely will happen."</br>

<br>I am not sure how serious I was about Lucia.<br>

<br>But I am sure that I felt lonely as if I had been left behind when Lucia told me that she had found someone she liked.</br>

<br>"So that's why you....... burned yourself with a man instead."</br>

<br>Misono suddenly says something strange again. While looking at me with sympathy eyes.</br>

<br>"That's bad you know." she said.</br>

<br>"What?"</br>

<br>"If you want to date someone you should go with woman instead, not on a man." Suddenly her tone softens.</br>

<br>She looked more earnest, as if she was pondering something, then gently lowered her eyes and mumbled in a hushed voice.</br>

<br>"For example...... how about me?</br>

<br>Misono, with her white cheeks fleetingly stained with shame, her eyes downcast, and her slender shoulders squeezed weakly, was still my ideal.</br>

<br>"Should we go out..... n-now?"</br>

<br>I was tempted to put a dog-eared hair band on Misono's head and a red collar with a leash around her neck.<br>

<br>"No, I refuse." I answered flatly.</br>

<br>Misono's cheeks twitch.<br>

<br>I mean, normally, I would definitely refused. Misono is my favorite girl in terms of looks, and after I rejected her in such a crazy way, I can't believe that Misono is confessing her feelings to me again. If I had to say whether I was happy or not, I'm definitely happy, and more than that, I think it's amazing that she had the guts to do it.<br>

<br>I have respect for that kind of person.</br>

<br>Although her appearance is to my liking and her personality is a little different from what I had imagined, she is still a destructive force when she is in her demure mode, and she is the best crush I have ever had.<br>

<br>It would be fun to date Misono.</br>

<br>But I'll still refuse because of current situation, It's bad to go out with Misono right now because, In Lucia's situation, I really need to see whether Lucia will start dating Kurebayashi.</br>

<br>And before I confirm misunderstanding with Misono.</br>

<br>"Pervert! I will not let you date Kurebayashi-sensei infront of me!"<br>

<br>She ran, yelling in the middle of a charming path between an old house and plants of Hydrangea.</br>

<br>The hell?</br>

<br>I'm relieved she didn't hit me with her bag.</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>Today, Lucia is in good mood for some reason.</br>

<br>"When I said 'I want to see Junpei-san's room.' 'Then how about coming this sunday.' he said. So it's already time, Junpei-san will cross the line between teacher to student."</br>

<br>She's drawing a slime, a room with no windows, a room with big eyes and big mouth, that is apparently sketch drawing of Kurebayashi's room. To me it looks like a horror room though.</br>

<br>Since the day of resurrection of Appreciation Club, we always face the outside window. From there, Lucia staring at her love one while making unscrupulous delusions.</br>

<br>In this times, Lucia is having fun while laughing at evil tone. That is not beautiful at all. She's like evil queen after all. <br>

<br>When I think about this situation, the back of my chest gets heavier.</br>

<br>"If you look at Music room with me, Kurebayashi might get suspicious you know." It's too late to say that now though.</br>

<br>"Junpei-san has bad eye sight." she said.</br>

<br>That's a good thing then.</br>

<br>If a people see to much, they will not get happy about it.</br>

<br>Misono, who noticed me, immediately closed the curtain.</br>

<br>"Sanada-kun, did something happen between you and Misono-san?"</br>

<br>"Nothing." I answered.</br>

<br>"Hmm ..." Lucia was suspiciously and currently looking at my face.</br>

<br>"Well, whatever. Anyway If Junpei-san becomes mine. This kind of sight seeing will end. I'll be able to appreciate him as much as I like."</br>

<br>She continue. "In this X-day Junpei-san will confess to me, then go to Junpei-san room on Sunday and deepen our relationship. Perfect!"<br>

<br>Looking at Lucia's phone, she place X on her schedule tomorrow while smiling unscrupulously.</br>

<br>"In that dawn, there's fruit parfait store near station, so let's celebrate there while eating."</br>

<br>There's throbbing in my chest.</br>

<br>"So you also eat fruits parfait something like that."</br>

<br>"This month, it's cherries. I love the eroticism of cherries. They are the perfect size for inserting, rolling, and decorating, and they are fun to tie, too."</br>

<br>I see... So It's a forbidden fruit for you. </br>

<br>As I watched Lucia happily talk about cherries, I was still trapped in the tingling sensation in my chest.</br>

<br>When Misono confess to me again. I already make my mind that I will not date anyone until Lucia and Kurebayashi started dating.</br>

<br>In other words, In the corner of my chest, I still have expectations that Lucia will choose me instead of choosing Kurebayashi.</br>

<br>Such possibility is not zero. I wonder what will I do If Lucia and Kurebayashi really did start dating.</br>

<br>"Hey Aimoto. If I was M what will you do?" I ask like it's normal.</br>

<br>Why did I even asked that? When I was still kid, I already know to myself that I was S, but in this moment, I wonder to myself, "what If I was M?" and why did I even ask Lucia about that. Probably in this moment, I'm making a serious expression.</br>

<br>Lucia look at me and she answered with a small voice.</br>

<br>"I will not like it. Very much."</br>

<br>In a quiet room, I also answered in a serious tone.</br>

<br>"Right? Even I,  I'll be gross to myself, If I was M."</br>

<br>Tall, Skinny, Nasty looking eyes, That'll be disaster.</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>On the X-Day. And as expected it's raining.</br>

<br>Hey, isn't this year rainy season kinda long? Ever since first subject my energy already dropped down, and just laying my face down on my desk.</br>

<br>Shit, Gotta go now.</br>

<br>According to Lucia's prediction, Kurebayashi will confess to Lucia today's lunch break. </br>

<br>I hope lunch break will not come forever.</br>

<br>What I'm a talking about. I already make my mind that I will be participating Lucia's plan. I even do acting. And that stupid question I asked to Lucia. What a idiot self-proclaim S I am.</br>

<br>And Lucia came to my classroom with stern look on her face.</br>

<br>Sensing disturbing feeling. I stood to my desk and walk to the hallway. Lucia suddenly grabbed my arm and talk first.</br>

<br>"Sanada-kun, she got me."</br>

<br>"What happened?" I ask.</br>

<br>From Lucia's expression and tone, I knew that something problematic happened.</br>

<br>"Junpei-san push Hanasaki Yumi at the stairs and will probably forced to stop as teacher because of injury."</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>After the break, Lucia and I go to art club and talk about the incident. Facing the music room, there's nobody in there.</br>

<br>"Even though Junpei-san fall from stairs, he only got minor injuries like bruises and sprained his ankle. While Hinasaki-san claims she was push by Junpei-san even though she feel on herself. It's totally set-up to Junpei-san."</br>

<br>"Then, what's Kurebayashi's excuses about the incident?"</br>

<br>"I heard he was confused and couldn't make a decent excuse."</br>

<br>Because Kurebayashi is delicate and mentally unstable person, he didn't make decent excuses.</br>

<br>Since Lucia understand Kurebayashi the most, it's impossible to forgive Hinasaki by how she set-up Kurebayashi. Behind Lucia beautiful lapis lazuli eyes, a lit of fire is burning.</br>

<br>"But what's the reason why Hinasaki go that far to set-up Kurebayashi? Even sacrificing her own body to make that plan, she probably get more serious injuries than Kurebayashi."</br>

<br>Lucia said Hinasaki Yumi might be one of us. And base on Hinasaki action back then, I think she also has thing for Kurebayashi but is that really the only reason. </br>

<br>Squeezing her skirt, uneasy expression while looking at Kurebayashi and Lucia. That's how I remember Hinasaki's action back then.</br>

<br>"I don't know what's reason behind Hinasaki, but leaving her alone is my mistake. I will not forgive her. I'll find weaknesses and make her confess her sins to the teachers. After that I'll crush her like a bug."</br>

<br>Instead of finding evidence, Lucia wants to find her weaknesses. And blackmail her instead. Lucia is that kind of person.</br>

<br>Of course I'll be force to help once again. Well, I'm actually curious why Hinasaki did that, so I'm totally okay in helping.</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>So, during the next break, I visited Misono Chifuyu.</br>

<br>"Wha-what are you---"</br>

<br>Misono, beckoned by me from the corridor, turned her head and rolled her eyes, then ran out into the corridor, shaking and trembling, her voice stuttering.</br>

<br>"I already know you don't want to see me, but at least hear me out, its emergency you know Misono. I have to ask something from you."</br>

<br>We stopped at a spot where there's not much students.</br>

<br>"Wh-what?"</br>

<br>She is absurdly angry, but she seems curious why I bothered visiting her, so she swims her gaze while fidgeting.</br>

<br>"It's about Hinasaki Yumi. I heard she got injured because she was pushed by Kurebayashi in the stairs."</br>

<br>Misono suddenly get calm and make a serious look on her face.</br>

<br>I continue. "Im investigating because, were talking about Kurebayashi, its impossible for him to hurt someone especially his students. Is Kurebayashi really getting bullied at music club? </br>

<br>"Sanada-kun, you really do..... about Kurebayashi-sensei."</br>

<br>After mumbling something complicated, Misono began to speak, as if she had no choice.</br>

<br>"At first, we all really do get along with Kurebayashi-sensei. Since Kurebayashi-sensei is young, the way he talks is really have kind atmosphere into it.  Everyday after we finished practicing, Kurebayashi ask us if we have questions about him."</br>

<br>"Did Hinasaki also?"</br>

<br>"Hmm... In Hinasaki-san case, I think she really don't like Kurebayashi-sensei. Like she's really easy to tell if she's annoyed by it. Example, when we greets Kurebayashi-sensei or talking about Kurebayashi-sensei. She's really annoyed by it. I remember talking to Hinasaki-san when I joined club but for me she's kinda weird. And hard to get close."</br>

<br>So I was right. Since Ogasawara is pure he probably didn't notice it. Well, I'm not saying Misono is not pure but anyway lets listen to the continuation.</br>

<br>Misono tells that there's some girls club members that visits Kurebayashi apartment. One of the student looked at pictures album of Kurebayashi when he was still learning piano, and a picture when he was still attending in a famous band vocalist.</br>

<br>After the picture incident. Hinasaki starts to bully Kurebayashi and became totally isolated because the other students are scared of Hinasaki.</br>

<br>And the stairs incident happen.</br>

<br>"Thanks Misono, that really helps me a lot."</br>

<br>"Wha-- I won't confess to you anymore even if you flatter me." Misono said with a sharp voice.</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>After school. Me and Lucia as always in art room.  I told to Lucia about the story. She look expressionlessly but behind her face, Lucia is thinking of something. Then,</br>

<br>"Hey, Sanada-kun, What kind of expression Hinasaki-san did back then, when she saw me with Junpei-san?"</br>

<br>"She's grabbing her skirt, gritting his teeth in her lips, and she looks very worried."</br>

<br>"Worries." Lucia close her eyes and sink into her thoughts.</br>

<br>"Sanada-kun, Hanasaki-san asked something from you right?"</br>

<br>"Asked? Well, she asked me if I know you and after that, she ask 'If you guys really dating.' then 'If you already visit Kurebayashi's house.' something like that."</br>

<br>--- Is Aimoto Lucia dating Kurebayashi-sensei?</br>

<br>---- Did she already visits Kurebayashi's house?</br>

<br>That's right, when Hanasaki asking me this question, she looks really worried about something.</br>

<br>--- If they did start dating, they will.<br>

When I said that Hinasaki grabbed her skirt more violently. Then,</br>

<br>--- I will not let them!</br>

<br>Is Hinasaki don't want any students to go to Kurebayashi's room?</br>

<br>Looks like Lucia is also same mindset as I am. Her lapis lazuli starts to shine intelligently and said,</br>

<br>"The key of the mystery is mostly in Junpei-san's room."</br>

<p style= "text-align: center">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>Sunday.</br>

<br>This day, Lucia should be coming here alone while carrying hand-made cake and probably already dating Kurebayashi right now but, currently, me and Lucia comes into Kurebayashi's apartment.</br>

<br>Kurebayashi was worn out, the shirt he wore is shabby, hair is cumbled, and his face was pale. Maybe because of hard work. </br>

<br>Me who should be not be close to Lucia, is currently right here and acting like it's normal that were friends.</br>

<br>"I don't really understand. In that day, Hanasaki-san called me in the stairs and starts complaining about my teaching in the club. '---Sorry, but can you tell me later on, I'm currently in hurry.' I said. But when I starts to go downstairs Hinasaki-san blocks the way, So I tried to get out in sideways and..... I think I hit her shoulders. Then Hinasaki-san yell and feel down the stairs."</br>

<br>Kurebayashi, who is currently trembling in the sofa. Lucia grabbed his hands to calm he down.</br>

<br>Even though she's S, Lucia embrace Kurebayashi like her own son. And my heart starts to get hazy.</br>

<br>"I believe in you, Junpei-san. I know you didn't do harm on Hinasaki-san. I'm sure that was only accident."</br>

<br>Saying 'It was an accident.' is probably just to comfort delicate Kurebayashi's heart and to not get more shock about the accident.</br>

<br>"I have a way to prove Junpei-san's innocence. So please let me see your picture albums"</br>

<br>"Albums?" </br>

<br>Kurebayashi has suspicious looks on his face but, thanks to Lucia's comfort. Kurebayashi eventually bought the album to Lucia.</br>

<br>"I heard you attend to the same piano class with some famous band vocalist."</br>

<br>"In that case..." Kurebayashi turn the pages and a group photo appeared.</br>

<br>The photo was consist of 20 students from elementary to highschool, lined up in a piano recital stage.</br>

<br>And that weak-looking highschool boy who have glasses, crumbled hair, is probably Kurebayanashi.</br>

<br>Well the nervous and his innocence look still the same though. Even now his skin is silky that is same as Ogasawara Shinubo.</br>

<br>And that blonde guy who's winking on the camera is probably the famous vocalist.</br>

<br>In the corner of the picture, there's a elementary student who's hiding to her seniors. Lucia suddenly notice her and sharpen her eyes into that girl.</br>

<br>I also pay my attention to that girl.</br>

<br>The girl has cheeks plump, norrowed nostrils, and rounded body that's looks like a pig, basically not a beautiful girl. And she's wearing cute frill dress that makes her stand out even more.</br>

<br>The girl is looking downward that makes her look timid.<br>

<br>--- But her right hand is grabbing the skirt part of the dress.</br>

<br>"Found you." Lucia said.</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>The next day, Monday. Lucia called Hinasaki Yumi to go at art room during lunch break.</br>

<br>Wrapping her left ankle with bandage Hinasaki Yumi came with caution. Well it will probably heal in just few days.</br>

<br>"What's serious story you want to talk about?" Hinasaki glaring at Lucia.</br>

<br>The eyelashes are long, the nose is tall, and the mouth is arranged like a Western doll.</br>

<br>Hinasaki Yumi is extremely beautiful girl. That's what's saying the boys in my class.</br>

<br>Well, her face is not my type but, in common sense they're probably right.</br>

<br>"This is you right?"</br>

<br>Lucia suddenly shows the picture she got from Kurebayashi album.</br>

<br>Hinasaki suddenly got confused, her face stiff, the color of her face got red, and her lips is shaking like gasping.</br>

<br>"...I, I...."</br>

<br>'I dont know.' That's probably she wants to say. Distorted face and unable to say anything. Squeezing her skirt with her right hand, it's probably unconscious act of her.</br>

<br>When she was still a kid. It was probably a habit, squeezing her skirt when she's upset.</br>

<br>And the girl on the picture also squeezing her skirt like she's doing right now.</br>

<br>"You don't have to answer. Based on your reaction, I already know the truth."</br>

<br>...I'm.... not..." Hinasaki is sweating and desperately tries to deny it.</br>

<br>Lucia's expression is like a ice queen. She lifted her lips and smiles wickedly.</br>

<br>Hinasaki slowly shrink her shoulders. Lucia's platinum-gold hair shimmer and her lapis lazuli eyes burning coldly.</br>

<br>Hinasaki feel despair and fear that makes her small body shiver.</br>

<br>Lucia again attack with her arrow.</br>

<br>"When you're still in elementary school, I quite heard some rumors about you, Hinasaki-san or should I say Oinky-chan? Oh, your eye here is quite small, Oh it's buried in fat. Your teeth also is like a pig, your nostrils also big and clearly see in front. Your highschool self is really different person. I wonder if you can achieve this by only dieting? Right, Oinky-chan?"</br>

<br>Hinasaki is already done. Everytime Lucia pulls punch in Hinasaki image in past, Hinasaki just closing her eyes and clearly scared of Lucia's chilly voice.</br>

<br>Now, Lucia is treating Hinasaki like what she's doing with Kurebayashi in the music club.</br>

<br>"Stop.... stop...." said while shivering. Hinasaki already lose her will to fight.</br>

<br>Ofcourse Lucia will not stopped with something like that. Lucia show her beautiful platinum-gold hair, her beautiful face with her lapis lazuli eyes. Lucia shines like an perfect godness.</br>

<br>"You, that face yours, is plastic surgery."</br>

<br>Lucia who is born beautifully, tells her with mercy and pity.</br>

<br>"You don't want your club members to go in Kurebayashi's apartment because you don't want anyone to see Kurebayashi-sensei's album. Maybe because in the piano recital stage picture, there's a picture of the past you."</br>

<br>Lucia continue. "That's why you bully Kurebayashi-sensei, so that It'll isolate him to the other members. It's because you're already a PRINCESS now right?</br>

<br>At first, Hinasaki only just want to avoid Kurebayashi, but when Hinasaki knows about the picture album, she started to bully Kurebayashi to isolate Kurebayashi from other members.</br>

<br>That's probably the conclusion.</br>

<br>Hinasaki successfully isolate Kurebayashi to the other member but the anxiety still is still in there, as long as Kurebayashi is still in school. </br>

<br>It's not about If anyone's sees the picture again, It's about when Kurebayashi realize that Hinasaki is the ugly one in the picture.</br>

<br>That one day, everyone will know her ugly appearance.</br>

<br>Because of anxiety, Hinasaki couldn't take off her eyes on Kurebayashi. And when Kurebayashi talks to Lucia in rabbit hut. Hinasaki's greatest nightmare will eventually occur. That's what she's imagine. So she watched them carefully.</br>

<br>--Did she.... already visit.... Kurebayashi's house...?" She probably wants to confirm something.</br>

<br>Even the percentage that Lucia will recognize Hinasaki is extremely low. Hinasaki can't help to get anxious.</br>

<br>In fact. Kurebayashi is same piano class with Hinasaki. So if ever someone asked who is the ugly girl in the picture. Kurebayashi will eventually remember that the ugly girl in the picture and the current Hinasaki has same name.</br>

<br>For Kurebayshi, Hinasaki is just one of his students. But for Hinasaki, Kurebayashi is her greatest anxiety.</br>

<br>So she decide to get rid of Kurebayashi instead of waiting for the maternity leave teacher to return.</br>

<br>Set up in the stairs, getting hit by Kurebayashi and fell down in stairs. It's totally meaningless plan. It's like she planning to go suicide.</br>

<br>"You dont want anyone to know you got plastic surgery. So you get rid of Kurebayashi-sensei by falling on stairs." Lucia voice echoes.</br>

<br>Hinasaki's will collapsed. She can't even make an argument anymore. (Note: "will" means determination. Not the "will" that express future.)</br>

<br>"Tell to the teachers, that It was your set-up to get rid of Kurebayashi or else..."</br>

<br>Lucia suddenly get something from her pocket and throws it in the ceiling.</br>

<br>It was a copy of picture of the piano recital. The picture has red circle naming it to Hinasaki Yumi before the plastic surgery.</br>

<br>Hinasaki crawls and collects the photos scattered on the floor -of her past self-. But, Lucia scatters more photos.</br>

<br>"There are still a lot of them. Should I put them in the shoe boxes of all the students? Or I wonder if it would be more efficient to send them all at once with a mobile phone."</br>

<br>"Stop, stop..... already" Hinasaki cries as she squeezing the photos that are scattered on the floor, while breathing wildly.</br>

<br>"Terrible ......! Why--why are you doing this?"</br>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tmQNBg4/Screenshot-20220616-124337.png" alt="Screenshot-20220616-124337" border="0"></a>

<br>"You also did something terrible to Kurebayashi-sensei right? Hiding your bad deeds and pretending to be innocent is ugly. I like teasing cute and beautiful things but I still tease them with love, and bullying ugly like you is just waste of time. How about I'll scatter this all over the school. Even if you will not get married anymore or you'll jump to rooftop because of despair, my heart will no get affected from it." With unwavering, beautiful face. Lucia affirms</br>

<br>Hinasaki who is squeezing her skirt, which shows her thighs crouching in the floor, squeeze a voice even with tears and runny nose.</br>

<br>"Sob.... It's.... because you're..... pretty..... you will not understand..... my feelings..... Calling me..... pig..... bullying me..... in my elementary school..... 'Hey pig, how about jumping to third floor, you're a pig so it's normal you can do that. If you will not do it, I'll pluck 10-yen in your nose.' So I...... have no...... choice but to..... jump off..... and got injured."</br>

<br>After being discharged in hospital. Hinasaki lose her weight and got a beautiful face.</br>

<br>"When I..... transfer in my middle school..... everyone saying 'You're cute, You're pretty.'..... It's like my world changed..... But I still know that someday...... my secret will get exposed..... so I can't help to get conscious. And when...... Kurebayashi-sensei came here in school, I feel like...... I'm gonna past out because it's already my end."</br>

<br>Lucia's S eyes, looks down Hinasaki.</br>

<br>"S-so, What will you do now? Will you go to staff room and explain it or not? Lunch will almost end. When the class starts, some students may come in, you know."</br>

<br>"I will go now. I'll explain it to the teachers, Kurebayashi did nothing. I'm so sorry." And she apologize.</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>After cleaning up the photos that Lucia messed up earlier. Me and Lucia sandwich Hinasaki that keeps crying while having a runny nose. And Hinasaki is extremely cooperative while being taken to staff room.</br>

<br>"Hey, Hinasaki, I know already that, what you've done to Kurebayashi is not good thing, but you've already cry a lot right? So stop already. It's not like I hate crying woman, in fact I love them, but the way you cry now..... It doesn't turn me on.</br>

<br>Then Hinasaki looks at me like 'What a jerk.'</br>

<br>Not only Lucia, but also the other girls in the hallway, looking at me with fear and criticism.</br>

<br>Beyond Hanasaki, Lucia is frowning something. She's probably thinking 'Why I'm even talking to this girl.' something like that.</br>

<br>But were talking about Lucia. Lucia who is popular, will easily follow the other girls reaction.</br>

<br>Then I look down to Hinasaki's messed up face.</br>

<br>"If you remove your tsundere act... You're prettier." I said.</br>

<br>"Wha-!?"</br>

<br>Then Hinasaki looks away while Lucia shakes her shoulders with a twitch.</br>

<br>"I heard you're the next president of music club, and president is the central figure of the club right? Then that means you work hard to get that position for yourself and you're already a beautiful girl now. So be proud. "</br>

<br>"Guhhuuugh...." Hinasaki look at me red face and stiff voice.</br>

<br>Then we arrive at staff room.</br>

<br>"Go now."</br>

<br>When I press her shoulder, Hinasaki face suddenly get red again with mixture of tsundere face. Then she pursed her lips.</br>

<br>"I will not forget what you did to me."</br>

<br>"It's normal to whipped before sweets right?" Lucia answered while having dissatisfied face.</br>

<br>"Well I don't hate Sanada-kun's S habit while having strong sense in justice. Sometimes it annoys me though." Lucia still looks dissatisfied.</br>

<br>"I see." I let the conversation off.</br>

<br>"Well whatever, after this you'll get big sweet."</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>The next day. Kurebayashi returned to school.</br>

<br>After rainy day, a nice and relaxing sunny day appear. And at the front of the the rabbit hutch. Lucia's golden hair shines beautifully while looking at Kureyabayashi.</br>

<br>And I'm peeking at the side of the school building.</br>

<br>"At first I'm worried but I believed at Kurebayashi-sensei. Because sensei is my..... "</br>

<br>Talking loudly then slowly lowering the voice while getting red cheeks is just normal on how "in-love/maiden" girl talked. </br>

<br>Lucia, you're really good at toying man's heart.</br>

<br>Kurebayashi is also staring at Lucia with a thoughtful look.</br>

<br>This guy probably into Lucia now.</br>

<br>But my heart still feel hazy. And maybe it's already time to change pace.</br>

<br>But in that moment, Kurebayashi suddenly look at me.</br>

<br>Crap... Our eyes met.</br>

<br>I pull my head back in a hurry.</br>

<br>"Hey, you! come back here!" Kurebayashi said with happy voice.</br>

<br>'Guhhh.... It's already a chance to confess to me, why did you interfere us.' Lucia will surely tell me that later.</br>

<br>"Hey, You!" Kurebayashi still calling me.</br>

<br>I have no choice but to walk through the rabbit hutch, then Lucia hide behind Kurebayashi back while looking at me with 'Remember this!' Unlike Lucia, Kurebayashi looked at me friendly.</br>

<br>"You and Lucia-san came to my apartment the other day right? And you guys even pursueded Hinasaki-san for me. Thanks, both of you."</br>

<br>Kurebayashi continue. "And you've been watching over Aimoto-san for a long time right?"</br>

<br>Now this is a huge misunderstanding. How much do have good virtue this guy is. </br>

<br>Then Lucia interfere Kurebayashi.</br>

<br>"Thanks for taking care of me.... Even this time. Thank you very much." and she politely bow to me.</br>

<br>"Eh, Um.... You're welcome." I replied.</br>

<br>Crap.... That "Thanks you for taking care of me..... even this time." really did pierce my heart.</br>

<br>What kind of situation this is?</br>

<br>"And Hinasaki-san also apologize to me already. I'm really relieved."</br>

<br>Kurebayashi is smiling. Maybe the problem is already solved, that is why he don't feel worry anymore. And his face is all shiny now, same as his highschool picture.</br>

<br>This man is not beautiful man at all but a pure one instead. He even forgive Hinasaki for apologizing in her bullying. And he even feel happy when Jinasaki apologize to him personally.</br>

<br>He's a good man.</br>

<br>Since Kurebayashi is mentally weak, he's probably look good with Lucia.</br>

<br>"Hey, Listen to me." <br>

<br>A small bitter voice comes behind.</br>

<br>I suddenly grab both hands of Kurebyashi and lifted them up. (Note: Sanada probably going to say 'Take care of Lucia' something like that)</br>

<br>Kurebayashi look at me "Eh?" expression, while Lucia is looking at me with serious expression.</br>

<br>In the past week, Lucia asked me to help her, but now this is not acting, I will said this with my serious feeling.</br>

<br>But before I speak up, a loud voice echoed in the backyard. (Note: Like I told you.)</br>

<br>"Don't get close to that guy. That's pervert!"</br>

<br>In front of us. A girl running out of breath suddenly appeared. It was Chifuyu Misono.</br>

<br>Why Misono?</br>

<br>Wait, What did she say? A pervert? Is she talking about Lucia or about Kurebayashi?</br>

<br>Or..... Is it me!?</br>

<br>Misono suddenly came to me grabbing my hand and use the momentum to pull it off.</br>

<br>Then Misono shook of my hands like a germs and put her index finger in my lips.</br>

<br>"Don't get fooled Kurebayashi sensei. This guy is planning for pervert confession. He would stare at me every day with a intense gaze, and when I would confess my feelings for him and he wiil agreed, then he will shake my feelings like a devil. I thought I should just ignore this but still I can't, when Hinasaki-san ask me. "Are you close to..... Sanada-kun?" I thought you were only after Kurebayashi-sensei, but you're even targeting Hinasaki-san in your sights as well, you pervert!</br>

<br>She's talking while having excitement. So I don't really understand.</br>

<br>About Hinasaki? And then I'm close with Misono? How's even that connected with targeting Hinasaki as well? </br>

<br>Lucia who is listening intently to Misono. While Kurebayashi is clueless as ever.</br>

<br>"Eh, Eh? Pervert? Are they talking about you? Sanada-kun?"</br>

<br>"It's not only Hinasaki-san, He even groped Ogasawara-kun at the train. He's a pervert who don't care about gender. Whether man or a woman."</br>

<br>"He got groped? That timid Ogasawara-kun?"</br>

<br>Kurebayashi can't help to get surprised. It's because he probably realize that Ogasawara is same type as him.</br>

<br>But Me groping Ogasawara is funny misunderstanding though.</br>

<br>"Hey Misono, I still haven't molested anyone. And if ever I'll molested anyone, I will not do it with Ogasawara."</br>

<br>"Mo-molested." Misono said with bright red face.</br>

<br>"I already have proof." Misono said like a detective in a T.V. drama series.</br>

<br>Misono continue. "I heard there's a lot of people who saw Sanada-kun and Ogasawara-kun in train while Ogasawara is embarrassed with bright red face." </br>

<br>No, that's because I helped Ogasawara being molested.</br>

<br>"And a salaryman with dandy suit saw Ogasawara-kun running away from you."</br>

<br>That's the molester! Why's the information so confusing?</br>

<br>"And when I asked Ogasawara-kun about the molester, he said "Ye-yep, Sanada-kun did..." he got red and unable to say anything anymore."</br>

<br>Ogasawara.... Why did you stopped talking in the most important part? That definitely tells, I'm the one who groped you.</br>

<br>Kurebayashi start to look at me differently.</br>

<br>"Kurebayashi-sensei, he's also targeting you. Didn't you feel nasty look on his eyes?"</br>

<br>"Now that you menti.... But he's actually looking at Aimoto-san."</br>

<br>"Nope. Kurebayashi-sensei, you're his target. I'm confident with this because, he already looked at me in that way. This guy is pervert till his bone!"</br>

<br>Ah~~ What should I do with this situation....</br>

<br>Maybe I'll just admit 'I'm pervert, what's wrong with that?' It's probably less effort explaining the situation...</br>

<br>"After school, he's always staring at you at art club room secretly."</br>

<br>"Eh? art club room?"</br>

<br>This is bad. If Misono talks more, she might tell unintentionally, Lucia also staring at Kurebayashi.</br>

<br>If that happens, It'll surely reveal that me and Lucia actually knows each other and will lost her chance to get Kurebayashi.</br>

<br>Maybe the best way to solve this problem is to admit that "I'm a pervert."</br>

<br>I'm proud pervert anyway. Here we go~</br>

<br>But before I open my mouth.</br>

<br>"Don't get mistaken. Sanada-kun is not the pervert, but me."</br>

<br>Misono shut her mouth. While Kurebayashi moves his eyes to Lucia.</br>

<br>And I'm stunned.</br>

<br>What are you doing? Lucia? You're in front of Kurebayashi you know. Isn't your job, to pretend weak and lonely girl?</br>

<br>But Lucia didn't hold back. Her lapis lazuli eyes sparkle and stand to her feet confidently.</br>

<br>"Even if Sanada-kun is pervert, He can't beat my pervertedness."</br>

<br>"Aimoto-san? Why you?..."</br>

<br>Lucia looks at sweating Kurebayashi and smiles like an evil queen.</br>

<br>"Even the time when you starts to teach at Music room, I've been looking forward on licking all of your body parts. I wonder how happy I am, if I put dog collar in your neck while taking a walk in a full moon. I'm also imagining you torturing you all day long while collecting your tears in a violet bottle and arranging them around in a bed with the petals of crimson roses.</br>

<br>"Hey, Aimoto." I called out.</br>

<br>I stop Lucia who silent after calling her out. And she suddenly started to stretch her body. Being with sunlight, she stood up like a noble who's not at least embarrassed how perverted her imagination is.</br>

<br>"My mother is a housewife whose hobby is handicrafts, and my father is a civil servant who works in a department where he is not busy and leaves on time. I asked Sanada-kun to act as well, because we are in the same art club. Sanada-kun was watching us because he was worried that I might let my perversion get out of control and attack Junpei-san, so he couldn't take his eyes off of me. There is no way that Sanada-kun would molest an amateur boy on a train. He has a strong sense of justice. If it were me, I might forget myself and molest a boy of my choice in front of him."</br>

<br>Misono looks at Lucia without saying anything.</br>

<br>And Lucia defended me.</br>

<br>But Lucia.</br>

<br>With this.... you will...</br>

<br>And Lucia look at Kurebayashi once again.</br>

<br>Kurebayashi who notice Lucia's eyes suddenly get stiffen.</br>

<br>"Even I am pervert. Will you still go out with me? Junpei-san?"</br>

<br>Kurebayashi who hear Lucia's confession, he can't help himself to get confused. His eyes is too pure, that you can basically tell he is hesitating and frightened.</br>

<br>He's probably thinking, having a good relationship with a girl who admit to herself many times, that she's pervert, will not work.</br>

<br>Then.</br>

<br>"Im sorry."</br>

<br>Lucia watch Kurebayashi bow deeply, and smile like "I'm counting her to you." facing into me.</br>

<br>With a bitter and light smile.</br>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇ ◇ ◇</p>

<br>After school the next day.</br>

<br>Lucia and I were sitting across from each other by the window of the art room. There was a desk between us, and on the top of it was a pack of glossy cherries that I had bought on my way out of school during my lunch break.</br>

<br>"It was too early to reveal the true me. I should have tied Junpei-san's heart more. In that way my confession should be more successful. That was mistake of me." Lucia said with calm face.</br>

<br>Then Lucia pick a cherry with stem attached into it and put it into her mouth.</br>

<br>In that time, Lucia protected me.</br>

<br>When Lucia still appreciating Kurebayashi, I pretend like a "pervert" to hide Lucia from Kurebayashi. And just like plan that's how Misono sees me. </br>

<br>What if I admit that I was the pervert. Will Lucia deny it?</br>

<br>At the side, Kurebayashi who's teaching in the music room looks really relieved. Lucia also probably relieved seeing Kurebayashi doing well.</br>

<br>Misono who is playing fulte, sometimes looks at me. And when our met, she don't embarrassed from it. She just naturally look away from my gaze.</br>

<br>And Hinasaki starts to play violin as well, she rest her chin and sometimes look at me, then starts to play violin again.</br>

<br>The other side seems to be reasonably peaceful</br>

<br>While Lucia who got dumped by Kurebayashi.</br>

<br>"I'm already get used to rejection. I think in my kindergarten. There was a boy named Yuki-kun. I like making him cry all the time sometimes I put worms on his desk. Then 'Lucia-chan is pervert, You're gross. I don't want to play with you anymore.' Yuki-kun said to me. That was my first rejection. And after that I got rejected many times, so the rejection in the past is also same rejection I feel now."</br>

<br>And we clean up. Lucia expression is cool as ever. It's same as usual.</br>

<br>Yes, Lucia is too beautiful to be envied, but she is strong and tough enough to bully bullies back. Even she can't understand or relate herself to other people, she has proper friends. Growing up in a normal family with a father working in civil servant, a mother of a housewife, and a younger brother who was pranked by cockroaches. </br>

<br>She probably pretend it didn't hurt, but actually she did get hurt from rejection.</br>

<br>Lucia probably already understand, why people rejects her, because of the word "like" she's talking about is different meanings to other people.</br>

<br>Lucia learned from kindergarten that the word "like" she mean will not accept by other people.</br>

<br>That is why Lucia plan, strategies, and learn the target like engrossing yourself to them. Or else they will only think Lucia is pervert and creepy. And get rejected once again.</br>

<br>Lucia is lonely. That my understanding on Lucia. How do I know? It's because I also feel loneliness myself.</br>

<br>Lucia had a look "Leave me alone" on her face while putting cherries in her mouth.</br>

<br>I took one cherry and put it against Lucia's lips.</br>

<br>Lucia met my eyes while the cherry on his lips are pressing. Then.</br>

<br>"What are you doing?" With calm voice.</br>

<br>"This kinda turn me on, like S and M combination something like that."</br>

<br>"Are you challenging me?"</br>

<br>"Let see.... You're S too."</br>

<br>"Yeah, you too."</br>

<br>There was no sweet things happening between us but I feel sense of camaraderie</br>

<br>"I'm glad Sanada-kun was S."</br>

<br>Lucia murmured as if it didn't matter.</br>

<br>"If Sanada-kun is M, It'll be lonesome. because you're not cute nor beautiful." (NOTE: Means no one will take Sanada because Sanada have no MOE points.)</br>

<br>'Surely.' But the word just now probably comes from her heart, which is rare.</br>

<br>'--- If I was M. What will you do?'</br>

<br>'--- I will not like it. Very much.'</br>

<br>Maybe, when I said that, I was also serious in that time.</br>

<br>"They say a good kisser also good at licking cherries. But for me I want to go further than kiss." Lucia said while removing seed from her mouth.</br>

<br>"Hey Sanada-kun, how many holes are there in human body that can fit cherries?"</br>

<br>"Six?"</br>

<br>"Nope, I found nine spots."</br>

<br>"Eh? Where's the last 3?"</br>

<br>"If you're only cute boy, I'll gladly do it for you, but unfortunately.... you're not." (Note: They started to talk dirty here.)</br>

<br>"How about I'll use the stem of the cherry and make you cum?" I said. (Note: Sanada probably get the idea where will Lucia put the cherry.)</br>

<br>"Have you ever used stem to make others cum? Sanda-kun?"</br>

<br>"Yep, It's because my practitioner" (Note: google "practitioner")</br>

<br>"You pervert."</br>

<br>"Is there even place where put 9 cherries?"</br>

<br>"Of course, you have to practice it also, so that you know where you can put it to others."</br>

<br>"You're also pervert."</br>

<br>Lucia probably don't want any comfort words from others. That is why we talked about cherries erotic components.</br>

<br>And today again, we talked about insolent things.</br>
