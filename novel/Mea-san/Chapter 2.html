<h3>Chapter 2 - Nice to meet you, Mea-san.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That day. I left my house with my father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s going on, Dad?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;ve to wait until we get there! Ha-ha.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He laughed out loud as usual, then glanced at me and grinned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I see…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, I fixed my bangs and got ready.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a situation like this, a man shouldn&#8217;t care about the details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no choice but to play it cool, even though I was nervous about where we&#8217;re going.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I never knew what was in his mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the first </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;assignment&#8217;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from you in a while.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, something like that. So here we are.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; As you wish.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll try my best.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To tell you the truth, my family is a little different from most.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ever since I was a little child, my dad has given me various &#8220;assignments&#8221; from time to time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What were they, I&#8217;ll put it aside for now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever I was given one of these assignments, I was always thrilled in one way or another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like I wanted to be like my father, even if just a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s right. He&#8217;s my role model. I always wanted to be like him (except for his personality).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, ever since I was little, I&#8217;ve been trying to be a man… In other words, I was trying to be taller&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If my dad gave me a task, no matter how difficult it was, I did it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Moreover, the day after tomorrow, I will finally be a junior high school student.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A junior high student is an adult. At least, more than an elementary student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, naturally, the assignments from my father must be on a different level than before.</span></p>
<div class="zetro-c10bd0cc39b80af367992b41add7c24e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c10bd0cc39b80af367992b41add7c24e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s why I accepted his assignment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(No matter what the challenge is, I&#8217;m going to overcome it and show him that I&#8217;m better than before&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I walked for about 15 minutes, thinking about that.</span></p>
<p><span : 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right, we&#8217;re here. It&#8217;s 201!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We arrived at a brand-new apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He walked lightly through the entrance and up the stairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I checked the surroundings just to be sure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seemed like a simple apartment in a residential area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But you never know what&#8217;s behind it&#8230; My dad might ask me about it later. It&#8217;s best to check in advance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Is there enough room inside? There&#8217;s quite a bit of space from the surrounding buildings.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It had city gas. Also, the internet is already installed (it was written on the sign for tenants). Hmm&#8230; I see…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey~! Kuya, what are you doing? Hurry up.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah… sorry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Father called me as he came down the stairs, and I rushed to join him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Sorry, just checking to make sure, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay. So, how was it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess you want me to meet someone who lives here…?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fu</span></i> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fu fu</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He grinned. Guess I was right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The building itself is normal, so I thought it would probably be something like that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m saying, you like it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What did he mean by, &#8220;Do you like…?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, whatever. They&#8217;re already here, so come with me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Uh, yeah.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-15c8c24fc77cf05deff463bb2323a83b zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-15c8c24fc77cf05deff463bb2323a83b"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over there? They&#8217;re already here? Does this mean it&#8217;s a joint operation?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wondered, but he didn&#8217;t reveal more than he had to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without any further explanation, I had no choice but to follow him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s how I arrived at the door of room 201. My father immediately pressed the intercom.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes&#8230;&#8221;</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the voice of an old man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, Yoshitsugu? It&#8217;s me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wait a sec.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The door opened immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The man who came out was about the same age as my father, a thin man with wrinkled eyebrows and a scary look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was pushed forward by my father.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, so you&#8217;re Kuya~kun. Come on in.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-yes, pardon the intrusion…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He was a scary man, not only in terms of his face but also in terms of his surroundings. I was a little anxious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But as soon as I saw the inside of the room, I was blown away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be precise, the room was brand new and fully furnished, just like a high-class suite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah&#8230; hello.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as I entered, a girl greeted me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was very pretty and seems to be a little older than me.　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t help but gaze at her beauty. To be honest, she&#8217;s as beautiful as a celebrity or idol.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as our eyes met, I just nodded a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><br />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her movements were elegant as if it were a traditional dance or something. I guessed she was a princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hurriedly looked away. Or rather, I was embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If only I was a little— taller!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because she was about the same height as me, or a little shorter, I honestly felt like I was being held back at this stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is not how a man should be. I mustered up all my courage, put on a calm expression, and fixed my bangs while bringing them up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hello, I&#8217;m Kuya Nonomiya.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I took the initiative and introduced myself.</span></p><div class="zetro-f1907a42289314dc0c384e7b66cb102c zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f1907a42289314dc0c384e7b66cb102c"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then she also bowed and replied,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Mea Chitose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She had a gentle voice, like the sound of wind chimes ringing in the summer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8230;She&#8217;s really a real Princess!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was our short exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And I&#8217;m Yoshitsugu Chitose, Mea&#8217;s father and an old friend of your father.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes no sense that he could be the father of such a pretty girl, because of his scary face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more I thought about it… the more questions arise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the h**l is going on here? Did my father want me to meet these people? What&#8217;s the point of letting me see them? And what&#8217;s up with this house?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned to my Dad and saw him nodding with a big smile and his arms crossed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And her father nodded in agreement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, as of today, Kuya and Mea-chan are newlyweds! You two have to live together here from now on!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Yes?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, all the questions I had earlier have been answered. But now I have the biggest question! &#8211;  What is going on…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was visibly confused in my thoughts, Dad in a great mood said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve always said that we should get you two married in the future~ Yoshitsugu!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father on the other side made a bitter face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of the so-called bride to be…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A bride to be? Like a fiancée?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are such things possible nowadays? And to a cute and adorable young lady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But still, isn&#8217;t this too much too soon, Touya?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father&#8217;s face became more and more bitter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, he wasn&#8217;t happy about this development.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No….it’s not, father.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But his daughter… The girl who will be my wife wasn&#8217;t like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She brushed off her long, beautiful hair and said,</span></p><div class="zetro-6363ee649fb97eab9b8f187f2dd94832 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-6363ee649fb97eab9b8f187f2dd94832"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ll be in junior high the day after tomorrow. That means we&#8217;re mature enough.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked mature, but&#8230; she was the same age as me. And she seems to be rather enthusiastic about this development.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You can say that, Mea…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right Mea-chan. You&#8217;re already in junior high school!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her father looked even more bitter at his daughter&#8217;s words, but my father brushed it off in a jovial tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A junior high school student is thirteen years old. So, it&#8217;s only natural for you to do this!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right, uncle, no, I mean father-in-law.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ll be in junior high the day after tomorrow. That means we&#8217;re mature enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeesh~, that&#8217;s right. Father-in-law, I love the sound of that! I&#8217;ve been waiting for this day!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the other side her father raised his eyebrows and fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Kuya-kun.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looked at me as if I was his last hope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You… Is that okay with you? Isn&#8217;t It too early…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Indeed, it was sudden. It was unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was sure her father wanted me to reject this proposal so that he could end this matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, I looked at my dad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He grinned and nodded in return.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a gesture that said, &#8220;You&#8217;ll accept it, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dad has given me &#8220;challenges&#8221; like this many times before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I&#8217;ve never rejected any of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then turned to the girl, who would be my fiancée.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her cheeks were red and she looked down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Such a cute reaction, I was embarrassed as well so I looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My heart was beating so fast. It&#8217;s indescribable, a feeling similar to tickling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(My, my wife. From today, we&#8217;ll be living as a couple&#8230;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very mature… thing to do.</span></p><div class="zetro-18d1bdb7113ec2006f13a421d47d43e8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-18d1bdb7113ec2006f13a421d47d43e8"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And she&#8217;s such a… The cutest girl I&#8217;ve ever seen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Kuya-kun?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t mind either way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I found myself nodding as if to show that I can do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t know what the outcome of this decision would be. Even how the &#8220;newlywed life&#8221; I&#8217;m about to lead will be like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What if I didn&#8217;t nod? I thought about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, it’s just like she said. We&#8217;re going to be in junior high school, so we&#8217;re mature now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hearing my reply, her father fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My dad, on the other hand, had a big smile on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well said! Then, it&#8217;s settled. You&#8217;ve got the furniture and money for the time being, so you two can start living together! It&#8217;ll be a new start for you two!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He declared and patted our shoulders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, our fathers left and we were left alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the evening sunlight falls through the window, we both sat down on the cushions in the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um… Mea-san, is that okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I scratched my forehead while waiting for her reply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wasn&#8217;t sure if I should call by her name or with &#8220;chan&#8221; either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-yes… Kuya-san.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this kind of atmosphere, she was sitting up straight, looking like a perfect being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;~~~~~~~~~~&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What happened&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She was bashful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um&#8230; I was just wondering what the proper… word is.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I should use honorifics or not. Since we&#8217;re the same age, but I&#8217;ll be your wife, so…&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-e98697a5fc1e602507dc0d9416f09c3b zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e98697a5fc1e602507dc0d9416f09c3b"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When she said this, I was thrilled!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, it&#8217;s dangerous for my heart to see such a fine beauty acting like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;N-no, it&#8217;s fine. I want us to be on an equal footing.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So&#8230; I can&#8217;t help but reply with as much composure as I can muster.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Mia showed more and more embarrassment as she shrunk further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um… I-I understand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She nodded, but then her cheeks flushed with embarrassment and her gaze wandered from place to place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m not used to this kind of thing.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m not used to talking to b-boys like this.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh… I see.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why is it thrilling every time I hear her voice?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(So, she has never talked to a boy before? I&#8217;m the first!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a little bit superior, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8230; And yet she accepted such a silly story.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Um, but, Kuya-san…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-what?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While being embarrassed she squeezed my hand and put it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best as your wife.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I rolled my eyes and thought,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8230; Are we going to do it?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But when I think back, this girl was supportive from the beginning. She told her father that we were mature enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Mea-san, did you know about this?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;N-no, I was brought here by my father. He told me that my future husband would be here any minute.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s the same for me. I don&#8217;t know why I&#8217;m asking this, but why did you accept this, Mea-san? Why were you so determined?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;When I said this, she looked away.</span></p><div class="zetro-9fabed26439b93f89f3d9935758bd685 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9fabed26439b93f89f3d9935758bd685"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s… a secret.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She whispered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(&#8230; Secret?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If she says so, I can&#8217;t really ask. Or rather if she asked me, I would&#8217;ve said the same thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Anyway. If that&#8217;s the case, from now on I&#8217;ll be in your care. Let&#8217;s do our best together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She smiled a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was such an innocent smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I looked away again, not knowing what to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From now on, we&#8217;re going to live here as a &#8220;couple&#8221;. How am I supposed to treat her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She told me that she would do her best as my wife, but…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I met her a while ago; I think it would be a little too much to do something like a real couple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well, yes, let&#8217;s check our room and the money our father left behind. That will determine the way we live.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I changed the topic so that I could escape. Naturally, in a calm tone as much as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t want her to think that I&#8217;m a kid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I fixed my bangs up and grabbed my Passbook, which seemed to have money in it. Incidentally, I also had my credit card, Personal ID, and a note with a PIN number.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Which one is… isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I raised my voice in a strange way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s happened Kuya-san?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, well, the thing is…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve got about&#8230; a million in my account!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is this my allowance? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s a lot of money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had this much money, I could do anything… Are you sure you want me to have this, Dad?</span></p><div class="zetro-1c698f28ad61203adadae0bb2aa0c01d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1c698f28ad61203adadae0bb2aa0c01d"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was upset and excited and excited at the same time, but I couldn&#8217;t let that show.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There was a lot of money in there&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what to do with it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can I see it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, sure.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Careful not to let my hands tremble, I handed the Passbook to Mea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looked at the amount and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Our monthly rent, food, and utilities are all covered from this, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm? Oh! So that&#8217;s how it works&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I see. I&#8217;ve been living at home, so I&#8217;ve never had to worry about that…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike me, Mea seems to have a solid economic plan. I keep looking at her, who was calculating with her finger, One-Two-Three,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; I think we can manage for half a year or so, with a margin.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s right!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although it was over a million, it was only for half a year…!</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought that with that much money I could easily live off of it for a year or so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was groaning in disbelief, Mea closed the Passbook and said, &#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll have to use some of this money to buy uniforms.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We&#8217;ve to pay for our summer uniform out of this.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Oh… that&#8217;ll happen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get more if we run short, but now that we&#8217;ve got it all in one place, I think we should try to save some of it so we can make it last as long as possible.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Saving&#8230; Yeah, I agree with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not sure I can keep up, but I can&#8217;t help but agree with her while scratching my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s tougher than she looks. If I don&#8217;t do something, I&#8217;m going to be forced to rely on her&#8230; That&#8217;s kind of a bad idea&#8230;!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only she&#8217;s beautiful, but also very smart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Isn&#8217;t this what you call an &#8220;ideal wife&#8221;?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not surprising that I couldn&#8217;t help but think about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And when I think about it, I became more and more conscious of her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh&#8230; I should check the fridge, too!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shaking off my embarrassment, I stood up and walked over to the refrigerator.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thankfully, this room is fully equipped with all the appliances and furniture. It looks like we&#8217;ll have no trouble at all making a living. Apparently, my dad prepared it for us in advance, as well as the room, but… since he went to all this trouble, I&#8217;m sure they want it to last.</span></p><div class="zetro-f26d850461fbd029d1ffa02a94857623 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f26d850461fbd029d1ffa02a94857623"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Long… how far, of course, until we married&#8230;?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve become even more aware of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I opened the refrigerator with a bang while trying to cover up my embracement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inside, I found meat, eggs, vegetables, and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our fathers had prepared so much of us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I guess I don&#8217;t have to go shopping today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I knew it, Mea was right behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re right.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When we stood side by side, she was really almost the same height as me, just a bit shorter than me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This means that she&#8217;s about 156 centimeters tall… I&#8217;m only 158 centimeters tall (It&#8217;s frustrating).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m jealous that girls have early growth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Mea… are you fine with a kid like me as your husband?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more I think about it again, the more I grieve, (No, I&#8217;m not a kid!)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll make dinner for now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to say it in a composed manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know I&#8217;ve been saying this a lot, but it can&#8217;t be helped. I don&#8217;t want to make a mess on the first day. And I don&#8217;t want to disappoint Mia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I&#8217;m going to cook. I&#8217;ve never done much cooking before, but I&#8217;m sure I can handle it. All I have to do is chop the ingredients, cook them and season them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, Mea, I&#8217;ll take care of cookin—&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But she stopped me. I was about to scratch up my hair,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;L-let me make it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her enthusiastic voice overtook me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What? Are… you sure?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-it&#8217;s my duty.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She insisted, her cheeks flushed and her hands clasped tightly at her heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I… I&#8217;m your wife, and… I-it&#8217;s my duty to cook for my&#8230; husband.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8216;I&#8217;m you wife… wife… wife.&#8217;</span></i></p>
<div class="zetro-c33ec0bbf9c0524a6995f2b25f9dc215 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c33ec0bbf9c0524a6995f2b25f9dc215"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a bit too much of a power word that hit me hard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;All right. All right. You can do it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had to nod my head in a relaxed manner, even though I was really upset.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the duty of a husband to support his wife.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you, Kuya-san&#8230;, can you wait? You can watch the TV in the meantime?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Okay&#8230; Thank you, too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kuya-san, you&#8217;re my husband and I&#8217;m your wife. So, there is no need to thank me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ahh… is that how it works…?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I couldn&#8217;t argue with her willingness, so I went back to the living room and sat down on a cushion, and turned on the TV for the time being.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Let&#8217;s see, we have… pork, onions, and mushrooms…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I kept catching glimpses of her back as she was looking for new ingredients.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It was an open kitchen, so I can see it even if I don&#8217;t want to.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least I&#8217;m recognized by her as a &#8220;Husband&#8221;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, I&#8217;ll have to wait for her patiently, even though I&#8217;m nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; stir-fried vegetables.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She clenched her fists again in excitement.</span></p>




<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a few minutes later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were at the dining table sitting right in front of each other’s faces in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s because… It was unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This is not&#8230; edible, you know.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stir-fry vegetables that she made were charred and looked like charcoal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rice that was being cooked at the same time was gooey and looked like porridge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest…</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> it was terrible</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Kuya-san!&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-06b436969a9b593d11fbe41d017284fa zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-06b436969a9b593d11fbe41d017284fa"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was at a loss as to how to react, but Mea bowed with a tearful face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I&#8217;ve never actually cooked before…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;O-Oh!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230; Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She slumped her shoulders and nodded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, she was so enthusiastic about it making it look as if she knows everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can&#8217;t be helped; I have to eat it no matter how it turns out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;IT&#8217;S OKAY! It&#8217;s already cooked! Itadakimasu!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said as loud as I could, clasped my hands together, and started to eat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s… Ah… the burnt part is a little hard&#8230; and bitter&#8230; And partly sour&#8230;!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that&#8217;s it! Don&#8217;t think about it, just chew and swallow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kuya-san, please take it easy…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious! After a long while since I&#8217;ve had a home-cooked meal, so I&#8217;m really happy!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded in a cheerful voice as if to cheer up Mia, who seemed to be struggling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But it seemed to have the opposite effect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; for making you feel so uncomfortable…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she saw that I&#8217;m forcing myself to eat, Mea dropped her shoulders and looked down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing to apologize for, it&#8217;s just the beginning, I&#8217;ll help you from now on!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s my duty… I don&#8217;t want to trouble you, Kuya-san.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve been trying to follow up, but she&#8217;s making me feel worse!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What should I do? Guess I have to eat everything in front of me&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea was still depressed, while I was furiously moving my chopsticks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the meal&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Your bath is ready.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, she had changed her mind and decided to make up for it with another task.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Please go ahead Kuya-san!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like before, she was in great enthusiasm. She pressed her hands to her heart and pleaded.</span></p><div class="zetro-cb25ee5e190d520291e44713c9262aa0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cb25ee5e190d520291e44713c9262aa0"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Thank you… then I&#8217;ll go first.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there&#8217;ll go nothing wrong. It&#8217;s just a bath, it will not be as bad as cooking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conveniently, in the drawers were several pairs of towels and underwear, along with towels. Dad&#8217;s attention to detail is unparalleled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I grabbed them and heded for the bathroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I checked beforehand&#8230; Yeah, It&#8217;s hot water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I took off my clothes without worry and washed my hair first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s my custom to get into the bathtub after washing my body. So, this is the procedure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After I finished rinsing my hair, I went to… to wash my body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;U-um&#8230; Kuya-san&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I heard a knock on the door and her voice I was startled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-What&#8217;s wrong, Mea-san?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I asked while covering my crotch somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems she&#8217;s up for something(again).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;C-can I come in?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the h**l did she just say?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;W-wait&#8230; N-no, you c-can&#8217;t come inside.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;D-don&#8217;t worry, I have a bath towel wrapped around me&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Thud*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before I could say it, the door was opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there she was, just as she said, naked with a bath towel wrapped around her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;U-um, I&#8217;ll w-wash your back.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah, no, that&#8217;s…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I t-think it&#8217;s my duty as your w-wife!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seems desperate as she came forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at her figure, I can&#8217;t help but notice how well developed she is.!</span></p>
<div class="zetro-7d8f952fe50e2ebc87ac7f913561f2c3 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7d8f952fe50e2ebc87ac7f913561f2c3"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even wrapped in a bath towel, her b*****s look really soft and puffy, and the slim waistline and… bare legs are too poisonous to the eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if… she wants to wash my back then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s O-okay, I guess. Go ahead.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned my back to her and sat on the bath chair, keeping my crotch covered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it&#8217;s the wife&#8217;s role to wash the back, then in a sense it&#8217;s the husband&#8217;s duty to let her do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s the point of me being a little embarrassed?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea is definitely more nervous, so I&#8217;ll just have to be patient here!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;ll s-start.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She picked up a nylon towel that was provided in the bathroom, lathered it up (I can&#8217;t tell because she had her back to me, but maybe), and started rubbing my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a unique sensation. It was ticklish, different from washing myself, but not stimulating enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Is this&#8230; enough, I wonder&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Y-you… can do it harder.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Harder… Um… mm… mmm&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Probably because of applying more pressure, her small voice leaked in rhythm as she washed my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she was right behind me, ugh… it&#8217;s ticklish and embarrassing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s feeling the same.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm~~~~ hm~~~&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes she would stop and moan, as if she was trying to hold something back. It felt like she&#8217;s tired.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Is she overdoing it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I&#8217;ve never met a girl before who comes in wearing just a bath towel and washed my back…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;M-Mea, take it easy, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn&#8217;t help but turn around and say,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that was not a good idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As soon as our eyes met, she turned red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m sure she didn&#8217;t expect me to turn around. She shrank as if to hide her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;~~~&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aa! I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-5de37a8adb00198dea6e2e135e6cd18c zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5de37a8adb00198dea6e2e135e6cd18c"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned back in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Woosh*</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t know what happened all of a sudden, but Mea disappeared and her bath towel fell on the spot. As if she wasn&#8217;t here in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah&#8230;eh… What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I stood up in a panic and had forgotten to cover my crotch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mea…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked over again then,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aa…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh…&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our eyes met.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were both naked, and we both looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oppai! Nipples! There…!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If it were a normal situation, I would have been excited, but unfortunately, right now I&#8217;m more surprised than that!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Wai— Mea, how did you get behind me in that instant?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;S-secret… it&#8217;s a secret. Please d-don&#8217;t look at me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry! Ah! Don&#8217;t look at me either.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Eh… kyaaaa… elephant-san!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;D-don&#8217;t look at me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Afterward…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the living room, we were sitting right in front of each other in silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I couldn&#8217;t bathe as it was, so I hurriedly jumped out, wiped my body, put on my clothes, and returned to the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a while, Mea also came out in her clothes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, to say the least, it&#8217;s…awkward. It&#8217;s too awkward&#8230;!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, even if we keep silent with each other then there&#8217;s no end&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mea, that was──&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I put my courage and start the conversation,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah~~~~&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-fe809dafbe1272a8ad0ff3c35c8a5f06 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-fe809dafbe1272a8ad0ff3c35c8a5f06"></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea squealed and looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if she was too embarrassed to look at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;T-there is nothing to be ashamed of. It&#8217;s just that you saw me naked.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though she was pouting, she said such things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at that face, I felt a strange tingling feeling.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to see more of this cute Mea-san.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But&#8230; Well, it was your first day as a wife, so you were just thinking what you should be doing”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Mea whispered in a small voice like a mosquito.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But I overdid it…now when I think about it…going to wash your back…is…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She suddenly covered her face with her hands and started to weakly shake from side to side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt a very tingling sensation when I saw her like that.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to remove her hands and see her blushing and embarrassed face, even if it’s for a few seconds.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought about it…but I can’t afford to push her any further.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;It was also my first day, I have to do what I was should.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Mea-san”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke all my sincerity I could muster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You can go at your own pace. There is no need for you to force yourself”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke in a low voice but had a firm expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kuya-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face turns redder as her blush intensifies, but she relaxes her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, she stared at me with moist eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“a-a…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her words and the expression on her face started making me feel hot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She then wipes her eyes and looks the other way again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, too, looked away. What can I do…I was too embarrassed?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(It’s good that Mea is relieved now…As I expected, it was the right choice to say it)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">-I also knew it myself, that I had never done anything like this, so I had to be more mature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Forcing ourselves like this isn’t a good idea…So I told her that she should not overdo it, but take it easy and go at her own pace.</span></p><div class="zetro-9be01bf3600c9ab820198b84e8043b14 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9be01bf3600c9ab820198b84e8043b14"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should’ve done that too…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep acting like someone you’re not, trying to look good, you’ll end up spouting really cliche stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I just said what I did. There is no need for me to push myself either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was in my thoughts, when,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Kuya-san is such a person…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea murmured while talking to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As if pondering on it, she looked quite moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuya- “…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, if that’s how you think of it…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’LL HAVE TO KEEP MY ACT GOING!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Umm…I’ll go have a bath.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea wiped her hair and went to the dressing room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, we took turns to take a bath. We came back to the living room after we took a bath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just lazily cooling off in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahhh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My voice leaked out involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea looked way too alluring with her wet hair and not only that, but she was also dressed in cute pajamas</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahh…that…I bought the least luggage I could from home…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She blushed and turned her face away when she notices my gaze while hugging her body close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that she mentioned it, I saw only one carry bag in the corner of the room. She had said, “I was just told to come here and prepare for my future”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If my dad takes care of the…No, he didn’t tell me anything beforehand means that he wanted me to do everything without him. After all, it was my dad who gave me the assignment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was thinking that when,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry…being alone is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea shrank in more and lowered her eyelashes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah…no, no, don’t worry”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I waved my hand in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really didn’t mind it, if I were to be honest, I was honestly thankful! I guess the phrase “seeing a girl of the same age after taking a bath is bliss” can be used.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Girls look so defenseless when they come out after taking a bath)</span></p>


<img src="https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/embed0011_HD.jpg?resize=721%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But of course, I can’t show I feel that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…So, do you always sleep in such a cute outfit?”</span></p><div class="zetro-a6cab2f3d45958c7cb87f112064432f0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a6cab2f3d45958c7cb87f112064432f0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no choice but to say something so embarrassing taking a casual pose.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea, Please be embarrassed too! Then I won’t be the only one embarrassed.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was thinking about that,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Umm…it’s a secret”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea replied while turning her face away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt as if the prank I was pulling suddenly failed. But if I stay silent after this, I’ll only end up embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Out of the corner of my eyes, I saw something black cross my sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A creature…that was not supposed to be here in a brand new apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“huh? Cockroach?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was surprised. To be honest, I’m not good with insects. I almost jumped back on reflex but was able to endure somehow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That was because I right in front of her. I’m been acting like I’m really cool and I get afraid of a cockroach, everything will be over!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“huh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I didn’t just let out a stupid voice unintentionally because she screamed like she was ripping silk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the same time she screamed, she took out something shiny from her pajamas. And…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THWACK!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the cockroach flew at the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">SMACK!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kuya- “…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Quick! Clean it up! Please!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhh…I…Y-yes”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was so dumbfounded at what just happened that I didn’t even have time to say I wasn’t good with bugs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I grabbed some toilet paper from the washroom in a hurry and went to the cockroach on the wall…and saw a flat piece of metal. I picked up a cross-like, pointed, flat piece of metal. Yes, it was a shuriken, and I put it through the paper making a turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I then threw the cockroach in the toilet and heard a gurgle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While all this, Mea kept her eyes closed, slightly trembling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it gone? It’s gone, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, I’m pretty sure it’s way down in the sewer now”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Haaa…good…”</span></p><div class="zetro-9664e1c5910e318f64039ee11ae6c03e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9664e1c5910e318f64039ee11ae6c03e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apparently, even she is not good with insects. But, she’s even worse with them than I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…you know, Mea-san”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“W-what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you, like…no, by any chance…are you…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I just couldn’t help but ask as I help up a shuriken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I can’t just believe you’re carrying something like this and throwing it so quickly…Mea-san, are you a ninja by any chance?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hehhhhhhh…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wack! Mea stiffened her back as she jumped up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…a few minutes later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“” …””</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no clue how many times we had to sit on the floor and face each other like this today…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this is just the way it had to be like. There was too much going on today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for my question earlier, she remained silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess it’s hard to answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If that’s the case, I feel bad forcing her, but still…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I turned towards the shuriken on the table (which, by the way, I had wiped carefully with wet wipes).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t just flush this down the drain like I did with the cockroach and pretend I didn’t see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Umm…that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, Mea opened her mouth to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her face was turned away from me, but her eyes kept glancing at my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She noticed that I was looking at a shuriken. I couldn’t but think of arrows and shields.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…yes?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“umm… I…I pulled it out?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I rolled my eyes</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8211;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that is what I’m asking about</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t care how scared you are, but you can’t just use…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-no…that’s not it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no choice but to return it back to her.</span></p><div class="zetro-803393587c927cb59787627634d434c1 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-803393587c927cb59787627634d434c1"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, Mea was now ready to talk. I don’t want to push her any further and stop her from talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I won’t take it…but I’m still curious. It’s obviously not normal for a girl to suddenly pull out a shuriken and throw it so precisely.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhh…yes, I know…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea groaned and her body shrunk more and more.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I chose the wrong choice of words!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nono, what I am trying to say is that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes…”</span></p>
