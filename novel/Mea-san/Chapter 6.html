<h3>Chapter 6 - Mea-san, By any chance...</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day after the entrance ceremony was a weekend vacation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Classes were supposed to start on Monday after the weekend, so it was just a preparation period for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But to be honest, I didn&#8217;t really care about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mea-san. I&#8217;m going to ask you again, about what happened yesterday…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, a secret you say&#8230; but is it a secret even from me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.Yeeah. It&#8217;s been a whole day already, and it&#8217;s Saturday afternoon…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san has been acting like this since yesterday and she&#8217;s just not getting anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how many times I ask her, all she says is, &#8220;It&#8217;s a secret.&#8221; She keeps her lips tightly pressed together and turns away with a pout&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I feel like I need to do something about this today. Thanks to her, I was surrounded by my classmates for a long time yesterday, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">as if I was being greeted by my mother-in-laws to be, that was how it felt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure what to do… To be honest, this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever had to deal with such a type of Mea-san, so I&#8217;m not sure how to handle it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn&#8217;t mean I can back down! This is, yes, a problem between the two of us!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to ask her again when I was suddenly cut off.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*PinPoon♪*</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The doorbell suddenly rang. I was taken aback.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Did anyone plan on coming?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh yeah&#8230; I wonder if my dad sent me an extra package.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I&#8217;ll have to prepare a personal seal other than my bank seal for such an occasion. For the two of us, &#8220;Nonomiya&#8221; and &#8220;Chitose&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking about it, I opened the door. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I guess I&#8217;ll just sign for today──</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Boom!*</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good Afternoon~~~~~~!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Ehhh?! Renjuyou-san!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the door, there was a little girl with the same brightly colored hair in twin tails with ribbons wrapped around her hair as yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected from this unexpected visitor, Mea-san couldn&#8217;t keep quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-what happened, Kobato-san…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Mea-san ran up to her,  Renjuyou-san was sweetly smiling and nodding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, I got the address from your mom, Me-chan!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p><div class="zetro-f88ba2d2b9c3302658e93adf5b792b41 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f88ba2d2b9c3302658e93adf5b792b41"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyways, please excuuuse my intrusion~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, wai…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She came closer to me without waiting for my answer. In her hands, she was carrying a grocery bag that seemed to contain food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ku-kun, can I borrow your refrigerator?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she tilted her head adorably at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;B-By &#8216;Ku-kun&#8217;, you mean, by any chance? Me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes~~. Kuuya-kun to Ku-kun!! …It’s okay right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, I don&#8217;t mind, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eheheh~. Thanksss~. Well then, ♪refrigerator♪, ♪refrigerator~♪”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean… What is she doing and what happened to her? She&#8217;s a completely different person than she was yesterday!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my memory serves me right, yesterday she was hiding behind Mea-san as soon as we met. It was like she was a shy girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But today, she&#8217;s very friendly&#8230; even to me. And then there&#8217;s this sudden visit. What kind of a change of heart did she have&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you doing, Kobato-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That seemed to have bothered Mea-san as well. She rushed over to ask about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, while transferring the contents from the grocery bag in her hand to the refrigerator, she turned to me and said-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard you two are living together, but it must be tough right!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said with a grin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Also, you&#8217;re both fiances and married, so as a newlywed you guys are living together.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san&#8217;s mom seems to have revealed a lot of things to this kid&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it seems that Mea-san&#8217;s &#8220;He’s my husband!&#8221; remark at the entrance ceremony revealed to the whole school that she is also living with me&#8230; There is no point in hiding it anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-it&#8217;s not a big deal is it?” Mea-san brushed her hair away and stuck her chest out. But…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? But you&#8217;ve never cooked before, have you, Me-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugyuu…!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was silenced with a single shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to chase down a fleeing enemy (Mea-san), Renjuyou-san leaped on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me</span><span style="font-weight: 400">! About the plan to live together, I think, if we don&#8217;t be true to ourselves then it is a bad thought altogether.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tr-True? As in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Mea-san fell silent, I had no choice but to interject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Renjuyou-san shrank her body a little, looked up at me, and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Ku-kun is the husband right?”</span></p><div class="zetro-c3b6475b745ea80612677eb78adda563 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c3b6475b745ea80612677eb78adda563"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Ye-yes….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she looked at me and called me &#8220;Husband.&#8221; I would like her to understand that I can&#8217;t help but feel a little nervous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, because! I can&#8217;t believe that the girl who was acting so shy yesterday is being so aggressive today… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">for real?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I can&#8217;t believe she&#8217;s talking to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, her appearance is young and cute, so the destructive power of her upward glance is, how can I put it, amazing. Mea-san&#8217;s upward glance is also quite exciting, but in Renjuyou-san&#8217;s case, the childishness is more pronounced, and it makes me feel like I can&#8217;t leave her alone as a man..!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not caring about the fact that I was going through such a sea of emotions, she continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The wife has to make dinner for the husband. You&#8217;re a newlywed couple. Me-chan may not be good at it, that&#8217;s why… I can make it for him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tha— That’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, how should I put it? Is it a declaration that I can make a better </span><b>‘wife’ </b><span style="font-weight: 400">than you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, does this mean that she has come to sell a fight to Mea-san? Haven&#8217;t these two been best friends since elementary school? I mean, even if they weren’t, aren&#8217;t they being too aggressive just today?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so scared of the girl and her aggressiveness that I just couldn&#8217;t take it anymore. No, I&#8217;ve never been shown anything like this before! I&#8217;ve never been this close to any girl before!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(No, there is Fuuga, but she is mostly a male friend!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to cook lunch today and show you how it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tone of her voice was smiling and friendly&#8230; But is it weird for me to feel a pressure that makes it hard to refuse?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, yeah. Let&#8217;s try to be calm here. That&#8217;s what a cool, mature man should do.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ehh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">… Renjuyou-san took the trouble to prepare the ingredients at her own expense and came to cook for us. She also said, &#8220;Living together, it must be tough.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the fact is, we&#8217;re in need of food. Mea-san&#8217;s cooking skills are exactly as she said, and I&#8217;ve never cooked well because I&#8217;ve always relied on my mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If someone is willing to set a good example there, wouldn&#8217;t that be very gratifying?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought about… I had no reason to refuse.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I don&#8217;t want to decline, but… is that okay? </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a feeling like that. Because…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a while now, Mea-san has been biting her lip in frustration as she kept pulling at the hem of my clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… Umm&#8230; Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Kuuya-san… What should we do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is she asking me!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Will you accept or decline…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s… nice of her to set an example, isn&#8217;t it? For us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to answer, emphasizing the &#8220;us&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">God please, let her understand the subtleties of my mind that emphasized this point!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──────!!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">UWAAA! I guess it didn&#8217;t get through!</span></p><div class="zetro-9b9f44b28b91d2d13ad783da28605144 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9b9f44b28b91d2d13ad783da28605144"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as she heard my answer, her eyes widened and she staggered as if she was in shock (of course she let go of the hem of my clothes).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whaa… Ehhh? Wh-what happened, Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It-it’s… a&#8230; secret…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here it is again!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm, I was thinking… that it would be subtly troubling if Mea-san were to bring that up, because we wouldn&#8217;t be able to proceed from there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But &#8230;if that&#8217;s the case!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I&#8217;ll cook for you too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;EEEEHHHHHHHHH??!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t expect her to say that!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, didn&#8217;t you make a big mistake this morning, too, Mea-san?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s fine isn&#8217;t it, Koboto-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha… Mou~ you&#8217;re so stubborn, you know that Me-chan?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even when Mea-san pointed a finger at her, I noticed that she was smiling and laughing a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, just follow my lead, and good luck.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ll see…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, that’s good&#8230; Or rather, if that&#8217;s the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, I might as well participate in making it for the sake of our future──&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But before I can say that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ &#8220;Watch me, Kuuya-san/Ku-kun!&#8221; ”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both declared in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The power of the two girls, or rather their motivation, was such that I could only respond, &#8220;Oh, yes&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so they began cooking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll make stewed hamburger steak for lunch today~~! I&#8217;m making it because it&#8217;s a dish that&#8217;s hard to mess up~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she put on the apron she brought with her, Renjuyou-san, with a bright smile, exclaimed to me. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, is that so? It sounds kind of difficult just by its name&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There are only a few steps to making a hamburger steak. All you have to do is simmer it with the sauce, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about it being raw or overcooked. Those are the two main reasons why many fail to make hamburgers steak.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I see… Makes sense…!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you learn how to cook it, you can change and use the recipe in many ways. You can cook the hamburger steak without stewing it, and the stewing sauce can be made into curry or stew by changing the seasoning at the end.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ohhh, that&#8217;s so convenient! It will increase my repertoire in one swoop!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like this, she was also very generous in showing us samples and giving us some tips to help us with our meal in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am very thankful. She was exactly like an angel helping from heaven.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And also… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ehehe~</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Ku-kun likes hamburger steak, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, well… Is there any guy who doesn&#8217;t like hamburger steak?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered while scratching my bangs up. In fact, my dad likes hamburgers too, so it should be no surprise that a grown man like me likes them too. It&#8217;s a meat dish if I am not wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">~~~Ku-kun, you&#8217;re so cute and adorable&#8230;♪♪&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing, it’s nothing. Then, let&#8217;s start with chopping the onion&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*ChopChopChopChopChopChopChop*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> She used the knife so quickly that it seemed like a mirage, and in no time at all, the onions were cut into slices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So Cooool!! But it&#8217;s totally impossible for me to do it like you!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nowadays, there are machines that can chop vegetables and they also come at a reasonable price, so I think it&#8217;s a good idea to use them for the first time. But if you can chop onions in various ways, you will be able to chop other vegetables quite easily, so I personally recommend you to practice~~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I see&#8230;&#8230;! Renjuyou-san, you’re so amazing&#8230;! So, what&#8217;s next? What&#8217;s next?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so engrossed in her skill that I couldn&#8217;t stop looking at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Heh heh heh~, next is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, Renjuyou-san seems to be happy to see me like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smile on her face is simply just adorable, and I couldn’t help but smile along with her──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute, please.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then a calm voice came from the side. Ofcourse it was Mea-san&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think I&#8217;m pretty good at chopping onions too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She brushed her hair off her shoulders and declared with a serious face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ehh, is that so? But Me-chan, you were in charge of making curry at the camp in elementary school, and you know at that time&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At that time I wasn&#8217;t in charge of cutting onions. But now—”</span></p><div class="zetro-f4ef851c908639869d4acf785641bf5f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f4ef851c908639869d4acf785641bf5f"></div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*CHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOPCHOP!!!*</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohh Myy Lord!!!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hwaa──!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both My and Renjuyou-san&#8217;s voices skyrocketed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, well because&#8230; The way Mea-san cuts is so different from the way Renjuyou-san showed us earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if cutting the sky with a knife at the ready &#8211; let&#8217;s say, like she opened the 5th gate  &#8211; she repeatedly sliced through it, and all at once, the onion was chopped into pieces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is no ordinary technique, no normal person can master it! Not in the same sense of what I said to Renjuyou-san, but this is DEFINITELY impossible for me to do! This technique!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha-Wh-wh-wh-What was that?! Me-chan!? How did you cut the onions like that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cause I’m a Ni… It’s a secret.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──I see, I didn&#8217;t know because I hadn&#8217;t seen her using a knife until now&#8230; Mea-san seems to be good at handling knives because she&#8217;s a ninja princess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has been throwing shurikens for years… And that seems to be a secret even from her best friend, Renjuyou-san.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“How- How was it? Do you like it, Kuuya-san?”</span></p>

</span><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Mea-san asked me that while clenching her fist (a little scary because she was holding a knife in one hand).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, well, that was really amazing… That&#8217;s how amazing Mea-san really is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, yes~! Fufufufufu~~ Fufufufufuf~~~, I did it, Kuuya-san praised me&#8230;♪</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did my best to keep my composure and praise her, but she turned red and broke into a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Damn, Mea-san is really cute and adorable after all! Renjuyou-san&#8217;s cuteness is straightforward and juvenile, but Mea-san&#8217;s cuteness comes from the gap between her normal mature personality and this present cuteness!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is Mea-san one step ahead with this? No, is this a game in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-Hmm, but the actual cooking is about to begin! Next, I&#8217;ll knead the meat!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, that’s how I like it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is true that chopping onions does not make a stewed hamburger, and they are still far from making a stewed hamburger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next step for both of them is to knead the meat, mix in the bread flour and other ingredients, and form it into a hamburger&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, like this! The key is to make a hole in the middle!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjuyou-san finished cooking first and placed the hamburger steak on the tray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow, beautiful!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said it unintentionally. The hamburger steak looked very delicious and had a beautiful shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ehehehehe~~~, beautiful? Am I beautiful? Oh my god, Ku-kun~, you flatter me～♪&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wa-wait! The hamburger steak! I meant the hamburger steak!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">AHH! The way she happily smiles and shakes her body like that!! AHH so cute! That gesture!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a sense of guilt when I thought about it, and I turned my head towards Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… like… Like this… Ahhh nope. Nononono… Oooh again… ahhh… hmm…”</span></p><div class="zetro-47e28d0d29beac9b05519aad028a8333 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-47e28d0d29beac9b05519aad028a8333"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she was trying to flatten the meat by throwing them back and forth between her left and right palms, imitating the procedure of her opponent, Renjuyou-san… Perhaps the force was too strong, but Instead of flattening out, the meat was scattered and sent flying. Every time she did this, she had to re-gather the scattered meat, so to tell  the truth, I don&#8217;t feel like she&#8217;ll be able to finish it at all&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Ku-Kuuya-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even more so when she noticed my gaze and froze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but Mea is embarrassed to present it&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, wait, wait! It&#8217;s not good to cover your face with your hands when you are cooking!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then what should I do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;First, I think you should be a little more gentle with the meat, Mea-san&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Kuuya-san, you&#8217;re so kind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t say something like that, it&#8217;s embarrassing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll try my best! Watch me, Kuuya-san!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, it appeared that she was on the verge of giving up… Well, her tone of voice also sounds panicked…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, there were many twists and turns, but I&#8217;ll spare the details&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, My dish is ready~♪!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I… I am done. Wahhh&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two contrasting voices rose, and the dishes were prepared(?).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The three of us immediately took them to the living room table. Incidentally, they had each made one for themselves and one for me. That meant I had to eat both of them, but there was nothing I could do about that. There was no way I could refuse in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thankfully, Renjiyou-san was cooking the rice at the same time as she was progressing. If this were a game, I would have felt that the winner had been decided at this stage, but it seemed that this would not be enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then Ku-kun~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bon appét*t, kuuya-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Yeah. I&#8217;’l have to compare both the dishes prepared by them…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to pick up a spoon and then──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, say Ahh~♪”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Eh?!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a silly voice when she presented me with a spoon filled with hamburger and sauce, which I scooped up first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it&#8217;s not that I didn&#8217;t understand what she meant. I mean, I have to eat it right. But…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Re-Renjiyou-san, that might be a little wrong….”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the kind of thing that loving lovers or newlyweds would do, no matter how you look at it!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but shout in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But, Ku-kun and Me-chan, you&#8217;re only married out of formality, right?&#8221; Renjiyou-san stared at me while holding out the spoon and said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And it&#8217;s not about the two of you, it&#8217;s just about your parents deciding to marry you off, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s true, but&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And on top of that, you guys are not old enough to get married yet, right? So you don&#8217;t know what will happen from now on, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? W-well, yes, we don&#8217;t know that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">yet.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.. but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that you understand that, say Ahh♪”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m being approached by her, apparently! And if Mea-san&#8217;s position isn&#8217;t solid, she can take her place right away, right? What!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, this girl&#8217;s reaction to our first meeting yesterday was </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I fell in love with you at first sight&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8230;Something like this, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If I’m not wrong&#8230;.?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart was pounding like, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Boom Boom Bang…</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Of course, this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever been smitten by a girl or approached like that. I&#8217;d be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t happy. I&#8217;d be lying if I said I wasn&#8217;t thrilled.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">But… is this… okay?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because, how can I explain? Looking towards Mea-san…</span></p><div class="zetro-2aa40416e7d82d04ac50a30c8faf93cc zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-2aa40416e7d82d04ac50a30c8faf93cc"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">~~~~~”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, Uhmm, Mea-san…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that Mea-san was glaring at me with her beautiful eyes, then she quickly brushed her hair off her shoulders and grabbed the spoon vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Say, Ahhー! Kuuya-san!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, Mea-san, you are coming at me too? You&#8217;re not going to let me go!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a thorough fighting strategy&#8230;! And if this continues&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-kun. Have mine first, say Ahhー!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuya-san… Please, it’s a request, Have mine… Say Ahhー!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Of Them Must Be Eaten!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s impossible to eat only one of them, but it&#8217;s also unacceptable to refuse to eat both of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So the question is which one to eat first…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The-Then.. I’ll have… Mea-san’s first…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s only natural that I should give priority to my wife, Mea-san, even if we are married because of a promise. I&#8217;m a little sorry for Renjiyou-san, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-thank you for the foood.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a bold bite of the spoon that Mea-san was holding out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you think&#8230; Kuuya-san&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Munching.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">..  It’s good, just like how you usually cook, Mea-san!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah&#8230; the hamburger-steak is cooked properly, and the demi-glace sauce is just how it should be…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the hamburger was a bit soggy and there were some flour lumps mixed in with the sauce. But it&#8217;s still edible! Considering what Mea-san had been making, it was a huge improvement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really good! You did great, Mea-san!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eheh, Ehehe~ Mea did great…! Fufufu~~ Fufufufufu~~&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it was because she was so happy, but she called herself &#8216;Mea&#8217; again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s really easy to understand this, even though she has a lot of secrets&#8230; That&#8217;s the cute and adorable thing about Mea-san. And more importantly, the part where her face is red and her body is twisting around. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks s**y while smiling and chuckling</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, I can&#8217;t stand it. I want to see more! SHOW ME MORE!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would have been great if that had been the end of it, but──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Now, I&#8217;m next!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t just eat Mea-sans cooking and not eat Renjiyou-san’s, can I? Huh&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I don&#8217;t know, I wonder if Ku-kun will like it. &#8230;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ba-dum Ba-dum</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And over there, she is putting more pressure on me (my subjective view). So, as a man, I can&#8217;t neglect this or it&#8217;ll be… bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-Thank you for the food. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Bites*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span></p><div class="zetro-9dc62c4fe7f253e5c2cac6c02c3896cf zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9dc62c4fe7f253e5c2cac6c02c3896cf"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took another bite, this time from the spoon that Renjiyou-san had kept offering me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tell me tell me, how is it? Ku-kun~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“*</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Munching*… !?!?!?” ──I couldn&#8217;t help but groan. It was so different</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The taste and aroma spread as soon as I put it in my mouth. Just by taking a bite of the hamburger steak, I could feel the pleasant crunch and the overflowing juicy goodness&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-so Delicious….!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be frank, I&#8217;m sorry to say this, but it was far better than Mea-san&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to add to the deliciousness of the food, Renjiyou-san smiled, like she was bursting with joy when she heard my impressions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was frankly adorable, and I felt deeply moved that such a girl had made me such a marvellous and tasty dish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking about it, Renjiyou-san&#8217;s aura suddenly became very calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If Ku-kun liked it so much… I&#8217;ll make as many as Ku-kun wants from now on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If Me-chan is your Wife… then&#8230; I&#8217;ll be your &#8216;commuting wife&#8217;&#8230; I guess, Heheheheh~~&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Re-Renjiyou-san…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─That heartly and cheerful word made me shake in terror.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She had always been very aggressive, but when she suddenly developed such a calm atmosphere, I was really surprised… I couldn&#8217;t help but notice the difference </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that&#8217;s really scaring me</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll also fulfil that gap, okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyou-san’s expression suddenly changed, and she smiled with her usual bright and cheerful smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you have any problems with cooking, I&#8217;ll be happy to come back and give you advice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, okay, thanks…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehe~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">─ Such a weird exchange between us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Nom* *Nom* *Nom*, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">delicious, even though she was my opponent, I can’t help but praise it, delicious….! </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Nom* *Nom* *Nom*”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san was glaring at Renjiyou-san while munching on Renjiyou-san’s hamburger steak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That night, I cooked dinner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This homemade recipe book that Renjiyou-san left for me is amazing. Even someone like me was able to quickly cook a meal that looked exactly like in the picture because it was so well explained.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I flipped through the pages, I was impressed once again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. After that, Renjiyou-san left this recipe book and went home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can’t say if they were perfect, or if it was the book that still needed some improvement… Anyway, the conclusion is that I was able to make a meal out of it…</span></p><div class="zetro-0d66d2b8c2b8a32d9e405b7c7f882119 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0d66d2b8c2b8a32d9e405b7c7f882119"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there was a reason why I cooked my first meal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Renjiyou-san, she’s amazing, right… in many ways.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Has she always been like that? Mea-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;” ──And since noon, Mea-san has not been talking to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can only guess that she&#8217;s curled up from her navel because I gave a better reaction towards Renjiyou-san&#8217;s hamburger steak than I did to Mea-san’s&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that still doesn’t change the fact that I don’t know how to react with delicacy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-anyway, let&#8217;s eat, Mea-san. I think I did a pretty good job.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Thank you for the food.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, when she eats, she puts her hands together properly and says ‘thank you for the food’, which is what Mea-san usually does in front of me&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But… after that…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“*</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nom* *Nom* &#8230;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">wow, the meat and potatoes are full of flavour!</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m glad the rice wasn&#8217;t overcooked, really.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Cooking rice is very easy you know, I think I&#8217;ll be in charge for it from now on~~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter what I said, Mea-san continued to stay silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Am I supposed to apologize for this? It was a bad move from my side, saying Renjiyou-san’s hamburger steak is better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I&#8217;m really sorry, but it&#8217;s true that Renjiyou-san’s one was more delicious&#8230; Mea-san probably knows the difference between their current skills…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmmm… what am I supposed to do now&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;.Is that not the only thing that Mea-san is sulking about, by any chance&#8230;?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly had a feeling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Which is it then? I didn&#8217;t understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, that night.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;..Mmm?)</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was asleep when I noticed something and suddenly came to my senses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn… Uhmma… </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Getting Up*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san, is she trying to go over me&#8230;.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why…? Ahh yeah, she can&#8217;t get out of bed without doing that, whether it&#8217;s to drink water or go to the bathroom&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought, half-asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Mea-san went over me and got off the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sound of footsteps moving away, and then the sound of a door opening and closing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a while, I heard the sound of running water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san, she had to go to the toilet&#8230;? I feel sorry now, because of me, she couldn&#8217;t easily get up…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking about it, the door opened again and I noticed Mea-san coming in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She washed her hands in the kitchen and came back to the bed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wh-what should I do? If I don&#8217;t do anything now, she has to get over me again to get in, right? Should I pretend to turn over and casually leave the left side open for her&#8230;.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was thinking about that—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Kuwuya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stood right next to the bed and mumbled to herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was wondering about that—-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;&#8211;</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*NshyoO*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to scream、 but I barely managed to hold it back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is because Mea-san suddenly pushed me and rolled me over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was wondering if it was too much trouble to get over, or something….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Eii.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Leaning back.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(!?!?!?!?!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost screamed again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because, Mea-san. Not only did she sneak into bed with me, but—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuwuya….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was because she hugged me like I was a pillow or something.</span></p><div class="zetro-ebf3d155cacd2afc5caa2bbc7f1264be zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-ebf3d155cacd2afc5caa2bbc7f1264be"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a full body hug. Not only her hands, but also her legs were wrapped around me, and we were literally in a… tight embrace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, my drowsiness was gone. I mean, it&#8217;s so warm and soft!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the… N-no, it’s not that I wanted to notice it or anything! I&#8217;m being crushed by both Mea-san’s b***s and her body, but is this okay&#8230;!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyways… Why is this happening──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Su─ Su─”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, I heard Mea-san’s breathing sound, she apparently has finally fallen asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she may have simply been too lazy to get over me, and just moved me out of the way to make room for her to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even if that was the only reason, she wouldn&#8217;t have hugged me like this…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-mea-san…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked over my shoulder to see what was going on, as I felt my whole body stiffen up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmfuuu… Kuwuya is… Mea’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s sleep-talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. I see, It was like the last time she said, ‘This person is mine’ and then she hugged me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she was really, really angry during the day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That, too, was probably towards herself. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t cook, and I can&#8217;t make anything as good as Renjiyou-san.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But&#8230; I guess that&#8217;s why she felt so bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. She believes, &#8220;Kuuya-san </span><b><i>is</i></b> <b><i>my </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400">husband.&#8221;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s all in my imagination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn&#8217;t help feeling that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nfuu… Su— Su—&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~~~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t bear to shake Mea-san off. As a result, my whole body tensed up, and I  continued to endure the softness and warmth of her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Because if I think… about it&#8230; it&#8217;s my fault too&#8230; definitely&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I hadn&#8217;t been overpowered by Renjiyou-san and had taken a firm stand, Mea-san might not have slept like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought about it, I had no choice but to endure&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That day, I couldn&#8217;t sleep until morning was near.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the next morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AAAAAAA! Mea is, Mea is really really sorry abut what Mea did, I’m sorry Kuuya-san!! It’s a misunderstanding, y-yes misunderstanding. AAA Mou!! I can’t be a wife anymore….!!”</span></p><div class="zetro-5b2a6ba1b848b02b6e9ebb239137c3f9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5b2a6ba1b848b02b6e9ebb239137c3f9"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, when she woke up, she was so embarrassed that she couldn&#8217;t control herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved to know that after spending the night like this, she would start talking to me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu UUUuuuu ~~~!!! Me-Mea also pressed her chest on you… Now Kuuya-san has found out all about me, what should Mea do! Mea is going to die of embarrassment&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I thought again as I stared at Mea-san, who was already red up to her ears and squirming in agony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230;&#8230;I need to take a firm stand.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuya-san is mature and may not care about it, but for… Mea, this is a serious matter! Because&#8230; Because&#8230; Mea has never pressed her b*****s against a man before! This is the first time… I&#8217;ve done this, I&#8217;m so embarrassed, Mea is going to die, I have no choice but to have Kuuya-san give it back to me.”</span>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">—Yeah. If Mea thinks I&#8217;m mature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, once again.</span></p>
