<h3>Chapter 7 - Why did you do that, Mea-san?</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s been a while since Mea-san and I entered junior high school.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s them, right? The newlyweds&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;They&#8217;re already living together&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ugh, Why is he with such a cute little girl… I can&#8217;t stand that puny little guy&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever Mea-san and I come to school together, we hear whispers from the students (mainly the seniors) who notice us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems that we&#8217;ve already become the favourite topic of the school. And then…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A-A very good morning, Nonomiya-kun and Chitose-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I entered the elevator, I was approached by my homeroom teacher, Ito-sensei. Apparently, he was waiting for us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A very good morning to you too, sir&#8230; Anything wrong, sir?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;N-Nothing, I see that you two are coming to school together again today.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;We come to school from the same room, so there&#8217;s no need to shift the time&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;And above all, we are a married couple.&#8221; Meia replied to his question with a bit of pride.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, Ito-sensei&#8217;s cheeks flushed and he panicked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Y-Yeah… Yeah. Sensei, you know that too, don’t you? It&#8217;s been reported to the school, and it&#8217;s been somehow approved….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I heard that area was an issue at one point after the paperwork was submitted…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After that, my father and Mea-san&#8217;s father came in person and made the school accept our situation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;As expected of a member of secret intelligence and the head of ninjas&#8230; I wonder if they talked about their jobs around here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, like that, we became well known in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;But, but, such a thing, a young man and woman living together under the same roof, even a teacher… has never done that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But from time to time, this is how Ito-sensei talks to us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A-Anyway! Even if you both are newlyweds on paper, you are still unmarried! So, uh, I mean, well… Please make sure there re no mistakes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;And this is how it usually goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What do you mean by mistake? Ito-sensei.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ee!! Th-th-that’s… Se–&#8230; you know… Se—&#8230; Sensei can&#8217;t tell you this because it would be frankly ridiculous for me to say it out loud!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I get it.” “I don’t get it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AAhhh!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, he&#8217;s stuck in a dilemma every time he can&#8217;t answer such a frank and innocent question from Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just when I thought it was all under control, I noticed that Ito-sensei was a little different today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;A-And! I overheard something recently&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, yes, what is it, sir?”</span></p><div class="zetro-e69589a393ec95f0ccad3d8abe6e3e0f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e69589a393ec95f0ccad3d8abe6e3e0f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Nonomiya-kun! I heard that you&#8217;re being approached by other girls while you have this girl, namely Chitose-san!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t look over that. It&#8217;s impure! At this age, two-timing is not a good idea&#8230; and I have never experienced such a thing either&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You are an earnest person, sir.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“T-That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a teacher! Hahaha&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ito-sensei responded to Mea-san&#8217;s comment with a feeling of being irritated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">…I guess she is right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About that, I also felt a little lost──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, when we arrived at the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahh~! Ku-kun! Morning~~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing that comes to my mind is why Renjiyou-san running up to me with a big smile on her face, as if she&#8217;s going to jump on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“M-Morning… Renjiyou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Mou~~, I have told you~ Stop calling like you are calling a stranger, haven&#8217;t I told you~~? Mou~~. It&#8217;s Kobato~ Ko-Ba-To♪&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Morning Kobato-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahaha, Me-chan Morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhmm… anything wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Renjiyou-san comes running up to me like this with a big smile on her face, it&#8217;s usually when something is going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve learned a lot about that in the past few weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes… You knowー Today, you knowー, I baked cookies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure enough, as she said this, Renjiyou-san happily showed me the package she was holding behind her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ku-kun said he wanted to eat it , so I made them for you&#8230;.?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">──I wonder when that happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This was the &#8220;approach from other girls&#8221; that Ito-senei had pointed out earlier, and this had also become a rumour throughout the school, just like the fact that I and Mea-san were newlyweds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I&#8217;ve heard that I&#8217;m secretly called &#8220;The tiny gigolo of the first year&#8221; by my seniors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;I&#8217;ll refrain from commenting on that. No matter what they say, it&#8217;s just a name. It&#8217;s not like a mature guy to get pissed off and say something back. Anyway,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahh.. y-yeah.. Thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have no choice but to accept it. I can&#8217;t just say &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t need it&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hohou, by all means.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We are also looking forward to sharing our meal!!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Fuga and Sumitarou joined in. This is usually the case, too.</span></p><div class="zetro-582193813f10e64a414e4ba52a761df3 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-582193813f10e64a414e4ba52a761df3"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You&#8217;re really good at baking, aren&#8217;t you Kotato-san? The soufflé you made the other day was excellent. It would be great if we could have a taste of your cookies too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Please! Leftovers, give me some leftovers~~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahahaha… Mou~ I guess it can’t be helped then. Join in, Fu-chan, you too, Sumitaro. But~! First is Ku-kun’s turn ♪~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a relentless disparity society!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Indeed it isー Now now, Ku-kun, say Ahh~~~♪♪”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah… no… you don’t need to─”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hurriedly waved my hand. The very first time, when she made me lunch, I had to eat it&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I respond to this action of her with all eyes on me in this class&#8230; I understand that it is really bad. I understand but─!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t say that~~ It’s okay, Ku-kun, say Ahh~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kuu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, She’s very pushy, Renjiyou-san&#8230;.!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s more, she&#8217;s still a &#8220;little child&#8221; whose appearance still leaves a strong childish and cute impression, so I&#8217;m really in trouble because I can&#8217;t just push her away!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;No, I’m glad that she often makes these things for my sake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because I&#8217;ve never had anything like this before. &#8230;.Ahh, this is what it means to have feelings for a girl… I feel so grown up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, Ku-kun. Say ahh~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-no.. I mean you know… that’s very bothersome, I was saying!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. But that&#8217;s not the same thing as I was saying previously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Besides, if I don&#8217;t stop this, I&#8217;m going to──</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">*Jerk!*</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Uwaa?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was almost knocked off balance by a sudden tug on my sleeve, even though I had anticipated it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don&#8217;t need to tell who has done that to me now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mu–………………” And it was Mea-san, who was at her limit.</span></p>

<p>“Ahh, hey, Mea-san? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“It’s a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>As usual, the reason is a secret. That is indeed expected.</p>
<p>Mea-san is getting jealous. Or perhaps she simply doesn&#8217;t like the fact that I, the &#8220;Husband&#8221;, am being approached by another girl.</p>
<p>So, instead of stopping or complaining about Renjiyou-san, I feel like she chose to come directly at me, who is the &#8220;Chooser.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, this is what happened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mou–~~, you&#8217;re really shy! Ku-kun~&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hahahaha… Well, let&#8217;s all eat together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scratching up your bangs and trying to cover up your mistake&#8230; But that kind of shyness is also cute and adorable, isn&#8217;t it, Ku-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh&#8230;.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m at your mercy! *bite*&#8230; Yum! It&#8217;s delicious, Kobato-Paisen!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Mou~ Stop with the ‘Paisen’ thing~~ Sumitaro~~”</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re cute and an expert at housework! I respect you, paisen!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Yes, it is indeed delicious…! Sumitaro has a weakness for pretty girls and tasty food, though I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s why he calls you Paisen.”</p>
<p>“Mea-san, let&#8217;s have some.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I guess so. Thank you for the food.”</p>
<p>And in the end, we all ate together.</p>
<p>“Ehehe—”</p>
<p>Even though her plan had failed (?) Renjiyou-san was still smiling and laughing. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;s because she&#8217;s an adult or what, but that must be why Sumitarou wanted to call her &#8220;Paisen&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>But for me, she is what she is.</p>
<p>———————</p>
<p>After the morning classes were over, it was time for lunch.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s main dish was pepper steak. I like this dish a lot because it goes well with rice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hehehe~ The school lunches are delicious too, aren&#8217;t they, Ku-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Our school cafeteria is pretty good&#8230; *Eating*.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I ate while talking with Renjiyou-san, who was in the same group as me, in a good mood, but while being careful so as to not lose my coolness…</p>
<p>“~~~~ ~~~~~ ~~~~~”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What happened, Mea-san?”</p>
<p>I looked over and saw the other group. In the back row group beside the window, Mea-san’s shoulders were shaking.</p>
<p>From where I sit, all I can see is her back, so I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going on…</p><div class="zetro-c176ef99a058d945cdb0375103827f3c zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c176ef99a058d945cdb0375103827f3c"></div>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m going to go get a refill!&#8221;</p>
<p>So Sumitarou, who was in the same group as Mea-san, got up from his seat and headed for a second serving.</p>
<p>Good timing, I left my seat to go get another one, and sat down in Sumitarou&#8217;s seat instead.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Ku-kuuya-san…”</p>
<p>“Mea-san. Anything wrong?”</p>
<p>I asked gently. At the same time, I looked at Mea-san&#8217;s lunch tray and saw that her chopsticks were not touched.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s in bad shape, she&#8217;s been acting as usual since this morning.</p>
<p>But right now, Mea-san is looking at me and the lunch tray as if she&#8217;s troubled.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Mea-san… by any chance…” And that&#8217;s when it hit me.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s menu is &#8216;Pepper Steaks.&#8217; Needless to say, it&#8217;s a stir-fried dish of green pepper and beef.</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t like bell peppers?”</p>
<p>“Um&#8230;”</p>
<p>Apparently, I hit the bull&#8217;s eye.</p>
Well, many girls are not good with bitterness. I&#8217;m trained to drink coffee black, so I have a tolerance for bitterness (I&#8217;m proud of that), but Mea-san still can&#8217;t drink coffee unless it&#8217;s café au lait.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why her chopsticks were not touched, but school lunches are basically meant to be eaten up. Mea-san is a very serious person, so I guess she was conflicted about what to do.</p>
<p>“I-I&#8217;m sorry, Kuuya-san, I&#8217;m a pathetic wife…”</p>
<p>“No… Well in this case──”</p>
I guess there&#8217;s only one thing for me to do.</p>
I quickly returned to my seat and brought my own chopsticks.</p>
<p>“Ahh… Kuuya-san…!”</p>
<p>“I’m good, I’m good… *Eating*&#8230; *Eating**Eating*!”</p>
<p>I ate all the peppers on Mea-san&#8217;s tray in one go and put the tray aside.</p>
Well to tell the truth, I was really thinking of borrowing Mea-san&#8217;s chopsticks to eat…</p>
<p>“Hyu~~ Husbanddd~~”</p>
<p>What can I say, even in this situation the girls around me would give me the cold stare, so indirect kissing is out of the question!</p>
<p>“I-Indeed! So bad!&#8221;</p>
“Indeed! You showed me what you&#8217;re made of, Kuuya!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was praised by Sumitarou, who had just returned.</p>
<p>“I mean, Mea-san, if you&#8217;d have told me, I would have eaten you peppers from the beginning! With my utmost pleasure!&#8221; And now he is talking s**t to Mea-san!</p>
<p>“Why?” But Mea-san’s reply was straight forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Why, you say?&#8230; You don&#8217;t like peppers, so Kuuya had to eat them for you, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it’s a secret, It&#8217;s okay to tell though!.”</p>
<p>Sumitarou seemed to be convinced (that it was useless to ask) and placed another serving on the table.</p>
<p>“Ohh, I’ll be going back then.”</p>
<p>“Hey hey! I’m the one who’s interrupting.”</p>
<p>After thumping his fists together, he returned to a different seat.</p>
<p>“Muu~~” Then, this time, Renjiyou-san was the one pouting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not a picky eater. I&#8217;ll eat anything! *Nom* *Nom* *Nom*&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When she said that at a volume that even Mea-san could hear, she started to eat enthusiastically as if to compete with her.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then it was break time after eating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, uhmm, Kuuya-san….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly, Mea-san walked over to my seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you for earlier…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, it’s nothing to worry about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scratched my bangs up, trying to look as cool as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuya-san…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was all worth it, and Mea-san squealed as if she was deeply moved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, lately, Mia has been showing me satisfactory reactions to my gestures like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I have a lot of room to grow&#8230; Well, that&#8217;s also one of the reasons why I ate the green pepper earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I want to show Mea-san my cool and good points. Or rather&#8230;.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Me-chan is so lucky.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Whoa, you scared me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I suddenly fell back when Renjiyou-san came into the scene out of the blue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-By lucky… What do you mean, Kobato-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san also quickly took a step forward、 asking what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyou-san turned to us and replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That&#8217;s not fair.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said something unexpected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san also seemed surprised by those words and rolled her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean by that… Kobato-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Just now, you got Ku-kun to eat your pepper&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;You also don&#8217;t like bell peppers, Kobato-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s not the point.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did eat her pepper&#8230; but I haven&#8217;t done it earlier though…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;When I met Ku-kun for the first time, you and Me-chan were already on such good terms, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But, I thought something would happen if I did my best, yet… as I thought, a late start is a big deal after all.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-552bf122cb540830db8974d483ae6dda zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-552bf122cb540830db8974d483ae6dda"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Renjiyou-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wondered what it would have been like if I had been Ku-kun&#8217;s fiancee. I just can&#8217;t help thinking about it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, the only difference between Mea-san and Renjiyou-san is only in &#8216;Who I met first&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a little while back, I met Mea-san and now we have been… spending our life together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if it was with Renjiyou-san?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I shouldn&#8217;t be… thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whatever the case may be, I&#8217;m with her now, Mea-san and I──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s exactly as what Kobato-chan just said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that&#8217;s when Fuuga poked her head in, looking even more dashing than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heyy, Fuuga wait, what do you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I mean, It&#8217;s certainly unfair. But that’s something which can’t be helped.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then don&#8217;t say anything you don&#8217;t have to──&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But to begin with&#8230; I&#8217;ve been wondering about that too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? About what──?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuuya and Mea-chan are a married couple that their parents have decided to join together since a long time ago. That&#8217;s why they started living together when they entered junior high school, because that’s how it’s supposed to be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The playful theatrical phrases and gestures were thrown on top of her lines one after another.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in the case of Fuuga, instead of being drawn in, I thought, &#8216;What the h**l are you trying to say?&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if reading my thoughts, Fuuga winked at me in a classy and cool way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But&#8230; In the first place&#8230; isn&#8217;t it too early for Kuuya to be married?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whaaa?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said something I didn&#8217;t expect at all and I reacted in a stupid way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-That&#8217;s not true. After all Kuuya-san is very mature!&#8221; Instead of me, Mea-san replied back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Fuga shrugged her shoulders in a well-behaved gesture and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think so at all! After all Kuuya is basically a tall kid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gu….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Fuuga said that, I couldn&#8217;t help but groan. I am well aware of the difference between myself and this person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But why would this girl even bother to say that now….?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And you know, I think it&#8217;s important to do things in order. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s too early to start a married life? You have to get to know each other, know each other’s feelings, get engaged, get registered, and then finally start&#8230; Isn&#8217;t that the way it should be?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, yes yes, that’s how it should be, right right.”</span></p><div class="zetro-01eb79ff3f966f27cc3a07d7aa9fa630 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-01eb79ff3f966f27cc3a07d7aa9fa630"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga&#8217;s argument was met with agreement by Renjiyou-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Inside my heart, I actually agreed with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My relationship with Mea-san started suddenly and it was totally unexpected. That&#8217;s why we still haven&#8217;t been able to do the things that my dad told us to do as a newlywed couple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is a part of me that doesn&#8217;t know how I should behave. If this had started after I had gone through the proper stages of falling in love, I&#8217;m sure it wouldn&#8217;t have been like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Yeah&#8230; maybe I&#8217;ll grow taller like I do now&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess she could tell from my expression that I was thinking about it. Fuuga smiled, brushed off her bangs, and continued on with a cheerful tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So what I&#8217;m trying to say is! I&#8217;m not sure if Kuuya and Mea-chan really deserve to live the life they&#8217;re living right now…!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s that supposed to mean? Fuuga-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious, Mea-san. It means you need to be determined, is what I mean.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Determined&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you really worthy of Kuuya? Are you really worthy of being his wife?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And fortunately, there&#8217;s one girl here who is determined to have that kind of relationship with Kuuya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, yes yes~~! M E~~. Eheheh~~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And here, there are those who think that Kuuya is still too young for such things in the first place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You mean me right!” And then Sumitarou, who had been quietly listening to the conversation until now, joined in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I mean, it&#8217;s wrong to say that Kuuya is already ready for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> even though I haven&#8217;t done </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> yet!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s&#8230; not just Sumitaro who avoids commenting on it because it&#8217;s a personal thing. To tell you the truth, I think so too. Well, as I said before, you know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;So what&#8217;s your point after all?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the drawbacks of Fuuga&#8217;s talk is that she takes a long time to reach her conclusions. Her theatrical gestures are usually amusing to listen to, and she&#8217;s very good-looking, but when the target is me, it&#8217;s a bit annoying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So in conclusion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if in response to my irritation, Fuuga winked at me again and said</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><b>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a group date!&#8221;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She declared such a thing as if she were singing it out loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;WHAT!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuuya, Mea-chan, and Kobato-chan. Let&#8217;s see what happens after that and find out!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oii… why would we do that…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The reason is as I just explained. If Kuuya and Mea-chan are really a couple worthy of a newlywed life, In a situation like that… even Kobato-chan would consider it, wouldn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, no, no, that&#8217;s not right&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m coming with you. I&#8217;ll be the so-called referee!&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-535ea12561fed31d04f43423ef671f91 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-535ea12561fed31d04f43423ef671f91"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then I guess I&#8217;ll have to do the same! You can count on me, I&#8217;ll be judging you every step of the way!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitarou joined in on Fuuga&#8217;s idea, and the conversation proceeded at a brisk pace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, but wait! The important thing is that me and Mea-san are…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Okay…!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Waaa?? Mea-san?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No matter what happens, I am Kuuya-san&#8217;s good bride and, and I am the one who will live with him. All I have to do is prove it to him!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. That’s how it is.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga nodded to Mea-san, who was enthusiastic, making a fist at chest height.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this, Mea-san brushed her long hair off her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Okay! That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m hoping for&#8230; I&#8217;ll make it very clear!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s settled then. I&#8217;ll see you all next time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Putting her hands on her slender waist, Fuuga nodded again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, wait a minute!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They&#8217;re making it sound like we&#8217;re on the same page, but they’re not listening to what I have to say!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I was about to argue over it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga smiled and shrugged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A mature person is supposed to be generous and accepting. Isn&#8217;t that right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye… yeah, I guess, You&#8217;re right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to respond as I scratched my bangs up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re my Kuuya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not yours.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahahah”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, we are going to have a mysterious date on the next weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one knows yet what the outcome will be&#8230;.!</span></p>
