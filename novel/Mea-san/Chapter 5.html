<h3>Chapter 5 - Mea-san, That Bombshell Announcement Is! </h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning, on the first Friday of April, it was finally the entrance ceremony for our junior high school</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay… Well then, let’s go…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes… I’ll be in your care~…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Heave ho!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“EHHH?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were changing clothes with our backs to each other, but then we turned towards each other, breathing in unison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oo….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oo….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we faced each other, we both let out a squeal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time for both of us to see each other in uniform.</span></p>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The blue-based one-piece sailor uniform looks outrageously good on the neat and classy Mea-san&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thrilled from the first glance. And I felt even more excited the more I looked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ho… How… do I look…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I kept staring at her, she looked up at me with a puzzled expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fought back the urge to hold my chest as she became increasingly destructive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, yes, indeed. I have to put it into words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It… it looks really good on you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so embarrassed that I ended up sweeping up my bangs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now that I&#8217;m dressed up, I&#8217;m obliged to complement her too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah… it looks like it was designed specifically for you, Mea-san&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that to her while looking away from her, which made me look like I was posing, she patted her chest (which I could clearly tell was bulging even more than usual) and lowered it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank God… But It&#8217;s too much of a compliment.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s how good you look.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why are you turning your face away?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s… a secret.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu~, Mou~, Kuuya-san is&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s kind of helpful that she backs off when I say this. Maybe because Mea-san herself is a princess in secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was what I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.It looks very good on you too, Kuuya-san. You look very charming.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uu~&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p><div class="zetro-d0e4d792ab626c317dd8289969708d87 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d0e4d792ab626c317dd8289969708d87"></div>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I-I look charming?! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my face heat up at the compliment which I am absolutely not used to hearing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank God I turned my face away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m honestly happy… because I was aware that I was wearing a uniform which was a little large here and there, and that I could have been called &#8220;Someone wearing a uniform&#8221; that’s why I felt kind of happy and relieved to be praised by Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about it, Mea-san said with a sly smile and a smirk on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;These uniforms are mysterious. Just by wearing it, I feel like a grown-up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s true… The second and third year students are also dressed in the same way, so it feels like we&#8217;re one of them&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head. As soon as I put on the uniform, even if it was loose, I was sure that I felt like one of the older people I had seen walking around town &#8211; in other words, an adult.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. I guess Mea-san also feels the same way as I do…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even more so since we used to carry randoseru on our backs until recently.&#8221;</span>
<span style="font-weight: 400">[TN: “Randoseru” </span><span style="font-weight: 400">firm-sided backpack made of leather, etc. (used by Japanese elementary schoolchildren, often red for girls and black for boys)​. As many of you might have watched in Doraemon.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine Mea-san in a randoseru&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was a nor-normal elementary school student.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s how mature you are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I can&#8217;t imagine you in a randoseru either, Kuuya-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh? You, you can’t?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was rather easy to imagine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because… I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s normal for elementary school students to sweep their hair up like Kuuya-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;This habit of mine was thought to be cool by Mea-san!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The more happy I was to know that I was acknowledged, I couldn&#8217;t resist turning around in a good mood and sweeping my bangs again to show it off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-is that so~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufufu~ yeah, really cool!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san hopped happily and nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The movement also made her b*****s bounce up and down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I became embarrassed again and looked away again.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Yes, indeed, this side of Mea-san is really like a grown up</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">… I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wish I was as mature as Kuuya-san, but… I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha! Why are you apologizing?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it&#8217;s just the other way around! You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s mature!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san is, um, you know, aren&#8217;t you very tall, like a grown up?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I barely managed to keep myself from saying, &#8220;Even your b***s are big.” Well done, me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Mea-san said,</span></p><div class="zetro-7a74ed1f9ed5969c8ac115c48ab97281 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7a74ed1f9ed5969c8ac115c48ab97281"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I just grew up quickly physically. I don&#8217;t think I would have caused any inconvenience if I was as mature as Kuuya-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I… I don&#8217;t remember being bothered by you at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no idea what to say, but I had to respond… In short, that’s what I said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;See, Indeed. That is what it’s all about. You&#8217;re so much more mature than I am.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both think that the other person is more mature than ourselves, and we&#8217;re both a bit shy about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…If you think about it in the other way, it&#8217;s like “Mutual Respect”, or… ”Mutual love”, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about it──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Aahahaha”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu~~&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We couldn&#8217;t help but laugh at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, like, what the heck. I mean, this is very&#8230;. &#8220;like that&#8221;, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you ask me what I meant by </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">that</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, it&#8217;s hard for me to give a solid answer&#8230; W-well, in short, &#8220;Don&#8217;t newlyweds compliment each other like this?” Or something like that&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I know that the idea of newlyweds showing each other their junior high school uniforms is nonsense, but!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m kind of happy about this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s exactly what it was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I failed to make breakfast again today, but… Uu~&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san and I left the room together and headed for the entrance ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I closed the door to my room, Mea-san looked at me with narrowed eyes. This kind of thing is both embarrassing and ticklish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well… shall we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked out in a good mood. And like yesterday, Mea-san followed three steps behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That walking stance also tickled me&#8230; &#8220;Walking pace of a Wife&#8221; so to speak&#8230;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What a thought</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I thought as we turned around the corner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are Kuuya-san&#8217;s father and mother going to be at the ceremony today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san suddenly brought up a topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked back over my shoulder and nodded (this is the only problem with this distance, I can&#8217;t talk to her properly.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I heard from her last night that she will be coming. But she said she will be going separately from us, and that she would only be watching the entrance ceremony.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My mother said something like that too. She has to submit some documents and elect PTA officers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I see, so guardians don&#8217;t just accompany us to the ceremony&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The elementary school entrance ceremony was so long ago that I can&#8217;t remember the details. Nowadays, it&#8217;s embarrassing for parents to be around their children for the entrance ceremony, so this format is very much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I should be able to meet up with your mom on the way back&#8230; When I do, please let me say hello to my mother-in-law this time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-yeah, thanks. I also feel that way&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it&#8217;s going to be embarrassing in a different way&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m honestly happy to see that Mea-san is such a disciplined and good girl. I&#8217;ll have to learn from her too&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh&#8230; by the way&#8230; Mea-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I remembered something important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is it, Kuuya-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, It’s about… our relationship, how do we explain it at school? Or should I say, publicize it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to confirm a little more seriously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is an important matter, to say the least. After all, we are a “Newlywed junior high school couple” which is a relationship that is unheard of (I think).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If such a thing were to become known, the whole school would be in an uproar, and more importantly, the school would have trouble dealing with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, depending on how Mea-san responds, we may have to ask our parents &#8220;Should we go ahead and fake it!?”&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;that’s true&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san put a finger on her elegant lips and thought for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B, but, I&#8217;d like to keep it a secret, if possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded with a smile as my cheeks turned red, captivated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I’m just asking out of curiosity, but why?&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-c22ffa9da7def1eb87f933bd71644e99 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c22ffa9da7def1eb87f933bd71644e99"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-It&#8217;s a secret.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s still a princess in secret when it comes to the most important things, but I can kind of tell that the reason she says &#8220;It&#8217;s a secret&#8221; is because “It’s embarrassing~”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand, then I&#8217;ll keep it a secret then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, Ehhhh, Please…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I&#8217;m starting to understand Mea-san a little better now. Yes yes, this tone, this tone&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was just approaching a railroad crossing, thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yoo! I think I know that person who’s wearing a uniform! Isn&#8217;t that the back of my dear Kuuya!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was flanked by a voice that sounded incredibly cheerful and loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, is it Fuuga…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the familiar voice of a friend. I turned my head in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as soon as I turned around, I had a subtle look on my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah? What&#8217;s with that face?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s just that, it feels strange to see&#8230; Fuuga wearing that uniform.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahahaha, that&#8217;s true. I&#8217;m a little uncomfortable too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This person who is laughing so cheerfully, Mayuzumi Fuuga, is a so-called childhood friend of mine. What is noteworthy is her appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga&#8217;s taller than me (probably in the mid 160&#8217;s), her lightly pigmented hair looks careless at first glance, but it&#8217;s neatly arranged, and above all, her arms and legs are long and slender, and she&#8217;s very good-looking. Her face is also very </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘cool and handsome.’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> I&#8217;m not going to lie, her appearance is as good as her name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But you look good, you just look too cute to me. Oh, don&#8217;t get mad, it&#8217;s an expression of affection.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this pretentious, subtly dramatic wording.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. Fuuga is, so to speak, a natural &#8220;Prince&#8221; character… Except that the gender is female.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not angry. Besides, if you&#8217;re feeling uncomfortable, why don&#8217;t you change into a boy&#8217;s uniform?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wish I could do that, it would be easier for me. I&#8217;m not used to skirts, I always wore pants in elementary school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;ve never been able to recognize Fuuga as a girl because of her appearance, behavior, and the way she dresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she says that she is growing well, she doesn&#8217;t have big b***s, unlike Mea-san… Even though she has been dating boys, including my other friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t that Kuuya and Fuuga together! What a coincidence!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just then, my other friend also appeared from the same direction as Fuuga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s not really a coincidence, since most people who are going to junior high school in the west area from the east area need to go through this crossing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga raised her hand refreshingly towards that friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yoo! Sumitarou! You look so manly in your uniform!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know, I know. What do you think? Do you think I&#8217;ll be popular? This could be a hit with the girls, right?!”</span></p><div class="zetro-86bc4c5513676f7b5ff5b9b210b47e9a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-86bc4c5513676f7b5ff5b9b210b47e9a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll make no comment on that. What do you think, Kuuya?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think the vibe of always wanting to be popular between girls is also a thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scratched up my bangs as I was about to answer Fuuga’s question. And then another friend of mine &#8211; Tochioda Sumitarou &#8211; firmly crossed his arms and said-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear that from you guys who are always acting pretentious! It&#8217;s fine anyway. In middle school, the more masculine you are, the more popular you will be! Always!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m normal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, I lied, I’m not. Fuuga is airheaded and has this childish behavior, I am also conscious of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, if I didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d feel like I was losing to these two. Fuuga naturally says and does things that are closer to &#8220;My ethics” than I do, and Sumitarou is a manly man who is already over 170 centimeters tall at his age, and has a sturdy body because he has been doing judo for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you&#8217;re a little short and skinny and you&#8217;re always looking up to these guys, you need to at least act taller to look good…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohh, by the way, you know Kuuya…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Fuuga shrugged her shoulders. It&#8217;s a gesture one makes to walk into a shrine, and after all it&#8217;s obediently cool and looks good. Damn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-what?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can you introduce me to the girl behind you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh&#8230; I-I&#8217;m sorry, Mea-san, I got excited because the three of us suddenly met each other!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly turned to Mea-san, who had taken up a hiding position behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay. They are Kuuya-san&#8217;s friends, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san turned her head towards them and humbly looked at Fuuga and Sumitarou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded at her and said-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, yes, from the past. The prince-like one over here is Mayuzumi Fuuka, and the big, sturdy one over here is Tochioda Sumitarou.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I introduced them to Mea-san. I had never been in this situation before, so I was a little embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nice to meet you, Fuuga-san, Sumitarou-san. I&#8217;m Chitose Mea.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san smiled elegantly and bowed to each of them. As expected of a young lady.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ye-Yeszu! N-N-Nice to meet you! I Tochioda Sumitarou!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitarou replied with a tense look full of nervousness at Mea-san&#8217;s elegance and cuteness…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Staring*</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga put her hand on her chin and looked at Mea-san with great interest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s with the bad manners, Fuuga? She just greeted you now, you need to return the greeting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, this should be an obvious question, right? But first of all,  is it fine if I call you, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-chan</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">? You, you&#8217;re from West Elementary School, unlike us, right? I don&#8217;t recognize you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, Yeah.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded her head, as if to say,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8220;What&#8217;s so surprising?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Fuuga also nodded while making a gesture like scratching in the air with one hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then the first thing I need to know is why such a child is at this crossing from the east to the west with Kuuya…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tha-That’s&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was shocked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The rest, well, it&#8217;s simple&#8230; What kind of relationship do you have with Kuuya, that you&#8217;re heading to the entrance ceremony together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, indeed! Oii, what&#8217;s this weird thing going on around there, Kuuya!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Fuuga held up one finger, and Sumitarou agreed with her.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s right! When I think about it, that was an obvious question&#8230;!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I can&#8217;t answer honestly about that. After all, I talked with Mea-san about the &#8220;Secret&#8221;!</span></p><div class="zetro-9d5cf0c6ca58e6a944bfa25e02dd1a97 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9d5cf0c6ca58e6a944bfa25e02dd1a97"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──To be honest, I wanted to brag to both of them that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“This girl right here is MY WIFE!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well that is that, while this is this. A promise is a promise. That&#8217;s why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhh</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ー About that… </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d like to make no comment on that part.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She ruffled her hair and responded with a pose that was as pretentious as she could make it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you really think an answer like that is going to convince me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good Grief…” Fuuga shrugged. Truth to be told, she&#8217;s far more into this kind of gesture than I am…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s right! I&#8217;m jealous that you&#8217;re with such a c-cute and… adorable girl&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Sumitarou clenched his fists and said something that sounded like a protest. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I know how you feel. If I were in your opposite position, I would have questioned myself too!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ohhh lord! I can&#8217;t get any further with Kuuya! Me-Me-Me-Mea-san, What in the world is this about?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitarou changed his target to Mea-san from me. Well, he is a guy who wants to talk to cute girls if he has the chance… However, the thing is that he becomes very nervous in such cases. It&#8217;s like his body hasn&#8217;t been able to keep up with his desires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when Mea-san was asked such a question, she said-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a secret.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it firmly and brushed her long, beautiful hair off her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a little different from the way she was treating me. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not like she&#8217;s posturing or acting like a cool, beautiful girl, is she&#8230;?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It made me feel a sense of superiority.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even if it&#8217;s me, you won&#8217;t tell me??&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ehh, I&#8217;m sorry. But can&#8217;t I keep it a secret?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected from Fuuga, she backed down a bit, but her tone was still as calm as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san… So she had a side like this… Maybe she behaved this way in elementary school. That&#8217;s why boys won&#8217;t get close to her, and it&#8217;s natural that she has almost no ties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. If that&#8217;s the way it is, I guess it can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing Mea-san&#8217;s reply, Fuuga smiled and withdrew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s the thing about Fuuga, I guess. It&#8217;s not that she doesn&#8217;t fuss over things, but it&#8217;s just that she puts her point very calmly and elegantly&#8230; This is why she was so popular with the girls in elementary school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu~&#8230;A-Anywas~. Well, girls with a lot of secrets are also mysterious and nice, aren&#8217;t they?! S-so I&#8217;m looking forward to working with you again! And I&#8217;d like to get to know you better, if possible.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And on the other hand, Sumitarou, because he is always like this with girls, he was never popular with them in elementary school. I have a feeling that junior high school won&#8217;t be much different. Is it bad to think like that&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anyways, I&#8217;m Mayuzumi Fuuga. I&#8217;m looking forward to getting to know you, okay~? Mea-chan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-Ehhh, Thank you both of you. I’ll be in your care.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san bowed her head in response to the two of them. Maybe she&#8217;s thinking that she&#8217;s the exact opposite of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, now that we&#8217;ve greeted each other, let&#8217;s get going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yeah! I&#8217;m sure there are other beautiful girls out there waiting for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahahaa, I don&#8217;t know about that.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-d55ce50b7d20c53496294e9efc1f26c6 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d55ce50b7d20c53496294e9efc1f26c6"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga and Sumitarou were the first to walk away, arguing with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, it looks like we&#8217;ve got this situation under control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if Mea-san and I are to continue our newlywed life, this kind of thing is bound to happen frequently in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a bit daunting to think about it, but I may need to take another measure with Mea-san when I get back…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mea-san, Mea-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we started walking after them, I walked up to Mea-san and whispered into her ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whaat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea-san seemed unconcerned.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a big deal&#8230; </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Was what I thought, and now I feel like it&#8217;s shameful to be worrying about this now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Right, I don&#8217;t think I should bother confirming it now&#8230;. I should take it slow and discuss it when we get back.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Kuuya-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No&#8230; it&#8217;s nothing. Anyway, it would be great if you could get along with Fuuga and Sumitarou too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Of course. They are friends of Kuuya-san, so I must.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She can still say such things without hesitation after keeping a &#8220;secret&#8221; from them, Mea-san is&#8230; really something&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, the four of us arrived at school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing we had to check was the class list that was posted just past the school gate. There were already a lot of new students there, and the place was packed with people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We joined them and looked for our names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But&#8230; A short guy like me is at a disadvantage in this kind of situation!&#8230;The person in front of me is in the way and I can&#8217;t see very well&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sumitarou, Sumitarou, can you see?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a pity, but I need to rely on Sumitarou, who is by far the tallest for our age.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well… Ahhh… I&#8217;m not very good at finding names on these things… Well, Uhmm, uhmm…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;MY FRIENDS ARE TOTALLY UNRELIABLE!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If I had to pick someone else, it would be the equally tall Fuuga, though not as tall as Sumitarou. In addition to that, this girl is very good at everything, so it will be easy for her to find names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fuuga, you got it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hmm… I&#8217;m in class 1B. And as for&#8230; Oh, Kuuya and Sumitarou are together with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“EHH, FOR REAL!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can I say, I&#8217;m glad to hear that! It&#8217;s so reassuring to be with like-minded people in a new environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, what about Mea-san? What class is Mea-san in?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re wondering about that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;D-Don&#8217;t tease me. I mean, those words didn’t mean anything deep.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Aahahha, Right, I&#8217;ll tell you. So──&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m also in class 1B!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then Mea-san spoke up there.</span></p><div class="zetro-709886b6b658a48f1115f2641edd827f zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-709886b6b658a48f1115f2641edd827f"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Together with Kuuya-san and everyone!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Ooohh….!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This makes me doubly happy! I had no idea that the four of us who gathered this morning would all be in the same class!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I feel like I would have a hard time keeping the secret because of this&#8230; but I am simply very happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s really good, right, Mea-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. I didn&#8217;t get to go to elementary school with Kuuya-san, but that didn&#8217;t stop me from going to middle school with──”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was at this moment that Mea-san&#8217;s lips quivered into a pitiful smile&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah~~~~~~~</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">~~Me-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A clear, buzzing voice rang out from the school gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked in the direction of the voice- a small child with brightly colored hair in twin tails and ribbons tied around her hair came running towards us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeing her, Mea-san rolled her eyes a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kobato-chan─KYAA!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The small child hugged Mea-san tightly with the momentum from running up to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her legs were a little bit in the air. She was about ten centimeters shorter than the stunned Mea-san, and had that cute little &#8220;still in elementary school&#8221; look about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wh-What happened?”</span></p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image17.jpg?resize=980%2C1391&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea-san approached the girl, rolling her eyes at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the girl smiled happily, looked up at Mea-san and said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;You said you were in class B, right Me-chan? I’m in B too! We&#8217;re together again!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ara&#8230; I&#8217;m so glad to hear that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ehehehe~~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It seems like they&#8217;ve been friends since elementary school, as they&#8217;re laughing while hugging each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I-I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen anyone as cute as her! She&#8217;s not the same type as Mea-san, but… Ooh, I want to get close to her&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Sumitarou was getting softer and softer. I&#8217;m not sure but is it because of the good growth of his body? He’s a guy who always cares about girls and can&#8217;t help it… Really…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, he’s the kind of person who&#8217;s interested but can&#8217;t get into it, so I guess it&#8217;s okay since he’s not doing any real harm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I&#8217;m also interested in girls, though not as much as Sumitarou.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess she&#8217;s been friends with Mea-san since elementary school right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, yes, this is Jiyou Kobato-chan. We were in the same class all through elementary school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Heh~, We are also best friends, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes. Kobato-san, first of all, this is Nonomiya Kuuya-san. My relationship with him is&#8230; a secret&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahh, Hello, Nice to mee──”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was the moment she turned to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“────────!!!!!!!!!!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hee?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She- Renjiyou Kobato-san, looked as if she had been struck by lightning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-What happened to you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fumu~, you’re turning bright red, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitarou and Fuuga also noticed the sudden change in her look. But to begin with, she interjected in such a way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Renjiyou-san did not respond to them at all, but continued to stare at me with her large eyes opened even wider&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-Nonomiya&#8230; Kuuya-kun&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was what she said in a small, mosquito-like voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, yeah&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m Renjiyou, Kobato&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Nice to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">~~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her face away and went straight to hiding behind Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;What does this mean? From the way she hugged Mea-san, I thought she would be cheerful and carefree&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhh, Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that&#8217;s when I noticed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san was hiding behind me in the middle of the street. I don&#8217;t know why, but she looked like she was in a bad mood with her beautiful eyebrows raised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-what did you do, Kuuya?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-even if you ask me… I don’t know…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly whispered back to Sumisutaro, who had been listening in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I was just greeting her normally! I didn&#8217;t even strike any pretentious pose!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, in addition to Renjiyou-san, Mea-san&#8217;s condition is also strange… What is happening?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu-Fuuga, do you know what’s happening?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Fuuga, who was watching what was going on with her hands on her waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga then brushed off her bangs and shrugged her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a bit of a wild goose chase.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">DAMN!&#8230; Such a cool line, SUPER COOL! I want to say it too&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, the entrance ceremony is about to start, so we&#8217;d better get moving, right?”</span></p><div class="zetro-7235a4bfb7cdbb62243fe073a5159162 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-7235a4bfb7cdbb62243fe073a5159162"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yeah, that&#8217;s true&#8230; Then you too, Mea-san and Renjiyou-san, let’s get going…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Ehh, okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So early……!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One was muffled, the other jumpy. The reactions of the two were contrasting.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The entrance ceremony itself proceeded and ended normally, without any unusual events.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, my mom was waving and laughing (along with Fuuga and Sumitarou&#8217;s parents), and also, I was so embarrassed that I couldn&#8217;t relax.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And… apparently, Mea-san&#8217;s father had not come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, there was a stunningly beautiful woman in a kimono who looked just like her, or rather, just like the kind of person Mea-san would look like when she grows up, watching the ceremony with narrowed eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe that&#8217;s Mea-san&#8217;s mother. I&#8217;ll have to say hello to her later…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the ceremony, we parted ways with the parents again, and the new students went to their classrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a lot of buzz in the class until the homeroom teacher arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the classroom, there were faces that I knew from elementary school and faces that I had never seen before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one thing they all had in common was that they were all looking at me and Mea-san at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Or rather, looking at all of us in the first place? If you form a group from the entrance stage regardless of the school you are from, you will get a lot of attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On top of that, the two people who are the center of attention have too much presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the one hand, of course, there was Mea-san. It&#8217;s not uncommon to find a legitimate beautiful girl with a face this well-defined, so it was only natural that she caught attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And on the other hand &#8211; surprisingly to me &#8211; it was Fuuga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that&#8217;s probably not surprising when you think about it. She is the tallest girl in the class, and her demeanor is that of a gender-neutral prince.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Mea-san was mainly fussed over by the boys, Fuuga was unusually fussed over by the girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m used to the sight of Fuuga and hardly think of her as a girl, but Fuuga is just as good-looking as Mea-san. That just causes a lot of fuss in the class. She looks very elegant, though that’s mainly how it is for girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And speaking of girls, there&#8217;s another one&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… Ehehehhe~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Renjiyou-san was still hiding behind Meia-san…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So yeah, that&#8217;s it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay then, everyone, please take your seats.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teacher came in, and suddenly we all dispersed and sat down in the order of our attendance numbers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our homeroom teacher is a young and cute woman with her hair neatly tied in a bun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I always had old men or old ladies as teachers in elementary school, so this alone made me excited to be in a new environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, then everyone, congratulations on your enrollment. I am your homeroom teacher, Nakanushi Ito. Please call me Ito-sensei, it&#8217;s nice to meet you all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone&#8217;s voices overlapped, &#8220;Yes Ma’am!” This place is still very much like an elementary school, but…</span></p><div class="zetro-5067903c164eb3f0eca6a0cb340c1d07 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5067903c164eb3f0eca6a0cb340c1d07"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure it will gradually change over time. Becoming just like how a junior high school student should behave.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So let&#8217;s get started and have everyone introduce themselves. Seating order… in order of attendance number.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ito-sensei took up the chalk and wrote in large letters on the blackboard, &#8220;Self Introduction.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The attendance numbers are in the order of birthdays. I heard that most schools go with birthdays in Chiba… Right, so everyone, please announce your birthdays together. It&#8217;s kind of cool to know your classmates&#8217; birthdays, isn&#8217;t it? Fufuu~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, don&#8217;t other prefectures and cities follow the order of birthdays? The class was buzzing with excitement. So, apparently there are no students who have crossed the border or transferred here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So the very first one is…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess it’s me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Fuuga stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right, Fuga was born in April, I believe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m Mayuzumi  Fuuga from Chiyodai East Elementary School. I don&#8217;t have to tell you all that I&#8217;m obviously a girl… because I look like this, and also because I&#8217;m wearing a girl&#8217;s uniform. My birthday is April 10th, and it&#8217;s coming up soon. I look forward to working with you all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, with Fuuga in the lead, the self-introductions began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m Renjiyou Kobato. Uhmmm, I&#8217;m from Chiyodai West Elementary School, and my specialty is cooking! My birthday is on the thirtieth of July!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, she was born in the summer. I know what you mean&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nonomiya kuuya, from Chiyodai East Elementary School. Born on September 14th. Nice to meet you all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was born in mid autumn. And Sumisutarou, who was born in winter──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;SUP!!! It&#8217;s your man, Sumitarou Tochioda!  Born on December 21st, and I do judo! I&#8217;m waiting for your fan letters, girls!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…With that, he started right from the start, earning the giggles of the girls in the class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, surprisingly, the last one…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I am Chitose Mea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she stood up and said her name, the whole class was immediately on the edge of excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Fuga was there, a few people from both sexes were buzzing, but it was even more than that now. In other words, that&#8217;s how outstandingly beautiful Mea-san is…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m from Chiyodai West Elementary School. My birthday is March 1st.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I didn&#8217;t know that… Mea-san was born so early in the year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And the rest is a secret.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Mea-san was still Mea-san after the entrance ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but squirm in my seat…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s what I would have said but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn&#8217;t end there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san puffed out her chest like she was proud of winning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll add to that. I&#8217;m currently living together with Nonomiya Kuuya over there.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p><div class="zetro-dc696433da8fef4f3040d37a8b1cf7ca zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-dc696433da8fef4f3040d37a8b1cf7ca"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;──── Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, wait a minute?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you talking about, Mea-san? I thought we were going to keep that part of the story under wraps…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was foaming from the mouth, and Mea-san&#8217;s face became even more serious.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He&#8217;s my husband!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said firmly and proudly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──There was a moment of silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a moment of silence, the whole class (including the teacher) erupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of it all, I was in a panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Mea-sann… It’s no longer a secret or anything now</span><span style="font-weight: 400">────────!!!?)</span></p>
