<h3>Chapter 1- Our Newlywed Life.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What exactly is a newlywed life supposed to be like?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thinking about it normally, I think it&#8217;s just being lovey-dovey.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Yes, Ann na ta ♪”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mmmm…It’s delicious. I’m happy that I can eat your handmade cooking every day.”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m happy too because I can cook and make delicious food for you every day”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ha ha ha »</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fu fu fu”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love you…</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I love you, too…Unn..chuu~…chuu~”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Can I get more kisses?”</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Oh, you idiot… You already know it, don’t you?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so on. Anyway, I think looking at it like that is a bit naïve.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it&#8217;s only after you fall in love with each other, start dating, and get married when you realize you want to be together forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a world of just the two lovers, where no one can get in their way. A new family created by two people who are deeply in love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m sure you’ll be able to imagine what the newlywed life is all about…       </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…um…Kuya-san&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it, Mea?”     </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In our case, it was not like that at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Firstly, it was completely strange from the beginning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the first place, I, Kuya Nonomiya, and her, Mea Chitose, are not married.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or rather, we can&#8217;t get married yet. Because both of us just entered high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, there is no dating time accumulated, nor have we been together for a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We&#8217;ve only just met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We don&#8217;t know much about each other yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But we’ve started living a newlywed life in this 1DK apartment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(1DK- Apartment with one room, dining &amp; kitchen area.)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">…Just what is this world am I supposed to do?       </span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">        </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">      </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, Kuya-san, you&#8217;ve been turning away from me for a while.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This…uhhh….um…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not sure what to do…</span></p><div class="zetro-cf5e620f33faf5c16984083769ee9eb4 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cf5e620f33faf5c16984083769ee9eb4"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to deceive her, I ran my hand up my bangs and pretended to be a cool guy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anyway, I quickly take a look with a sideways glance at her, still in the pose with my hand through my bangs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not sure what to make of it. Fair-skinned, well-organized features. Beautiful hanging but innocent eyes. She has beautiful, long black hair that adorns her face. Many people are interested in girls like her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started to feel embarrassed, so I took off my gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I still can&#8217;t look directly at her. Even though I just took a glace, my heart is throbbing hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right, She, Mea Chitose, is just too beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is much more beautiful and cuter than any girl I have ever seen. I&#8217;m still amazed that such an orthodox, black-haired, Japanese style beauty exists in this world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And unlike me, who is yet to start puberty, she has matured a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She&#8217;s almost as tall as me, and looking at her b*****s, they’re really big.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, on the other hand, am the complete opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be frank, the secondary sexual characteristics are just starting. I&#8217;ve grown a bit taller, but I&#8217;m still far from my goal of 170 centimeters. My voice hasn&#8217;t changed yet, and there&#8217;s no sign of hair growth on my legs or face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In other words, I’m yet to mature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s why I think our relationship is a bit weird.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is because the wife, Mea, is too cute and mature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve never been conscious of girls like this before, but…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea is different. She is different from others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even if it&#8217;s just for the sake of it, I think that as her husband, I should be able to match her…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And by the way, Mea-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is it okay to be in that posture? If you sit like that, your legs might get numb.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At such times, it&#8217;s best to act cool and say what you can afford to say. This is the ideal image of an adult in my mind.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Come on! Mea-san! How did I look like?!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I&#8217;m fine.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;Complete rejection.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…I see. That&#8217;s fine…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea continued to sit upright and tried to shrink her well-developed body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She takes a quick glance at me. I don’t look back at her, but I notice her stare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not sure what to do, but I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m not the only one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I scraped up my bangs again.</span></p><div class="zetro-64fdd8360d8275eceda7ab66e69e3de6 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-64fdd8360d8275eceda7ab66e69e3de6"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wonder what I look like&#8230;&#8230;to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230;It’s embarrassing. Why can’t I mature faster?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I’ve said it many times already, I’m her “husband”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&#8217;t go on like this. I can&#8217;t just keep scraping up my bangs and cheating. I have to do something. Something… anything…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Let’s turn on the T.V”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought about it and eventually spoke in the most composed voice I could muster.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like I was still trying to deceive myself, but it was still better than the awkward silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;So, remote control&#8230;remote control…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh…yes…the remote…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I reached out to take the remote, she also reached out towards it. She went the same way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our fingers accidentally touched each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We quickly withdrew our hands and looked the other way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I-I’m sorry”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ahh…me too…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our eyes were away from each other as both of us became quiet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea-san quickly turned red and looked down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m not sure what to do. But I have to fix this atmosphere!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But how? What am I supposed to do in this situation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (In the first place…what do I even want to be with her)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was thinking in loopholes, this question suddenly popped into my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Again, we are not old enough to actually get married yet. And a newlywed&#8217;s life is about honest and true feelings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before even that, we don’t know anything about each other, how did we even start living together…?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And is it okay to start such a relationship when we don’t know anything about each other?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is she thinking about our honeymoon..?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How should I treat her&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My head started to spin</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll get you…a drink”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea suddenly got up. She seemed very restless.</span></p><div class="zetro-44be141173e859ab0e2f863ffcf8b51c zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-44be141173e859ab0e2f863ffcf8b51c"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhh…is that okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Rather, I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t notice until now, but I think it&#8217;s my duty…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does that mean “duty of a bride”?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Either way, I&#8217;m getting panicky. What the h**l am I supposed to do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I was thinking about this, Mea quickly stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Ah?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Immediately, Mea stumbled over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was too late when I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hyaa..?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thud! Mea fell backward as she tipped over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Are you okay!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;I’m sorry, I’m okay, it seems like my legs were a little numb.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I told you to sit comfortably”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, obviously, my words I spoke trailed of…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">MEA-SAN’S PANTIES WERE IN FULL VIEW</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s right. Mea was wearing a one-piece dress. The skirt part of the dress rolled up as she fell backward, revealing her supple legs, white underwear with a cute frilly design that was completely different from guys, and even her smooth(maybe) stomach was visible.</span></p>


<img src="https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/embed0007_HD.jpg?resize=721%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;!!!???”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was completely baffled, my eyes were glued to her and I couldn’t look away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I mean, it’s because I&#8217;ve never seen a girl like this! And, moreover, Mea had a very mature body too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Oh&#8230;Well, it&#8217;s obviously totally different&#8230; she is a &#8220;girl&#8221;&#8230;there is nothing in the crotch, so it really fits her groin perfectly.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would like people to think it’s perfectly natural to be slightly excited and embarrassed by what they see.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While that kind of logic is perfectly natural, but Mea didn’t understand it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah…? KYAAAAA!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She must have noticed my stare with my eyes wide open looking at her panties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea raised up her body while screaming, and hid her bare lower body using her skirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My ears had turned red as I was glared at by teary eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah&#8230;ah&#8230;I’m sorry…I’m sorry”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had no choice but to apologize in a hurry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or rather, she was embarrassed and angry! Even if it was a complete accident, her panties were exposed and I had seen too much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, “It’s okay as we are a married couple doesn’t work”. As I have said repeatedly, we have just met, and we do not know anything about each other. In other words, we are “complete newlyweds who suddenly started to live together.”</span></p><div class="zetro-60327ef2a3aec9deba9aa1cab98e77ae zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-60327ef2a3aec9deba9aa1cab98e77ae"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I got glared at, rather, it wouldn’t be unusual to be slapped-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was thinking in circles and broke out in cold sweat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;fu”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea suddenly pouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8212;fu?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Fu&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She raised her eyebrows, then raised her hands to the height of her face, and took a deep breath…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;fu…AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While covering her face, she screamed as loudly as she could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While I am dumbfounded, her body starts to tremble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Idiot! Idiot! Idiot! What is Mea doing?” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She started screaming to blame herself. Her ears got red. Moreover, she was calling herself “Mea” and not “I”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah…Mea-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Kuya-san told me that my legs will get numb if I sit like that, but I said it was okay because I wanted to look good, but it wasn&#8217;t okay. I fell and showed a place to Kuya-san which I shouldn’t have&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Hey, no, calm down, breathe, breathe!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m sorry, Kuya-san. I&#8217;m sorry I showed you a strange place.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pok Pok Pok Pok</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When Mea stopped covering her face with her hands, she started hitting her head this time!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No no, rather, I’m sorry I saw your pan-“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don’t say it! Don’t say it! Don’t think about it. I showed Kuya-san Mea’s underw*ar, it’s so embarrassing I might die!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Huh….I’m sorry…I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Uhhhh…Mea can’t get married anymore.” (Mea)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;…”  (Kuya)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Her long eyelashes dropped, she once again covered her face with her hands and she fidgeted her body around, groaning and whining, ears completely red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">─ Of course, I should have tried to comfort her and follow her at times like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, you can still be a bride, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">we are supposed to be newlyweds</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, so it&#8217;s okay. I mean, I’m getting to know you properly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But&#8230; to be honest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I saw the distraught Mea-san, my chest started getting stuffy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that&#8217;s why I said something else.</span></p><div class="zetro-404d69050f420f32cdc360d19e21a97a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-404d69050f420f32cdc360d19e21a97a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In my best, calm and composed, coolest tone, I said-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was a cute pair of pant*es, wasn’t it”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jolt! Her body turned stiff and mind blank as she heard the remark</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then she covered her face again and started shaking and her hair swayed while she was in shock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“AHHH! Don’t say that! It’s embarrassing! AHHHH”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Her embarrassing face is so…)</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muzzle Muzzle Muzzle</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Slowly, a feeling of impulse came up to my chest, and I couldn&#8217;t stop it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My face was burning and my chest was throbbing hard while my mouth was wide open with my jaws dropped.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s…SO CUTE!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, she is…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">She’s Acting so childish…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And…</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea-san acting shy like this…I want to see more…</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, I looked at Mea as I said-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Mea-san, look over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, Mea continued to cover her face and shake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;No, no, I can&#8217;t show this kind of face to Kuya-san&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With her ears getting redder from embarrassment and her swaying hair…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I couldn’t stand it anymore, I had to see her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s alright. It&#8217;s alright. I&#8217;m your husband, remember? No matter how you are or what condition you are in, I’ll always take care of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“…Really?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, it’s really true, so, Mea-san, look over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;&#8230;Un”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea-san slowly removed her from a face and looked up fearlessly at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;This&#8230;? Kuya-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;What is it?&#8230;”</span></p><div class="zetro-e007d16c623c6eb1b327322c6ff9025c zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e007d16c623c6eb1b327322c6ff9025c"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thump Thump! She’s so cute! So cute that my chest started thumping so hard! She was like a small animal, but somehow also se*y. And, it gives me a sense of superiority that “I’m sure no one has seen Mea-san like this except me”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what I was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">─ Ah, I was thinking about what to do with my newlywed life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">─ Isn’t such a thing already decided.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ahh…It’s no good…It’s too embarrassing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, Mea-san! Turn around, come on!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;Ah…No&#8230;Kuya-san’s an idoit! Idoit! Idoit!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">(TL- for more weeb-y people- “Kuya-san no Baka! Baka! Baka!”)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">─I want to see my wife embarrassed more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">─I want to see more of my wife’s cuteness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mea and I, both are new junior high school students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, we have just started living together as newlyweds recently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was about to begin junior high, I thought that many things would change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I didn’t expect that my whole life would change to this extent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why did this happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes back two days before the entrance ceremony of junior high school…</span></p>
