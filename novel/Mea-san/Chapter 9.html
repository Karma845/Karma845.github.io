<h3>Chapter 9 - Mea-san, Let's go back home together!</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Here it is, ku-kun&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyo-san guided me to a corner of a residential area, opposite of the railroad tracks from my house and the room I live in, and turning left on the way to the junior high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a very large Japanese-style mansion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-it&#8217;s a big house&#8230; It&#8217;s so different from ours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-chan is a princess after all… She asked me to keep it a secret though…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hahaha</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, She laughed with a wry face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;.Yes, indeed, it&#8217;s a ‘secret’ that can&#8217;t be kept secret for long. That’s how it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I have to bring Mea-san back from here first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fu-chan and Sumitaro didn&#8217;t follow us, did they?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah &#8230;Sumitaro, that’s how he is.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He himself told me &#8216;show her the man&#8217;, that&#8217;s why he wouldn&#8217;t bother to follow me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, I had a feeling that Fuuga would be more concerned about how things would turn out and would be willing to follow me…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fuuga&#8230; I wonder if she&#8217;s embarrassed, she noticed herself pretending to be a gal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That jealousy was probably what that was about. I know it wasn&#8217;t romantic feelings though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, that&#8217;s a&#8230; woman&#8217;s instinct, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh-huh.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Renjiyou-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What can I say, It’s a secret♪”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She laughed involuntarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s not something I should think about now. I have more important things to deal with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I straightened my back again and glared at the nameplate &#8220;Chitose&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Mea-san, she should be home by now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be a little courageous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… Well then, I’m going in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah&#8230; I don’t think I deserve to say this, but, bring her back! Ku-kun!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, thank you. Now then..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pressed the intercom.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it Kuuya-kun?”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reply was immediate. It was Mea-san’s father.</span></p><div class="zetro-ff4b89f593e8821baa015ea1e6dd5bf5 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-ff4b89f593e8821baa015ea1e6dd5bf5"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thanks for the other day. So, father, Mea-san is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She says she wants to pretend she never had that conversation.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I would like to ask you to leave her alone here. I will contact Touya later.”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was cut off!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was refused from the main gate. A-are you that hurt, Mea-san&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, or was the one hurt her dad? He&#8217;s the one who acted like he was against this, that he&#8217;d never let her daughter out of his hands again…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-what are you gonna do now, Ku-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I won’t back down until I talk to her!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to play hardball! I opened the front gate and stepped into the premises.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I did that,</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">clank clank clank!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something rang throughout the mansion. It was not only that.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Tsuuuuuu!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Owaa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I narrowly dodged a flying shuriken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can&#8217;t see the person who threw it at me. In other words, this is a trap for intruders&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had forgotten that Mea-san is the princess of a ninja family. So, if you think about it, her parents&#8217; house is a ninja mansion!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What, what, what?! What is this?! Shuriken!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That part&#8217;s a secret! Anyway, if that&#8217;s the case&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried my best to remember what my father had taught me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be almost impossible to break in from the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we must go around from the back, where the security seems to be thin!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;See you later, Rejiyou-san! Pray for my safety.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left Renjiyou-san and went to the back of the building to get to the wall!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow, that hurts!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fence was carefully covered with spiky protrusions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, if it were an entry route, they would have set traps even in the back of the house! This area is indeed a ninja mansion!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if you are a ninja, THEN! I am an aspiring intelligence officer. Infiltration is our specialty, so to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would have loved to say that I was a ninja, but unfortunately, that was not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m the son of a secret agent, but I don&#8217;t have any special tools&#8230; and I&#8217;m not formally trained to be a secret agent. I&#8217;m just a kid who pretends to be a secret agent, I only took occasional lessons from my dad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m gonna give up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I call out my wife&#8217;s name as I once again mount the fence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The spikes were stinging my hands as hard as it could, but&#8230; so what! I don&#8217;t care!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcefully lifted myself up and climbed on top of the fence. Then I called out again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mea-san! It&#8217;s me! I&#8217;m here to get you back!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I saw a figure quickly pass by one of the windows on the second floor.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, it&#8217;s Mea-san</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I instinctively guessed, and raised my voice even higher.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not true that you are unqualified to be my wife, Mea-san! I rather think you are so very cute and adorable when you are shy! Just like a few moments ago&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My face was hot. But I have to say it. If I want Mea-san back!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why Mea-san… Come back home together with me!!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Urrruuuuuu</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;What?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Boom!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouwaaa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a smoke ball flew out of the air and exploded under my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a slight burning pain, and I lost my balance and almost fell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tch..!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I&#8217;m going to fall, I&#8217;m going to fall on the property!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thud!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I twisted my body forcefully and fell over the wall into a Japanese garden-style yard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhhhh!! It hurts!!&#8230;. But! I have to be patient! I’m a man!”</span></p><div class="zetro-0a3ce685d4efbb2a64f4e2504abef9dd zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-0a3ce685d4efbb2a64f4e2504abef9dd"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grit my teeth and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smoke was still billowing around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then─</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, one of the sliding doors facing the garden opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“────!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know, but it was better than staying in the yard!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought, and jumped in before the smoke cleared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was a secret closet-like place with no way out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh… what the h**l, this is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not a normal house.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That means&#8230;!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed the walls on three sides, except for the sliding door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, one corner! As soon as I pushed it, it spun around and opened.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">A hidden door&#8230;!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side was a staircase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that since I have come this far, there was no time to get confused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed the hidden door and ran up the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whhhaa!!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fiich!! Suddenly, the staircase transformed into a slope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lost my foothold and slid down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaaaaaaaa!!!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s with the staircase! If it leads to the second floor, I’ll climb it!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used my hands as well as my feet to hold my ground, and I pushed my way up the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There must be Mea-san waiting for me! If that&#8217;s the case&#8230; there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m falling!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MEAAAAAAA-SAAAANNNN!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I climbed up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the end of it was a short corridor and a Japanese sliding door!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without hesitation, I charged forward and opened the sliding door with great force.</span></p><div class="zetro-d987081f19b0640284507dbcdf44cace zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-d987081f19b0640284507dbcdf44cace"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~──”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was right</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san was there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room has a calm Japanese-style that was befitting of the mansion’s exterior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if leaning against a Japanese wardrobe placed there, Mea-san quickly turned her head away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huhh! Huhh!! Mea-san… You can hear me right…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By any chance, Mea-san&#8230; you were the one who opened the &#8230;door for me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway&#8230; huh, I&#8217;m here for you, Mea-san&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was out of breath. I didn&#8217;t even pay attention to my aching limbs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go home!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know you&#8217;re embarrassed, but I think you&#8217;re adorable!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;!&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true that you may not have been able to do what Renjiyou-san and Fuuga did today! But even so, my wife is still Mea-san!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san did not answer. She kept her face turned away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But… that doesn&#8217;t mean I can&#8217;t come all the way down here and be a bit of a jerk!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I want to continue to live with you, Mea-san! I want to understand you more and more!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku… Kuuya-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, A whispered voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just by getting even a small response, my whole body is filled with strength.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the power of a man in times of need.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not the kind of guy who is usually pretentious. I&#8217;m not a cool guy at all…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…! It doesn’t matter!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mea-san, turn around and look at me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, all you have to do is take a close look at me! It&#8217;s okay to do it little by little &#8230; Let&#8217;s go together, Mea-san !!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;~”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuushh~</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san looked back at me as she stood up, her hair almost floating in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was already bright red.</span></p><div class="zetro-8a78b7093dae70d2567f87db9fb8f791 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8a78b7093dae70d2567f87db9fb8f791"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I urged her to do, she looked straight at me…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-It&#8217;s embashishing, Kuuya-san&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded my head, conscious of the heat in my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m embarrassed too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Fufufuu~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Kuuya-san!”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Hug!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san leaped onto my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put all my strength into my legs and caught her as best as I could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sweet and sour smell. The soft touch. The warm temperature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m very sorry…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took those words &#8211; and her &#8211; to heart properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Splendid.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there was,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Heh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before we know it, an odd-looking woman was standing right beside us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was surprisingly beautiful&#8230; a woman who looked a lot like Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw her at the entrance ceremony&#8230; She&#8217;s Mea-san&#8217;s mother, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My son-in-law has shown me such great determination. You must also let go of your daughter, my dear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The father, with a bitter look on his face, also entered the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I knew it was you who threw the smoke ball. Thanks to that, we can no longer tear them apart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You also made a bad move by dropping the staircase. But it didn&#8217;t seem to work on my son-in-law.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure&#8230; but&#8230; he&#8217;s saying that Mea-san’s mom was trying to thwart Mea-san&#8217;s dad who was trying to thwart my intrusion?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Nice to meet you, Kuuya-san. I&#8217;m Mea&#8217;s mother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, Y-yes, Nice to meet you too, I’m Nonomiya Kuuya…!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Once my daughter has made the decision to marry, I was not going to let her cross the threshold of this house&#8230; again, even if she cried. That&#8217;s what I should do as the mother of my daughter, the Ninja Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…”</span></p><div class="zetro-c75a0f5709b92ab67268bf7f93ba8438 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c75a0f5709b92ab67268bf7f93ba8438"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You must keep your mouth shut. You also made a promise to Touya-san, didn&#8217;t you? And now you try to change it because your daughter whined&#8230; Yet you still call yourself the head of the Chitose family, you are pathetic.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, Mea.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y… yeah… Mom…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is what it means to be married. You go hand in hand with the man you have decided to marry. No matter how embarrassed you are&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mother looked at me and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Without fail, Kuuya-san, he reached out to you no matter what&#8230; Even I understood how much he cares for you, don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t understand that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Yes. Yes, Mother.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Mea-san sobbed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Kuuya-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked up at me while she was still in my arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was aware of it all over again. I realized it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All this time, I had thought that Mea-san was more mature than I am&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still thought that I was still, in fact, a kid…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a little. Even if it&#8217;s only a couple of centimeters.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m taller than Mea-san…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my whole body being filled with a warm feeling again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah&#8230; Mea-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mea is really sorry&#8230; Mea is still like this, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah&#8230; yeah&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Can Mea be your wife&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only that &#8211; I hugged her tightly with all the strength I had in my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From me. For the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san let out a warm exhale and gentle breath…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she gently intertwined her fingers with my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No… </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We intertwined our fingers with each other&#8217;s, and then she took hold of my hand, our hand on top of each other.</span></p><div class="zetro-29cfe4a596f8e9fe5164cf41dd8d4922 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-29cfe4a596f8e9fe5164cf41dd8d4922"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was how lovers hold hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I did it…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hahhahaha”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My wife&#8217;s face was still bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she looked me in the eye, smiled and called me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My dear Husband!”</span></p>
