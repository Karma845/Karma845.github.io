<h3>Chapter 3 - What's your secret, Mea-san?</h3>


<p>─If Mea-san was a ninja, I was the son of a secret agent.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know that big company that was all over the news the other day, the one that was found to have done fraudulent accounting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>“My father was the one who uncovered it. He&#8217;s been on the inside for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am his son&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Yes. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s always given me challenges, and that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve always taken them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always admired my dad&#8230; a so-called spy.</p>
<p>As a kid, I tend to put on a good image and pose in a sophisticated way.</p>
<p>Spies are cool adults (though my dad is a bit of a different type). That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to be, and that&#8217;s why I say and do a lot of things like this.</p>
<p>Before entering this room, I checked the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>The first thing I thought&#8230; when I saw Mea-san using a shuriken was, &#8220;Is she a ninja?&#8221;.</p>
<p>Because that&#8217;s not normal, it&#8217;s possible that the other person, Mea-san, might not be normal too&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I won&#8217;t withdraw. And I know it’s probably confidential.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kuuya-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After all&#8230; not only is it the job of an agent to uncover secrets&#8230; it is also the job of an agent to protect them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; Kuuya-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san murmured and held her hands at the chest level.</p>
<p>Ah, that gesture&#8230; She does that when she&#8217;s enthusiastic.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me-Mea is the princess of a…… ninja clan!&#8221;</p>
<p>Sure enough, she answered so screamingly.</p>
<p>At the end, she even called herself &#8220;Mea&#8221; instead of &#8220;I&#8221; again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mea’s family has been a family of ninja since the Edo period&#8230; and since Mea is their only daughter, Mea has been trained in ninjutsu ever since Mea was a small child,..&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, that&#8217;s why you carry a shuriken, and you can throw it like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; Mea was actually going to keep it a secret, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you mean, that thing in the bath earlier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yeah. It&#8217;s the so-called Utsusemi (Cicada Shell) Technique&#8230; which failed because there was no way to escape and I had to go behind&#8230;&#8221;<br />
(ED: Cicada Shell Technique is about casting the skin or shell off to escape, which is probably clothes or towel in this case.)</p><div class="zetro-c64456ec039c95cad5371b56cc1ae3e6 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c64456ec039c95cad5371b56cc1ae3e6"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded and smiled at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, for telling me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-you believe me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mea-san, do you believe that I&#8217;m the son of an secret agent?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I do believe. Ah, so I guess that&#8217;s the reason&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason?”</p>
<p>&#8220;My father and your father are old acquaintances&#8230; They&#8217;ve promised each other that they&#8217;d marry each other&#8217;s children for a long time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; I can certainly see that happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>If it were a normal partner, this kind of outlandish proposal would be impossible.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a secret agent for you. And if it&#8217;s the chieftain of a ninja clan, that&#8217;s&#8230;</p>
<p>In the case of the two, they are both doing something unusual for a living, and when the time comes for your child to take over, the most convenient way to pass it on is to get two people who are already involved know each other together.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if Father had explained the situation to me beforehand&#8230;</p>
<p>For a moment I thought, well, maybe the best way to develop a natural reveal is for the two of us to start living together.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t think he expected it to be revealed on the first day&#8230;</p>
<p>And in any case.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I&#8217;m relieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, Mea-san smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad that my partner is&#8230;Kuuya-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;*blush*&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>For some reason, I can feel my heart pounding in my chest.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but hold my chest, and Mea-san must have understood the meaning of what she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m s-sorry, I&#8217;ve said something really embarrassing&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as she said that, her ears suddenly turned red, and she covered her face with her hands.</p>
<p>On top of that, she also shook her head, her long hair fluttering as if to wash away her embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mou~, mou~, Mea is such an idiot. Mea has been like this since the first day, ugh. Mea is so embarrassed, this is so embalassing&#8230;!” (TN: はじゅかちいっ =&gt; hajukashi, mispronounce embarrassing).</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because she was so embarrassed, but before she even noticed, her first name, which had been changed back to &#8220;I&#8221;, was changed back to &#8220;Mea,&#8221; and towards the end, she couldn&#8217;t even properly pronounce &#8220;embarrassing&#8221;.</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>One word. I can summarize it in one word.</p><div class="zetro-904d028a0a4080e660dacfb4d8e73a7b zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-904d028a0a4080e660dacfb4d8e73a7b"></div>
<p>─Isn&#8217;t she too cute?</p>
<p>How can a girl be so cute when she is embarrassed?</p>
<p>Moreover, Mea-san was considered to be a mature and beautiful girl with a calm atmosphere. But she&#8217;s like a child, shaking her head and saying, &#8220;No, no, no&#8221; when she doesn’t like it&#8230;</p>
<p>That made my heart pound much more intensely than before. For some reason&#8230; there was something about her that made me *turned on*.</p>
<p>So, I just went ahead and told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me, Mea-san. You refer to yourself as Mea when you&#8217;re embarrassed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;─Kuh!? Ah mou~, Mea&#8217;s really an idiot. Even though Mea decided to fix it because it makes Mea sound like a child~.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re saying it. You&#8217;re saying it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;!?!?!?!? Me, Mea&#8217;s an i*diot. S*tupid, s*tupid, s*tupid&#8230;.!&#8221;</p>
<p>─Ah, this is bad. This is really dangerous.</p>
<p>(I want to see more, this side of Mea-san&#8230;!)</p>
<p>I thought as I reflected upon it.</p>
<p>And I want to make sure that this will come true.</p>
<p>After all, we are going to live together starting today&#8230;</p>
<p>For the first time, my mind had caught up with that fact.</p>
<p>So&#8230; I&#8217;m going to live my life with this girl from now on.</p>
<p>And as her husband too! What a heart-pounding fact!</p>
<p>&#8230; And moreover, it is approved by our parents. In the first place, our parents are the ones asking us to do this.</p>
<p>(Lucky&#8230; this is the best, right&#8230;)</p>
<p>&#8220;Aaahhhh!!! Embarrassing, &#8216;hajukachi&#8217;. This is so embarrassing. Please kill me now&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>While continuing to be mesmerized by Mea-san&#8217;s embarrassment, I couldn&#8217;t help but smile in my heart.</p>
<p>Well. While all this was going on, the night was drawing to a close.</p>
<p>The shuriken that killed the black thing was disposed of, and my hair was now dry (natural drying), and Mea-san had just finished using the hair dryer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Th-then, l-let&#8217;s go to bed, Mea-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, we got up and headed for bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sleeping, well, yeah that&#8217;s what&#8230; we should do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yeah&#8230; there&#8217;s no other thing to do, is there &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no wonder that the two of us are both a little reluctant to go to bed.</p>
<p>After all, this room only has one&#8230; bed.</p><div class="zetro-2133a8508a6435c3f47d50bf32d16a4b zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-2133a8508a6435c3f47d50bf32d16a4b"></div>
<p>It&#8217;s also a double bed. There are even two pillows on top.</p>
<p>『Because you&#8217;re married, you&#8217;re supposed to sleep together now!』 I can imagine the look on my father&#8217;s face saying that&#8230;</p>
<p>I know what it means. But to do it from the start, isn&#8217;t this too much of a hurdle?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Kuh!&#8221;</p>
<p>See, even Mea-san who had once calmed down was starting to become fidgety again!</p>
<p>Of course, revealing each other&#8217;s secrets has brought us closer together (I think).</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that a boy and a girl who met for the first time today should sleep together on the same futon (TN: futon = bed)&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I hat no protlem wid it. (I had no problem with it).&#8221;</p>
<p>Squeezing both of her hands, Mea-san says so, but&#8230; it&#8217;s obvious that she&#8217;s not okay. She&#8217;s having trouble speaking again.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m just grateful that she doesn&#8217;t say things like, 「Please kill me now!」.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, there&#8217;s no other bed in this room. If we were to sleep separately, one of us (and that would definitely be me) would have no choice but to sleep on the floor.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t let the kindness of Mea-san&#8217;s words go unheeded.</p>
<p>Or rather. Since Mea-san said she&#8217;s okay with it, I can&#8217;t say 「but this is embarrassing&#8230;」&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve never slept in the same bed with a girl before. This is totally embarrassing. But even so!</p>
<p>As someone who aspires to be a grown man, I have to make Mea-san feel at ease!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll…</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahh, &#8230;&#8230; Me-Mea-san, do you want this side or the one further back?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked her casually, as if it was a natural question.</p>
<p>Then Mea-san jolted back, and with a bright red face, looked timidly at the position of the pillow on the bed.</p>
<p>By the way, if one chooses the right side of the bed, they would be on this side, while the left side is against the wall. Whether or not you rather be near the wall is purely a matter of preference. Now, Mea-san&#8217;s answered&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; the one further back&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I replied with a wry smile.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t all she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think&#8230; it&#8217;s proper for a lady to be on the left side of a man&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kuh..!.&#8221;</p>
<p>That follow-up made my face burning hot.</p>
<p>To think that she chose the back because she cared about that!</p>
<p>I mean, she is a lady, isn&#8217;t she? However, Mea-san is a princess (even though from a ninja clan), so have she been trained in such manners&#8230;&#8230;? And what does she mean by that? Mea-san was definitely treating me like a man.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so happy, but at the same time&#8230; I feel so fiercely embarrassed and ticklish!</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8230; I&#8217;m going to lie on your right. Exactly as what a man should do&#8230;&#8221;</p><div class="zetro-ce08a348ee3ad417c057cdf44d0c7f20 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-ce08a348ee3ad417c057cdf44d0c7f20"></div>
<p>&#8220;O-okay&#8230; please&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; Mea-san, please go first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hawawa. Then, please excuse me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san went into bed, red from the neck up.</p>
<p>Her pajamas wrinkled and her curves were emphasized as she slid into bed.</p>
<p>I felt thrilled by this, and felt somewhat apologetic, so I hurriedly removed my gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hnn&#8230; *Fuu~*&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, the only thing I heard was a whispering sound and Mea-san&#8217;s breath.</p>
<p>This made my heart pound &#8230; or rather, made me uncomfortable &#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, please come in.&#8221;</p>
<p>At some point, Mea-san asked me to enter the bed. That made me a little nervous, but I looked back at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san was lying curled up, with her back to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; Here I go&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I said it somewhat out of character, and for my convenience&#8230;</p>
<p>Certainly, if I were in the opposite position, I would have slept with my body facing away from her like this.</p>
<p>But even sleeping side by side on your back was still a hurdle for me.</p>
<p>&#8220;U-un, then&#8230; I also.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you please turn off the lights&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A-ahh, yeah, that&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8221; *Click*</p>
<p>I used the remote control to turn off the light in the room to night light and went to bed again.</p>
<p>─But in any way you see it, we&#8217;re &#8220;sleeping together&#8221;.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;*Rustle*&#8230;*Rustle**Rustle*&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Everytime I make a move, Mea-san jolted *twitch twitch* with a buzz, which makes me even more nervous&#8230;</p>
<p>Then, once I had my whole body under the covers, I took the same position as her, curling up with my back to the other party.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s out of the question for me to sleep with my face facing toward hers, and I think she&#8217;s not comfortable with me lying on my back…</p>
<p>Then our backs made contact with each other.</p>
<p>「「 *Gasp*&#8230;」」</p>
<p>Both of us gasped for air.</p>
<p>But still, this is the best we can do. And there is also the problem with the bed’s width. Even though it&#8217;s a double size bed, we can&#8217;t get any further apart than that when we&#8217;re both lying on our sides.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the reason I could feel her body heat trickling down my back.</p>
<p>The thought of my own body heat being transmitted to her in the same way makes me feel even more embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The both of us were unable to even retreat.</p>
<p>Instead, I can hear our hearts beating vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8230; Ah! Mou~ this is no good! There&#8217;s no way I can sleep like this!</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah-&#8230; B-by the way, Mea-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>As if to shake off my nervousness and excitement, I used all my strength to utter those word.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Ha, Hawa&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san&#8217;s reply over my back was so tense that it almost flipped my insides out.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was manly instinct to want to ease her nerves. Or does it mean that if she eases up, I&#8217;ll feel a little better? Anyways…</p>
<p>&#8220;Earlier, I told you that&#8230; I am the son of a spy right?&#8221;</p>
<p>I struggled to formulate those words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About that, I want you to keep it a secret from everyone but you, Mea-san. You see, it&#8217;s not a normal thing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8230; I understand that. You also know that I&#8217;m a ninja princess and I want you to also keep it a secret&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; that&#8217;s right, we&#8217;re really alike&#8230; thank you, that&#8217;s very reassuring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my pleasure&#8230;&#8221;</p><div class="zetro-9ae46a4e080c9a4c1091b95c399b95f8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9ae46a4e080c9a4c1091b95c399b95f8"></div>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Ever since I was little, father has been giving me a lot of &#8216;tasks&#8217;.</p>
<p>Like that, I changed the subject.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s best for her to understand who I am and what I&#8217;m going through.</p>
<p>Besides, I want to know more about her. And if I wanted to know more about her, I would have to reveal myself first.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tasks&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>With our backs to each other, I could only grasp the other person&#8217;s behavior by the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>For the moment, Mea-san&#8217;s voice was calm. So I felt at ease and continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s more like preparation for the future, you know&#8230; Father knows that I&#8217;m interested in his career.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What things did he make you do&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san asked back. It made me feel more and more at ease.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s nothing serious. It was almost like a game, you know, try to figure out the location from a few clues, or guess who&#8217;s hiding something in here. And so on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Sounds kind of interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it was interesting. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve always accepted father&#8217;s &#8216;tasks&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>While saying this, I sneakily look back over my shoulder.</p>
<p>Mea-san&#8217;s back was still turned to me. Her long black hair was flowing downwards, giving off a beautiful luster even in this dim light.</p>
<p>I hurriedly returned to my original stance. I felt as if I had seen something I shouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>─There was no doubt about it, she was next to me. She&#8217;s lying next to me.</p>
<p>Just that fact again made my heart tickle and scream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kuuya-san &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yeah, sorry&#8230; That&#8217;s why&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I think the reason why Mea-san was brought here today, and the reason why you and I are going to be newlyweds, is because it&#8217;s a &#8216;task&#8217; from father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be frank, this is unusual&#8230; but because it&#8217;s unusual, that&#8217;s why I think that it&#8217;s probably a &#8216;task&#8217; from father. So I want to accomplish it properly. Just like before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;However&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; in order to do that, I will need your help&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, that&#8217;s right. You can&#8217;t live a newlywed life alone&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; But I know that Mea-san has her own circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san snuggled her back. It was almost like an acknowledgement.</p><div class="zetro-18870a0766c2eaac15c95ed8daaeb8a3 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-18870a0766c2eaac15c95ed8daaeb8a3"></div>
<p>That&#8217;s why I stared to empty space &#8211; and asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once again I&#8217;ll ask&#8230; why did you accept this, Mea-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no immediate answer. However, Mea-san curled her body into a ball and shrugged.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; That&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, she whispered just that.</p>
<p>&#8230;It&#8217;s another one of those secrets. Again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I still&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; I see. Well, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t force you to talk. If Mea-san feels like talking, you can just talk to me then.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a lie. The truth is, I was intensely curious about it.</p>
<p>However&#8230; not wanting to force her to talk was also my honest feelings.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve just started today, living together as a newlywed couple, but we&#8217;re still very new to each other&#8230;</p>
<p>We still know very little about each other.</p>
<p>So it is only natural that she doesn&#8217;t want to reveal her secret yet.</p>
<p>─It&#8217;s definitely an adult way of looking at things.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t think I can force my way through this matter&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fine. This was me. And this was not yet the time for it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a mutual secret now&#8230; Anyway, I look forward to working with you from now on, Mea-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was all I whispered, and I pulled the sheets back over my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san, after a pause that seemed troubled by the response, said.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all she whispered back to me.</p>
<p>&#8230;Yup. That&#8217;s fine for now.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes softly, my heart was still racing.</p>
<p>But since she was next to me, there was no way I could fall asleep so easily.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Kuuya-san, have you already fallen asleep?&#8221;</p><div class="zetro-e740185ff30ae53b7dda8d4e1c3618d7 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e740185ff30ae53b7dda8d4e1c3618d7"></div>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m still awake&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m also having trouble falling asleep, too&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s only natural&#8230; Both of us have never experienced something like this before&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; however&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Mea-san once again snuggled her back.</p>
<p>More than ever, our backs are in perfect contact with each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; no, it&#8217;s nothing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sleepiness didn&#8217;t hit me yet. Instead, there was a ticklish and unsettling sensation throughout the entire time.</p>
<p>─ From now on, it will be like this every night.</p>
<p>─ Someday will we get used to each other, I wonder?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be a little embarrassing if this became the &#8220;norm&#8221;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I suddenly thought.</p>
<p>As I felt her warmth on my back.</p>
