<h3>Chapter 4 - Mea-san, If you do that...</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;──san, Kuuya-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice brought my consciousness to the surface.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhmm…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuuya-san, it&#8217;s morning already&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that I was able to fall asleep without any problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in the morning&#8230; my ears heard it&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s Mea-san’s voice.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh yes. I slept with her last night&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I&#8217;ve&#8230; become an adult, just by this one thing&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That… Ahh, wake up… please… or I’ll…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there it was, Mea-san&#8217;s voice sounded as if she was getting desperate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she suddenly shook my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;You mean I have to get up early?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm… don&#8217;t be so hasty&#8230;. it&#8217;s still spring break today&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied in a half-asleep voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad we were able to sleep together properly, it&#8217;s not so bad to be woken up like this&#8230; or rather, I&#8217;m happy to be tickled by her&#8230;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh yes, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to be every morning from now on. &#8230;&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I… I want to go to the toilet! I can&#8217;t get out of bed unless Kuuya-san gets out of the way!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were positioned with her at the back by the wall and me in front. In other words, it was exactly as she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, sorry, sorry! I was kind of sleep deprived!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly jumped out of bed to make some space.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right, when you wake up, you would want to go to the bathroom! And Mea-san, the fact that you didn&#8217;t step over me and get out of bed is really impressive&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good morning, Mea-san, I&#8217;m really sorry&#8230; please take your time.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with that, in an effort to make up for my mistake, I made a gentlemanly gesture in the direction of the restroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll be relieved by this. It might be a little embarrassing to be forced to reveal that you need to go to the bathroom, but please, Mea-san, know that you won’t be</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> able to escape an urgent problem without making some sacrifice</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I guess I&#8217;ll have to wake up early every morning from now on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a morning person, but I guess I can&#8217;t help it&#8230; for Mea-san’s sake&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.!?!?!?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh?, for some reason, Mea-san suddenly got stiff there!?</span></p><div class="zetro-5ae6d95489878cfda611e265941b1b8a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-5ae6d95489878cfda611e265941b1b8a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh? Is, is something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She panicked again. Have I said something wrong?!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Kuya-san… that…Uu~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked at her, she looked wide-eyed and frightened, so I followed her gaze&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah……… UWAAAAAAAAA!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was already in a big hurry to cover my son. Finally, I understood what was going on!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. It&#8217;s morning. And when it comes to men in the morning, there&#8217;s a natural physiological phenomenon, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">The Morning Erection.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I&#8217;ve been caught in the act by Mea-san! It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a tent pitched on my pants, and my son is all bulging and stiff!</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m ashamed! I want to die! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment, but apparently that was not the point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with that—</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Kuya-san… Uu~&#8230;“</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could see her trembling as she backed away to the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wai-, Ehh, Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t… Don’t tell me, that’s, with th-tha-that, you and…”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You, and&#8230; me, and that… excited.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you going to attack me?&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Is that what you mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N, N, N-NoNoNoNo!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to wave my hands frantically (with my son still stiff).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;B-But I&#8217;ve learned that when men want to do that, their.. .Peni-… G-gets bigger&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re right, but this is different! This is a morning erection! It&#8217;s just a physiological phenomenon!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know that&#8230;.. I never learned about it&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, now you know! It naturally happens when men wake up from sleep! It has nothing to do with lust or anything like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is… is that so…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That’s why, don&#8217;t give me that stare again!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And anything like that, why! Because it&#8217;s getting bigger and it hurts!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anyway, you get it, right? This is just a physiological phenomenon and will be fixed when I go to the toilet. And with that, I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll go on ahead&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh… Y-yes, I’m sorry too&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Good grief… and a few minutes later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m back&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt bad for having her use the bathroom after me, so I immediately left the room with my wallet in hand after finishing my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">task.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I felt bad about listening to the sound of girls doing their t</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ask</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230; And more than that, I felt kind of awkward&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, welcome back. But, where did you go&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yeah. I bought us breakfast.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held up a bag from the convenience store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way here yesterday, I had confirmed that there was a convenience store just a few minutes&#8217; walk away. In every sense of the word, Dad&#8217;s preparation of the house was well done. To be frank, it has a much better location than my parents&#8217; house. It&#8217;s also closer to the middle school I&#8217;ll be attending tomorrow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, cooking is, well, you know, we&#8217;re both still a little out of it. For today, I guess.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um… I&#8217;m sorry for&#8230; various things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It’s alright&#8230; then, let&#8217;s eat now, shall we? Which one does Mea-san want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I sat down on the cushion in the living room and spread out the things I had bought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I chose a variety of rice balls, sandwiches, and other types of food, but I then realized&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah… I should have also bought a drink.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just realized that now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, for some reason, I felt upset.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just as I was thinking that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh… then, Then I&#8217;ll prepare the drinks~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saw Mea-san squeezing her fists tightly and cutting my words off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s great, but are you sure you&#8217;re okay with it&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can at least get you a drink.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san&#8217;s cheeks were puffed out. It was honestly cute and adorable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fortunately, we have a lot of things prepared for us&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She walked into the kitchen and bent down to open the bottom storage cabinet, &#8220;I guess my dad put some drinks in there.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you want to drink, Kuuya-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think I&#8217;m going to go with&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is my chance to get back on track. So I brushed my bangs up and struck a cool pose. And then I saidー</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll have coffee, please… Black.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, what else could I ask for?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you okay with black coffee?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded with more pretension.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400">YES YES YES, that&#8217;s how it should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not good to be upset or shout. A grown man needs to be composed at all times. And if I&#8217;m going to drink, it should be black coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The bitterness and aroma of black coffee is essential for waking up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, this method is very effective …I&#8217;m sure this will restore Mea-san’s opinion of me, which had dropped earlier (I think).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So that’s the case, I see… I&#8217;ve always been a green tea drinker&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, Mea said admiringly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll get you some coffee, just wait a minute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mia filled the kettle with water and put it on the fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, a fragrant smell of coffee wafted out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she had prepared drip coffee instead of instant coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My father is very attentive in this area as well. I really appreciated it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thanks for waiting.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mia brought us the cups and then she placed two cups on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Mea-san is also going for coffee?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. When I heard Kyuuya-san’s choice, I wanted to try drinking it black too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well&#8230; I hope it suits your taste.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled at me and said, &#8220;I can take it easily&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Mea-san also sat down and we started to sort out the food I had bought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was slightly surprised when Mea-san told me that one rice ball was fine for her. Girls are such small eaters&#8230;Well, anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, let&#8217;s eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s eat.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We said to each other neatly. Mea-san was more polite and even put her hands together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s with this, I can&#8217;t lose. I&#8217;ll make sure to join my hands properly next time too&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking about this, I first brought the coffee that Mea-san had prepared for me to my lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(UWAA, it&#8217;s bitter… Ugh!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I groaned inside my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it&#8217;s bitter, astringent, and not very tasty&#8230;! I want to add a lot of sugar and milk to it&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I know. This is what adults are supposed to do, to drink this stuff normally&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I keep drinking it like this, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll start to enjoy it someday. Yes, just like growing taller and changing your voice&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8216;Yeah… I love this bitter taste. Thank you, Mea-san, for making this delicious brew.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so I tried my best to keep the bitterness out of my face, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s so darn bitter and bad!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, and smiled while thanking her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Okay, so far, so good&#8230;! What do you think, Mea-san, about my maturity&#8230;!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome&#8230; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">*Sniff*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She lifted her own cup and sniffed the aroma of the coffee as she peered into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;While I was brewing it, I was thinking that the smell of the coffee was… very fragrant and nice.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, Mea-san have never had coffee before, have you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;ve always had a traditional Japanese style life… so I&#8217;m going to try some myself.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Her first black coffee&#8230; will she be okay? I&#8217;m a little worried about her. Furthermore, even though I said I drink black, I actually don&#8217;t.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking about it, Mia-san took a sip from her cup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as soon as she did──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“────!?!?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bang!</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> she put her cup down vigorously and held her mouth in a panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!?~~!?~~!?~~!</span><span style="font-weight: 400">!~~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, with bright black and white eyes, she looked around as if she didn&#8217;t know what to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that the taste is so unexpected that she doesn&#8217;t even know if she should swallow it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me-Mea-san! you have to be patient here! Swallow with all your might!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jumped into the kitchen and filled a mug with milk and returned it to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s only going to get more bitter if you keep it in your mouth! So when you drink it, wash it down with this!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~~~!?!?!?!</span><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was already in tears as she nodded her head in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she breathed in through her nose a few times to regulate her breathing&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huu…… Fuuu, Huufuun, Huuh&#8230;Fuunn”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She closed her eyes and swallowed hard, straining her throat as hard as she could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it my imagination that&#8230; she looks kind of irresistibly s**y? No, stop looking at her like that!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Mea-san finally swallowed all the coffee in her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;FUAA, It was bitter… It wasn&#8217;t tasty… FUAAA, *</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sob*</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She continued to say with tears in her eyes and started to drink the milk I had brought to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm, I think it was kind of s**y, or it felt naughty somehow&#8230; I&#8217;m dying to take my eyes off Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was I such a pervert after all? Or is it that Mea-san is such a naughty adult that she makes me feel this way?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thinking about this, and looked at her again, then&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhhh”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our eyes met.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as our eyes met, Mea&#8217;s face turned red, even her ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she turned her face away, put her hands on her cheeks, and shrunk her body. She began to wriggle her body as if she didn&#8217;t like it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-Me-Me-Me-Me-Mea showed something very bad again&#8230; No, no. Why do I end up doing same thing again and again…:”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was completely embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Idiot, Idiot, Idiot, Mea is an Idiot!&#8230; in front of Kuuya-san, like this, like this, like this, like this&#8230; Fuuaaann!&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, she turned into a crying mess and started smacking herself on the head again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it yesterday too, but──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t the shy Mea-san… too cute&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I especially like how her normal expression, which is usually calm and mature, collapsed so easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She crumpled up her beautiful face like a bullied child&#8230; and the gap between her appearance made my heart ache. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I couldn&#8217;t resist saying it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me-Mea-san, can you show me your face for a second?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to get a better look. I have to see the look on Mea-san&#8217;s face! The part where she&#8217;s embarrassed!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s what my manly heart says, then──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, dont~, Mea have a funny face right now &#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head even more, and covered her face with her hands, which is probably because of her womanly heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for me, such further embarrassment is also irresistible&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say that, Mea-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noo, don’t, Bad, Kuuya-san is bad, are you an Idiot? Are you an Idiot? Are you an Idiottttt…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s the scene that unfolded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite everything that happened, breakfast was over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-you aren’t going to keep wearing your pajamas forever, will you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you saying~</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Mea-san cut me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, her face was still a little red. She didn’t seem to be reeling from what happened earlier (I apologized to her a lot), but it seems that she won’t be changing her mind that easily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to have to dismiss your opinion. As for me, since it was my day off, why don&#8217;t I just wear my loungewear? But now that the two of us are living together, it&#8217;s not just my problem. Maybe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, well, let&#8217;s get dressed for now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y… yeah&#8230; but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;We can&#8217;t just change clothes like this, can we?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-of course. Such a thing… to be seen by Kuuya-san is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I&#8217;ve already seen Mea&#8217;s naked body&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment, and I understood that she meant </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want you to see any more.” </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">So I guess I&#8217;m the one who should be concerned. As a man.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;All right, I&#8217;ll turn around and then you can get dressed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, taking the initiative to turn my back to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not looking back. This will be fine, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y… yeah, yes, thanks&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She replied slowly, but with a reassured voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inwardly, I&#8217;m a little relieved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, to tell the truth, I&#8217;m interested. I really want to see Mea-san changing her clothes. I&#8217;ve only ever seen girls changing clothes with a sideway glance while changing for P.E. until the fourth grade. And of course, none of them were as beautiful and well-developed as Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This never occured to me before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe something is starting to awaken in me now that I know this girl, Mea-san. Yes, so to speak, the booming part of a grown man is&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I was relieved that I was able to take the initiative to turn my back on her and put her at ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, something may be budding, but not enough to dance around with it yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I&#8217;m trying to be a cool, mature guy. It&#8217;s just the opposite of &#8220;I&#8217;d like to see you changing!&#8221; This is fine, this is fine&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, I started to change out of my loungewear and into the clothes I took off yesterday. I came here empty-handed, unlike Mea-san, so I&#8217;ll have to go get my stuff later today&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking about this, I put on my shirt.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn… sho~&#8230;“</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can hear the sound of her clothes rubbing against her skin, and the sound of her breathing coming from behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl behind me must have started to change her clothes too. From the sound of it, she probably has just taken off her pajamas now&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuu… I want to turn around! I really want to turn around!</span></p><div class="zetro-1cf78174375c755f2c171faf642f95eb zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1cf78174375c755f2c171faf642f95eb"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so excited that I couldn&#8217;t help but shout inwardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, because! I didn&#8217;t realize how ticklish and embarrassing it was to hear nothing but the breathing and sound of clothes rustling!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, it was my first time. When we were still changing together in elementary school, it didn&#8217;t bother me too much because everyone was there, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t realize how uncomfortable it would be to be alone with someone else and having them change behind you&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can&#8217;t let that happen. With steel reasoning, I suppressed my desire to turn around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I turn around here… I&#8217;ll be screwed in many ways.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gritted my teeth and finished getting dressed, telling myself, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">be absent-minded&#8230;..absent-minded &#8230;&#8230;</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn, Nnn… yotto… fuu&#8230;“</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the background, Mia-san was still in the process of changing her clothes.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m done, how about you?&#8221;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> If I look back, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll see Mea-san in her beautiful appearance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that&#8217;s it! Just because I&#8217;m done over here doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;ll be done too!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I tried my best to keep my back to her until she called me. Good luck, me! I&#8217;m being tested (by myself) to be a mature and cool guy right now!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hm, uhh&#8230;. I&#8217;m done too, Kuuya-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I WON&#8230;! FROM MYSELF….!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I finally turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was dressed in a pretty dress and an elegant cardigan, different from yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I looked back at her, she mumbled to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.Kuuya-san is so mature.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Heh&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh&#8230; well, I was protected by my friends in elementary school&#8230; but even so, the boys in my class would try to catch a glimpse of me when I was changing&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I-Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But… Kuuya-san is totally different. From the beginning to the end, you kept your back turned&#8230; So you&#8217;re an adult that is incomparable to the boys I&#8217;ve known so far&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8230; I know right&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to respond like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I wonder what you would think if you knew about my inner conflict, Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But if it doesn&#8217;t show through, it&#8217;s fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m wearing the same clothes I wore yesterday, which is a little embarrassing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I scratched my hair up with a pretentious pose, trying to cover up my thoughts.</span></p>


<img src="https://i2.wp.com/zetrotranslation.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/image13.jpg?resize=980%2C1391&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m really starting to feel like I have no choice but to act like an adult in front of her.</span></p><div class="zetro-395edfe21ff026e70a5ecba560cc9aa0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-395edfe21ff026e70a5ecba560cc9aa0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that&#8217;s what I want. It is, but&#8230; I can&#8217;t let my guard down for a moment, yet at this rate&#8230;!</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I&#8217;ve finished getting dressed and now I&#8217;m ready to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uhhー&#8230; I&#8217;m going to get my stuff from home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said to her evasively.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As I said before, I need more clothes. And tomorrow is the entrance ceremony, so I have to get my uniform too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;In addition, I wanted to get away from Mea-san for a while and relax a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s pathetic, but I can&#8217;t help it. I might just be a &#8220;Popular kid,&#8221; not an actual adult (as Mea-san thinks). I hate to say it, but I&#8217;m still short and my voice hasn&#8217;t changed yet&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, I&#8217;m sorry to bother you, Mea-san, but can you stay here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, she put her hand on her chin and gave me a thoughtful look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll go with you too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s easier to carry something with two people rather than one person carrying everything alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, th-that may be true, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I might look like this, but I’m very strong. I&#8217;ll show you how useful I can be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was enthusiastic, her clenched fists waving at chest level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Mea-san is still Mea-san, and she&#8217;s feeling like she needs to make up for her constant blunders&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that situation, I knew I couldn&#8217;t reject her in the slightest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I… I understand… well then, I’ll be in your care&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to say so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leave it to me. You can tell me anything you want to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san was getting more and more enthusiastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked back the same way my father and I had walked yesterday, but this time with Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder our school districts are so different.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told her it would take about fifteen minutes to walk from our house, she said something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If we&#8217;re talking about that area, then Kuuya-san went to East Elementary School, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That means you went to West Elementary School, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, my parents live on 9th West Street.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our town, Chiyoda, is divided into east and west by the railroad tracks that run north and south.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, children from the east side of the town attend Chiyoda East Elementary School, while those from the west side attend Chiyoda West Elementary School. In junior high school, the students from these two schools will be merged together. By the way, the apartment we started living in yesterday is in the south district, which is right below the east district (also in the east elementary school district), and we can access Chiyoda Junior High School on the outskirts of the west district as soon as we cross the railroad crossing. And since Mea&#8217;s parents live on 9th West Street, I guess we&#8217;ll have to turn around there. In any case, it&#8217;s the opposite direction from my parents&#8217; house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And while I was thinking about this.</span></p><div class="zetro-e7dc635dafeafbd26353e021817a18ea zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-e7dc635dafeafbd26353e021817a18ea"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wish… Kuuya-san and I had been together since elementary school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got a little nervous when she suddenly said that to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, it would have been a lot easier if we had known each other for a while, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, doesn&#8217;t that make you even more embarrassed? I thought we were just classmates, but we were actually fiancées, and suddenly we are going to live as newlyweds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought like that, but apparently Mea-san didn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Right? If I had, I might have been able to be more useful&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she said that, she came to stand next to me. Her long, beautiful hair fluttered around her shoulders, almost brushing against my shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so too, Kuuya-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Even if we knew each other for a long time, it wouldn&#8217;t change the fact that you&#8217;re not used to being with boys, would it, Mea-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was conscious of the fact that we were about the same height and stride length, so my reply was a bit moody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I am standing next to her, I am reminded of how well developed she is &#8211; and by extension, how underdeveloped I am. This was the reason why I was trying to grow taller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, you said that you&#8217;ve never really talked to boys before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s indeed true but… Uu~, You’re right, well I guess, at any rate I….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san squirmed.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ohh s**t! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought to myself when I came back to my senses. I can&#8217;t believe how I let my looks get the better of me, I&#8217;m not even close to being a man</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is where I should follow up! Ehhhh, umm…..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I could think of anything else, Mea-san looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Still, I&#8217;m sure Kuuya-san and I would have gotten along just fine, unlike the other boys!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sounded so sure of that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this short period of time (actually, it&#8217;s only been a day), I&#8217;ve gained a lot of trust.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I wonder if it&#8217;s the quality of her upbringing&#8230;.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a way, I guess I was lucky that she hadn&#8217;t had much contact with boys before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it. What can I say, it&#8217;s too dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(It&#8217;s a good thing that it was me&#8230;..)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;Ehh? Me? What am I even thinking?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m starting to feel fiercely ashamed of myself. What kind of hubris is this! I&#8217;m still just a kid!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;? What&#8217;s wrong, Kuuya-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing, it&#8217;s a… secret, a secret!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh my~ you&#8217;re saying that too, Kuuya-san. If you say that, I have no choice but to back down.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha&#8230; that, that&#8217;s very helpful&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but laugh dryly as I try my best to keep my red face away from hers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;I wonder if this is how you feel too when you&#8217;re embarrassed, Mea-san…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And thus, We arrived at the hidden shrine of the Miya-household kept away from the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no response when I pressed the doorbell, so I used my duplicate key to get in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Dad&#8217;s at work, and Mom&#8217;s probably out shopping, I think&#8230;. because I can&#8217;t find her shoes here. Well, come on in anyway.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, pardon for the intrusion.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been a day since I&#8217;ve been home, but I never thought I&#8217;d be coming home with a girl&#8230; (and a super beautiful one at that!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Mea-san took off her shoes and put them back in the correct position, facing the right way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s little things like this that show how well you were raised. None of my friends would ever do something like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, nothing&#8230; Well, let&#8217;s just get you a drink and then we&#8217;ll go to my room.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Actually, I would have liked to say hello to my mother-in-law though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;B-But that can wait for another time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s where I was relieved! If my mother had been there, I don&#8217;t know how much she would have made fun of me&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I went to the kitchen to prepare tea for the two of us (I had to pay attention to Mea-san, who was a green tea drinker) and went up the stairs to my room on the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I apologize for the mess, but&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I opened the door. By the way, I was very fortunate to have just cleaned my room the day before yesterday, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, too, am going to be a junior high school student!&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Day before yesterday me, Thank you. Because of you I&#8217;m not too embarrassed to bring in Mea-san──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U~~~~~&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Uu~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Mea-san didn&#8217;t go inside, but stood there in the hallway, her face red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">the</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;boy&#8217;s room&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Ah, Umm, I apologize for the plainness of the room, but&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My very important elementary school days&#8217; live action posters that I cherished when I was in elementary school were torn away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was what I was thinking, but that was not what Mea-san had been paying attention to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As soon as I opened the door, smell of Kuuya-san, surrounded me by all siiidddeessss~~~&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;What does that even mean?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ehh?! Does it stink that badly?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah&#8230; That-that&#8217;s not what I meant!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san turned redder and redder, and shook her hands dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s the room where Kuuya-san lived&#8230; Kuuya-san&#8217;s&#8230; boy&#8217;s room&#8230; Of course, it&#8217;s completely different from my room. I&#8217;ve never been in a boy&#8217;s room before, so I was&#8230; kind of embarrassed&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;It was an amazing sheltered girl reaction!</span></p><div class="zetro-cdae78704052fbbb82b001c0b326bfb0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-cdae78704052fbbb82b001c0b326bfb0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I-If you say something like that, I&#8217;m going to be very aware of it&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room where we were supposed to live a newlywed life was unfamiliar and still lacking in a sense of life, so it was good. There was no feeling that she was in &#8220;My own room&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this room is different. It&#8217;s exactly my room, where I&#8217;ve spent all my life in ever since I was born.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, a bookshelf&#8230; hmm, Kuuya-san really likes manga&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that my fiancée and nominal wife, Mea-san, is right here&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;P-please don&#8217;t look at them too closely&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was embarrassed and ashamed to say such out of character words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh, I-I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230; ah, well&#8230; I suppose it can&#8217;t be helped…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, Ehhh, Why… so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m going to pack up my things for now. Mea-san, can you sit on the bed and wait for me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is it fine if I sit on the bed?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think it&#8217;s the most comfortable place to sit in my room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but feel that way. Rather, Mea-san is the one who wants to turn into a kid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, the chair on my study desk gets in the way when I need to pick things up. I feel bad asking someone to move out of the way every time…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for your concern. Well if you&#8217;ll excuse me then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san thanked me and sat back down. She is very polite and sincere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. Then I&#8217;ll get start─ Hmm…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I noticed something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was something unfamiliar on my study desk, along with a note.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ehh… this, this is a smart phone!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the note attached to it, wondering if it was possible.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s inconvenient to not have a means of communication!  You, too, are more or less going to have a family, and that&#8217;s why you are allowed to have it. You&#8217;ll have to pay the usage charges from the money in the account I gave you. Regards, Daddy.&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ooo&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I instinctively raised my voice out of joy. It’s a nice surprise that foresaw my actions, Dad!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-What&#8217;s wrong, Kuuya-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My dad gave me a smartphone! Uwaa, I&#8217;ve always wanted one, but I thought it would be a while before I could have one…!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Fufu~, Kuuya-san really gets excited like a child at times.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah&#8230; well yeah, I have to react honestly to the gift, otherwise it&#8217;ll be disrespectful to the sender.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying something like that, I scrape up my bangs, trying to cover  up my embarrassment.</span></p><div class="zetro-bd8bb28842f605782967759430835dcc zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-bd8bb28842f605782967759430835dcc"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m really happy about this. Only one of my friends has one, and this will allow me to do a lot of things on LINE, and I can brag about it to my friends who don&#8217;t have one&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;M-Mea-san doesn&#8217;t have a smartphone yet, right? So from now on, our contact information will be this num──&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a smartphone since I was in elementary school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was in a festive mood, but then it went down a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well&#8230; yeah, you&#8217;re a rich young lady, Mea-san, so you might have it. I mean, I shouldn&#8217;t be so excited about my phone either&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But&#8230; This is, Fufufu~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head as Mea-san suddenly chuckled happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now I can communicate with Kuuya-san even when we&#8217;re not together, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;~&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, but, fufufu~, I&#8217;m never gonna be separated from you, so I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;ll ever get the chance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-That’s true, but if we have separate classes in junior high school, then maybe&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, she would say things that would unexpectedly make me nervous, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve come to understand now. She&#8217;s like a little girl. I totally understand that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So if I get nervous every time, my body won&#8217;t be able to take it. I need to get used to it. Slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s exchange the contact information right away. Dad seems to have installed LINE already, so let’s register quickly for the time being &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you the code.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, thank you&#8230; Is this where I&#8217;m supposed to press? Ehh, to register friends&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Press the icon in the upper right corner, and it will load the code.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s it&#8230; Yeah, that&#8217;s it, Mea-san, let me read it for you─&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to walk up to her with my phone in my hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe I was still a little nervous. Or maybe I was a little nervous because it was my first time to friend her on LINE.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, I…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch…!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped on the controller of the game console that I had left on the floor and reflexively pulled my foot back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This caused me to lose my balance and fall forward─</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Thud!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“KYAa….~!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lunged onto Mea-san, who was sitting on the edge of the bed, like I was pushing her down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Ahh….」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then&#8230; we both went completely stiff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like I was a dress, completely covering Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like Mea-san was thrown onto bed, facing up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our faces were so close to each other that they were almost touching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That alone was more than enough to take my breath away&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My hand was pressing down on her hand from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My leg was in between Mea-san&#8217;s knees .</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──To put it simply, it was as if I had attacked her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Neither of us could move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, my head was frozen in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you look at her from this distance, she is really cute and adorable. Her eyelashes are long and her nose is well-defined. Her lips are pink, just like a pretty girl&#8217;s lips.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she smells so good that it makes my heart ache. I&#8217;m sure you used the same shampoo yesterday, but it smells different than mine… Is this what you would call a ‘girl&#8217;s smell’?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the feel of her full b*****s against my chest, crushing it. The firmness of her underwear and the softness of her b*****s underneath are truly &#8220;b***s&#8221; like&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-Mea-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called her name awkwardly, as if I was mesmerized by her beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why I did it. Maybe it was an instinct&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then,  she─</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She closed her eyes shut and turned her face away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was red up to her ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;That was it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She could&#8217;ve flipped me off at any time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you doing?! She could have shouted at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She should have been frightened, just like she was when she saw my morning erection in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san just turned her red face away, closed her eyes, and stifled her breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Correct. It&#8217;s like she’s trying really hard to accept </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">something.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what? What is that </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">something?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a given in this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I&#8217;m just a kid, I&#8217;m going to be a junior high school student tomorrow. So this much I know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──You believe that you&#8217;re going to be attacked by me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu~~~&#8230;&#8230;!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a rush of heat in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it was not the heat of excitement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san, show me your face!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the heat of indignation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to do that!&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-bb053c840180d17b0c794cb32131d174 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-bb053c840180d17b0c794cb32131d174"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But… Uu&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that my words, lacking in explanation, still managed to reach her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She squeezed her eyes tighter and tighter, her voice like a mosquito&#8217;s.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We are… Newlyweds… Newlywed husband and wife… that&#8217;s why…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was a-afraid… in the morning&#8230; but I’m not anymore&#8230; because Mea is&#8230; pre-pre-prepared&#8230; that&#8217;s why I&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she shivered and opened her legs a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──I&#8217;m feeling hotter and hotter inside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to force yourself! I mean, you really don&#8217;t have to!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wh-Why&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t do it like this!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is a saying… it&#8217;s a shame for a man to not eat&#8230; the food he&#8217;s set to eat… Mea knows that much…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But still… ah!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn it! I was the one who asked her to show me her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She opens her eyes wide with a surprised gesture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In her eyes, I saw my face, which was as red as hers, looking desperate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Kuuya-san…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We need to get to know each other better before we do these things!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouted as I said that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had only been a day since I had met her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were just starting to get to know each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In such a relationship, there is something different about doing something erotic&#8230;. No, I thought it was unacceptable and&#8230; above all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We just graduated from elementary school, after all! We&#8217;re not ready for that kind of thing!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Kuuya&#8230;-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, Mea-san, you don&#8217;t have to be so determined&#8230;I&#8217;m sorry, I pushed you over&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, finally, I drew back from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my upper body and slowly moved away from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She remained as she was for a while, as if in a daze&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Uu&#8230;”</span></p><div class="zetro-81c2f559a14925c35a1815f206da6e22 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-81c2f559a14925c35a1815f206da6e22"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, a sudden feeling of embarrassment overcame her, and then she sat up, covering her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me-Mea… did it again!!&#8230; Embarrassing, IT’S EMBALLISING&#8230;!!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she wiggled her body and started to feel ashamed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is so cute. Just as I&#8217;ve seen her so many times before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mea made a quick decision by herself and decided on her own…  Mea&#8217;s dirty mind! EMBALLASING! Mouu~ no, how will I face Kuuya-shan~&#8230; uu~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was deeply relieved, along with my heart thumping for the first time there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, we&#8217;re still at this young age. It&#8217;s too early for us to be having s*x.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why the words that came out of my mouth were exactly what someone of the same age as mine would have said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mea-san, that’s why, please show me your face.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But~u~~&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mea-san is also embarrassed, I’m relieved to know that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ku… Kuuya… san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, she moved her hands away from her face and looked up at me with a fearful expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, you finally showed me your face… I’m glad…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuuya-san… don’t you think that… Mea, Mea is… an embarrassing girl&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve been as embarrassed as you are for a while now. I&#8217;m really embarrassed. Because I never thought this would happen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Phew… </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san took a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, lowering her eyelashes, she whispered with renewed embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Kuuya-san is truly… really a grown up….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ehh? No, hold on a second there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-why do you say so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s very mature of you to take such care… of me, and trying to calm me down. I can&#8217;t imitate that&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my opinion, what I just said came out of my own childishness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes. I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;m still a child, no matter how tall I try to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was used to being treated like a child by my friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m really happy that you called me a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">grown up….</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t know people could say I was a grown up without being tall.</span></p><div class="zetro-4a2d3edd50cea5dedadbb98c07a32278 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-4a2d3edd50cea5dedadbb98c07a32278"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How should I behave from now on&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gathered up the things I needed and headed home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she had promised on the way home, Mea-san carried some of my luggage for me, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ufufufu~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a feeling that it wasn&#8217;t just the fact that she was able to carry the luggage that made her seem so irresistibly happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But asking her, &#8220;Why do you look so happy?&#8221; I felt like it was a minefield to ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh~&#8230;well, let&#8217;s just drop by the bank and withdraw some money. It&#8217;s for living expenses for the time being.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… I&#8217;ll go with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san, who replied, was far from me, unlike how she usually walks with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Specifically, about three steps behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Why are you walking so far away from me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to ask that much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she became even happier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because that&#8217;s what wives are supposed to do~.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled, blushing, and responded in polite language.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is, is that so&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s all I could say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a tickling and tingling sensation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I&#8217;m glad to say that everything turned out okay, but&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(If you do that, I&#8217;ll be more conscious of you than ever&#8230;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san is really cute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that such a girl is my wife is amazing…</span></p>
