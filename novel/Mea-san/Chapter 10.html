<h3>Chapter 10 - Look Over Here! Mea-san.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, come in, Mea-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came back to the room with Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The room where we live.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll call Renjiyo-san and the others. So, Mea-san, please relax for the time being&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was when I turned around and tried to take out my phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;That’s not going to work.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san said politely, her eyelashes down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just as I was about to ask her what she she meant─</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What─ Ehh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think… Mou, I mean you should properly say out what you want to say, Mea-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There she sat down abruptly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sat neatly upright on the floor, her hands on her knees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I know this one. I think it&#8217;s called &#8220;three fingers&#8221; &#8230;It&#8217;s when a woman does the most polite and bowed gesture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Please listen to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bowed her head deeply and whispered to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I… didn&#8217;t know what to do, so I sat upright across from her and waited for her to speak.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slowly looked up and looked straight up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At first I just wanted to get away from… my parents.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Get away?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We have a very strict home, and every day was so cramped, so tight, so unbearable, that I always wanted to run out of the house&#8230; to get away&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I somehow can understand that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she had to live in that mansion with such parents, she would have felt suffocated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that she has been raised strictly and carefully can be seen in her elegant behavior, surprising innocence, and naivete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think it is not unreasonable for her to feel uncomfortable with that…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s when my father told me about&#8230; you. About you… and about your relationship with me. About the promise between your father and my father.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Hmmm”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I could somewhat understand her state of mind when she found out about such things</span></p><div class="zetro-adab1d58bf4a2d5668dbf6461472e20e zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-adab1d58bf4a2d5668dbf6461472e20e"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she was─</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was so so happy with that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just as I had imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She uttered it as if it was a confession of her sins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So it didn&#8217;t have to be you in particular&#8230; Just as long as I could leave home. If I could live a free life, anyone would have been fine.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said this in a truly tragic voice, casting the shadows of her long eyelashes around her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shook her head violently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her beautiful hair was now in a mess, but Mea-san didn&#8217;t care about that, and she continued to scream in a painful voice,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As I lived with you&#8230; I began to think more and more&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What─&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It has to be you and you only…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“──”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I choked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked straight at me, her cheeks flushed. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If… If I’m not with you, Kuuya-san, It’s even worse.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-Mea-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know if It&#8217;s love or something. But I was really happy when you came for me…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She whispered &#8211; and then she bowed deeply to me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why, I’m requesting you, Kuuya-san. Please let Mea stay here with you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As your&#8230; wife&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a chill. My body was hot again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed my heart&#8217;s desire and&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up, walked over and knelt down in front of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took her hand and whispered to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san, look over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The words I had said earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would reach her, and I already knew it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Kuuya-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure enough, she looked up at me, fearfully… but sure enough, she looked up at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I too have to say something to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled and looked at her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have learned a lot today&#8230; but the truth is, I&#8217;m still a kid in a lot of ways.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, ah, y-yes…? That’s, you know… like…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230; I&#8217;m going to work hard and become a real, grown-up man. I&#8217;m going to be a man worthy of being Mea-san&#8217;s husband.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa… ah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned bright red and her eyes widened, and I told her clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Mea-san. Please be my wife.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuya-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gasped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her face was getting redder and redder, even her ears&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But she didn&#8217;t cover it up anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, she was showing them to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yes! My dear!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She answered and smiled, it was as if a flower suddenly bloomed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahahah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu~~&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We naturally laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just like in the beginning, I was worrying and imagining, &#8216;What exactly is a newlywed life supposed to be like?&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Together, Mea-san and I laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, first, I called up Renrenjo-san with the contact info she gave me, and made a phone call.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“──Yes~ It’s Kobato!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyo-san answered right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, she left everything to me and went home…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about today. But it went well.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-2452d283ab9934e76d74669a6af20981 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-2452d283ab9934e76d74669a6af20981"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled and told her. And then…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I’m sorry my wife caused you guys such inconvenience.”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu!&#8230; HAHAHAH!”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyo-san laughed as if she suddenly saw a speaking monkey.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, now!&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haha&#8230; see you at school then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hung up the phone and looked at Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders to hide my embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I’m going to say the same thing to Fuuga and Sumitaro&#8230; You won&#8217;t mind it right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;~”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san was already all red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Ku-Kuuyasan~&#8230; thazhh not fruee… Mea is your wife… you are amazing… its embashishing to zay ith… but, but, but… yeah, Mea is Kuuya-shan’s wife…~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~~~~~!!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ShuShuShu!!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Owaa!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What happened all of a sudden? Mea-san started throwing shurikens in all directions!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiot! Idiot! Idiot!! Kuuya-san’s an idiot! Mea is so happy, Mea doesn’t know what to do!! AAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!~~~~~~~~~~~!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Calm down, calm down for now! Throwing shurikens is really dangerous!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ha… AHH mou~! Mea… can’t look at Kuuya-san now!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now she covered her face and began to wriggle her body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I thought to myself,</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t she just too cute?</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I laughed. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This is okay</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t say that, Mea-san. Look over here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Fuaahh….”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I giggled more and more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That night…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Kuuya-san… this is really embraissing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But… it feels really good, doesn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-yes, I can see your face, Kuuya-san… and you can see mine&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We faced each other in bed for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was intensely embarrassing and ticklish, but&#8230; it was a great experience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Haha”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufu~&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We laughed together again. We laughed at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why, after all. I felt like this was okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I never thought I would see a day like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah… It goes the same for me too. I never thought I&#8217;d see the day I sleep facing a beautiful girl like you, Mea-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That goes for me too… Kuuya-san, you are also wonderful! Of course, there&#8217;s still that childish part of yours&#8230; but your looks are really stylish and cool&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If we&#8217;re going to compare compliments, there will be no winner you know? Mea-san, your face is so elegant, and even among celebrities, there is no one as beautiful, lovely, and refined as you are&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-stop stop stop, It’s embashishing…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahaha. I think I crossed the line a little too far.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mou~&#8230; Fufufu~ that’s true. You know I’m too shy about such things…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I see, we&#8217;re not quite there yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So let&#8217;s be a real couple together, even if it&#8217;s just a little bit at a time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Mea-san&#8217;s cheeks were tinted red&#8230; But,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. I swear.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded her head in sincerity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laughed again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She laughed along with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you again, Mea-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you too, Kuuya-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s sleep.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I wonder if I could sleep&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-1be9c94f13efd79e6689d6648cee3a78 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-1be9c94f13efd79e6689d6648cee3a78"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Since we&#8217;re here together, do you want to sleep hand in hand?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whatt!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m just practicing for the future. I&#8217;d like to do more and more of that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Okay… If you say so, Kuuya-san…~&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned so red that I could see her even in the dim light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, my wife held on to my hand as hard as she could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was as if to say, &#8216;I won&#8217;t let you go.&#8217;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if to say, &#8220;This person is mine,&#8221; this time with a clear intention.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What exactly is a newlywed life supposed to be like?</span></i></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">I can answer that question now.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We just have to do it this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We can do it our way, little by little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mea-san, come on, look over here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yes&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is shy, but she is still cute.</span></p>
