<h3>Chapter 8 - Mea-san, It's my First Time Date But...</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In short, it&#8217;s about which one of us is better for Ku-kun! Right!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the station on the weekend. When we all gathered, Renjiyou-san-san was the first to speak to me, jumping up and down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is dressed in a cute and lively culotte skirt and knee socks. It suits her exquisitely, as she still has a strong sense of youthfulness about her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m going to put in my best effort today.&#8221; Said Fuuga. She is dressed in casual attire. Instead of the skirt she wore as her school uniform, she is dressed in a monotone shirt, accessories, and black ripped jeans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes! Let’s take a close look!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitaro responded, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay&#8221;. He is dressed in a T-shirt and half pants, showing his lack of interest in fashion even at the time like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have never heard of a date with spectators present before&#8230; Well, never mind.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m dressed up to a certain degree. I’m wearing my favorite tapered pants, a striped cut-and-sewn, and a jacket, which is my favorite &#8220;kirakaji-style&#8221; look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it doesn&#8217;t matter. Because Mea-san&#8217;s dress is wonderful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-As I said yesterday, this is what suits me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long-sleeved knit and flared skirt. Her appearance is elegant and graceful, giving off the impression of a &#8220;lady on holiday&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Mea-san is different from other girls… </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let&#8217;s get to i─tt!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Renjiyou-san suddenly hugs me with her arms wrapped around me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wai–! Renjiyou-san?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, today is our date, right? During a date, shouldn’t we at least do this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she says it like that, I can&#8217;t even raise an objection. I have no choice but to be embraced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But still, she is energetic right from the beginning, or rather, she&#8217;s being aggressive&#8230;! I must say that Renjiyou-san is indeed the best in my regard…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, so the first move has been taken by Kobato-chan. Well, this is just as I expected.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga placed one hand on her thin waist and nodded her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she glanced at Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is…  Is that the kind of petty thing one does on a first date…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga gave a stare to Mea-san as if to say “You too”. To which Mea-san hesitantly replied</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Besides, women say, &#8216;Take three steps back and don&#8217;t step on shadows.&#8217; To me, it feels wrong to do that… and it&#8217;s embarrassing&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The last part was said in a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then to address Mea-san, Fuuga snapped her fingers and said,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, that depends on the person. But one is showing aggressiveness, and the other is frightened. It does make a difference at this stage, though. Is that okay with you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she spread her arms wide. With that outfit and such a gesture, she really looks like a &#8220;classy and good-looking boy&#8221;. I envy her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-It&#8217;s not good, however&#8230; I can&#8217;t do something like that&#8230; I&#8217;ve never done it before&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu~ Everyone has their first time. But if that&#8217;s the case, I won&#8217;t blame you, I don&#8217;t like to be unfair.&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-8fd9f5f2111a8f5b06b5c617d970006a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-8fd9f5f2111a8f5b06b5c617d970006a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Fuuga said that, she gently put her hand on my arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh?! Wai-!? Fuuga!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It got its perk, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you saying!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahaha. well, I thought I&#8217;d set an example, or rather, teach Mea-chan the procedure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-What the h**l is that supposed to mean….&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, Mea-chan, you get it? It’s true that it is not very nice to have one&#8217;s arms around a gentleman in this way since our bodies would be in close contact with each other, and moreover, our b*****s would rub against him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tha-!!… Do-Don’t say that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried so hard not to be aware of that earlier!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she says it like that, it makes me wonder even more about it even if I don&#8217;t want to… Yeah, Renjiyou-san is flat, I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s still hard for me not to notice her b*****s&#8230; Yeah, Fuuga has been acting like a boy all this time, but she&#8217;s a girl after all… I can see her b*****s puffing up, even if only slightly&#8230;.!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not how a cool man would think!</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from that,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I know that. That’s why I can’t do things like that.” Mea-san is so desperate. Her face is already bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To her, Fuuga embraced me (along with Renjiyou-san) with her hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand that feeling. But you know what? I still want to feel the bond and be together, so I put my arms around him. I want to feel that this is a special time for both of us&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Correct Correct, Heyy~~ Fu-chan. We&#8217;re spending the day with the person we love~ right!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And from the other side, Renjiyou-san agreed. And furthermore, she hugged my arm even more tightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m doing this&#8230; </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Ehehehe</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">~&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, I know… I also get excited when I do something out of character like this&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes&#8230; I&#8217;m very, very excited. I want you to feel it, Ku-kun. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling about this&#8230;~♪&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So It seems. Surely I can tell, even if I don&#8217;t want to, that they are both excited!</span><span style="font-weight: 400">And even more than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oaa…&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s shameful, but I’m also really excited and nervous that I couldn&#8217;t stand it. I even made an involuntary moan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, because! I don&#8217;t have a choice! There&#8217;s something about being in close contact with a girl that makes them smell so good, I know! And what&#8217;s more, it&#8217;s so fluffy and soft!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So-So-So you&#8217;re also excited too, Ku-Ku-Ku-Kuuya-san!? You&#8217;re happy, aren&#8217;t you?! Furthermore, being in between Kobato-san and Fuuga-san! T-Two flowers in each hand!!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san&#8217;s face is bright red and she is in a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">WaWaWa</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> protest stance!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shameless! So shameless! Not only the two of you, but also Kuuya-san! I thought Kuuya-san was mature and could let this kind of thing slide!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uguu…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I-It&#8217;s so painful to hear you say that! I&#8217;ve been trying so hard to maintain my maturity in front of Mea-san, and now to have it fall apart at a place like this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I mean&#8230; ahh&#8230; we unnecessarily went through… the trouble of dating&#8230; and we also… did negotiations&#8230; Uwaa&#8230; But… Uwaa… I can&#8217;t&#8230; let&#8230; my breast rub against him&#8230;. It&#8217;s embarrassing&#8230; I&#8217;ll die&#8230;&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-a8a981b53f823caa313ecd3c7121b0a0 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a8a981b53f823caa313ecd3c7121b0a0"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san covered her face and started to get embarrassed, but she still has no intention of retracting her argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So unintentionally, I have to make excuses as if I&#8217;m trying to reason with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;N-no, Mea-san, you know what? It&#8217;s a kind of courtesy that we should be nervous! Because, you see, it would be rude for me not to be excited and nervous when the one who is doing such things is excited itself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san&#8217;s eyes widened a little and she fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-if that&#8217;s the case, it makes sense. but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she said that. Mea-san, you are too </span><span style="font-weight: 400">gullible</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">..! I was involuntarily impressed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I&#8217;m going to take this opportunity and repeat what I&#8217;ve said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-thank you, and you know what? When it comes to a date, I think it&#8217;s a man&#8217;s duty to escort a woman with his arm around her, and I personally feel that it&#8217;s also a part of being a gentleman&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… Ku-Kuuya-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san showed her shyness and shrank back with her cheeks tinted with a hint of embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… Sh-should I also do… things like… that…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Fuuga let go of my arm and fluttered her hand in the air.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After all, Kuuya is basically a boy who would like to take the lead.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is… Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He probably thinks, ‘As a cool adult, I should do something like this.’ Well, let&#8217;s just say he&#8217;s pushing himself to his limit at least.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Fuuga! Don&#8217;t say anything unnecessary!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t stand it and plunged into the convo. However,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that too much to ask? As far as I&#8217;m concerned, I think it&#8217;s rather necessary.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-What do you mean…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t you think it is pointless? Even after having a definite understanding about Kuuya, they say that ‘It has to be you’?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That may&#8230; be true, but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that&#8217;s just an ideology right? I think it&#8217;s a bit much to ask for that right from the start&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then Fuuga spread her hands wide again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So with that said, girls!! Follow me!! I&#8217;ve known Kuuya for a long time, so I know everything about him!</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga led everyone to the toy corner on the second floor of the shopping center that served as the station building earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, Kuuya, look at this. There&#8217;s your favorite Rider&#8217;s belt!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s true! So cool… Oii, Fuuga!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a jolt I rushed towards her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m over this now! After all, we&#8217;re junior highschool students now!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a little burning sensation in my cheeks, I whispered and pointed out that I am concerned about Mea-san and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, it’s true that I used to love tokusatsu in the past. However, I decided to stop watching them after I graduated from elementary school, because I thought it was wrong to do so forever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because that&#8217;s the way it should be. This is kind of childish&#8230; It isn&#8217;t appropriate for a cool, grown man to have such likings&#8230;.No, I mean, I still want to see it, but I think I need to be patient…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think you have to hate what you like. At least I know you like this kind of thing. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga shrugged with one hand and looked at me as if to say &#8216;Good Grief.&#8217; Then she turned her attention to Mea-san and Renjiyou-san who were standing beside her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuya used to love to play with me. Sumitaro used to play as the monster, and I used to play as the enemy leader.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh… I-I see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha, you&#8217;re just like a boy!&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-f51ef4e02c870a4b6c68dcabf25dd40d zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f51ef4e02c870a4b6c68dcabf25dd40d"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Heyy, Fuuga, please&#8230;&#8230; stop&#8230;&#8230; Please stop revealing my black history in front of Mea-san and Renjiyou-san&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a fun memory for us. Well, Kuuya is like this now, but he had that childish side of him too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, Thank you for telling me all that, Fu-chan! Ko-kun, you really don&#8217;t have to worry about it. In fact, I&#8217;m glad to know that you had a time like that too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyou-san said so with an angelic smile. Is she an Angel? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you Renjiyou-san… That helps a lot…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehehehe~~”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Mea-san looked around at the toys in the lineup with a curious look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;N-never knew there were so many good looking action figures.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh, You also think like that, Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken aback by her unexpected words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t really understand them, but&#8230; anyway, Kuuya-kun liked this kind of thing right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U….!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">T-tthat </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I can&#8217;t really understand them but’</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is a bit damaging….!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s kind of embarrassing that I liked something Mea-san didn&#8217;t understand&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufufu~.This boy side of yours is so cute.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyou-san laughed at it, rather happily.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san didn&#8217;t answer and stood silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, that&#8217;s the look that says she doesn’t know what I&#8217;m talking about&#8230; Maybe…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well! Then let&#8217;s continue on to the next one!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Fuuga, paying no attention to this, said smilingly in the same tone as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next stop was a clothing store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuuya, you said you wanted those pants right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I caught sight of the damaged skinny pants worn by the mannequin in the store, Fuuga winked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah&#8230; they are really nice. It&#8217;s perfect for a cool man&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Kuuya&#8217;s size doesn&#8217;t seem to be the same, though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tch&#8230;! I-I&#8217;ll grow taller and be able to put them on!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuuya is very slender. I think it would look good on you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohh, Really? Really? I knew that, Yes…!”</span></p><div class="zetro-134a3dd213ab21efc320eb611d8fbc80 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-134a3dd213ab21efc320eb611d8fbc80"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think about t*t, Mea-chan and Kobato-chan?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga is the one who is pulling us along at her own pace, but she never forgets to talk to Mea-san and the others.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes~, I think it&#8217;ll look good on you! Ku-kun! I hope you will be able to wear them soon~!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyou-san smiled and answered immediately. Again, is she an angel&#8230;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ku-kun&#8217;s taste, remember it. For the future… Ehehe~&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she chuckled a little shyly when she said that. More and more like an angel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Mea-san looked at the mannequin sullenly, raising her eyebrows,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If I wear something with holes on it like this, I&#8217;d look sloppy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a few words, she cast away the idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“B-But that&#8217;s the point, isn&#8217;t it?! Isn&#8217;t it cool?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I prefer a neat appearance.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duh, why can&#8217;t you understand the love behind manufacturing these damaged jeans&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Do you like this kind of thing, Kuuya-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yea, I guess…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are the kind of clothes Fuuga usually wore (and today too she wore such.) They are smart, cool, classy, and good-looking. I would love to wear them too. When I grow taller.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then no Idea why, Fuuga winked at Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mea-chan, in times like this, isn&#8217;t it a lady&#8217;s duty to make her Mister feel good?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Mea-san gave a difficult look,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I see… Is that how it works?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At least, that&#8217;s what I did for Kuuya.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wai-Wait a minute, Fuuga. So you&#8217;re saying you thought it would look good on me even though you didn&#8217;t really think so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s leave it at that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.Muu-”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san raised her eyebrows more and more, comparing me with the skinny pants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yeah… It… looks good… If I take a closer look….”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh…? Me-Mea-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a flash, she covered her face.</span></p><div class="zetro-c93e8206fda636d8916bb6fdc561124a zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-c93e8206fda636d8916bb6fdc561124a"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn&#8217;t look good! I can&#8217;t lie after all!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even though all you say all day is ‘It’s a secret.’ ?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not something I lied about. I only hide it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh… She said it herself… I only hide it….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“HA…..! I&#8217;m going off the mark again… Mou~ I&#8217;m an idiot, why am I like this&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, now. Let&#8217;s move on then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Mea-san was twisting and turning her body, Fuuga kept her happy tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, when the window shopping was over, it was just about lunchtime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s try this place out shall we? Kuuya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yes… As you wish.’”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga chose a slightly trendy coffee shop with a modern Japanese atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew the coffee shop was here because I&#8217;ve passed by it before, but I’ve never been inside. I was in elementary school, after all&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now, I&#8217;m not! Yes, I&#8217;m in Junior High, I have money, and I&#8217;m dating!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, I can also enjoy Kuuya&#8217;s favorite coffee.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh&#8230; that&#8217;s a good place for me too&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you two fine with this place, Mea-chan and Kobato-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I&#8217;ll leave it to you. I don&#8217;t know much about such shops.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This place is okay for me~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Then it&#8217;s settled then. Well then, Kuuya─&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, Please go ahead.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I raised my hand and brushed my hair up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fuuga nodded smilingly and entered the restaurant without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hahaha, ladies first, right? Ku-kun, you&#8217;re such a gentleman~!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyo-san laughed carefreely and followed Fuuga into the store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But─ the other remaining lady, Mea-san, stood there hesitantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What’s wrong? Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m waiting for you, Ku-Kuuya-san, to go in f-first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, no, Mea-san, you go in first. As Renjiyou-san said earlier, ladies first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d rather follow you, Kuuya-san, from three steps back, and I will enter once I make sure it is safe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Is that a ninja-like habit?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s a secret.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, I see… Well, if that&#8217;s what you want to do, I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to go first and enter the coffee shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At times like this, I wish it was decided by the ‘ladies first’ thing… but as a man…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know but for some reason Fuuga understands me. Always unconcerned, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p><div class="zetro-9bed2c4db3799b268d45cb685136effe zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-9bed2c4db3799b268d45cb685136effe"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say… Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Kuuya-san, do you prefer girls who act like Fuuga-san and Kobato-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that&#8217;s… right, how should I put it…?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a little at a loss for an answer. Well, I’m certainly more grateful to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-Mea-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t know…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned her head away with a pout and eventually entered the store first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">….Huh? Is she responding to my desire for &#8216;Ladies First&#8217;?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uumu.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitaro, who had not said a word (or even had a presence) before, crossed his arms and growled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, he has only been sitting back and watching us go through the motions until now…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhmm… Sumitarou?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to take the initiative to get into it at such times! I see… ladies first… that&#8217;s the secret to being popular…! I&#8217;ll keep that in mind&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is beyond unimportant at this point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I entered the restaurant shoulder to shoulder with Sumitaro. Probably due to the number of people in the restaurant, the table was separated into two.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Kun~ Here here~~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m with Sumitaro, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hehe. I guess I&#8217;ll drink coffee with fuuga, sssccarrryyyy~!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitaro went to sit with Fuuga, and I naturally went to the seat where Mea-san and Renjiyo-san were already sitting side by side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-Kuuya-san, you’ll drink coffee right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I sat down, Mea-san cut to the chase. It was so quick that it was almost as if she wanted to say, &#8220;I know everything about Kuuya-san!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And top of that, black coffee right~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wow~, Ku-kun, you’re a grown up~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; also, I&#8217;m used to drinking──”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t you take it easy today and have your usual cream soda?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muguu….!?!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Fuuga pointed it out from the seat behind me, and I choked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wai..! Fuuga, you…!”</span></p><div class="zetro-a4c1002b9789273a6f263ba32f1e7836 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-a4c1002b9789273a6f263ba32f1e7836"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The usual cream soda?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san tilted her head in a questioning manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, no, that was just a joke by Fuuga.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You said the other day that you are still not used to drinking black coffee, but yet you are doing your best to master how to drink it. But you don&#8217;t have to go overboard today okay? It&#8217;s a day to let them get to know you, after all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-Then, Kuuya-san&#8230; have you been forcing yourself to drink black coffee until now&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, no, Mea-san, I told you so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, that Fuuga really went the extra mile! All my efforts are going down the drain!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What would Mea-san think of me if she found out that I&#8217;m actually just a kid who still likes cream soda and…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I knew it! She’s in shock!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the other hand,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also wuv it~~♪♪ Soda Cream~♪♪ Then, Ku-kun, let’s order it.” Renjiyo-san not only smiled, but also agreed with the idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is it okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean, &#8216;Is it okay?&#8217;, if you like it, you should drink what you like, is what I think. I mean, cream soda is something even a lot of adults drink, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-IS THAT SO…?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I-I didn&#8217;t know that! Somehow I feel incredibly forgiven!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll have a soda cream, too!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“YES! YAY!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brushed my bangs up and made my order in a way full of swag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh man, I&#8217;m so happy! I mean, it&#8217;s so fun! I don&#8217;t have to waste time trying to leave a good impact!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">── By any chance, Fuuga, was this your goal from the beginning?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since I started junior high school, I&#8217;ve been able to notice that I&#8217;ve been putting up a false front…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so &#8230;.I appreciate this response from Renjiyou-san very much──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the other hand, Mea-san was getting a bit upset, so I pulled myself together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuuya-san… to have a black coffee like an adult… In front of me… that’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, no, like I said, Mea-san, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;It means you weren&#8217;t being true to yourself in front of &#8230;me&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8212;&#8212;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s true, in a way.</span></p><div class="zetro-eb6952b02df51575a5eeff9fb3bef4b9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-eb6952b02df51575a5eeff9fb3bef4b9"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Renjiyo-san called out to Mea-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you think that it was a very bad thing to do, I’ll take Ku-kun, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She suddenly said the most outrageous things!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku…Kuuya-san is the person I need!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me-Mea-san…!!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but get struck by those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Ahhh~!” As soon as Mea-san said it, she covered her face, Mea-san being Mea-san.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wow, Mea just said something amazing, Uuu~~, Mea is so embarrassed, so embarzzesd~~ Mea is an idziot UuuuUU~~~~~~!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That goes for me, too.&#8221; Seeing her in such a state, Fuuga smiled and murmured mysteriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After lunch, we left the restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The p-pancakes were good, weren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-yeah&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Things got awkward between us when we were at the front of the restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was because Mea-san had become extremely quiet since our conversation when we entered the restaurant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clearly, she was concerned about something. It goes without saying──</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-kun~”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just then, Renjiyou-san jumped into my arms again with a big smile on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she looked up at me with her big, sparkling eyes and said</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you~ Let’s hang out again some time, shall we~?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew she would say something like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised that she was so happy about something as trivial as that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t even care that I ordered something like cream soda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was very gratifying, and at the same time, it made my heart warm…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Say, Ku-kun. If things just went like this… can we… hold hans… like lovers do…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“EHH!?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This dominance is, how can I put it, irresistible!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyou-san pressed her cheek against my arm and glanced sideways at Mea-san, and then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cause, It looks like you can’t have such moments with Me-chan, It seems…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san then gritted her teeth at those provocative words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she turned her attention to my other arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-holding h-hands like l-lovers… this is what you mean right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she asked Renjiyou-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then Renjiyou-san held my hand using both of her hands and showed it to Mea-sam,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You see, you hold each other&#8217;s hands like this. Then you can feel the body warmth from the palms of his hands. It&#8217;s a great feeling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So… W-we hold hands… then, then do that?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you are a couple, you can do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ku-kuuya-san and I are already married, so we don&#8217;t have to do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oya Oya~~, you&#8217;ve got the wrong idea.”</span></p><div class="zetro-021d66eb4237743334d08f749a67bf22 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-021d66eb4237743334d08f749a67bf22"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Fuuga, who had been silently watching the situation, interrupted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The next stage of being a lover is a married couple, Usually. So I think it&#8217;s more of a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Thing-to-do&#8217;</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> thingy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is… Is that how it is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, Mea-san was very dumbfounded in this regard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But it&#8217;s too embarrassing&#8230; to do such an embarrassing thing&#8230; such as leaning against the arm and then, pressing b*****s against it, and then interwinding&#8230; the hands together like this, it&#8217;s too embarrassing, and it&#8217;s too much&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;If that’s how you feel, then I guess it’s fine if I do it with Ku-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san froze, as if shocked by Renjiyou-san&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, Renjiyou-san looked up at me again, and-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So I&#8217;ll do it okay&#8230;? Can I do it, Ku-kun&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, no… that’s…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;d like to do it with Kuuya, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even you Fuuga!?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m a girl, too, in spite of the fact that I look like a boy, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have no idea what that means! What the heck is Fuuga trying to do!!!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And&#8230; What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During this date, I gradually came to understand many of Renjiyou-san&#8217;s good points, which I had always been overwhelmed by. I was beginning to like her. I was even thinking that if I became friends with a girl like her, I would probably be able to spend every day in a carefree and enjoyable way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Fuuga, too. I was annoyed by all the things she exposed about me, but at the same time, it was a process of reaffirming the comfort of a person I knew well. I felt that Fuuga understood me after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But. But&#8230; I…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“IF… If that’s how it’s gonna be… Then, I’ll do it!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san clasped her hands on her chest and proclaimed as such, leaning forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because I, I, I am Kuuya-san&#8217;s bride!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was Mea-san&#8217;s gesture when she was at her most enthusiastic state.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she walked up to my side and looked at my arm as if she were glaring at it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a tremendous sense of hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, she seemed determined and took my arm- but just before she did so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I… I-I… I…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san’s face, which was normally red, turned more red…</span></p><div class="zetro-f69940a92cc159980fd4354f76742c46 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-f69940a92cc159980fd4354f76742c46"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she raised her hands, slowly but steadily…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“~!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And eventually her hands almost hid her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Mea-san shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t do it!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me-Mea-san…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t go that far, I can&#8217;t, like how Kotoba-san did it, I, I, I, I&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san covered her face and shook her head vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m extremely sorry Kuuya-san! I am not qualified enough to be your wife…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah wai-&#8230; Mea-san!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going home! I&#8217;m giving up on everything&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">…She went running.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ “ “&#8230;.” “ “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of us were standing there… looking at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Oi. That was some crazy turn of events.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first to break the silence was Sumitaro, who had been watching the situation all this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think you provoked her a little too much, Kobato-paisen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well&#8230; this was like a match for me&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Renjiyou-san took her hand off my arm and raised her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But&#8230; I might have been getting on her nerves. I knew that Me-chan couldn&#8217;t do this kind of thing, so I said to her,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400"> what If I do it then</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Renjiyou-san&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;I think it was like that for me too&#8230; I guess I got a little carried away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean? Fu-chan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know Kuuya better than anyone else, you know&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;Fuuga&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, Fuuga was jealous because of that too. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s what she meant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But… Right now… It doesn’t matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230; what are you going to do now, Kuuya?”</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Good Grief,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> Sumitaro folded his arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-What do you mean&#8230;?&#8221;</span></p><div class="zetro-272b2c87f693d4991b700a1f3de8edd9 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-272b2c87f693d4991b700a1f3de8edd9"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, you know, she went back to her parents&#8217; house!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;ve won, you know? Kobato-chan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes&#8230; I was a little silly today&#8230; because I was the one who told Me-chan she was being silly&#8230; and I acted like I was doing better than her&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, that goes for me, too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s exactly what was going through my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mea-san, she was so resistant to doing this kind of thing with me that it caused her to run off on her own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words… We are not that close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, wasn’t it obvious.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there Sumitaro nodded his head with his arms crossed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You and Mea-san, you&#8217;ve hardly improved your relations yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Su-Sumitaro…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The actuality is that you can do such things with Fuuga, for example, because you guys have known each other for a long time. Besides, if you are as aggressive as Kobato-paisen, it is not impossible to accumulate a lot of things in a short period of time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, yeah… but…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. But it would be absurd to ask Mea-san to do the same thing, isn’t that what you wanna say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sumitaro.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m just saying, Kuuya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh? Y-yeah…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitaro grinned, and, with his arms crossed, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is the kind of situation where you get the chance to show that you are a man, ya know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you still want to continue your relationship with Mea-san, that is&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Su-&#8230;Sumitaro.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitaro clenched his fist and addressed it to me. Then he said aggressively, </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you&#8217;re a man, this is no time to act cool!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“───”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt my spine straighten up.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Sumitaro is right. Nothing will be resolved or progressed if I&#8217;ll just stand here.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And most of all&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to end my relationship with Mea-san!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I still don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s what love is&#8230; I have to be a man</span></p><div class="zetro-98c87e89f6b7c84f6e1a1f28f4a1b4b8 zetro-adsense-ads" id="zetro-98c87e89f6b7c84f6e1a1f28f4a1b4b8"></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thanks Sumitaro, you&#8217;re right&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;hmmm&#8230;. it&#8217;s not only Fuuga who&#8217;s cool and good looking, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! Sumitaro, you are cool too! I have to learn from you! ─And you too Renjiyo-san!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yeah. Uhmm…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400">
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mea-san, I’m coming!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku-kun, see ya─”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah&#8230;!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I brushed my hair up and nodded back, not coolly but enthusiastically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will bring Mea-san back!”</span></p>
