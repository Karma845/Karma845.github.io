<p class="calibre4">"Ah...... Sorry, it's just a little hard to call out to you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, I guess you have the point." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Letting out a dry laugh, he took his shoes out of his shoebox.</p><p class="calibre4">His face was slightly pained with a hint of guilt.</p><p class="calibre4">"That...... you're as popular as ever, ain't you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I wonder....... I'm not doing anything unusual, tho." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Well, yeah. Kakihara just lived a normal life. This guy was a saint at heart and treated people kindly by default.</p><p class="calibre4">And on top of that, he had a good face. If I were a woman, I would have nothing but good impressions of him. Well, I don't think I would fall in love with him because the high competition is too much trouble.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, Rintaro. Can we talk a little now?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"What?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I have a little something I wanted to consult with you...... It's about Azusa." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">My shoulders reacted with a jerk.</p><p class="calibre4">Now I was sensitive to that name.</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Sorry, I have a previous appointment. Can we do this later in the summer break?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I-I see. Then I guess I don't have a choice. Then....... let me just say this. I have made up my mind." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara turned to me with a very serious face.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm, going to ask Azusa out on a date, just the two of us." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">――――Aah, is that so. EEEEH.</p><p class="calibre4">Since he said it with such a serious face, I thought he had made up his mind to confess his feelings.</p><p class="calibre4">He seemed to be a shy person to begin with, so it was probably a very big step for him to have made this decision. Apologies, but I'm not really that interested.</p><p class="calibre4">"I-it's finally, yes." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeah. We'll be busy with exams next year, and I figured this was my only chance." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"I agree. Yuusuke and Nikaido-san seem to be aiming for a pretty top college." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not so, but Azusa seems to be aiming pretty top one....... I hope we can go to the same college." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Whoaa, this guy was madly in love with her.</p><p class="calibre4">The youth in the very front of my eyes was so dazzling that it made my head dizzy, as I had no tolerance for such things.</p><p class="calibre4">I really wished he would do it somewhere else. Please do it somewhere else.</p><p class="calibre4">"Do your best, Yuusuke-kun. I'll be rooting for you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh, thank you. I'm going to get some lunch then. I'll go ahead." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yea. See you again." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">After changing his shoes, Kakihara walked straight out the front door.</p><p class="calibre4">As I watched his back with a sigh, someone tapped me on the shoulder from behind.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, sorry to keep you waiting. Were you talking to someone?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? Ah, Yukio, huh. As you saw, I was talking to Kakihara not too long ago." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I indicated Kakihara's back with my chin as he headed toward the school gate.</p><p class="calibre4">"Come to think of it, you two have been pretty close since the cooking class, haven't you, Rintaro?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"Close, huh? It might seem that way from the outside......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"? Is it really different?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"Not really. I don't mean to treat him badly, but we haven't really had a chance to get to know each other yet. It's a little awkward to say we're close." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">No matter how much Kakihara treated me as a friend, I couldn't treat him that way. I never said it out loud, but I felt a little bad about it.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm not comfortable with being honest with others. Even without being told, I knew that my personality was never good. And I have no intention of going out of my way to change it to fit in with others.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't want to be disillusioned by people's expectations of me.</p><p class="calibre4">I'd rather remain put a facade than go through all the trouble.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, let's just leave it at that. Do you mind if we study at my place?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eeh, that should be my lines. Is it okay if I intrude?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"I've never had a chance to invite you to my new house. I'll prepare you a lunch." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yaay, right in time, I was just hungry." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">I took Yukio back to the apartment.</p><p class="calibre4">Standing in front of my new apartment for the first time, Yukio was stunned by its size.</p><p class="calibre4">"Is this the kind of place you're living in ......? Isn't the rent pretty expensive too......?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"There' s been a bit of a situation...... I'll tell you about it sometime." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I knew that I would eventually have to tell Yukio about my relationship with Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">She also told the two MilSta's what was going on. That was because Mia and Kanon are her irreplaceable friends, and for me, it was Inaba Yukio.</p><p class="calibre4">I felt uncomfortable keeping this secret from him.</p><p class="calibre4">After inviting him into the room, Yukio began to look around.</p><p class="calibre4">He exhaled reassuringly as he found furniture that had been in my previous house and was finally convinced that it was my house.</p><p class="calibre4">"I feel safer when I see things that I know. It's so different from before, it made me nervous for a moment." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"I couldn't get used to it for a while either. Ah yeah, is it okay to have Stir-fried Udon Noodles for lunch? I can make this in no time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yep. I have no problem." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then you can wait on the couch." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I headed to the kitchen and take out the udon noodles, scallions, pork, and cabbage that I had purchased in advance.</p><p class="calibre4">I cut each into bite-sized pieces and sauteed them together in a frying pan. Seasoned with soy sauce and dashi stock, and added salt and pepper to taste.</p><p class="calibre4">"Here it is!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Whoaa! Thank you!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">I places a bowl of freshly made stir-fried udon noodles in front of Yukio, who was very excited.</p><p class="calibre4">I sat down next to him and said, "Let's dig in," and moved my chopsticks.</p><p class="calibre4">"Let's dig in~! ――――Mmmm~! Delicious!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm glad to hear that. It's been a while since I made you a meal." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I guess so. I missed a little." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, hey...... don't say that in a creepy way." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">After we both slurped our udon, we set about our assignment as originally planned.</p><p class="calibre4">Of all the assignments, solving a math problem set was the simplest and most time-consuming. If we were going to finish it first, we would start with this one.</p><p class="calibre4">The only sound was the crunching sound of the mechanical pencil.</p><p class="calibre4">Neither Yukio nor I had bad grades in mathematics, so we were able to continue solving the problems without any particular stumbling blocks. So, when we get to this point, it was just a simple task. Only occasionally, when something difficult like an applied problem appeared, we consulted with each other――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, Yukio. About this one." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Aah, you can do it this way......." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">And thus, if I asked Yukio, he'd immediately tell me how to solve it.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, Yukio was not so lenient as to tell me the answer, so I had to solve the problem by myself after he taught me the method.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, there might be some friendliness, but it was honestly easier to understand than a bad teacher.</p><p class="calibre4">We spent a few hours working on each other's assignments in this way.</p><p class="calibre4">As the sun began to set, we put down our mechanical pencils and exhaled at about the same time.</p><p class="calibre4">"I think we've made a lot of progress. I've already finished the math, and I've solved a lot of the classic literature problems." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're right. Just in time. Let's take a break. Want a cup of coffee?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Can I have?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"Of course. I'm already out of energy drinks." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I didn't think I could take too much caffeine, but once I got over this point, the rest of my summer break would be nothing but fun.</p><p class="calibre4">I followed my brain's sugar craving and mixed milk and sugar into the drink I normally drank black.</p><p class="calibre4">Yukio preferred less milk and less sugar. I took the coffee, brewed it just as I remembered, and put it on the table.</p><p class="calibre4">"It's very generous of you. Thank you." (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're teaching me about small, difficult subjects, and we're both here to help. So, what do you want to do today?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What do I want to do?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"I was thinking of staying the night. After one night of cramming, the assignments will be almost done, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, are you okay......?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"As long as it's okay at your place. We can play a game or something when we get lazy with the assignments." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Y-yep!" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">Yukio smiled, looking rather happy.</p><p class="calibre4">Although we had been together at school recently, we rarely spent time together after school because I had been spending time for Rei. So at least on the first day of summer break, it would be nice to spend some time together for a long time.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Besides.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, you're looking a little pale....... Are you okay?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? Y-yeah. No problem." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That so?" (Yukio)</p><p class="calibre4">Close call, close call. Did it show on my face?</p><p class="calibre4">I turned on my phone screen and check the date and day of the week.</p><p class="calibre4">Today was Friday, which meant tomorrow was Saturday, of course.</p><p class="calibre4"><b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">[Would you like to go out to dinner with me this Saturday? ......I'd like to hear why you were with Otosaki-san at the aquarium.]</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">Yes, tomorrow was the day of my appointment with Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre4">I will need some peaceful time with Yukio to get over this melancholy.</p><p class="calibre4">(Sorry, Yukio......)</p><p class="calibre4">I apologized in my heart for taking the liberty of treating him as a refreshment.</p></div>
