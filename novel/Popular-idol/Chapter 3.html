<p class="calibre4">Why am I at this place right now?</p><p class="calibre4">I have been thinking about that since a while ago.</p><p class="calibre4">Spread out in front of me are happy people with their bare skin exposed and a vast, crystal-clear swimming pool.</p><p class="calibre4">Basking in the painful summer sun, I'm already beginning to regret my decision to come here.</p><p class="calibre4">"Whaddya think? Yuusuke! Rintaro! My well-trained body beauty!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yes, yes. It's embarrassing, so please calm down, Ryuuji." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Standing by the pool with me are Doumoto Ryuuji and Kakihara Yuusuke, classmates of mine.</p><p class="calibre4">Today is the day they invited me to the pool.</p><p class="calibre4">I got to come to this huge facility with numerous swimming pools after I finished showing off my swimsuit to Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">"Doumoto-ku――――no, Ryuuji-kun is in the judo club, right? I guess they train in different ways." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"For a homecoming club member, Rintaro is pretty solid too. Why don't you join the judo club?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, I'm not very good at competitive sports." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I softly decline an invitation from Doumoto, who has been posing there frequently since a while ago.</p><p class="calibre4">It's not that I don't want to join because it's judo or anything like that.</p><p class="calibre4">I have a part-time job under Yuzuki-sensei, and now I have to take care of Rei in addition to that. There are a lot of reasons why I can't participate in club activities.</p><p class="calibre4">"Even so, Azusa and Honoka are late......." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, I guess it can't be helped. I have heard that it takes women a long time to get ready." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Indeed......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">We have already changed into our swimsuits and are waiting for the girls to come out of the changing room at the poolside.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, those girls are Nikaido Azusa and Nogi Honoka.</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh, here they come!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">Hearing Doumoto's voice, I look up to see two familiar faces coming out of the changing room.</p><p class="calibre4">Next to me, I can feel Kakihara fawning over them.</p><p class="calibre4">"S-sorry to keep you waiting." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry! It took me so long to put on sunscreen!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido is wearing a light blue and white frilly bikini. While Nogi is wearing a yellow off-the-shoulder bikini.</p><p class="calibre4">Both of them look very good, partly because of the swimsuits.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara must have been especially impressed by them.</p><p class="calibre4">"Y-you look good, Azusa." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see.......? Thank you, I feel a little relieved." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Beside Nikaido, who is patting her chest in relief, Nogi raises her voice.</p><p class="calibre4">"Eeh? Only Azurin!? What about me, me!?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"O-of course! Honoka looks good too." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Kehkehkeh, right?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">Despite her urging, Nogi also seems to be in a good mood after being praised by Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre4">In fact, Kakihara's feelings are probably not false at all.</p><p class="calibre4">However, his gaze has been drawn towards Nikaido for some time now. How easy to understand――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"Shi...... Shidou-kun!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I have a bad feeling about this, and I turn my gaze toward Nikaido who called me.</p><p class="calibre4">With a rather embarrassed expression on her face, she was nervously fidgeting her hands.</p><p class="calibre4">"Does this, suit me......?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"A-aah! Yes, it suits you very well. The fluttering frills are so cute." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"!! I'm so glad...... I had no idea what Shidou-kun liked, so I was really worried." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Stop it, you idiot. Don't say that here. Kakihara's looking at me with a terrible look on his face.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey you guys! Let's have a race in that pool over there!" (Doumoto)</p><p class="calibre4">Doumoto, you seriously are not paying attention to the surrounding, huh.</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay! The one who loses buys yakisoba from the food stall!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh! Sounds nice! Let's do!" (Doumoto)</p><p class="calibre4">Why, I don't want to do it.</p><p class="calibre4">The two guys who are motivated don't care about the rest of us and head for the 25-meter pool.</p><p class="calibre4">The three of us were awkwardly left behind, but if this is going to happen, I should go join Doumoto and Kakihara, even if I don't want to.&nbsp; I'm sure Nikaido, who is not very good at sports, will stay here, so I can leave her alone with Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then I'll also――――." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Whenever I hear the word "competition,"...... I kind of feel like joining in." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"What......!? Hey!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ryuuji! Honoka! Wait!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Idioooooootttt! Why are you leaving, Kakihara?</p><p class="calibre4">Don't you want to be alone with Nikaido!? Don't you want to appeal to her!?</p><p class="calibre4">I won't say what, but maybe those are what you're after, Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre4">"......He's gone." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah...... He is. Nikaido-san, why don't you go join them?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I can't swim very fast,so I'll pass. If I can ride the waterslide or something later, that's fine. What about you, Shidou-kun?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"I am, let's see." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I look at Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre4">If I want to keep my distance from her, I should join their competition here. However, I can't bear to leave her alone, as she doesn't seem to be very strong-minded.</p><p class="calibre4">I have a strange concern because I have recently seen someone being picked on in front of me.</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't want to leave Nikaido-san alone, So I'll stay with you here. I don't particularly like competition either." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh!? Yu...... You're so kind, Shidou-kun." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Is it? I think it's just normal." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I don't like it being praised to this degree.</p><p class="calibre4">When I saw Rei getting tangled up with a couple of guys, I learned that under no circumstances should a woman be left alone, if at all possible. Of course, this only applies when there are many other people around.</p><p class="calibre4">"Nikaido-san, you don't seem to be able to say no very strongly when someone tries to pick you up." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ahaha...... I guess you're right. I'm a bit weak when it comes to pushy people, and I often got approached on my way home from cram school. At times like that, Kakihara-kun, who was in the same cram school as me, protected me." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Heeh, so you two went to the same cram school." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yes. The reason we have been close since the first grade is that we went to the same cram school together." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">So that's it.</p><p class="calibre4">Hearing this, it seems that Kakihara has been blessed with an excellent environment. In the end, he may just be unable to take advantage of the opportunities that come his way.</p><p class="calibre4">"So Yuusuke-kun is a prince to Nikaido-san." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I think that's different." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">――――I see.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"A-anyway! The three of them seem to be betting on the yakisoba, so why don't we at least prepare drinks for them? I don't know what they like, so can I ask Nikaido-san to choose?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, certainly. Shidou-kun is very thoughtful after all." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hahaha, it's a normal thing. Normal." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Smiling deceptively, I head toward the stalls with Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre4">We bought Cokes for Doumoto and Nogi, and a Ramune for Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre4">Incidentally, Nikaido did not know Kakihara's liking. As for this fact, I'm going to take it to my grave.</p><p class="calibre4">"Damn! I lost!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ya~y! You're ten years too fast to try to beat this Honoka-sama!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">As we're heading back to the 25-meter pool with the drinks in our hands, we hear a voice saying that the game has just ended.</p><p class="calibre4">It seems that Nogi has won. As expected of Nogi, who is second only to Rei in bringing excitement out of the students in the physical education class every time.</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, Azusa and Rintaro...... where have you been?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara, noticing our presence, asks us anxiously.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, maybe this guy is more of clumsy than I thought.</p><p class="calibre4">"I bought you guys some drinks. You see, it's said it's easy to get dehydrated in the pool, right? I want you guys to take proper breaks." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh? You two are so thoughtful! Thanks!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">I hand over drinks to each of them as they come up to the poolside.</p><p class="calibre4">After swimming as hard as they could, they drank down the drinks we have bought for them with what appeared to be delightful relish.</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew! This brings me back to life!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Soda after exercise is the best!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">Doumoto and Nogi exclaimed.</p><p class="calibre4">To be honest, drinking a carbonated beverage after a strenuous workout is not something to be praised, but I didn't go out of my way to push my body to the limit, so I'm not going to be a jerk about it.</p><p class="calibre4">"Anyway, what's going to happen in the end? Me and Yuusuke are buying yakisoba for Honoka?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Isn't that a little naive? How about we buy yakisoba for Azurin and Shidou since they bought us the drinks?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ugh, but surely that's fair enough...... no choice then! Because the loser has no right to have a say!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">In the blink of an eye, our lunch money is going to fly away.</p><p class="calibre4">So the yakisoba is more expensive than the juice cost, and I get the gain on this one. I'll go along with this as it is. Don't call me a cheapskate, okay.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm fine with you buying me a drink. We'll think about yakisoba again at lunchtime." (Yuu</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmmm, maybe a flowing swimming pool? There is one over there." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara and Nogi are just about to wrap up the conversation when I say, "Ah," as if I have just remembered.</p><p class="calibre4">"Speaking of which, Nikaido-san said she wanted to go on the water slide. If there's no particular request from everyone else, how about we go for it first?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, really?" (Yuusuke)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kakihara looks at Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre4">She looks at me a little surprised, but then she scratches her cheek in embarrassment when she realizes that she's being watched.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not much of a swimmer, so I thought it would be nice to have something like that to play with." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Alright! Then we'll go to the waterslide first! Le's get going there now!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Are you sure?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Of course! Ryuuji and Honoka are okay with it too, right?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">He asks, and they both respond with nods enthusiastically.</p><p class="calibre4">Alright, the situation itself is almost ready now.</p>
</div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-20"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">When Nikaido said she wanted to go on the water slide, I had one plan in mind to support Kakihara's love.</p><p class="calibre4">The five of us head for the large waterslide ride.</p><p class="calibre4">[This waterslide is for pairs! Two people in line, please!]</p><p class="calibre4">The woman in charge calls out to us as we head to the end of the line.</p><p class="calibre4">This waterslide requires pairs of people to hold onto floats and slide down the long slide. This very system is what exactly I was after.</p><p class="calibre4">"They said it was for pairs. What do we do?" (Doumoto)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, we'll have one person left." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">Doumoto and Nogi are wondering what to do.</p><p class="calibre4">As for Kakihara, he just glances at Nikaido and doesn't say anything.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't think he's a chicken, but if anyone could ask her to ride with him in a situation like this, he'd probably have bristles growing out of his heart.</p><p class="calibre4">So leave it to me, Kakihara. I'll solve the odd-numbered problem first.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, sorry...... but I'm afraid of heights, Therefore, I'd like to avoid doing this if at all possible." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh!? is that so?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido raises her voice in surprise.</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that I'm afraid of heights itself is a lie, but saying this will increase the probability that she will be convinced.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, hey, let's go somewhere else. It's lonely here without a ride, isn't it?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, no, no, you four should go together. I don't want the four of you to miss the ride because of me. There are other water slides, so when you're done here, you can go with me on that one." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, I see. ......I'll take your word for it then! I've always wanted to ride this one!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">Okay, nice one, Doumoto. I believe that you, being the bold and adventurous person that you are, would not want to miss out on the biggest water slide here.</p><p class="calibre4">And if one person is willing, there's sure to be another who will jump on the bandwagon.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, the line has started to form, and I've always wanted to ride it too. Shidou, I'm sorry, but can you wait for us?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"No probs. I'll be watching you guys jump in." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"You said it, didn't you? Then I'm going to jump in like all cool!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">With this, Nogi falls.</p><p class="calibre4">Once the obstacles are cleared, the stage is completely set.</p><p class="calibre4">I look at Kakihara and give him a wink, as if to say, "Now, go!".</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara notices this and her face lits up and he nods happily.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah...... Azusa! Wanna ride with me?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara, with his intention in mind, calls out to Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre4">This is what I call " The Lovey-dovey Waterslide Operation". I know, I'm so f*cking lame at naming.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah...... M-mm, okay." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"――!!! Then let's get in line!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">I didn't miss it, Kakihara. I didn't miss your gut pose.</p><p class="calibre4">"Eeh―! Then I'm with Ryuuji? I would have preferred to be with Azurin, though!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew...... it's all right, isn't it. You should put up with me at least once." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh!? Ah...... yeah. Well, it's okay." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">Nogi is embarrassed by Doumoto's unusually mature voice.</p><p class="calibre4">Then, Domoto alternately looks at me and Kakihara, and then gives a thumbs up so that only I can see it.</p><p class="calibre4">Aah, I see. So you can at least see through your best friend's love life, huh?</p><p class="calibre4">"Then...... Shido-kun, I'm off." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeah, have a good time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I wave off Nikaido, who has been glancing at me.</p><p class="calibre4">Turning my back to them as they line up two by two, I move to the edge of the pool where the end of the slider is.</p><p class="calibre4">Here I can just see them as they plunge down the slider.</p><p class="calibre4">(...... what do, I do?)</p><p class="calibre4">I flopped down by the pool and stared at the bobbing water in a daze.</p><p class="calibre4">Being alone, the triviality of what I am doing once again comes to the fore.</p><p class="calibre4">To begin with, the help I was providing would only benefit Kakihara, of course. As for Nikaido, who had no interest in him from the beginning, perhaps it is an extremely annoying behavior.</p><p class="calibre4">Even I can understand the pain of having no way to escape.</p><p class="calibre4">What I am doing now is the same as disrespecting her feelings, isn't it?</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't get it......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">At first, I wanted to help Nikaido to divert her feelings. But now I am a little closer to Kakihara himself, and there is a slight desire to honestly support him.</p><p class="calibre4">If one's love life is called youth, then I wonder if this situation is also like that.</p><p class="calibre4">Youth may be crueler than I think.</p><p class="calibre4">I chuckle to myself, thinking that I really ain't cut out for this.</p><p class="calibre4">""Yaa~hoo~!""</p><p class="calibre4">Before I know it, their turn has come, and Nogi and Doumoto jump into the pool in front of me.</p><p class="calibre4">Splashing in the water, the two emerge out at the surface, cackling and laughing happily.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah! Shidou! How was our jump in?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Aah, it was pretty spectacular." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I know, right~! We did it, Ryuuji!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">They clap their fists together.</p><p class="calibre4">They return the floats to the staff and go to the side of the pool to wait for the other two who are coming later.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, Shidou?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Shidou, are you aware of Yuusuke's feelings for Azusa?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">Nogi, who is sandwiched between me and Doumoto, asks this question as she looks toward the waterslide.</p><p class="calibre4">A moment's thought. Then, I nod honestly, since Doumoto doesn't try to stop her when I look at him with a sideways glance.</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeah, He's asked me to help him. So you two notice about it already." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"The four of us have been together for a long time, so it's not hard for me to notice....... Well, I don't want to be thought of as being overly self-conscious, so I may just be pretending not to notice." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">That――――may indeed be the case.</p><p class="calibre4">&nbsp;"I've been watching them closely for a long time and...... I can tell you that they are a perfect match for each other. But that Yuusuke is too shy and Azusa doesn't even notice it, so I've been struggling with it for a long time." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"......Well, I understand that feeling a little." (</p><p class="calibre4">"Right. That's why when you skillfully guided them to the waterslide earlier, I thought, "You did a great job!"." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">Nogi nods at Doumoto's words.</p><p class="calibre4">"We have this image of those two, you know, like, dynamic." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"W-well, that may be true." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's why I couldn't understand Yusuke's feelings. I thought why didn't he just bump into her? Maybe it's because it's someone else's business, but you know. If we keep living the way we are now, the relationship will never change, and if we want to move forward, don't you think we have to be prepared to go through the pain?" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">I think that's a valid argument. The only reason I can say that is because it's definitely someone else's business.</p><p class="calibre4">And I can understand Kakihara's feelings.</p><p class="calibre4">We have completely different roots and different ways of thinking, but I'm sure anyone can understand the fear of ruining an existing relationship.</p><p class="calibre4">And after listening to their words, I came to an understanding. I had come to it.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara is aware of it himself.</p><p class="calibre4">Somewhere deep down, he knows that Nikaido's feelings are not for him.</p><p class="calibre4">That's why he couldn't step in. He wasn't ready to put himself in.</p><p class="calibre4">Because he doesn't want to get hurt, because he is afraid.</p><p class="calibre4">He wants encouragement from those around him――――from us, to dare to get hurt.</p><p class="calibre4">What will happen to the relationship between the four of them once he does so and gets hurt?</p><p class="calibre4">Maybe they will remain friends and stay the same.</p><p class="calibre4">Or it may not, and it may be irretrievably broken.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm beginning to feel more than a little scared at the prospect of being involved in such a crossroads in their friendship.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-14"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">"WHOAAAAAAAAH!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"KYAAAAAA!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">As if interrupting our conversation, we hear other joyful voices.</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido and Kakihara, who have slid down closely together on the float, jump into the pool.</p><p class="calibre4">I am inwardly relieved to see them happily making their way to the poolside.</p><p class="calibre4">Let's leave them alone today.</p><p class="calibre4">I have already fulfilled my obligation to cooperate with him.</p><p class="calibre4">Even now, I think their relationship is already good enough. At the very least, I don't want to get involved in someone else's love life.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm sorry you guys had to wait. I think I made Rintaro, in particular, wait quite long......." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's okay, don't worry about it. It was fun to watch you all jump in." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Is it? Then the next, let's go to the one that Rintaro can enjoy." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">What a conscientious guy. He's such a good guy that I hate him.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, it is true that I thought it looked like fun when people were sliding. Since we had come all this way, let's enjoy it and go home anyway.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then let's go to the low one over there!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sounds great! We can all slide at that one!"</p><p class="calibre4">The waterslide that Doumoto pointed to is the type where the slide itself is wide and everyone can slide together by holding on to a large floatation ring. Certainly, everyone can have fun on that one.</p><p class="calibre4">"Shidou-kun, do you think you can handle that one?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yes, it's fine. Yes, that height is no problem. Thank you for your concern." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm. It's only natural." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">The other three nod in agreement with Nikaido's words.</p><p class="calibre4">They are really good-natured people. I can honestly agree that they are high in the class caste.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder if there will come a time when I can talk honestly with them.</p><p class="calibre4">I shake my head and let the thought of myself thinking like that fade away.</p><p class="calibre4">No matter how I think about it, I don't think the real me and their personalities match.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm a little surprised at myself for beginning to feel sad about it.</p><p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre4">After playing on the water slides, we come to a terrace-like plaza lined with food stalls.</p><p class="calibre4">We sit down at a table where another family had just been sitting.</p><p class="calibre4">"Damn...... that's a painful expense."</p><p class="calibre4">With pained expressions on their faces, Doumoto and Kakihara put the yakisoba noodles from the food stall in front of us. It's the punishment for losing to Nogi earlier.</p><p class="calibre4">On top of the tray is a bowl of yakisoba noodles with traditional sauce.</p><p class="calibre4">We had been moving around in the water and got unexpectedly hungry, then I hear a rumbling sound of a stomach that I don't know who it belongs to.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah...... sorry." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eeh! Azurin is too cute already! Look, boys! There"s a cute girl hungry, so let's eat it now!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ho-Honoka! It's embarrassing!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Unexpectedly, it was Nikaido's.</p><p class="calibre4">As if to follow her up, Kakihara raises his voice.</p><p class="calibre4">"Let's eat then! Here, Bon appétit!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">We put our hands together like we did at a cooking class the other day, and each of us begins to take a mouthful of freshly made yakisoba noodles.</p><p class="calibre4">――――It's delicious.</p><p class="calibre4">If I were to describe it in terms of taste alone, it really is just ordinary yakisoba noodles with sauce. However, the combination of an empty stomach and this open-air situation makes it unusually tasty.</p><p class="calibre4">It's the same as the curry and BBQ cooked when camping.</p><p class="calibre4">After all, the environment is also important when it comes to food.</p><p class="calibre4">"Delicouuuuussss! What is this, so good!　And this's Yuusuke and Ryuuji's treat!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't keep digging up the same thing over and over again! But seriously, this is really delicious!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">I can understand why Nogi and Doumoto are so excited.</p><p class="calibre4">And Nikaido, who is eating elegantly next to me, also has a smile on her face.</p><p class="calibre4">"What do we do after this? I think we've already gone through the whole place, so I think it's okay to move around on your own." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"I agree with Yuusuke! Let's move around as we like for a while. Decide on a time and meet up again later."</p><p class="calibre4">Everyone seems to agree with Kakihara's idea, nodding their heads in agreement even if they didn't say it out loud.</p><p class="calibre4">I, too, am in favor of moving around on my own. I'm glad to be able to get away from Kakihara and Nikaido without having to think about complicated reasons.</p><p class="calibre4">"H-hey...... Azusa." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? What?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">――――Oh?</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara, who had proposed the idea, called out to Nikaido.</p><p class="calibre4">I, Doumoto, and Nogi look at each other silently and watch where the conversation is going.</p><p class="calibre4">"H-how about we go ride the water slides together again? You know, the first one." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">I know it, he doesn't need my help anymore.</p><p class="calibre4">If he can ask her on his own, there's no need for me to make arrangements.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, that's okay. I want to ride it too." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"I-I see. Then let's go as soon as we finish eating!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're so enthusiastic...... weird Kakihara-kun." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido has a look of not so enthusiastic.</p><p class="calibre4">What do I do with these two to voluntarily leave them alone?</p><p class="calibre4">I turn my gaze testily to Doumoto, and he begins to smile what I interpret to be a wicked smile.</p><p class="calibre4">"Kekekekek...... I get it, Rintaro. You want to have a swimming speed contest after all, right!"</p><p class="calibre4">No, not at all.</p><p class="calibre4">"Can't be helped then! Next, let's battle over a drink!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sounds great! Then I'll participate too!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Fine! This time it's a three-way battle with Rintaro participating!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">No――――well, it's okay.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm bored going around by myself, so if I can move around without thinking, that's better.</p><p class="calibre4">After finishing our meal, we get up from our seats and begin to move into two groups.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara and Nikaido went to the waterslide, the first one they rode on. And as for us, we went to the 25-meter pool.</p><p class="calibre4">"All right, it's 50 meters game! The fastest one to get there and back wins!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Pfft, I won't lose even if it's the second time!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">With the two of them fired up, we enter the pool and prepare for the start.</p><p class="calibre4">As expected,&nbsp; jumping into is forbidden because it's dangerous, so we start in the water.</p><p class="calibre4">"Let's do this! Get ready...... go!"</p><p class="calibre4">We kicked the wall of the pool in unison at Doumoto's cue.</p><p class="calibre4">I try to keep their positions within my sight and concentrate on my own swimming. &mdash;&mdash;I am not a good swimmer, but in reality, I just don't have the capacity to pay attention to other things.</p><p class="calibre4">I just keep moving my hands and crawl forward.</p><p class="calibre4">When I finally reach the 25-meter turnaround, I get a fleeting glimpse of their position.</p><p class="calibre4">Aah, this is no good.</p><p class="calibre4">Both of them have already completed the turnaround and are swimming in front of me.</p><p class="calibre4">I give it my all, but in the end, I can not catch up with them. It seems that the dull man's peerless move does not happen in real life after all.</p><p class="calibre4">"YASSS! Did you see that, bastards!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">It's Doumoto who let out a triumphant yell.</p><p class="calibre4">Nogi, who had finished first in the first race, was stomping her feet in frustration.</p><p class="calibre4">"Aaah jeez! If only my swimsuit hadn't almost slipped off in the mid way, I would have won for sure!" (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">"Too bad, a match is a match! Well, the last one is Rintaro!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ugh, I guess I'll just have to be glad I didn't finish last." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">The two grin at me as I walk up to the side of the pool, out of breath.</p><p class="calibre4">Oh dear, I'm so pissed off.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll ask, a Cola." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Me too." (Honoka)</p><p class="calibre4">It's the same one they bought earlier.</p><p class="calibre4">It's no use, losers don't even have the right to complain.</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay, I understand......, I'll definitely pay you back for this one day." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll wait, bring it on!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">I grab my wallet from one of the waterproof bags available for rent in the facility and start walking toward the stalls.</p><p class="calibre4">It was my chance to beat the upper-caste guys, but it didn't work out that way. So, I'm going to buy drinks quickly and quietly.</p><p class="calibre4">But with so many people, just going to the stands to buy drinks is a challenge.</p><p class="calibre4">I try not to bump into people as I walk, choosing an area with the least crowded as possible.</p><p class="calibre4">As I do so, I find myself near the waterslide. Although the area at the bottom of the water slide is crowded with people waiting for their turn, there are only a few people around the receiving pool.</p><p class="calibre4">As I am hurriedly making my way to the waterslide area, I saw two familiar faces out of the corner of my vision.</p><p class="calibre4">"Azusa....... I have a suggestion." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">I can hear the conversation between Kakihara and Nikaido sitting by the pool, looking tired.</p><p class="calibre4">At that moment, I quickly hide behind a nearby rock object.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara, who has no way of knowing this, continues.</p><p class="calibre4">"Next time...... that...... Why don't we come back here, just the two of us?" (Yuusuke)</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-4"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">Talking to myself, I immerse myself in mining.</p><p class="calibre4">I have just been diving into a dungeon with some friends, but my skill is still a little low.</p><p class="calibre4">It's been a long time since I've played a web game, and although it's fun, I feel like I'm a blank compared to the hardcore players.</p><p class="calibre4">I casually look at the doll I had placed by my desk.</p><p class="calibre4">It is a cute doll that is a deformed version of Rinka. She is dressed in an idol costume. The doll has big, clear eyes and a bright, innocent smile. She looks like Mizuki Rinka, but her atmosphere is more that of Rin.</p><p class="calibre4">Before returning home, Rinka said to me, "I know you will miss me when we are apart, so I will give you my doll. This will help you bear the loneliness of not having your wife around."</p><p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4">Today was a terribly tiring day.</p><p class="calibre4">Suffering from the unique malaise of tiredness from swimming, I managed to make it home.</p><p class="calibre4">I still have things to do.</p><p class="calibre4">Suppressing the urge to sleep, I take a shower and head for the kitchen. Of course, I have to prepare Rei's dinner.</p><p class="calibre4">Thanks to the shower, I have woken to some extent, so I proceed with my routine tasks.</p><p class="calibre4">As I'm doing so, I hear Rei's footsteps coming from the front door. Before I knew it, it seemed that a lot of time had passed.</p>
<p class="calibre15"></p><p class="calibre4">A few days ago, Rei, who had been having intense dance lessons for a new song, had asked me for something filling for dinner.</p><p class="calibre4">In my mind, a filling dish is Chinese food. I thought about making a stamina rice bowl with lots of garlic, but since it was reasonably easy to make, I decided to save it for a time when I had less time.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm glad you told me what you wanted to eat. It saves me time when I'm trying to come up with a menu." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, I can make more requests?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yea, bring it on." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I realized this when I started cooking for someone else, but it is hard enough to ask for requests and get "Anything is fine" in return.</p><p class="calibre4">In my case, Rei is relatively honest about what she wants to eat, which helps me out, but if this were a wife with an indifferent husband, it would be quite stressful. Of course, there are those who are happy to be allowed to cook as they please, but I think they are in the minority.</p><p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4">"Welcome home." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm home." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4"></p><blockquote class="calibre16">(PTW/N: Just married already!)</blockquote><p class="calibre4"></p><p class="calibre4">After the usual exchange, Rei heads off to the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre4">In the meantime, I reheat the food, put it on the dishes, and prepare it so that it will be ready to eat as soon as she comes up.</p><p class="calibre4">So far, it has become a routine.</p><p class="calibre4">While I'm immersed in a sense of satisfaction looking at the dishes on the table, Rei, who has finished drying her hair, comes out of the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry to keep you waiting. What's for dinner today?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's a Chinese set of Pepper Steak and Mapo Tofu with red pepper paste. You said you wanted to eat it the other day." (Rintaro) <b class="calibre8">(PTW/N: </b>青椒肉絲<b class="calibre8"> (chinjaoroosu)= Chinese stir-fry containing green peppers and meat; </b>麻婆豆腐<b class="calibre8"> (Mabodoufu)= Mapo tofu, Sichuan style bean curd.)</b></p><p class="calibre4">"You remembered?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Of course." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">A few days ago, Rei, who had been having intense dance lessons for a new song, had asked me for something filling for dinner.</p><p class="calibre4">In my mind, a filling dish is Chinese food.

Of course, there are those who are happy to be allowed to cook as they please, but I think they are in the minority.</p><p class="calibre4">"For now, let's start with the food in front of us. Eat it before it gets cold." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm, Bon appétit." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">The pepper steak is seasoned with oyster sauce, and the mapo tofu is cooked in a rather authentic way with a seasoning called Tianmian sauce (<b class="calibre5">PTW/N</b>: sweet bean sauce) and Doubanjiang paste (<b class="calibre5">PTW/N</b>: broad bean chili paste).</p><p class="calibre4">I was convinced that the dish was well done when I tasted it, but when I paired it with white rice, I couldn't stop my chopsticks.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, refill please." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh, you've broken your fastest record." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">The first serving of white rice vanished at a speed that made one wonder if a vacuum cleaner is attached to her body.</p><p class="calibre4">It's not just words, actions like this are enough to bring joy to the cook. I prepare another bowl of rice for her, smiling at my own simplicity.</p><p class="calibre4">There is not much noise during our meal.</p><p class="calibre4">There is hardly any conversation until we finish eating, because Rei keeps on eating at a level where she cannot even utter a word to begin with.</p><p class="calibre4">The refill itself is on its fourth bowl, and the platter of pepper steak and mapo tofu is almost completely emptied.</p><p class="calibre4">It's about time, huh――――just when I think so, she puts down her chopsticks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Thank you for the food." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oui, glad you enjoyed it." (Rintaro) <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: Yukihira Rintaro)</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">It was only recently that I had come to better understand the capacities of Rei's stomach.</p><p class="calibre4">I take the completely empty plates and bowls and take them to the sink.</p><p class="calibre4">Before I start washing the dishes, I tossed her some ice cream that I had bought for dessert, which was a little expensive. Even after eating so much, I was told that sweets are something that people can't get enough of.</p><p class="calibre4">After deftly finishing the dishwashing, I wipe my hands and return to the couch. I put the coffee I have brewed in front of her and sit down.</p><p class="calibre4">The TV, which I have left on, is filled with the sound of celebrities laughing.　</p><p class="calibre4">The time is a little after twenty o'clock. Right around the primetime variety shows are about to start.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Do you ever go on these shows?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sometimes I do. Sometimes, like before the release of a new song." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Aah, for promotional purposes, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't have a good impression when you put it that way, but that's what it is." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">It's just a casual conversation. I find comfort in such exchanges.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder if it is possible to be calm when watching a variety show, but I sip my coffee without worrying about such a thing.</p><p class="calibre4">"......did something happen?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......What makes you think so?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Because we are closer than usual." (Rei)</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Rei says that to me, I gasp.</p><p class="calibre4">The distance that should have been between me and Rei is now narrower than usual. I immediately felt the heat rising to my face.</p><p class="calibre4">Oh no, I'm extremely embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre4">I try to quickly move away, but for some reason, Rei grabs my hand.</p><p class="calibre4">"L-let go of me......! I'm going to get some cold water!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, you'll catch a cold." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What I'm going to get now is not a sound argument!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I desperately try to shake off Rei's hand. But thinking about it calmly, it will be a disaster if she gets injured as a result of my outburst.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Yeah, it seems my head is cooler than I thought.</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew...... I get it. Let me sit down properly first." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I sit back down on the couch, and her hand releases my hand.</p><p class="calibre4">"Did something happen, with Kakihara-kun and the others?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, it's not like something happened......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei is quite stubborn. If we've come this far, perhaps it would be better to stop trying to deceive her and just tell her everything as it is. Even if it's Kakihara's private life, it's a way to get back at him for all the trouble he's put me through.</p><p class="calibre4">"Can you swear you won't tell anyone?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"If Rintaro says I should, then I will." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, I'll tell you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I explain to Rei, recalling what happened today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That I was trying to support Kakihara's love life. That I had successfully taken them on a waterslide. And that he finally took a step forward.</p><p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">[Next time...... that...... Why don't we come back here, just the two of us?]</i></p><p class="calibre4">These were the words of invitation from Kakihara's mouth as he gathered up his courage.</p><p class="calibre4">I had heard Nikaido's reply to this on the spot.</p><p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">[It's definitely more fun if we all go together. Why don't we ask them when we get together later?]</i></p><p class="calibre4">"――――Because, you know. I want to ask you, a woman, is she......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm, probably has no romantic interest."</p><p class="calibre4">"......I guess." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">In a roundabout way, Nikaido refused the date invitation.</p><p class="calibre4">Somewhere in the back of my mind, there's me who thought that somehow Kakihara's love life was going to work out.</p><p class="calibre4">Considering the depth of time they have spent together, I had really hoped that she might be hiding her feelings for Kakihara somehow, or rather that she might be hiding them.</p><p class="calibre4">It seems that my wish was fleeting and dissipated.</p><p class="calibre4">"That Kakihara, he was so incredibly depressed...... I didn't know what to say to him anymore." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's...... a bit unfortunate. Even though we weren't close friends, I could easily understand how Kakihara-kun felt." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"You were aware of it too......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"He would often invite me to join him when we would do things together as a group. We didn't spend a lot of time together, but he was very easy to understand, you know?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I see. Kakihara, you're probably the only one who thinks nobody knows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I understand that Rintaro is supporting Kakihara's love. But that doesn't explain why Rintaro was acting strange just now." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... I'll spare you the details." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">After saying this, I reach into my pocket and tap my smartphone.</p><p class="calibre4">Shown in it is a message from "Nikaido Azusa" that had arrived just a few minutes ago.</p><p class="calibre4">[Thank you for coming despite my sudden invitation. If it's all right with you, Shidou-kun, why don't the two of us go together next time......?]</p>
<p class="calibre4">What was sent to me was such a message.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't want to act like I'm exposing myself, but I can't show the screen. I just told Rei in a few words that I had received an invitation from Nikaido to hang out alone with her.</p><p class="calibre4">"That is......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, that's probably what she meant." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I knew it,&nbsp;Nikaido-san, she really likes Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What do you mean by "I knew it"?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I can tell by looking at her." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......is that so." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Women are scary.</p><p class="calibre4">"What are you going to do about it?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? Ah, I'm going to turn her down. I've put it on hold because I'm checking my schedule." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Why?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Why, you ask...... Because Nikaido's free day just happens to be the day I'm going to the hotel you invited me to. I had an appointment first, and you are my number one priority." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Even if Rei's came later, my life is with her. So I'm really sorry to say that, in whatever way, I would have refused Nikaido's invitation.</p><p class="calibre4">So, there is no way that I would deliberately take such a disruptive action as closing the distance between myself and her.</p><p class="calibre4">"But well, it's not Nikaido's fault, and I kept wondering how I could say no――――eh, why are you grinning?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Next to me, who keeps thinking so hard of ways to turn her down without hurting her as much as possible, Rei is turning up the corners of her mouth somewhat happily.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm number one...... I'm Rintaro's number one priority." (Rei)</p>

<p class="calibre4">"What's wrong with you...... you look a little creepy." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Never mind, please continue?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuh......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Although I am puzzled, I am convinced because this is Otosaki Rei who I'm dealing with.</p><p class="calibre4">This kind of eccentricity is also a part of her charm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"......In the end, I have just pushed around, and eventually, the relationship became more complicated....... I wondered if this was the kind of youth I had longed for, and I felt a little down. It seemed painful and bitter. I totally didn't know what was so fun about it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">In the world of anime and TV dramas, youth drama is a group drama of running, sweating, and weeping. As a high school student, I had always wanted to experience something like that at least once, but apparently, I was not cut out for it.</p><p class="calibre4">The cause of all the blurring lies in the collapse of a single ideal.</p><p class="calibre4">If this is what youth is all about, then this world is in terrible taste.</p><p class="calibre4">"I was like, what's with you all." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Then, let's enjoy the youth with me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I was so taken aback by her sudden and crazy suggestion, that I let out a dumbstruck voice.</p><p class="calibre4">As if to further push me, Rei leans forward and stares me in the eye.</p><p class="calibre4">"Let's make unforgettable memories together at the beach during our next vacation." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I can only nod in agreement, overwhelmed by Rei's powerful words.</p>
