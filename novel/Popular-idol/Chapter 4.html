  <p class="calibre4">Summer means sea.</p><p class="calibre4">I have often heard such a line.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, it is not wrong. In fact, except for surfers and fishermen, most people don't go to the beach unless it's summer.</p><p class="calibre4">However, this means that summer is not the sea, but the sea is the summer, isn't it? In other words, there is no summer in the ocean, but the ocean in the summer――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"Darn! not there yet!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I shouted to the sky on the asphalt, where not a single shadow could be seen except for the occasional car passing by.</p><p class="calibre4">I tried desperately to think of something unimportant to forget the heat, but that didn't help. Under the sun that burned everything, no human tricks would work.</p><p class="calibre4">"Those girls...... If the place is far from the bus stop, then tell me in advance." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Sweat is dripping from my chin, as I grumble to myself.</p><p class="calibre4">This is a seaside prefecture far from Tokyo. It took a few hours to get there by train. Another hour by bus from the station I arrived at. And when I finally arrived at my destination, it was another hour on foot.</p><p class="calibre4">I left home at seven in the morning, but it was around noon before I realized it.</p><p class="calibre4">My destination was a seaside hotel――or a seaside cottage――with a private beach where Rei and the others would be staying.</p><p class="calibre4">(Damn......, I never thought I'd end up like this.)</p><p class="calibre4">I had worn a hat to protect myself from the sun, but the heat is starting to penetrate it.</p><p class="calibre4">Perhaps, or perhaps not, this road is designed to be driven on. It is not suitable for walking.</p><p class="calibre4">There is not even a single vending machine, both sides of the road are full of weeds, and not even a tall tree to provide shade.</p><p class="calibre4">To put it bluntly, I want to go home.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei had told me to make unforgettable memories, but my heart was already breaking.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm...... is that it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">A house made of wood came into view at the end of the road.</p><p class="calibre4">If it is not a mirage, it must be the cottage of my destination.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm saved――――.</p><p class="calibre4">The words spontaneously leak out of my mouth as if I had been lost in the mountains.</p><p class="calibre4">I had drunk all the drinks I had brought with me, and I was prepared to die if I had to walk any further. When I finally feel like I can rest, my stamina, which should have bottomed out, comes back to life a little.</p><p class="calibre4">Now, in order to get to the cottage, I have to pass a guest card key through the gate to enter the premises from the outside, or ask someone to open it from the inside.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, I don't have a card key, so I'm supposed to ask the girls to open the gate for me.</p><p class="calibre4">First, I take out my phone and call Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Hello." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">[Mmm......ye~s......] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're waking up. you're just waking from sleep, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">[Good morning......?] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's noon already. Anyway, can you open the gate for me? I can smell the burnt smell on my body." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">[That's exaggerating.......] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Shut up and open the gate already!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">[Kay......] (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">A few moments later, the gate in front of me slowly opens.</p><p class="calibre4">Stepping onto the grounds, I see a familiar blonde walking toward me from the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">"Welcome, Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, I never heard I had to walk this far." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That was my miscalculation. Sorry." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not mad at you, but I might get a little cranky if I don't get some water right now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm, That will be a problem. For now, come inside, where it's nice and cool." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I enter the cottage as Rei leads me.</p><p class="calibre4">The air-conditioned room, with its distinctive wood aroma tickling my nose, is indeed very pleasantly cool.</p><p class="calibre4">From the window, I can see the rumored private beach, with the waves glistening in the sunlight as they come and go.</p><p class="calibre4">"Is plain water okay?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? Ah, it's okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">While I was engrossed in this scene, Rei, who had moved to the refrigerator before I knew it, tosses me a plastic bottle.</p><p class="calibre4">It's a bottle of chilled water.</p><p class="calibre4">I open the lid as if in a hurry and pour the contents down my throat.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――! Yum......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I've never seen Rintaro so happy." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm feeling so alive right now...... that I can make a face like this." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">My body, which had been overheated, cools down quickly, and the brain regains its normal functioning.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't like to torture my body too much, but if the water tastes this good, it might be good once in a while.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――My! you're finally here, Rintaro-kun."</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Before I know it, Mia is looking down at us from the second floor of the atrium.</p><p class="calibre4">She comes downstairs and goes to the refrigerator to get a bottle of water, the same one I have.</p><p class="calibre4">"Are you also just waking up?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, yeah. We were shooting under the blazing sun all day yesterday, so I guess I was pretty tired." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah......, then I'm sorry about that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">This apology is directed at Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">As she's not a particularly morning person, it must have been very hard for her to be woken up suddenly.</p><p class="calibre4">"Umm,&nbsp; It was my fault that I made Rintaro walk so far. I should have at least ordered him a cab or something." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"A high school boy with so much energy doesn't need that much support. So don't worry about it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">All right, I think I've regained enough strength to be strong.</p><p class="calibre4">"So what about Kanon?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, she is――――." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia points to the second floor.</p><p class="calibre4">Then from somewhere there comes the sound of a door opening, and half a head with red hair can be seen over the balustrade of the atrium.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmn~...... what is there? There's a lot of noise......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Kanon, Rintaro's here." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmwhoa? He is?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon, with her hair down, comes down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre4">Her twin-tails are her trademark on stage, and when she wears her hair down, she looks more mature than usual.</p><p class="calibre4">However, there is one problem.</p>
  <p class="calibre4">She was wearing a camisole, probably a nightgown, but the shoulder straps were slipping and almost revealing her breasts.</p>
  
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/m428FpH/u9785-dd3460ff-7aa3-48cb-bdad-736781709100.jpg" alt="u9785-dd3460ff-7aa3-48cb-bdad-736781709100" border="0"></a>
  
  <p class="calibre4">I'll be lying indeed if I say that I honestly am not interested――――but my sexual desire is not so inflamed that it gets the better of my rational mind, so I silently turn my back to Kanon.</p><p class="calibre4">"Nn...... what? Why are you turning your face away?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Kanon, your br*asts are almost shown." (Rei) <b class="calibre8">(PTW/N: it can be either "br34sts" or "cl34vage" because it's censored "</b>乳○<b class="calibre8">".)</b></p><p class="calibre4">"Huh?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei, the way you say it is too blunt.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ri――――Rintaro's an idiot! Pervert!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I won't apologize. You knew I was coming and you came out looking like that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">You were right! I'm sorry about that!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I hear footsteps rushing back upstairs.</p><p class="calibre4">This kind of honesty is a good thing about her.</p><p class="calibre4">I was relieved that she didn't beat me up unreasonably like those tropes in romantic comedies.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah right, by the way, Rintaro-kun. Actually, we haven't had breakfast yet." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"If you guys just woke up, then no wonder." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"If it is possible, I would like you to cook breakfast and lunch for us." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Heh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I look at Rei with a sideways glance. Then she gives a single nod and agrees with Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">"I hadn't eaten Rintaro's food for a while since the shooting started, so I was missing his cooking by now. ......Can I have some?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't feel bad to hear you say that. Do you have any ingredients?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"The fridge is stuffed with a lot of things, mostly BBQ meats and such, though......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">We can have a BBQ, huh. I think I'll prepare for it later.</p><p class="calibre4">I open the fridge and sure enough, there are a variety of ingredients in there.</p><p class="calibre4">Vegetables and meat are all in stock. Although many of the condiments are not very seasonable, there will be no inconvenience unless you want to make an incredibly elaborate dish.</p><p class="calibre4">"I think I'll go for salted yakisoba." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">For now, let's just make something quick and easy.</p><p class="calibre4">I grab some pork, green onions, and cabbage as needed, and then pile some noodles, presumably for the BBQ, on top of them.</p><p class="calibre4">I quickly head for the kitchen, trying not to let them see my face break into a smile.</p><p class="calibre4">After confirming that this cottage is equipped with what is called an "island kitchen," I've been dying to try it out.</p>
</p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-21">
  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">Throw four bundles of noodles onto a pan with sesame oil and stir-fry them with bite-size pieces of vegetables and meat. Season with salt and pepper, a little garlic, and soy sauce.</p><p class="calibre4">Normally, I would have thought of some garnish for this dish, but since I used a lot of energy just to get here, I'll let myself slack off a little in this area.</p><p class="calibre4">Still――――not bad, the island kitchen.</p><p class="calibre4">It is very different because it is an induction stove instead of a gas stove which is used there, but once I get used to it, it is very convenient because of how easy it is to adjust.</p><p class="calibre4">In addition, the kitchen is much larger than the one in our new apartment. After all, being easy to move around is the best, isn't it?</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, it smells so good. Is Rintaro cooking?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yea. It will be ready soon, so take a seat at the dining table." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's great!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon appears in a T-shirt and shorts and jumps down from the middle of the stairs. Although it is pretty tall, the way she does not seem to mind its height makes me realize how extraordinary her physical abilities are.</p><p class="calibre4">"As usual, Rintaro-kun makes it so quickly....... I can never imitate you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Compared to all the housewives out there, I still have a long way to go. I am still a trainee." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">It may be hard to understand, but the housewives and househusbands of the world really do a wonderful job every day. I will always respect and admire them.</p><p class="calibre4">"Conversely, I can't do what you guys do. This is what people call it "even"." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, that's true." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Anyway, eat up. The quantity is small, but it's for you guys who have just woken up. So don't complain. In exchange,&nbsp; I will serve dinner to your heart's content." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I put freshly made yakisoba noodles on the table and we begin to eat.</p><p class="calibre4">The portion of the noodles is not much for them, and vanish from their plates in an instant.</p><p class="calibre4">I decided to have a BBQ for dinner and let them eat to their heart's content.</p><p class="calibre4">"""Thanks for the food."""</p><p class="calibre4">"Oui, Glad you guys enjoyed it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I stack up their plates and take them to the sink along with mine.</p><p class="calibre4">I start to wash up the dishes, but Rei comes next to me for some reason.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What is it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"We're going to the beach after this, so I want you to get dressed and meet us outside." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Right away?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">The time is 13:00.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4">It's still hot outside.</p><p class="calibre4">"I got the swimsuit that I had been using for the shoot yesterday. It's different from the last time I took it in the bath, so you can look forward to seeing me in it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......Ooh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Please do not think I'm being indifferent. There's no way I could say, "Oh! I'm looking forward to it!" here. It'd be too embarrassing.</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh my, in that case, I have confidence in myself too. I had a professional costume designer pick out my swimsuit for me." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I picked out the cutest one, too! You can expect a lot from me! Rintaro!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">The two of them head upstairs to change.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei follows them upstairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Left behind, I finish washing the dishes and sigh to myself.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder how much I have to pay to enjoy such a nosebleed-inducing situation. Surrounded by three top idols in swimsuits――――, it is a situation that is beyond the control of an ordinary person like me.</p><p class="calibre4">Rather than disgust or happiness, it's a heavy load to carry.</p><p class="calibre4">If the fans find out, I will be beaten to a pulp for sure. I feel a chill when I think about it.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Well, if that's the case, I'd better enjoy the moment even more." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">It's just a bubble of time in my life anyway. If I am going to go to all that trouble, I might as well enjoy it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre4">I finished changing before the girls, put on my sandals, and headed for the beach.</p><p class="calibre4">Even in just a pair of shorts, it is still hot.</p><p class="calibre4">As I feel my skin burning, I cast my eyes toward the ocean.</p><p class="calibre4">"......How long has it been?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">It's been ten years since I've seen the ocean outside of a video or image――――, and if I'm not mistaken, even longer. To begin with, when I don't even remember when the last time I saw it was, so I guess it is understandable that it was a long time ago.</p><p class="calibre4">Yes, seeing it again makes me feel excited, despite my age.</p><p class="calibre4">The water itself is relatively clean and the waves are quiet. It will be a perfect situation for swimming.</p><p class="calibre4">Anyway, here I am, waiting for them, and I'm already beginning to regret that I should have stayed inside the house a little longer.</p><p class="calibre4">I can't stop sweating.</p><p class="calibre4">I think things are going to be bad, so I open the cooler box I've prepared inside the cottage. I had been careful when I was in the pool with Kakihara and the others, but in water, it was hard to notice that I was losing fluids. That is why it is necessary to have water in a place where I can drink at any time. It's very bad to get sick in such an unpopular place.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Hmm." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I wait while drinking water, I hear footsteps coming from the direction of the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">When I turn around, I find the "three goddesses" standing there.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro-kun, sorry to keep you waiting." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia, wearing a black swimsuit, waves her hand at me.</p><p class="calibre4">The left and right sides of the upper part to support her breasts were connected by laces of the same color that were arranged like shoelaces, and the lower part is also connected to the left and right sides of the waist by the same laces.</p><p class="calibre4">I presume this is what is called a "lace-up bikini".</p><p class="calibre4">Naturally, there was no cloth under the area connected by the strings, exposing a bright skin color. This gave the impression of a large coverage area, yet it did not lack any sex appeal. Mia's proportions were the key to her ability to wear such a black swimsuit that gave such a strong impression.</p><p class="calibre4">In terms of size alone, hers is only slightly inferior to Rei's, but Mia's bosom has a firm assertion. The strings of laces pulling together as if just bridging the cleavage were, if one had to choose a word, it'd be "erotic".</p><p class="calibre4">"Fufufu......! You can admire to your heart's content! At my swimsuit!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon, with her hands on her hips and her chest out, is wearing a swimsuit that also brings out the best of her attractiveness.</p><p class="calibre4">It is a swimsuit that has no shoulder straps, just like an off-the-shoulder swimsuit, and unlike a swimsuit that supports the breasts from the bottom, it supports the breasts from the sides, bringing them to the center.</p><p class="calibre4">I think it is called a "bandeau bikini". To be honest, my knowledge is a little fuzzy at this point. <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: dun worry dude... mine even zero.)</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">The legs are slender and toned, and the swimsuit naturally attracts the eyes. The cheerful, flighty image that characterizes Kanon and the girlishness that would normally be difficult to harmonize are perfectly blended.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Rintaro...... how's mine?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">And the last one――――.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei is wearing a white swimsuit, the exact opposite of the black one from the previous one. There's fine light blue embroidery spread throughout such a cloth, which functioned as a vivid accent.</p><p class="calibre4">The shape of the swimsuit is the standard bikini that most commonly comes to mind. The triangular fabric supports her ample breasts and accentuates her beautiful cleavage.</p><p class="calibre4">In terms of coverage area, Rei is the best by a slight margin from Kanon. Therefore, her white skin is exposed sufficiently. The whiteness of her skin reminds me of the elves in the fantasy world.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, I've never seen the real thing. I'm just talking about an analogy.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey girls...... do you want me to spend my fortune for the rest of my life?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm? Is that a compliment?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"In my opinion. I'm thinking, How much virtue do I have to accumulate to be able to come to the beach with three beautiful girls like you....... Well, they look great on you girls." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh...... M, mm. If you say something so straightforward,...... that's, umm." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Is Mia the type of overcapacity when she is praised so suddenly and much?</p><p class="calibre4">Contrasting her is the red twin-tailed girl with a grin on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Oh my! Oh my, my, my! Do you perhaps just fall head over my heels for real today!? Could it be that you have a fetish for swimsuits? Then you can admire me more closely. You can, okay?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"You sound like an old hag......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"HUUUUUHHHHH!? I'm perfectly a vivacious HS girl, okaaayyyyy!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">The way she said she's "vivacious" is also old-fashioned.</p><p class="calibre4">Then I see both Rei and Mia nodding, they both seem to have the same opinion as me.</p></p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-15"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
  
<p class="calibre4">"Huuuh! What the hell is wrong with you guys! Enough! Rintaro, I have a favor to ask you." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"What is it, out of blue." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"This, you know what this is, right?" (Kanon)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Saying that, Kanon hands me something.</p><p class="calibre4">It's sunscreen, your skin's best friend. A bad sunburn only causes pain, so it is something to put on the skin just to be safe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I know what it is, but what's it all about?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Put some on." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"What?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm saying! I'm asking you to put some on us!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">My mind freezes for a moment, not understanding what Kanon is saying.</p><p class="calibre4">Do you want me to touch the raw skin of an idol?</p><p class="calibre4">"What the hell are you talking about, I'm going to kick your ass!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"You come here for violence!? But to my face is not allowed, okay!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not going to hit you anywhere. I'm the one who's more concerned about your health than anyone else." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't mix kindness with rhetoric!" (Kanon)</p>
<p class="calibre4">――――Now that we've all yelled at one another, the confusion has subsided.</p><p class="calibre4">Let's talk calmly from here.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, you guys. Can you please translate what this senseless one is saying?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, could that senseless one be me?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Who else could it be? Didn't you learn in health class not to let guys put sunscreen on you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I never learned that with that much pinpoint accuracy!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">In any way, unless your life is in danger, I don't think it's a good idea to let a boy who is not your lover touch your skin.</p><p class="calibre4">Yes, I am very pure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I never think that if I accept this situation easily, I will run out of luck and feel like I will die tomorrow. I'm just worried about Kanon and the girls. I'm serious, okay?</p><p class="calibre4">Mia, who had been laughing at this exchange between Kanon and me, opens her mouth in resignation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Well, well, don't blame Kanon too much. We're in on this too." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What? Might you guys have mistaken me for a plant or something?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"We don't think of you that far, though. I've been told that I'm still a top idol, but I'm a little unsure of myself." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm the kind of person who would never make a move if it didn't make sense. I'd rather they say I'm a manly man." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then I feel rather safe. You can put sunscreen on us without feeling guilty." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I feel like I'm being seduced.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not saying you have to do it to all of us. Just pick one person to put on the sunscreen." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuuh...... why don't you guys just put it on each other?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"The person you choose here will be sleeping in the same room with you tonight." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Is this a hell?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">What's with that ultimate choice――――.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had a walk through the cottage earlier, and there were only two rooms for bedrooms on the second floor.</p><p class="calibre4">Two bedrooms with two beds inside. In other words, only two people can sleep in one room.</p><p class="calibre4">I know that even putting on sunscreen is agonizing, but to have another step beyond that is more than a reward, it's a punishment.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hell is a bad word to hear. I'd rather have you be grateful that you get to sleep in the same room with such beautiful girls." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I can't do it. In the first place, what's in it for you guys? If it's more beneficial than me sleeping on the living room couch, please tell me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh? Like being more confident as a woman?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay, I get it. You guys started this for fun, didn't you?" (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The three of them nodded simultaneously in response to my question.</p><p class="calibre4">Ah, I see. So I'm being teased.</p><p class="calibre4">In that case, why don't I just go along with them?</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Got it. So I just have to pick one, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What? Suddenly you're all in on it." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Kanon, come here." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuh!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I grab Kanon's arm and we head straight for the parasol set up in the middle of the beach.</p><p class="calibre4">There is a resting mat under the parasol, where we can sit and rest at any time. I lay Kanon prone on the mat.</p><p class="calibre4">"Wa-wait a minute!? Me!? Are you serious!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I am. I'm going to put it on properly, so be prepared." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hold on!? I'm so nervous! I'm reaaaaaaly nervous now! ――――HYAA!?" (Kanon)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I drip some sunscreen cream on Kanon's back.</p><p class="calibre4">Then, I put out more cream on both of my hands and carefully rubbed them together.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What is it, Rei?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Do you want to sleep with Kanon......?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I turn my gaze to Rei, who asks me such a question with a pained, wistful expression on her face.</p><p class="calibre4">I let out a sigh and beckoned Rei with my cream-slick hands.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rei, come here. Mia too." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh? Me, too?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">I make them stand on either side of me, with Kanon between them, as they come up to me vigilantly.</p><p class="calibre4">Now everything is ready.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"――――Hmm? Somehow, I have a bad feeling about this." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Ignoring Kanon's words, I gently put "my foot" on her back.</p><p class="calibre4">Then I put my left and right hands on Rei's and Mia's backs, respectively.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, let's get started." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Smear, smear, smear, smear.</p><p class="calibre4">As I dexterously move my right foot and both hands, I put sunscreen on "all three of them" at the same time.</p><p class="calibre4">There's a moment of silence.</p><p class="calibre4">The first to open her mouth was Kanon, who was being trampled on the back.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――Wh-what the hell is this treatment!? What do you think you are doing, stomping on an idol!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm going to be sharing a room with the one I choose, right? That's why I picked all three of you. Maybe two of you guys can sleep in the same bed, and that way two beds will suffice. I'll sleep on the floor, so all is well." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Even if that's the case, why am I the only one being trampled on!? Bullying! A bullying!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"What a fussy. I'll pretend I didn't pick you so you'll get a room to yourself." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"This is bullying! Give me back my thrill!" (Kanon)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Did you get a little thrill out of it? You have a cute side there, huh.</p><p class="calibre4">I have no hobby of trampling on women, however. Thus, after I'm done with it, I withdraw my foot.</p><p class="calibre4">"Aaha, you caught a flaw in the rules. Well, I guess it's very typical of you, Rintaro." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Poor you. But I don't like to be teased all the time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Actually, it wasn't a hundred percent teasing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia's gaze turns to Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">And then she looks at me with a somewhat relieved look on her face.</p><p class="calibre4">"I want to be in the same room with Rintaro, you know?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......Is that so?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">As usual, this lass can say things that make people feel embarrassed without hesitation.</p><p class="calibre4">I am neither listless nor yearning for it, but I don't like to be on the receiving end of what is being said. The pace I've been protecting is shattered in an instant, and it takes time to recover, for better or worse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Hey, don't flirt with each other, can't you just finish put it on anyway? It's incomplete if it's painted halfway through." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......do you need me to do it anymore?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What are you saying after having put your hands on us? I hope you'll take responsibility until the end." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Don't say things that are misleading. Mia knows that too, which is probably why she's been grinning at me since a while ago. She really is a cunning person.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Can't be helped then.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Leaving aside what she said, it will be a waste if I don't use up the sunscreen once I had spread it on my palm.</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay then. I'll just put it on your back." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't make it hurt, okay?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You really don't want to do that, do you?"</p>
<p class="calibre4">I decided to put it on starting with Kanon, who remained lying down for the time being, while giving a straight face to Mia, who keeps on smirking and teasing me.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm already getting very tired, but there are still nights to come. The more I think about it, the more I am starting to feel a little more frightened than excited.</p></p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-5"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, she asks me to put some on――――</p><p class="calibre1">"Then I'll start with Kanon, who's still lying prone." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I kneel down beside Kanon, who is still lying prone, and this time I use my hand on her instead of my foot.</p><p class="calibre1">First, I put my hand on her, partly because I felt a little guilty for trampling her. I'm not going to say it, though, because if I do, she'll probably take it as an opportunity to get the better of me.</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah, it's cold." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hang in there." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the sunscreen is a little inadequate, I put out some new sunscreen and then spread it on Kanon's back.</p><p class="calibre1">Not a single pimple on her beautiful back. I wonder what she ate and how she lived her life to keep her back so beautiful.</p><p class="calibre1">"Heeh......, you're really skillful at it, aren't you." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"There's no such thing as skillful or unskillful in putting on sunscreen." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"It's a matter of how you work with your hands....... Well, the person performing it doesn't seem to understand, so that's fine." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"?" (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't really understand it, but if she doesn't find it repulsive, so much the better.</p><p class="calibre1">When I have finished putting on all over, Kanon thanks me and gets up, turning her back to me, and starts putting on her front. Now, it is Mia who lies down instead.</p><p class="calibre1">"Then you'll take care of me next, won't you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Kay, okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">While thinking that she is the same as Kanon, but surprisingly she has a firm back――I put sunscreen on her in the same way.</p><p class="calibre1">First, I start around the shoulder blades. From there, I gradually move down to the waist area.</p><p class="calibre1">"Ahhhn!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Ngghh...... you can't go there...... Rintaro-kun......." (Mia)</p>
<p class="calibre1">When I touch the area near her flanks, Mia raises moans for some reason.</p><p class="calibre1">Please stop it. I'm flying my consciousness to a distant world so that I don't react.</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro-kun......, you're so skillful." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"You seem to be all right if I put my feet on too." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Wait, wait! I'm sorry!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">When I get up and try to put my foot on her, Mia stops me in a hurry with a bitter smile on her face. It's all right if she understands. If only she does.</p><p class="calibre1">"Muu...... surprisingly tough, you are." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"You'd better learn from this and stop making fun of me like that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I would hate to stop it. The face of you in trouble is unexpectedly amusing, you know?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">As expected of the Demon King. She even enjoys my suffering.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, I think I'll stop here for now. Because the princess seems to be upset right now." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"What?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I glance at Rei and find that she is looking at us with a very stern face.</p><p class="calibre1">Ah, indeed, I need to hurry up with this girl.</p><p class="calibre1">"Phew, thank you. Here, Rei. Time to switch." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"...... Mm." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia moves out and Rei lies down to replace her.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, please." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"...... Yea." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">No, I wonder what.</p><p class="calibre1">As expected, my heart, which I have kept so strongly, is shaken when she is so openly showing her fondness for me.</p><p class="calibre1">On top of that, when I look at Rei's bare skin, my cheeks heat up as I remember what happened in the bathroom that time.</p><p class="calibre1">No, if I react here, my life will be over――――</p><p class="calibre1">I close my eyes and touch her back.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nnnn...... can you put it on a little stronger?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Blurf!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">That's a close call, I am about to get a nosebleed.</p><p class="calibre1">Unlike Mia, I can tell that this girl has a naturally seductive voice, so I can't be careless.</p><p class="calibre1">I knew this, but she is definitely the one who breaks my pace the most among those I've met. She is the one who does it naturally, which is why she is so dangerous.</p><p class="calibre1">"Nnnh....... Aah." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Rei......, keep your voice down a little." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Be-because...... Rintaro...... tickles me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">She's already a murder weapon now, isn't she?</p>
<p class="calibre1">Reason and desire are running rampant within me.</p><p class="calibre1">Hang in there, and stay strong, Rintaro. You can do it if you try. Suppress this nasty monster of desire with your strong reason.</p><p class="calibre1">"Aah, there...... not good!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"――――!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Uh-huh, I'm at my limit.</p><p class="calibre1">I turn my desperate gaze to ask for help from Kanon.</p><p class="calibre1">"Looks like you need my help." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Yeah......, please." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Clench your teeth." (Kanon)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Kanon's fist, swung wide, digs into my cheek.</p><p class="calibre1">I'm grateful for this pain now.</p><p class="calibre1">Thanks to the aching pain in my cheek, the desire in me recedes.</p><p class="calibre1">"Thank you, you've saved me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"It's okay. In times of need, mutual help is always welcome." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">I think Kanon and I might become good friends someday.</p><p class="calibre1">Although, the one problem is that she's too loud.</p><p class="calibre1">"I see....... that Rintaro-kun gets excited when I speak out like that." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"You're not thinking straight, are you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I finish putting the sunscreen on Rei's back, while making a retort to Mia.</p><p class="calibre1">Phew, finally done.</p><p class="calibre1">I pat her on the back to let her know I'm done, and Rei stands up, looking a little out of breath.</p><p class="calibre1">She looks so sexy in every single way.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, Rintaro. That felt good." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">I and Kanon gush at the same time, and Mia, as expected, is holding her mouth and holding back her laughter.</p><p class="calibre1">The only one who doesn't understand our reaction is Rei herself.</p><p class="calibre1">"A-anyway, now that we're done, why don't you guys go swimming?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmm. No, not yet. Rintaro hasn't been done yet." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"No, I'll do it myself――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">As if to interrupt my words, Mia and Kanon grab me by the arms on either side of me.</p><p class="calibre1">I am stunned at what is going on, and I am pushed down prone on the mat on which Rei had been lying just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, well, you'd better at least put some on, or you'll be afraid of what will come after, right?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"She's right. We are sorry if we only ask you. We'll give you full treatment in return." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">I try to escape from this situation, but I am no match for these girls, who have been exercising regularly. When I am a bit down due to the fact that my physique is bad compared to theirs, Rei comes straddling on top of my body.</p><p class="calibre1">It's no use, I can't escape.</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, stay still." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"S-sto――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I feel a shiver of pleasant sensation running down my back.</p><p class="calibre1">◇◆◇</p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I had a terrible experience." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Isn't that must be the best? Three idols touching your body?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"I want to take better care of my body." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"That's not a man's line." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">I was put on sunscreen all over, and I am lying limp under the parasol.</p><p class="calibre1">I am so tired that I can't even stand up, even though I haven't even been into the sea yet. In contrast, the perpetrator trio is sprightly, and the difference between the victim and the perpetrators is really surfacing.</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of all this, this girl reaches out her hand to me and says――――.</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, let's go." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"......Yea!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">And I, can't refuse her invitation.</p><p class="calibre1">I take Rei's hand and stand up.</p><p class="calibre1">Heading toward the ultramarine sea.</p><p class="calibre1">Dipping ankle-deep in the water feels comforting, cooling the blood vessels and lowering the body temperature itself.</p><p class="calibre1">"This is nice......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Blegh!?" (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I turn my head in the direction of the call, and at that very moment, water is splashed on my face.</p><p class="calibre1">My mouth instantly became salty, and I spit out the water.</p><p class="calibre1">"What are you doing?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"If you feel upset, just try to get back at me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hey hey, I'm not gonna do such a childli――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">――――No, It's probably because it's a time like this.</p><p class="calibre1">At a place like this, where no one is around but us, it'll be stupid to act like an adult.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei is trying to liven things up for us. It will be a waste if we don't enjoy ourselves.</p><p class="calibre1">"I understand. I'll show you how to handle the water I've trained by washing dishes every day." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"That probably has nothing to do with――――whoa!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Gotchu!" (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I scoop up the water and pour it over Rei's body.</p><p class="calibre1">Her smile deepens as I take advantage of an opportunity, and she then splashes water at me as a counterattack.</p><p class="calibre1">"Enou~gh! I told you guys to stop flirting!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"We'll have to join in the fun, I guess." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Kanon and Mia join in, pushing their way through the splashing water.</p><p class="calibre1">Four high school students are having a water fight, yelling and screaming without caring about being too old to do so.</p><p class="calibre1">Normally, it'll be embarrassing to even look at this scene, but if you put that aside and get into the fun, it's surprisingly not so bad.</p>

<p class="calibre1">"This is my grudge from the past! Rei! Eat this!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah......." (Rei)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Rei is about to be splashed with water by Kanon, but she managed to dodge it.</p><p class="calibre1">The one who is at the other end of the dodge is me.</p><p class="calibre1">The impact causes my feet to be caught in the sand, and I fall into the water with her.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei's golden hair is swaying in the cool blue water.</p><p class="calibre1">I marvel at her beauty, and countless bubbles escape from my mouth.</p><p class="calibre1">What is this? Summer actually isn't so bad.</p>
