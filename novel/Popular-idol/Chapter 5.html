  <h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 5 - The Right To Order</h1>
  
  <p class="calibre4">"Let's play beach ball!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon suddenly announces to us as we are rehydrating after getting out of the sea.</p><p class="calibre4">In her hands is a ball, which she happily holds up to the sky.</p><p class="calibre4">"The four of us will rally, and whoever drops it will do one thing each of the three of us says!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't decide on your own......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, now what? Are you gonna run away?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I'll have had a blue streak on my forehead in front of Kanon, who smirks at me in a mocking manner. But even though I'm frolicking in the sea, I have to be an adult when I have to be.</p><p class="calibre4">After all, I'm not one to take this kind of provocation――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"Fine. I'll do it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">――――All those thoughts were just thoughts after saying these lines.</p><p class="calibre4">I was already taking the bait. No turning back.</p><p class="calibre4">Now, I'm regretting it a little.</p><p class="calibre4">"That's the way it's got to be. You guys will do too, won't you?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Of course. How can I not participate in such an interesting game?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei nods next to Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">And so our sandy beach death match is to be held.</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon first moves a little further away from the water's edge and draws a large circle on the beach with a fallen branch.</p><p class="calibre4">"If the rule is that the player who drops the ball loses, then the player should hit the ball as far as possible and send it to a place where the player can never catch up to it, right? So in this case, if the ball falls out of the circle without being touched, it will be the miss of the last person to touch it." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see. Then I guess the game won't end so soon." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You have only two lives! If you hit the ball out of the circle as I just said, you lose one life. And if the number of remaining lives reaches zero, you lose the game. And if the same player touches the ball twice in a row, he loses one live." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">For an impromptu game, the rules are pretty solid.</p><p class="calibre4">It'll have been a fun game if not for the punishment.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, what if a standoff occurs?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei's question is more than reasonable.</p><p class="calibre4">If the ball lands exactly between two people, they might push each other and not hit back. Then it'll be hard to tell whose mistake it is.</p><p class="calibre4">"<span>When a standoff occurs, I'll chalk it up to a miss on both sides. If you don't want to miss the ball, you have to talk to each other. Also, if you say you'll take it and then intentionally don't take it, that counts as a miss." (Kanon)</span></p><p class="calibre4">"I see. Got it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">That's another good rule.</p><p class="calibre4">With this rule, standoffs are unlikely to occur.</p><p class="calibre4">Prohibiting declarative feints was also a good decision.</p><p class="calibre4">For example, if I have two remaining lives and Rei has lost one, and if I say "I'll take the ball" that is about to fall between me and her and block her action, we both lose one life and I automatically win, based on the standoff rule, as I have one life left.</p><p class="calibre4">This is how the game ends, but it's kind of tasteless.</p><p class="calibre4">"Is it okay to give any kind of order for punishment?"</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, as long as it's within the bounds of common sense, why not? It's not like you guys are going to misuse that, right?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Well, of course it is. I'm not going to throw out an order that someone will seriously dislike.</p><p class="calibre4">At best, I'm going to make that person feel a little embarrassed.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then take your positions." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">With the peculiar tension of a punishment game, I step into the drawn circle.</p><p class="calibre4">It seems larger than it looks from the outside.</p><p class="calibre4">There is no such thing as a strategy for this game, but I think the important thing is to be able to drop the ball in the right spot. If you want to be greedy, it is best to drop the ball just short of the line. If the ball goes to a place where it is difficult to tell whether it will go out, you can create hesitation in the opponent's head. If you can induce a mistake there, you're on your way.</p><p class="calibre4">However――――.</p><p class="calibre4">(......I've never played it.)</p><p class="calibre4">I don't remember playing volleyball at all, except in school. I know how to pass, receive, and the like. But if I don't know what it feels like to play the ball with my body, I can't really be sure.</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't think there's a problem with the rules, but to be sure I'd like to check them out and practice one time. If we drop the ball here, we won't lose the remaining lives." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I'm relieved when Kanon tells us that.</p><p class="calibre4">Thank goodness. Now I can learn to feel the ball.</p><p class="calibre4">For practice, we pass the ball a few times.</p><p class="calibre4">It's still difficult to pass the ball just right, and a few times I pass it the wrong way and let it roll away, but I become a little better as I repeat it.</p><p class="calibre4">As long as I stay focused, I'm sure I wouldn't miss a single passing.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well then, it's time for the real thing!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Finally.</p><p class="calibre4">A peculiar sense of tension fills the circle</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon floats the ball and tosses it up into the air with her fingertips.</p><p class="calibre4">The gently spinning ball slowly falling to under me.</p><p class="calibre4">(Yeah....... if only this much, then...)</p><p class="calibre4">I take a basic receiving stance that I often see in volleyball, joining my fingers with the tips of my outstretched hands, and passing the ball high into the air.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball rises to a certain height and begins its free fall just between Rei and Mia. I'm able to drop it at the perfect spot.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rei! I'll take it!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei, who's about to dive down, stops and Mia takes the ball's landing spot instead. And just like Kanon did earlier, Mia tosses the ball with her fingertips.</p><p class="calibre4">At the destination of the toss, there is Rei who has just stopped her feet.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm, perfect toss." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei leaps up high and arches her body backward.</p><p class="calibre4">Watching her move reminds me of a scene I saw one day.</p><p class="calibre4">It was before summer break, I believe. During PE class.</p><p class="calibre4">I was leaning against the wall watching Rei leap higher than the net and launch a powerful spike into the opponent's court.</p><p class="calibre4">Oh no――――.</p><p class="calibre4">By the time I realized it, it was already too late.　</p><p class="calibre4">The ball, which has been launched by her hand, is coming towards me with frightening momentum.</p><p class="calibre4">I was naive. There is no rule against spiking the ball. It's a fine super-aggressive strategy, too.</p><p class="calibre4">"Damn......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I have to receive the ball.</p><p class="calibre4">Fortunately, unlike the ball used for volleyball, this ball is a little bigger and softer. With this ball, even if you receive it with your arm, it won't hurt you much.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Supposedly.</p><p class="calibre4">"What...... the......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">My arms that receive the ball make a creaking sound.</p><p class="calibre4">I bend my knees further to kill the impact and use the spring in my body to reduce the force of the ball.</p><p class="calibre4">But still, the momentum of the ball does not stop.</p><p class="calibre4">With a heavy thud, the ball flies out of the circle with great force.</p><p class="calibre4">Looking at the ball rolling around, I gape open-mouthed.</p><p class="calibre4">"Seriously......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Rei! You did it!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei sniffs with pride at Kanon's praise.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, now you only have one life left." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"You......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I see it now.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei, you're going to aim at me, aren't you?</p><p class="calibre4">Looks like she really wants me to do what she orders.</p><p class="calibre4">"I want the right to give order to Rintaro. That's why I'm going after you." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Fine. Come at me!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">She declared war on me, and as a man, I can't just sit back and do nothing.</p><p class="calibre4">I have the advantage here.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei wants me to lose, whereas I'm fine as long as I don't lose.</p><p class="calibre4">In the current battle royale situation, it'll be difficult to target one particular person.</p><p class="calibre4">(As long as Rei is focused on me, I can win this match......!)</p><p class="calibre4">With that conviction, I pick up the ball that has fallen.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-22"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">"We'll start again with the one who made the miss, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Right. No problem." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Alright." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I thought calmly as I tossed the ball between my hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If Rei spikes the ball, it will be hard to receive it. Even if I can, the ball will probably go out of the ring. That would be my loss.</p><p class="calibre4">Then there is only one strategy.</p><p class="calibre4">I'll play a lowball to Rei. That's it.</p><p class="calibre4">I'll float the ball and lightly toss it with my fingertips.</p><p class="calibre4">The toss, which will surely have been criticized in the original competition, goes straight down to Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ugh......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">As expected, Rei is unable to spike the ball.</p><p class="calibre4">Taking a receiving stance, she bounces the ball high in the air with her arms. It is hard to tell from the height, but it is definitely inside the ring.</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon, who is closest to the ball, chased after it.</p><p class="calibre4">"Aiming at Rintaro...... it isn't bad at all! It's basic to aim at the one who is on the brink of losing, isn't it?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuh!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">She says something outrageous and while running, she bounces the ball with one arm.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball flies through the air again and this time falls to where Mia is standing.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, I think I'll wait and see until my remaining lives are running out." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">The ball, which Mia floats with a light touch, goes back precisely to Kanon, although it is randomly tossed.</p><p class="calibre4">Not good, this is just a spike opportunity for that lass.</p><p class="calibre4">"Whoa! Thanks for the good toss!" (Kanon)</p>
<p class="calibre4">And that would mean a big pinch for me.</p><p class="calibre4">If Rei can spike it that well, it's not hard to imagine that the other two can do something close.</p><p class="calibre4">It is a mistake to think, even for a moment, that I can win.</p><p class="calibre4">Her body is bent over, and a powerful spike is about to be shot just as I have imagined it'll be.</p><p class="calibre4">She is aiming right at me, no doubt.</p><p class="calibre4">"This is the end! Rintaro!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah. Speaking of which, I'm pretty sure Kanon's breast size is――――." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What are you talking abouuuuut! You stupid Miaaaaaa!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon, receiving an unexpected provocation, dexterously changes her target in mid-air.</p><p class="calibre4">The aim, of course, is toward Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball is bounced with a loud sound and heads toward Mia with a force that can have blown her face off.</p><p class="calibre4">But――――</p><p class="calibre4">"As I thought, Kanon is easy to handle." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia evades the ball by lightly tilting her head to the side.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball's momentum naturally does not weaken, and it slams greatly into the sand outside the ring.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball is dropped outside the ring, in other words, it is Kanon's miss.</p><p class="calibre4">"You, you set me up." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't talk nonsense to me. I just suddenly remembered Kanon's three sizes, okay?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't you dare say that, okay!? Absolutely don't, okay!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm. Is that a cue? Then I'll meet your expectations, from the top, seven――――" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not giving you a cueeeeee! Stop it! Save me!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Why is she begging for her life?</p><p class="calibre4">For now, I leave Kanon as she suffers holding her head in her hands, and I look at Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">"You were standing by the line on the premise that you'd provoke her...... you're good." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Fufu. The game is boring if it's over too fast. You should do your best to reduce the number of my remaining lives." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's a good point. I'll make you cry in the end." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Anyway, thank goodness Kanon is vulnerable to provocation.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei and Mia still have two remaining lives, and I can't see――――any way to reduce theirs with just my own strength.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro! I can cooperate with you here, tho!? or better yet, we should do something about them! We can't let them get away with this!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I was just about to make the same suggestion. Please, Kanon." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Likewise, you better give me a good toss!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">If you can't do it alone, then cooperate with others.</p><p class="calibre4">We both only have one life left. If we fight too much with each other, we might end up in a standoff.</p><p class="calibre4">First of all, we must get Rei and Mia to have the same remaining lives as us. By doing so, the game is back on track, in a sense.</p><p class="calibre4">"Is there a coop-play option?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"If I say there is, then there is!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">With so much outcry, the ball leaves Kanon's hands.</p><p class="calibre4">It's headed for me, her alliance partner.</p><p class="calibre4">It's at the perfect height and speed for an easy toss. This way, I can return it to a good position.</p><p class="calibre4">"Do it! Kanon!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I throw up a toss based on Mia's earlier move.</p><p class="calibre4">For the first timer, it flies to a good position.</p><p class="calibre4">"Great!"</p><p class="calibre4">Kicking the sand and leaping up, Kanon bends her body back greatly as she did before.</p><p class="calibre4">The person to whom she is turned is Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">Apparently, the fact that she almost had her own breast size revealed is still lingering on her mind.</p><p class="calibre4">But she doesn't spike it right away.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――Sorry, Rintaro." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">As she says this, Kanon twists her body in the air.</p><p class="calibre4">"Anything is fine as long as I don't end up being the one being punished!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Then, with her flexed arms, she launches a spike "at me".</p><p class="calibre4">The powerful shot from an impossible posture, created by her amazing leaping ability and flexible body, will be impossible to receive at first sight.</p><p class="calibre4">But if you're prepared, it's a different story.</p><p class="calibre4">"As pre-dic-ted, Kanon." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I had been tossing the ball on the assumption that I would be betrayed from the start. I had no reason to cooperate with her in the first place, since it would be more efficient to aim at me, who would lose with just one more miss.</p><p class="calibre4">No matter how powerful her spike is, it is still inferior to a spike from the correct posture. As long as I know she will aim for me, even I should be able to return it.</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuuh!? What is that!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Traitor, you shall――――DIE!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I receive the spike with the core of my arm. If you play it straight, it should land at Kanon's feet.</p><p class="calibre4">But it doesn't work that way.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ugh......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">The force of the spike should be lower than that of the previous one, but my body can't kill the impact.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball is bounced in a strange direction, and with a strong rotation, it flies in an unexpected direction.</p><p class="calibre4">The direction is, coincidentally, exactly between Rei and Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">""I'll――――."" (Rei, Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">It was so sudden that both of them shouted at the same time.</p><p class="calibre4">As a result, both of them stop, and the ball, which is almost to the ground, falls to the sand without being blocked by anyone.</p><p class="calibre4">"...... This means?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah...... it fell between, so both of them lost each one life! Good job, Rintaro! That's what coop-play is all about!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"You betrayed me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Wh-what are you talking about?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">When I glare at her, she turns away and starts whistling badly.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, let's just forgive her. As a result, I was able to reduce their remaining lives, the two most difficult ones to deal with.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmmm, you got us. We couldn't decide which way to hit at that timing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"So frustrating ......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">From this point on, no matter who misses, the loser is decided, and the game is over.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei and Kanon won't be able to carelessly hit a strong spike considering the possibility of making a mistake.</p><p class="calibre4">My policy remains the same.</p><p class="calibre4">I will defend thoroughly and wait for the three of them to make misses.</p><p class="calibre4">I am not going to get subjected to this penalty game.......!</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-16"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">"It was a miss on both of our parts, so which of us can start over again?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, that's fine, isn't it? As long as both parties agree." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see. Rei, which would you prefer?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia and Rei each discuss it, and finally it is decided that Mia will take it.</p><p class="calibre4">Mia plays with the ball in her hand, and then she takes her turn to look at each of our faces.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, there wasn't a rule against spiking the ball on the restart, was there?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You...... you don't mean." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Now I can slam the ball into any opponent, does each of you have a plead for your life?" (Mia)</p>
<p class="calibre4">She smiles a black smile at us and we take a step back, rubbing the sand in front of her.</p><p class="calibre4">If she hits from the front, Rei and Kanon can handle it, but I can't.</p><p class="calibre4">In other words, I am the only one who needs to be off of her target at all costs.</p><p class="calibre4">"I-I found a blue gemstone necklace that I thought would look good on Mia at the station....... I might give it to her as a gift next time....... ehehehe." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmmm, I see." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia is grinning and listening to Kanon's plea.</p><p class="calibre4">By now, Rei, standing next to her, had a look of regret on her face.</p><p class="calibre4">"I understand what Kanon is offering. Then how about Rei?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......Let-let's go eat...... spicy food together." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh! You've always been so stubborn about not following me when I told you I was interested in it...... Great, you're a great life pleader." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Spicy food, eh?</p><p class="calibre4">I will cook as many of those as she wants――――and yes, let's go with this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Then, lastly, Rintaro-kun. Do you have any last words?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......I'm going to cook for you for a week, apart from Rei." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"――――I see, I see I see! Yep, it's decided." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia tosses the ball high.</p><p class="calibre4">Gaining momentum with her arms, she takes a strong leap forward and raises her arms.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm going for...... you!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">A spike that is second to neither Rei's nor Kanon's is released.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball is headed for――――Kanon.</p><p class="calibre4">"Why me!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry Kanon, but I have bought that necklace for myself♪." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Idioooooooot! Ugh!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, Kanon's receive is barely in time and the ball is bounced in the wrong direction.</p><p class="calibre4">The direction of ball seems to be flying toward me, but with this momentum, it should be out.</p><p class="calibre4">Convinced of victory, I stop in my tracks.</p><p class="calibre4">But then a tragedy occurs.</p><p class="calibre4">A strong wind blows onto the beach.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball, which is bigger and softer than the ones used in volleyball, is pushed by the force of the wind and rapidly slowed down.</p><p class="calibre4">As a result, the ball, which is supposed to go out, shifted its landing spot into the circle.</p><p class="calibre4">(This is not good――――!)</p><p class="calibre4">I am the closest to the ball.</p><p class="calibre4">If the ball continues to fall, it will be my miss. I have to prevent that at all costs.</p><p class="calibre4">"Make iiiiiit!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">With a shout, I reach out with my foot.</p><p class="calibre4">My foot, sliding under the ball, bounces it up with a solid impact.</p><p class="calibre4">(I made it!)</p><p class="calibre4">But that is the end of my heroics.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball is still rotating strongly because Kanon failed to properly kill the rotation of the ball.</p><p class="calibre4">The ball leaves my foot and does not fly inward, but falls on the sand outside of the circle.</p><p class="calibre4">"I――――I did it, I did it! Don't underestimate my luck, okay!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"N-no way......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I am just stunned as the ball rolls in front of me.</p><p class="calibre4">I know that I lost.</p><p class="calibre4">Then someone taps me on the shoulder.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro-kun, you lost." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......you don't have to tell me that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Now, what should I ask you for?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia and Kanon are smirking at me as I stand up.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei is not that blatant, but her hands are clearly in a triumphant pose. Apparently, not a single one of them is on my side.</p><p class="calibre4">"......O dear princesses, please state your wishes." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Dear princesses, you say, what a pleasant thing to hear. Hmmm, what should we do, girls." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Won't it make their wishes a little bit easier if I treat them like princesses?　</p><p class="calibre4">The girls, who have no way of knowing what is going on in my mind, begin to secretly discuss the matter in front of me.</p><p class="calibre4">Maybe I should run away. Though, I'm sure I'll get caught before then.</p><p class="calibre4">"I....... prefer not to do it now. I want to save it for later." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh, you're okay with that, too, right? Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p>
<p class="calibre4">That's what I'm afraid of not being ordered right now, but――――I have an image that Rei is going to make the safest request.</p><p class="calibre4">If it can be put off, that might help.</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't mind. It would be even better if you could just forget about your right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, I won't. I'll remember it forever." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......Is so?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">If Rei says she'll remember it, she'll really remember it forever.</p><p class="calibre4">"If you don't mind with that, I'll do so too, then. I can't think of anything in particular for now." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... You're right, I'll go with that too." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">In the end, no one give me any orders.</p><p class="calibre4">But the fact that they are all put off their orders means that I have to be on my toes at all times――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"For God's sake, be easy on me, will you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll do my best." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll do my best." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I should do my best, I guess." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Aah, this might be a bad idea.</p><p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre4">The devil's game in beach volleyball skin was over, and we were peacefully enjoying the ocean from then on.</p><p class="calibre4">We swam around, tried our hand at building a castle out of the sand, buried Kanon in the sand we collected when we couldn't make it in the end, let Kanon break a watermelon that the staff had apparently prepared for her, and let Kanon bat around in circles in the process.</p><p class="calibre4">By the time the sun was setting, the three energetic idiots looked exhausted, and we returned to the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, there is no way that the girls are tired while I am not, and to be honest, I feel so tired that I don't want to move even one inch.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But there is still something I have to do.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rascals! It's barbecue time!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh! I've been waiting for it!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Leaving aside a retort of "we are not rascals", the four of us are working together to carry the ingredients to the cooking area outside the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">The meats, including sausages and other such items, are not cheap, but are all well-processed products. Grilling them over a charcoal fire must be delicious.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, grill me a lot of meat." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hold on, hold on. We haven't even started the fire yet." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I suppress Rei's urging and prepare charcoals and an igniter.</p><p class="calibre4">The actuality is that I've never done the work of lighting a charcoal fire outside like this, so I've been secretly longing to do this.</p><p class="calibre4">With my heart racing, and following the fire-starting manual in the cottage, I start to light the fire. It is my first time doing this, so I struggle with it for a while. When I finally succeeded in lighting a decent charcoal fire, I feel a sense of accomplishment run through my entire body.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, you have a face of a boy." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huh? That's because...... I'm a boy." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm, that's not what I meant, but ...... it's hard to explain." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">What does she mean? Well, she doesn't know herself, so how could I know that?</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry to keep you waiting." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"No problem. I wasn't bored when I saw Rintaro-kun's excited face." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's up with you girls...... all you do is talk about my face." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Did I look that weird?</p><p class="calibre4">Well, whatever, right now I need to grill some meat for the wait.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-6"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">The sausages and vegetables are arranged on a grill placed on top of the coals. I have skewered the chunks of meat on skewers so that they are easy to hold and eat.</p><p class="calibre4">The girls, sitting on outdoor chairs, have been watching me working like this since a while ago. It's not that they are in my way or anything, but it's just a little awkward.</p>

<p class="calibre4">"......It's kinda making me feel uncomfortable." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry, but it's very interesting." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Interesting?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">What do you mean, talking like a scientist all of a sudden?</p><p class="calibre4">What is so interesting about a guy working in silence?</p><p class="calibre4">"I mean, I've never had the chance to see you cook in the flesh before. So, it's kinda refreshing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Aah, what the heck is that. It's not really interesting, though." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Even if it is not interesting, yet oddly......I still watch it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">That's should be my line――――Well, whatever.</p>
<p class="calibre15"></p><p class="calibre4">I never think that if I accept this situation easily, I will run out of luck and feel like I will die tomorrow. I'm just worried about Kanon and the girls. I'm serious, okay?</p><p class="calibre4">Mia, who had been laughing at this exchange between Kanon and me, opens her mouth in resignation.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, well, don't blame Kanon too much. We're in on this too." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What? Might you guys have mistaken me for a plant or something?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"We don't think of you that far, though. I've been told that I'm still a top idol, but I'm a little unsure of myself." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm the kind of person who would never make a move if it didn't make sense. I'd rather they say I'm a manly man." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then I feel rather safe. You can put sunscreen on us without feeling guilty." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I feel like I'm being seduced.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not saying you have to do it to all of us. Just pick one person to put on the sunscreen." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuuh...... why don't you guys just put it on each other?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"The person you choose here will be sleeping in the same room with you tonight." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Is this a hell?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">What's with that ultimate choice――――.</p><p class="calibre4">I had a walk through the cottage earlier, and there were only two rooms for bedrooms on the second floor.</p><p class="calibre4">Two bedrooms with two beds inside. In other words, only two people can sleep in one room.</p><p class="calibre4">I know that even putting on sunscreen is agonizing, but to have another step beyond that is more than a reward, it's a punishment.</p><p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4">I try not to worry about it, and proceed with the grilling.</p><p class="calibre4">The heat level is not bad. At this rate, the beef would be cooked just right in no time.</p><p class="calibre4">"Alright, I guess this is about right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I place the cooked meat on each paper plate in turn and add vegetables for garnish.</p><p class="calibre4">Some might say, "It's a BBQ, so don't worry about presentation," but as a cook, I want the food to look appetizing visually.</p><p class="calibre4">"It's done. The sauce is there, but it's already lightly seasoned with salt and pepper, so it's good just as it is." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"""Bon appétit."""</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh, enjoy." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">The three of them, who appear to have been quite hungry, devour the meats ravenously.</p><p class="calibre4">Even though they were simply grilled, it is nice to know that they are so enthusiastic about what I have made.</p><p class="calibre4">"Is it good?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro-kun...... are you sure these are just grilled meats?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What? Yes, they're." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"They're cooked just perfectly...... not too soft, not too hard, just right." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Heeh, then I guess the doneness suits Mia." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Doneness?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You know, there's a certain doneness to steak, right? Such as medium and well done." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre15"></p><p class="calibre4">Leaving aside a retort of "we are not rascals", the four of us are working together to carry the ingredients to the cooking area outside the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">The meats, including sausages and other such items, are not cheap, but are all well-processed products.

When I finally succeeded in lighting a decent charcoal fire, I feel a sense of accomplishment run through my entire body.</p><p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4">He use such fashionable words, but the point is the difference between raw and well-done. This is the level of basic knowledge that you will be asked by the waiter whenever you go to a steak restaurant.</p><p class="calibre4">"No, I know that, but...... don't tell me you're still trying to cater to our tastes even here?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What nonsense? Naturally I am." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... I'm amazed." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">My pride won't allow me to make them eat something tasteless.</p><p class="calibre4">In order to make them eat good food, I don't care how much trouble I have to go through.</p><p class="calibre4">"If you want something grilled a little differently, don't hesitate to ask me. I can't do anything about the one I just cooked, but I'll use it as a reference from now on." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, I prefer it if you cooked it a little more. I don't really like the rarer the doneness." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Kanon prefers well done. Okka~y, I'll remember." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre15"></p><p class="calibre4">Leaving aside a retort of "we are not rascals", the four of us are working together to carry the ingredients to the cooking area outside the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">The meats, including sausages and other such items, are not cheap, but are all well-processed products.

<p class="calibre4">Well done means that the meat is cooked until it is no longer red inside.</p><p class="calibre4">I look at Rei and she shakes her head.</p><p class="calibre4">"I like it this way too. Very satisfying." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Rei and Mia prefer medium. Got it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Medium is the state of being between rare, which is almost raw, and well-done, which is cooked through, with a slight redness remaining in the center.</p><p class="calibre4">With this, it seems like I only need to make a little effort on Kanon's. I said I don't care how much trouble I have to go through, but if it can be cut down even a little, then I'll be more than happy.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, I've left you to do the grilling all the time, but you also want to have some, don't you, Rintaro? If you do, I'll take over." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? I appreciate your concern, but this is something I want to do. Of course, if Kanon wants to take over, I'll change my mind." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, that's not what I mean....... but if you say so, then I'll leave it to you. I don't think I can do it any better than you." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's too much praise." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"If you're trying to be humble by saying so, then you should drop the smug look on your face......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Oops, I guess I'm getting carried away with the praise and it's showing on my face.</p><p class="calibre4">I feel embarrassed to tell them this, but the reason I have come to enjoy cooking from the bottom of my heart is because they enjoy my food and give me feedback.</p><p class="calibre4">The more I think about cooking to make people happy, the more my motivation goes up.</p><p class="calibre4">I want people to say it tastes delicious more――――This desire becomes the source of my action before I know it.</p><p class="calibre4">"Eat up. I'll grill you as much as I can." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">In a good mood, I put more meat on the grill.</p><p class="calibre4">Watching an opportunity, I also eat what I have cooked, and we're all enjoying the BBQ.</p>
<p class="calibre15"></p><p class="calibre4">I never think that if I accept this situation easily, I will run out of luck and feel like I will die tomorrow.

<p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre4">"Aah! I'm so full! I can't eat any more!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon's voice echoes in the night sky.</p><p class="calibre4">She may want to show that she's full anyway, so she sits down on a chair and pats herself on the stomach.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder if her fans will ever see her like this.</p><p class="calibre4">"Thank you, Rintaro. The food was all delicious." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I was confident in my grilling skills, but it all came down to the ingredients you provided. ......Thanks for having me, even though this was a vacation for three of you. That...... was more fun than I thought it would be." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"......You thought, I'm glad you had a good time." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei smiles reassuringly.</p><p class="calibre4">There is no lie in my words.</p><p class="calibre4">I never get bored with them, and even though I had a bad time at beach volleyball, playing a game of penalty among friends was something that had never occurred to me before in my life.</p><p class="calibre4">How could it not be fun?</p>
<p class="calibre15"></p><p class="calibre4">Leaving aside a retort of "we are not rascals", the four of us are working together to carry the ingredients to the cooking area outside the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">The meats, including sausages and other such items, are not cheap, but are all well-processed products.

<p class="calibre4">"...... Rintaro-kun, I don't think it's fair to wear that expression, you know?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What? I've been like this since the BBQ started, but today you guys are making too many comments about my face, aren't you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's true. Because you're the reason why." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eee......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I don't know what Mia means by that.</p><p class="calibre4">You can't see your own expression unless you are looking in a mirror.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, then. Now that the fun meal is over, let's prep ourselves ready to go to bed. It will be a hassle to have to take a shower right before bed, won't it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia's suggestion seems plausible, and we all agreed.</p><p class="calibre4">The time is still just shy of twenty o'clock. We can still enjoy the night. And in order to fully enjoy the time, it is better to finish everything that needs to be done.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ri-n-ta-ro?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"What the hell, Kanon. That's creepy." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Can't you use a little more subtlety in your cussing?" (Kanon)</p>
<p class="calibre15"></p><p class="calibre4">Leaving aside a retort of "we are not rascals", the four of us are working together to carry the ingredients to the cooking area outside the cottage.</p><p class="calibre4">The meats, including sausages and other such items, are not cheap, but are all well-processed products.

<p class="calibre4">It can't be helped since the way she called me was creepy.</p><p class="calibre4">I have a bad feeling about it, but I urged Kanon to continue.</p><p class="calibre4">"You aren't thinking of soaking yourself in our leftover bathwater, are you?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Why should I bother myself to soak in hot water with oil oozing out of your skin?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"The way you say it! The way you say it!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Even family members sometimes feel a little uncomfortable with it, so no matter how many national idols they are, it's understandable that they would feel uncomfortable with it.</p><p class="calibre4">I have never shared hot water with Rei. In the first place, I don't soak in the bathtub in the summer, so there is no way for me to do so.</p><p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, this is no different in this cottage. I will just wash my body and be done with it.</p><p class="calibre4">"How about I go in first? Before you put the hot water on." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm...... that's a little boring, isn't it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Is there such a thing as a boring bath ......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"You see, now that we've got a man and women under one roof, I'd like to see more exciting happenings." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Aah, Mia has that look on her face when she's not thinking about anything decent.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't need such happenings, so please just let me wash myself leisurely.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, let's do it this way. Rintaro-kun, I'm going to use the right of order I just got here." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey......, what are you gonna order me to do?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Fufufu, I think I'm going to have you stay with me until I finish my bath." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">With a teasing look on her face, Mia announces.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-29">
  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment, Rei suddenly taps on the desk.</p><p class="calibre4">Her face looks very desperate and ghastly.</p><p class="calibre4">"I will use my right of order to dismiss it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? But that's a right to use against him, you can't stop me, can you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then I'll order Rintaro not to listen to Mia." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see. Well, that would certainly make my orders disappear. But you know what, Rei? Isn't that a little wasteful?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I only gave the order to take a bath together. Of course we will both be wearing swimsuits, and I'm not asking for anything more than that. But you've already bathed with Rintaro-kun, haven't you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's...... I have." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Hey, don't reveal it so easily.</p><p class="calibre4">Because that makes Kanon confused.</p><p class="calibre4">"If that's the case, why don't you issue a more radical order? You can do it if it's now." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Certain, ly?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">No, Rei is completely in Mia's hands now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I watch her as she dances on Mia's hand, but I will not help her in any way.</p><p class="calibre4">I can't refuse whatever they order me to do. If I were to intervene here and be given an even worse order, I might be made to feel as if I wanted to do so. I don't want to do that.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm passive here, no matter what......! That's it.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, my right to give orders will be carried out as it is. Let's get the hot bathtub right now." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... You're going to soak in the bathtub even in this d*mn heat?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Of course. It's necessary to keep your body in good shape. Or are you allergic to hot water?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm hoping I am, just for now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then that means there's no problem now. Come on, let's get ready." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">I never thought I would regret that I had not won that time so much.</p><p class="calibre4">What in the world did Mia want with me?</p><p class="calibre4">I'm convinced that she wants to make me fall in love with her and tease me, but――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ugh......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">In shame, I look at Rei and Kanon for the last bit of help.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, hey, what do you mean you two took a bath together? Please let me know." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Y-yea......, Okay." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">――――it doesn't look promising.</p><p class="calibre4">It's all over.</p><p class="calibre4">I give up and start preparing to take a bath with Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of the shower echoes in the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre4">Mia is standing in front of me, having changed from her casual clothes to her swimsuit again.</p><p class="calibre4">"How's the hot water, Mister?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">She picks up the shower and slowly pours hot water over my feet, just as Rei had done sometime before.</p><p class="calibre4">As she does so, Mia gently places her hand on my chest.</p><p class="calibre4">My heart jumps despite my thoughts, which I try not to be aware of.</p><p class="calibre4">The reason I am less agitated than I was with Rei is that I narrowly know that Mia is here to tease me.</p><p class="calibre4">The lack of naturalness makes it easier for me to keep my reason.</p><p class="calibre4">"Are you going to open a night bathhouse?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Fufu. I just wanted to play along. Maybe you're a little bit conscious of me now?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Stop it...... I'm trying to keep my rational mind off the fact that I'm taking a bath with a woman." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh my, it seems you were surprisingly conscious of me from the beginning. I thought you might actually be mature since you have never wavered.." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I've always been patient. Even when that time you made Rei seduce me, I gritted my teeth and persevered." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I desperately suppress my hands that want to touch them so as not to change the relationship we have now.</p><p class="calibre4">In the end, no matter how far I go, I am still nothing but a cowardly man.</p><p class="calibre4">No matter how attractive a woman is in front of me, I can't cross the line.</p><p class="calibre4">"It's also for our own good that you draw the line and keep yourself away from the man-woman relationship, isn't it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......I don't know what you're talking about." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">"――――I mean, you could've at least given us a little hand." (Mia)</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, it's nothing. I can't speak about others, and you're not being honest either." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"If I'd lived an honest life, I wouldn't be here in the first place." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"......that might be true." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">I'll pretend I didn't hear Mia's line earlier.</p><p class="calibre4">I sensed a hint of darkness about something in her words. It must have been something that she herself did not intend to say.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We went off-topic because it was an area we didn't want to be touched.</p><p class="calibre4">In that case, I'm going to take Mia's wish into consideration.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, since we're going to this trouble, I might as well have you wash my hair, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, that's not part of the order." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Just that much will be fine. Don't be stingy, okay?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">When I'm called stingy, it stimulates my revolting spirit――――</p><p class="calibre4">So, I end up standing behind Mia in the bath chair and put the shampoo out in the palm of my hand.</p><p class="calibre4">Then I run my fingers through her hair, which is well-wetted with hot water, and wiggle them around to create a lather.　</p><p class="calibre4">Perhaps because she usually takes good care of her hair, it is easier to run my fingers through her hair than I thought it'll be, and I enjoy washing her hair a little more.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah~...... this feels better than I thought it would." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I know how you feel. I don't mind being washed by other people either." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh, then, shall I do it for you later?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"If you can do it better than Rei, I'll leave it to you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What. Rei has already done it. Then I'll pass. I don't like to be second best." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Though it was you who put her up to it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Fufu. You're right." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">It's really a strange time.</p><p class="calibre4">Mia's head occasionally bobs in response to the movements of my hands as I silently wash her hair.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm a little amused by that, and my cheeks involuntarily broke into a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Hmm? Did something funny happen?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Nothing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're not doing that "Super Sa*yan" thing with someone's hair up, are you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not. You want me to do it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Do you think it suits me?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I think it suits you perfectly." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then don't do it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Tsk, how unfortunate." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">After washing every inch of her hair, I pick up the shower and start to wash off the lather from around her hair whorl.</p><p class="calibre4">I make sure she's clean and I put the shower back on.</p><p class="calibre4">"There, I'm done." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Thank you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What about the treatment?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll put some on after the bath that won't need to be rinsed off." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I wash my head and take a shower.</p><p class="calibre4">I wipe the water from my face with my hand and open my eyes to see Mia looking at me with a smile.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro-kun, you've finished washing your head too. Then, I guess it's my body next?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're going to make me wash your body, too?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"You've already put on sunscreen on my body, so there's nothing to be embarrassed about, is there?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's ...... true." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Unlike on Rei, you can use a sponge on me, you know." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Well, I think that's okay.</p><p class="calibre4">Although I have touched her with my bare hands, this time I feel that it is better to use a sponge.</p><p class="calibre4">This time, I lather up the sponge with body soap and lightly scrubbed Mia's back as she sits on the chair again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"......When you think about it, we're, doing some pretty embarrassing things, are we?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"In this case, you're the one who's making me do it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't be so hard on me." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">".......say." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Say what?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"How could you let this happen?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What do you, mean?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I think it's strange that you would let a man you don't even know who he touches you, even from a common sense perspective...... If it was just to stay with him, it would still be understandable, as is typical of high school students, but this is just――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I stop the hand that's scrubbing her back and look up.</p><p class="calibre4">I know why Rei is hitting on me.</p><p class="calibre4">If she shows her affection for me so clearly, it is obvious that I would notice it unless I am a dense protagonist who lacks some kind of emotion.</p><p class="calibre4">Although the reason for her affection itself has not been ascertained, it explains the source of her behavior.</p><p class="calibre4">As for Mia, at least I know she has no ill feelings toward me.</p><p class="calibre4">Otherwise, she would have refused to allow me to participate in this vacation.</p><p class="calibre4">However, not having ill feelings does not automatically equate to affection.</p><p class="calibre4">It's not a matter of logic, but I don't think Mia has feelings for me.</p><p class="calibre4">Sometimes she teased me in an obvious way, sometimes she didn't, and no matter how much time we spent together, the "Mia" that is supposed to be right in front of me remains elusive.</p><p class="calibre4">It's as if she's a fictional character――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"......I, you know, like you more than you probably think." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">She turns around and tells me this.</p>

<p class="calibre4">"Let's leave the details for another time. There's a right time to tell things." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......I see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I decided to withdraw from the conversation.</p><p class="calibre4">If she doesn't want to tell me at this point, she probably won't tell me anything, no matter what happens. No matter how much I question her, there is nothing but stress that will result.</p><p class="calibre4">Anyway, it is enough to know that there is a reason.</p><p class="calibre4">"At least I don't have any negative feelings toward you, so don't worry." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeah, I'll take that as a reassurance." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well then, can we continue?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... as you wish, milady." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I was a princess earlier, but now I got demoted?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"If you call yourself a princess, it makes me feel like I'm a prince or so, and that makes me cringe. However, if you call yourself a lady, that makes me feel more like a servant." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm, Rintaro as a servant....... it's not bad." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, I'm going to be cooking for you for a week after we get back, so in a way, I'm already like a servant." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ooh, you remember it. Impressive." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">The promise I had made during the beach ball game had been etched in my memory. It's not my principle to break a promise once made, even if it's inconvenient for me to do so.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Then why did you listen to her request the other day?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm aware of that myself. It's not healthy for a man and a woman of our age to take a bath together. However, you did what Rei asked and took a bath with her. This time with me is just a punishment game, but the time with her is not, is it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... You're right. I could have just said no if I wanted to." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">But I still didn't say no――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――I'm not going to tell you anyway." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Stingy." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You didn't tell me either, did you? So we're even." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Tsk. well, that's okay." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">In the end, Mia never asks me anything more.</p><p class="calibre4">One of the reasons I like Mia, and by extension all three of the MilleSta, is that they don't go into things others want to hide.</p><p class="calibre4">This distance between us, no matter how far, is comfortable for me.</p><p class="calibre4">"There, your back's done." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Thank you. Now do my front." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Alright, <b class="calibre5">"are you sure"</b>?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"...........As I thought, I'm not." (Mia)</p>

<p class="calibre4">Pfft, you coward.</p><p class="calibre4">It's a secret that I'm also relieved inside.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then how about having my feet washed instead? I'd feel like a real lady somehow." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What a bad taste......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's fine, isn't it? It's not like it's going to make me any less of a lady." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Well, it's better than washing her front.</p><p class="calibre4">Mia sits on the edge of the tub and points her toes in front of me as I kneel.</p><p class="calibre4">The angle from which I look up at her makes it possible for me to see the base of her thighs, which are hidden by her swimsuit, and my heart, which should have calmed down, jumps again.</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh my goodness? What's wrong, you turn your face away." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......it's nothing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm, well, I'll just do your honor and not pursue the matter any further." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">It is always made me think that men are weak creatures against women.</p><p class="calibre4">I run the foamy sponge over Mia's hairless legs.</p><p class="calibre4">Her thighs are the most reluctant for me to touch.</p><p class="calibre4">The moderate amount of flesh on the inner side of them is so soft even through the sponge, and my hand almost stops every time I do so.</p><p class="calibre4">However, if I stop my hand, it will take longer to finish washing――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"......H, hey, that's enough, isn't it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh!?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't just "Eh!?" me here!? If you want to humiliate me, you've already achieved your goal!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"A...... ah! You're right, this is enough. Yes, it is." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia flaps her hands in panic as she puts her feet down and stands up.</p><p class="calibre4">If I look closely, I can see that her face is also quite red.</p><p class="calibre4">Ah, so she is embarrassed as well?</p><p class="calibre4">"You're not used to this kind of thing, even though you're the one who initiated this." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"It......It is natural. I've never been touched by a man other than my father before." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You don't have to go this far, though." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">For the longest time, I couldn't understand why she would use her own body to make fun of me.</p><p class="calibre4">If she's enjoying it, it's fine, but if she's embarrassed like this, I think it's even more pointless.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm going to soak in the bathtub and then leave, so you can leave whenever you want." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm, I see. Then, I'll leave after I wash my body." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Sigh~. It seems that this is the end of my work for now.</p><p class="calibre4">In the end, it was a nothing event. It's just fortuitous that I was able to get her to use her right to order me to do something like this.</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">After getting out of the bath, I use a hair dryer to dry my hair while cooling my body that had been burned by the hot water.</p><p class="calibre4">About two months ago, I used to dry my hair with just a bath towel, but recently, after realizing that it has grown longer, a hair dryer has become a must for me to dry it off.</p><p class="calibre4">Just as the heat and moisture have dissipated from my body, the door to the changing room is suddenly opened with a loud noise.</p><p class="calibre4">I am just about to put on my loungewear so I quickly cover my waist with a bath towel.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei, the very one who opened the door, is looking at me with a more impatient face than before.</p><p class="calibre4">"......I'll just mention it since it's a common practice, but can you at least knock?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mia didn't do anything to you, did she?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"O-oh, she didn't do anything to me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"――――Okay, then that's fine." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">After telling her so, Rei closes the door to the changing room.</p><p class="calibre4">Is that what you want to ask a man when you peek into his dressing room?　</p><p class="calibre4">I thought I had understood a lot, but I guess I still didn't understand Rei very well.</p>


<p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre4">I have finished changing my clothes for a while. I am sitting on the sofa in the cottage's living room, licking a popsicle we have in the freezer.</p><p class="calibre4">Mia and Rei, who have already taken a bath, are sitting on the same sofa.</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon, the last one to take a bath, has not yet returned, and we are each busy with our phones, waiting for her to return.</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew~! I feel refreshed!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">While I'm browsing through the internet news, Kanon appears from the bathroom with a towel over her shoulder.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? What is it?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... No, it's nothing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuh? You're such a weird, Rintaro." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I swallow the words that are about to escape my mouth and let out a sigh instead.</p><p class="calibre4">I am tempted to say this again and again, but I still think they are too defenseless.</p><p class="calibre4">All three of them are dressed even more lightly than usual, probably because they have just finished bathing and feel hot.</p><p class="calibre4">They are dressed in shorts and T-shirts, which is far too stimulating for spending time under the same roof.</p><p class="calibre4">From the deepest bottom of my heart, I am so glad that I have a strong sense of reason.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, do you want some of this?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"You've been glancing at me since a while ago, so I thought maybe you were curious about this flavor." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I chose the grape flavor, while she chose the orange flavor. The taste is certainly different. However, it's not to the point I'm curious about――――</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, here it is." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei takes her mouth off the popsicle for herself and points the tip toward me.</p><p class="calibre4">Due to the heat in her mouth, the popsicle is a bit melted and about to fall onto the sofa. I find it strangely captivating.</p><p class="calibre4">"Putting aside the time we had bubble teas, I'll refrain from having what you have licked, no matter how much you've licked it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm...... Certainly there is the resistance of having what someone had licked." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei pulls back the popsicle and put it in her mouth again before the melted part falls out.</p><p class="calibre4">What is she going to do if I put it in my mouth without saying anything?</p><p class="calibre4">As I look sideways at Rei enjoying the popsicle without a change in expression, I suddenly have this question in my mind.</p><p class="calibre4">She must not have thought anything of it.</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that she offered it to me so easily makes it an act that didn't mean much to her.</p><p class="calibre4">――――I had not noticed the slight blush on her cheeks because I had made such an assumption.</p><p class="calibre4">Even if I do, I will have chalked it up to the fact that she has just had a bath.</p><p class="calibre4">And so I turn my eyes away from the crux of the matter once again.</p></div>
