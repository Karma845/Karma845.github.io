  <h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 6 - The secret I left behind in the summer</h1>


<p class="calibre1">"Now that we're all ready to go to bed at any time――――Let's play Old Maid!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Just like with the beach volleyball, Kanon suddenly suggests that.</p><p class="calibre1">She has a generic playing card in her hand.</p><p class="calibre1">From the look of excitement on her face, it seems that she has been planning to do it from the beginning.</p><p class="calibre1">"Interesting, so <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">what is the bet</i></b>?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia asks gleefully.</p><p class="calibre1">It seems that they have already decided to bet on something.</p><p class="calibre1">"Before, we had one right to order anything, but when it comes to Old Maid, one game and done is boring, so how about every time the game is over, the loser reveals a secret that he or she has been hiding?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hey...... Are you insane?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Well, it's just for fun, so you don't have to say anything you are not willing to say. There are lots of little secrets, aren't there?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Well――――, she has a point.</p><p class="calibre1">"But it's up to the others to decide if it's an acceptable secret or not. Otherwise, one would just reveal, "When I take a bath, I wash my head first" and the others can't do anything but accepted it." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"So you should be prepared to be humiliated to some extent, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"That's right. Are there any other questions?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Neither I, Mia, nor Rei can think of any specific questions.</p><p class="calibre1">In the Old Maid, there are no rules at all.</p><p class="calibre1">In the old-maid game, where there are many local rules, you just simply draw cards from your opponents one by one and discard them when you get a pair number.</p><p class="calibre1">There is no strategy in the beginning. It is only in the later stages of the game, when you gradually learn the habits of your opponents, that you finally begin to use your head.</p><p class="calibre1">In the end, it comes down to luck. That is why, unlike beach volleyball, there is a chance to win.</p><p class="calibre1">"Let's get started, then!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">We gather around the table and commence the game.</p><p class="calibre1">If you have a certain number of cards in your hand at the time you are dealt, you can feel like you have an advantage with a small number of cards――――, but in reality, however, it does not make that much difference because the cards start to not mesh later on.</p><p class="calibre1">The order is Rei takes Mia's card, Mia takes my card, I take Kanon's card, and then Kanon takes Rei's card.</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah, a pair." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">When Rei takes Mia's card, it seems that one pair is complete and she discards her cards on the table.</p><p class="calibre1">Looking at the number of cards in each player's hand, the average is seven.</p><p class="calibre1">By the way, I don't have the Old Maid. I hope I can keep my cards until the end.</p><p class="calibre1">"Here, draw mine!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Kanon's card is held out in front of me.</p><p class="calibre1">There are six cards. There is no point in being tense from this point on.</p><p class="calibre1">I reach for the card at the end of the deck.</p><p class="calibre1">"!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"...... Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Just as I'm about to draw it, her eyes widen.</p><p class="calibre1">If I move my hand to the other card, her eyes will return to normal.</p><p class="calibre1">But when I reach for that card at the end again, her eyes widen again.</p><p class="calibre1">――――I'll have to check this out.</p><p class="calibre1">"I'll take this one." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I draw out the card at the far end.</p><p class="calibre1">The word "Joker" is written proudly on the face of the card.</p><p class="calibre1">I don't believe it, but...... is this girl really weak in the Old Maid?</p><p class="calibre1">(......Anyway, I have to do something about the old maid that I have drawn.)</p><p class="calibre1">I'm forced to draw that card in the end, and I'm the one at the biggest disadvantage in this situation.</p><p class="calibre1">Mia is the one to draw the card from me.</p><p class="calibre1">I have to pass this card to her somehow......</p><p class="calibre1">"From Kanon's reaction just now, it seems that the old maid has moved on to Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Sigh~, you can see right through it, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Well, yea. I'm going to be very careful from here on out." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">As she says this, Mia begins to examine my expression.</p><p class="calibre1">Therefore, I decided to keep my mind clear.</p><p class="calibre1">It is not so difficult to avoid showing attitude unless the situation is directly related to winning or losing.</p><p class="calibre1">Even if she avoids drawing the old maid at this point, I still have a chance.</p><p class="calibre1">Rather, I think it is better than being drawn here and circling around and then coming back to me again.</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmmm, I see you can't afford to be beaten this time after all." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">In the end, Mia picks the right card.</p><p class="calibre1">Although it's not the Old Maid, it does not seem to have a pair with the cards in her hand, and without discarding anything, she holds out her cards to Rei.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei, feeling relieved to learn that Mia does not have the Old Maid from the previous exchange, draws her card.</p><p class="calibre1">This kind of exchange continues for several rounds, with everyone steadily reducing their cards except for me, who is left holding the Old Maid.</p><p class="calibre1">And finally――――.</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah, another pair." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei draws Mia's card and says this.</p><p class="calibre1">She then discards it along with a card in her hand, to the table, leaving her with only one card left.</p><p class="calibre1">Then, it's Kanon's turn to draw a card from Rei.</p><p class="calibre1">In other words, that one card will be gone during this turn.</p><p class="calibre1">"Tsk, At least you can have the winner." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Mm, thanks." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Thus, all the cards in Rei's hand are gone.</p><p class="calibre1">It's a clean sweep.</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmm, I've got a pair, too. Okay, your turn." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">After Kanon discards her cards, I reach for her remaining cards.</p><p class="calibre1">There are only two cards left. So Kanon will soon be done.</p><p class="calibre1">I, on the other hand, still have four cards. One of them is the Old Maid.</p><p class="calibre1">I want to make as many pairs as possible and increase the chances of getting the Old Maid to be drawn.</p><p class="calibre1">"Hurry up and draw. You still have the Old maid anyway, don't you?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"You can relax for now......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">On a hunch, I draw the left one of her cards.</p><p class="calibre1">The card matches in number with my card, and I'm able to move on.</p><p class="calibre1">I have three cards in my hand. This is enough to get the Old Maid to be drawn.</p><p class="calibre1">"Here, time to draw!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">".......You're being so aggressive just because your cards decreasing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">In this situation, Mia is at a mental disadvantage because of the fear of drawing the Old Maid. At this point, getting it can directly affect the outcome of the game.</p><p class="calibre1">"Fine then, this is it!" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia decides it's no use thinking much about it and draws a card from my hand.</p><p class="calibre1">At that moment, I involuntarily lift the corner of my mouth.</p><p class="calibre1">The old maid is no more.</p>


<p class="calibre1">"Wait a minute......! Don't tell me, Mia, you drew it?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Sorry, Kanon. But, I'd appreciate it if you'd take this nuisance off my hands." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"No! I'm not going to do that!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Oh, it's a flag.</p><p class="calibre1">By the time I thought so, it was already too late. Kanon brilliantly draws the Old Maid out of Mia's cards.</p><p class="calibre1">Of course, I can't tell, but her eyes already convey more than her mouth.</p><p class="calibre1">Now she has only two cards in her hand. One of them is the Old Maid, which means that there's a one-in-two chance that it may be drawn.</p><p class="calibre1">However, Kanon has a habit, which can be called a fatal one, that she had shown earlier.</p><p class="calibre1">"...... this is it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"What!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">The card I draw mercilessly is not the Old Maid, after all.</p><p class="calibre1">The expression on her face is too easy to understand. This way, there's no way I'll lose.</p><p class="calibre1">"It looks like I'm the runner-up." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I've got another pair.</p><p class="calibre1">I now have only one card left in my hand. And now it is Mia's turn to draw my card.</p><p class="calibre1">"Phew........., well, it's only the first round." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia draws my card, and I'm done.</p><p class="calibre1">And here is where the tragedy for Kanon happened.</p><p class="calibre1">"Oh, a pair." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia draws a card from me, and the card matches with one in her hand.</p><p class="calibre1">Then, by discarding them, she is left with only one card in her hand.</p><p class="calibre1">The turn proceeds, and it is Kanon's turn to draw a card from Mia. In other words, Kanon no longer has a chance to win.</p><p class="calibre1">"......You'd better remember this next game." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">With a frustrated look on her face, Kanon draws the last card.</p><p class="calibre1">"I don't mind listening to your ramblings, but I'd like to know Kanon's secret." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"We've known each other for quite a long time, but I'd like to hear Kanon's secret." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia and Rei, are very interested in Kanon's secrets, even though they have known her longer than I have.</p><p class="calibre1">It's true that after spending so much time together, there's probably not much that they don't know. Given that, it's no wonder they're curious.</p><p class="calibre1">"Fine...... I'm the one who started this. I'll reveal a proper secret of mine!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">I've never seen such a beautifully desperate person before.</p><p class="calibre1">"About that...... it's so embarrassing, but...... recently, I've shrunk a centimeter in height." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Ah, is so.......</p></p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-7">
  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre4">According to the profiles published by the management, Rei is 162 cm tall. Mia is 164 cm, and Kanon is 154 cm.</p><p class="calibre4">In other words, if she has dropped 1 cm from there, she should now be 153 cm.</p><p class="calibre4">Honestly, though, I really can't judge.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, actually, Kanon's tall profile is made by 2 cm taller. So, to be exact, she is now 151 cm." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's a cunning fudge......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Even if she is trying to make herself look tall, the number is too small.</p><p class="calibre4">By 2 cm. At least make it 5 cm. Well, if she does so, it will be easily found out.</p><p class="calibre4">"Why do you tell him that!? I saved it for later when I lost!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, Kanon. It can't be counted a secret as long as we know about it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Y-you're right.......!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I had never heard about the height reduction, so I guess it meets the criteria for the punishment game. When did you notice?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......It was when I was getting my swimsuit measurements done. When I got my measurement, I was 1 cm shorter than the results of my school health checkup." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">An awkward atmosphere hangs between us as we're listening to this.</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that Kanon says it with such a serious expression on her face makes it impossible for us to laugh it off. Physical appearances are not always easy to comment on.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Hey, it's okay, you know? To laugh." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Because, Kanon, you are concerned about your height, aren't you? That's why I thought it would be better not to touch it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not concerned about it in a weird way, okay! I love myself and that includes my height! All I care about is the balance between me and you two on stage!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Is that so?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"That is! Well...... I always wanted to be at least 155 cm high." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Listening to her, these words seem to be her honest feelings.</p><p class="calibre4">"I mean, don't you know? That shorter girls are more popular among boys." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmmm, I see what you mean. Well, let's ask Rintaro-kun about this matter." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Just fine! Go ahead, Rintaro, tell us." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Why are bullets being fired at me here?</p><p class="calibre4">No matter how much I wonder, the gazes of these three have already locked onto me and won't let me go.</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew...... I don't really care about the height, it all comes down to that person's appeal." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What do you mean?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"If you don't like a person's personality, you won't like them no matter how short and cute they are. Conversely, if you like someone, you will like them no matter how tall they are. Some people like a girl as long as she's good-looking, though." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"In the other words, you don't choose girls based on their height." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, if it's just a matter of preference, I like them shorter." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Just when it seems like it will end peacefully, you suddenly drop an outrageous bomb." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">The expression on Kanon's face brightens behind Mia's words.</p><p class="calibre4">Then, she comes closer to next to me and presses her head against my shoulder.</p><p class="calibre4">"Geez, so you understand. Look, as a reward for saying you like the smaller ones, you can pet my head, okay?"</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm sorry to interrupt your pleasure, but I didn't say I liked the smaller ones." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I said I like them shorter. Shorter <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">than me</i></b>." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I look at them one by one.</p><p class="calibre4">The tallest of them all is Mia, who, as I said before, is 164 cm.</p><p class="calibre4">But even at that height, she is more than 10 cm shorter than me.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, how tall are you?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"178 cm." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"It is too big of a gap." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">One is stunned, another one is relieved, and the last one is impressed.</p><p class="calibre4">"Conversely, I don't like to be halfway. If she's tall, I want her to be considerably taller than me, and if she's short, I want him to be distinctly shorter than me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"......Then, we all meet your criteria, don't we?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't deny that. That's why I said I don't really care." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I! I feel like I'm being swayed around by you all day!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon exclaims, as her face turns bright red.</p><p class="calibre4">Rather, I think it's me who's being swayed around, since she's the one suggesting all these games.</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, that's fine...... I've told you one of my secrets, let's get on with the next game." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Shouldn't we switch our positions now?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What? Should we do?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"No...... it's not like we should do." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's too much hassle, so let's just leave it like this. Come on, I'll deal you the cards." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I suggested this for your sake, though.――――Well, if you want to keep it like this, that's great for me. As long as it's in this order, I know where the Joker is.</p><p class="calibre4">A few rounds after the next game started easily.</p><p class="calibre4">Surprisingly, Kanon was out as the winner, and then I was the runner-up.</p><p class="calibre4">Thus, it was Mia and Rei's game, with Rei holding the Old Maid.</p><p class="calibre4">"I envy your poker face at times like this." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's not like I'm conscious of it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">There is no doubt that Rei's expressionless face has intensified since the Old Maid game started.</p><p class="calibre4">Adding up Kanon and dividing by two would have made it just fine.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Well, I guess I'll pick this one." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">In the end, Mia stops thinking and draws one of her two cards at random.</p><p class="calibre4">At that moment, Rei's expression clouds over for a moment.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, a pair." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">With these words, the last card is discarded from Mia's hand.</p><p class="calibre4">With this, the game is over and the loser is decided to be Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm...... I lost by sheer luck." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's bad." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I can't help it. Then, I will tell you my secret." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei's secret, huh?</p><p class="calibre4">She is rather open about everything, which makes me wonder what her secret is that she has never told anyone before.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Sometimes, I get hungry in the middle of the night. So I get up and unlock Rintaro's room with a duplicate key and――――" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">――――Hmm?</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm sneakingly snacking some leftover side dishes and some rice." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">""Bwah!"" (Rintaro, Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I and Kanon gush out.</p><p class="calibre4">And then we both simultaneously draw closer to Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">"I told you to stop eating at night because it makes you fat, didn't I!?"</p><p class="calibre4">"I was wondering why there were fewer leftovers, but it was your doing, huh!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Uuu...... I'm sorry." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">It is only a trivial incident that happens about once a week, but there have been several times when I woke up in the morning and decided to make lunch boxes, but there were not enough rice and side dishes.</p><p class="calibre4">I have wondered about that. However, I never thought that someone was snacking on them, and at that time I convinced myself that I just had misjudged the portion.</p><p class="calibre4">I never thought there might be rats here.</p><p class="calibre4">"I had the trouble of remaking the insufficient portion the next day, so...... next time you want some, just wake me up and let me know." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Still, I'm really sorry about that." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm slightly more averse to making you eat cold leftovers.......Then, I'll make you some rice balls for dinner, so put up with it next time, okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll do...... I'm very grateful for it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">This solved this problem for the time being.</p><p class="calibre4">The remaining problem is――――</p><p class="calibre4">"Re~iii~? Just because Rintaro spoils you doesn't mean I'll let you get away from this, okay." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Uuu...... sorry." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not mad at you, but the only reason you don't gain weight living like that is because of your youth, okay? You're going to get fat sooner or later." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"......from your experience?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm the same age as you, you idiot!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia sneaks over to my side while those two are having such a comic exchange.</p><p class="calibre4">"You look like a guardian, don't you, Kanon?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I guess. I've been doing it for years." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's because you have a lot of siblings. That's why you are so dependable when you are serious, Kanon." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Dependable. I think that is certainly true.</p><p class="calibre4">No matter what anyone says, I knew from the first time I met her that she was at least a more solid person than Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">However, what struck me was that night when she expressed her weakness.</p><p class="calibre4">So, being the only one who knows such a weak part of herself seems to give me an unexpected sense of superiority.</p>
</p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-30"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">"You there! Stop grinning!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Oops, the corners of my mouth turned up before I knew it.</p><p class="calibre4">I clear my throat and interject.</p><p class="calibre4">"I guess a sermon is needed, but for now, let's move on to the next game. We've only gotten two secrets revealed." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Tch, your life's been spared! Rei!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">You said you weren't going to be mad.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, guys, I have a suggestion." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What is it?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"How about we limit the game up to ten rounds? We haven't decided how long we're going to play after all." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, I think that sounds appropriate." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"And then, how about the person who loses in the tenth, the final round reveals his or her most embarrassing secret?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"!! I like that! I'm in!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">I'm glad to know that there would be a definite end in sight, not just a vague number of rounds until I got bored.</p><p class="calibre4">However, the part of reveal the most embarrassing secrets are a bit hard.</p><p class="calibre4">I feel that something half-baked is unacceptable――――And, I don't have many secrets of my own, to begin with.</p><p class="calibre4">"Now, let's start the third round." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">The cards are dealt again, and a new game begins.</p><p class="calibre4">Then the series of games continues for the next six rounds, but in the end, thanks to Kanon, I'm able to get through without losing a single game.</p><p class="calibre4">Now a total of eight rounds have been completed, and Kanon has been punished five times, Rei twice, and Mia once.</p><p class="calibre4">Then comes the ninth round, one step before the final round.</p><p class="calibre4">Mia, who has drawn the Old Maid from me, is holding it until the end of the game, and the game ends with her taking the punishment.</p><p class="calibre4">"Uhmm, how unfortunate. I was hoping to have Rintaro-kun reveal his secret by now, though." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry about it. But, it seems to be my lucky day." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, it's a game of luck anyway, so I guess it can't be helped. So, this is my second reveal." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">As Mia says this, her expression does not look too painful.</p><p class="calibre4">In contrast, Kanon is quite dejected.</p><p class="calibre4">This was the difference between having been revealed twice and five times.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ummm, yes. Did I mention that my underwear size doesn't fit anymore?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh,...... I've never heard of that before?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, then, I guess it's okay. Actually, the size of my swimsuit today is different from the previous one. I'm not wearing an F-size anymore." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, I don't want to hear it! I don't want to hear it anymore!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't say that, I'm telling you my secret, so you'd better listen to it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What kind of person you're to one-up the penalty games?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia tries to deliver her words in a whisper to the screaming Kanon.</p><p class="calibre4">I watch these two with a blank expression on my face more than Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">I actually don't know how to ask this question, you know? But, I want to ask all the boys out there. If you are caught in this kind of situation, how should you respond?</p><p class="calibre4">For me, I will ignore any responses that might be construed as sexual harassment.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm going to ask a question similar to the one about height earlier, Rintaro-kun, do you prefer big ones, or do you prefer small ones?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......No comment." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh my, that's too bad." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">If there will ever comes a time when I will tell them my preference for breast size, it will be when I get punished. But now all that's left is the fateful tenth round. I haven't thought much about it, but it's a somewhat tenuous reveal to make if I lose here.</p><p class="calibre4">"Enough already! Look, the next round is the last! If you lose this one, you'll reveal a seriously embarrassing secret! Have any complaints!?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, but......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's the matter, Rintaro? Are you scared?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Well, if Kanon herself is willing to do it, then it's fine.</p><p class="calibre4">"Nothing. Here, hand them out." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm definitely going to make you cry!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Even though it's the last game, it's unlikely that I'll lose if I play the same way as before.</p><p class="calibre4">Everyone is steadily reducing their cards, and soon Mia and Rei are easily out.</p><p class="calibre4">The remaining players are me and Kanon. I have one card left in my hand and Kanon has two cards.</p><p class="calibre4">And, one of them is the Old Maid.</p><p class="calibre4">Once this situation is established, there's no way I'm going to lose.</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry, Kanon. This is the end." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Wh-what? I don't understand!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Gently, I reach for one of her cards.</p><p class="calibre4">As I am about to touch the card on the left, her expression changes.</p><p class="calibre4">This card is the Old Maid. I should draw the other card.</p><p class="calibre4">And I draw the card.</p><p class="calibre4">At that moment, Kanon smirks.</p><p class="calibre4">――――A bad feeling ran down my spine.</p>


<p class="calibre4">"You fell for it! Rintaro!" (Kanon) <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK!!!)</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">"Wha......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">The card I drew is the Old Maid.</p><p class="calibre4">I just stare at the card, stunned, not knowing what just happened.</p><p class="calibre4">"I've been planning for this moment......! The change of my expression when you drew the Old Maid was all an act! You were tricked so beautifully!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">She got me. Is this the acting ability of an idol?</p><p class="calibre4">"D*mn......, but this doesn't decide who wins, does it? It's a 50-50 chance anyway, and I can't see any chance you'll win this one!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew, what a fool. The one who took advantage of people's naivety to win the game of luck and I, who have carefully laid the foundation for the game so far, is in a different position! The goddess of victory smiles at me!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Kanon draws a card out of my hand.</p><p class="calibre4">The card left in my hand is the Old Maid.</p><p class="calibre4">"No...... way." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Now, let's hear you take your punishments of the final round, shall we?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Right in front of my eyes, a set of cards is discarded on the table.</p><p class="calibre4">Here we are――――I never thought I would lose only at the very end.</p><p class="calibre4">"I want to know Rintaro's big secret." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I totally agree with you. Normally, he would probably dodge the question, so I'm really anticipating this one." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Naturally, I have no allies.</p><p class="calibre4">I let out a big sigh and sit down deeply on the sofa.</p><p class="calibre4">I have one secret that I haven't told anyone. Just the thought of them knowing about it makes me overflow with shame, but since they've had to reveal their secrets too, it's no good for me to just run away.</p><p class="calibre4">"It's not a very interesting story......, but actually, you know, there's something I'm really not good with." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, what is it? Is it Food?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, not it...... It's thunder." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huuh?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">Next to Kanon, who has a puzzled expression on her face, Rei and Mia also have the same expression on their faces.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, that's the kind of reaction I expect.</p><p class="calibre4">"The sound of thunder, the tremors,...... and that moment when the black clouds flash,...... I'm really not very good at it. This year, there have been only a few thunderstorms, which is a relief, but when it happens in the middle of the night, I can't sleep unless I'm wrapped deeply in my quilt." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">""............"" (Rei, Kanon, Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Somehow, the three of them are listening to me in silence.</p><p class="calibre4">With a strange, unbearable atmosphere, I look at their faces to see their reactions.</p><p class="calibre4">Then, while making eye contact with me, Rei whispers something to me.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――So cute." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I burst into a cold sweat, wondering if there is anything more embarrassing in the world.</p><p class="calibre4">It is still better to be made fun of for being uncool. The word "cute" is the highest version of "you're not manly" for me.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ugh...... If you're disillusioned, then laugh more properly." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not disillusioned. Rather, it's nice to know that there are some flaws that I haven't been able to see in Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"P-please stop......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Even positive feedback is bad for me right now.</p><p class="calibre4">Two hands are placed on both of my shoulders as I struggle. When I turn around, I see Kanon and Mia standing behind me, having taken the trouble to walk around behind me.</p><p class="calibre4">"What a nice revealing, Rintaro." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre4">"Even if you have another tough night, we'll be there for you from now on." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Aaah, please k*ll me once and for all――――.</p>

</p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-24"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre1">"Well――――it's time to get to bed, guys." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia cut in and I look up.</p><p class="calibre1">After the humiliation I suffered, we were enjoying various card games with no specific punishment.</p><p class="calibre1">Doubts, millionaires, and the like. The game was more interesting than I had imagined, and before I knew it, it was already around midnight.</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah, you're right. Now thinking it's around the time to go to bed, I suddenly feel sleepy......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Mmm, Me too." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Now that she mentions it, I am certainly feeling sleepy as well.</p><p class="calibre1">If I let my mind wander and become dazed. It is only a matter of time before I fall asleep.</p><p class="calibre1">"Then I'll brush my teeth and go to bed......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I'll do that. Come on, you two, don't be lazy." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia, who still seems to be able to move, urges them on, and we brush our teeth and head to the bedroom.</p><p class="calibre1">The four of us enter the bedroom together, in which there are two beds.</p><p class="calibre1">Because of the sunscreen incident during the day, the four of us have to sleep together in this room with only two beds.</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, are you sure you want to sleep there?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Because it's a lot better than sleeping in the same bed with you girls. In fact, we should not even be allowed to sleep in the same room." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I have made a pseudo bedding with several blankets on top of each other in the space between the beds. Thanks to the layers of fairly good quality blankets, I could hardly feel the hardness of the floor when I lay down. I feel so exhausted now that I can easily fall asleep soundly.</p><p class="calibre1">"You're really sincere, aren't you? ......Rather, are you seriously not interested in us?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"I'm just trying not to be interested. If I were someone with ulterior motives, I wouldn't have been allowed to live on the same floor as you girls in the same apartment, would I?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Well, that's true. Mmm... Well yeah, I really commend you for not trying to do anything in this environment." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Furthermore, if I were such a person, Rei wouldn't have been so attached to me.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei is not a stupid person, although she is somewhat out of it.</p><p class="calibre1">Just because one is faithful to one's desires, it does not mean that one is a no-thinker.</p><p class="calibre1">She and the girls have allowed me to get this close to them.</p><p class="calibre1">I feel comfortable with this trust, and I don't want to betray it.</p><p class="calibre1">"Even for me, it's quite refreshing to have a boy being around in this way, and lately I've been enjoying my days a lot." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"I agree with you. A boy such as Rintaro isn't often around." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Although I don't feel bad about it, it really left me feeling creepy.</p><p class="calibre1">So I pull the blanket over my face, turn away, and close my eyes.</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah, you are running away." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Fufu, well, it's a problem if we pester him too much. So, let's give him some space." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">I can feel both of them lying down on the bed.</p><p class="calibre1">However, just as I am about to fall asleep, I hear a voice in my ear.</p><p class="calibre1">"Good night, Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"...... Yeah, good night." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">The voice of the girl who has made it possible for me to be here.</p><p class="calibre1">Her voice was so soothing and heartwarming.</p><p class="calibre1">In my sleep, I dream.</p>


<p class="calibre1">It was the scene of a party one day. That dream I've had many times.</p><p class="calibre1">A little blonde girl was sitting next to me.</p><p class="calibre1">She had her mouth full of the buffet meal I brought and a happy smile on her face.</p><p class="calibre1">As I thought, that face is――――</p><p class="calibre1">"Ugh!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">My consciousness is instantly pulled back to reality.</p><p class="calibre1">I feel a dull pain in my stomach. When I raise my head to see what it is, I see a girl's raw leg on top of me.</p><p class="calibre1">"Mmm...... give me some of those milk......" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"......Ugh, you're kidding right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Kanon, who was supposed to be asleep on the bed, just slammed a heel drop into me.</p><p class="calibre1">Come to think of it, this lass has a terrible sleeping posture――――.</p><p class="calibre1">(Remember it......)</p><p class="calibre1">My heart isn't small enough to wake her up and make petty complaints.</p><p class="calibre1">I put her body back on the bed, trying to make as little noise as possible. In doing so, I catch a glimpse of Rei, who is sleeping with Kanon.</p><p class="calibre1">In the end, Kanon and Rei ended up sleeping in the same bed, but yeah, it seems she is still safe for now.</p><p class="calibre1">Why the damage was done to me first and not Rei, who was sleeping right next to her――――I'm a little unconvinced, but well, I'm glad that I was the only one who was woken up here.</p><p class="calibre1">(......Let's have some water.)</p><p class="calibre1">The air-conditioned room is at a comfortable temperature, yet I'm feeling thirsty.</p><p class="calibre1">I leave the room and head for the kitchen, trying not to make a sound.</p><p class="calibre1">I pour a glass of water from the kitchen tap and slowly walk over to the window.</p><p class="calibre1">The view from the window is surprisingly bright.</p><p class="calibre1">It seems that a full moon is approaching. Not only the moon, but I can see a sky full of stars, probably because I am far from the city.</p><p class="calibre1">I'd like to see it a little closer――――</p><p class="calibre1">I thought so, put on my sandals and step outside.</p><p class="calibre1">"Whoa......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">The sky seen from an unobstructed location is completely different from what I have seen through the window glass.</p><p class="calibre1">When is the last time I was overwhelmed by nature?</p><p class="calibre1">Soon after, my sleepiness vanished and I am just trying my best to capture everything in my eyes.</p><p class="calibre1">"――――Rintaro?"</p><p class="calibre1">Suddenly, I hear a voice calling my name.</p><p class="calibre1">I turn around and there is Rei, who just stepped out wearing sandals just like me.</p><p class="calibre1">She looks at me and smiles with a delightful expression.</p><p class="calibre1">"I woke up and couldn't find you anywhere, so I was wondering if you were here." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Sorry, I thought I walked stealthily, did I wake you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"No, it was Kanon that woke me up. She gave me a fist to the ribs." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei rubs her side as she says this.</p><p class="calibre1">I was the one who laid Kanon back down next to her, so it was my fault as a result. Well, I don't dare to say it, though.</p><p class="calibre1">Let's blame it all on Kanon. That's the most peaceful way.</p><p class="calibre1">"I just woke up after getting a heel drop from Kanon, too. It was a disaster for both of us." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Really. But it was Kanon, so it can't be helped." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Haha, I can't be careful about the way she sleeps." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Unless I bind her body with a rope, she will never be able to correct her sleeping posture. But when I think of that posture, it is so surreal that it makes me laugh.</p><p class="calibre1">I turn to Rei again, clearing my throat and holding back my laughter for the sake of Kanon's honor.</p><p class="calibre1">"...... Can we talk for a minute?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"...... yes." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">We move to the beach and sit down on the mats we used to rest on during the day.</p><p class="calibre1">The parasol is closed and the view is open so that we can see the stars even on the mat.</p><p class="calibre1">"I was so tired from shooting all yesterday that I didn't even think to look at the stars like this. I didn't realize how magnificent they were." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"What a wasted opportunity. I guess I should be thankful to Kanon for today." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I guess so. I should thank her for waking me up." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Even if I express my gratitude to her tomorrow, she will probably just give me a dumbfounded look.</p><p class="calibre1">I want to say something sarcastic, but since I've had some good things happen, I decided not to.</p><p class="calibre1">"Do you want to, come back here again?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"If Rintaro is okay, I want to go on another trip with you like this. In the fall I want to go see the autumn leaves, in the winter I want to go skiing or to a hot spring...... in the spring, I want to see cherry blossoms, and in the summer, I want to come back here again. All with Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"......you want to be with me that badly?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei's eyes widen in surprise for a moment when I teasingly ask her this.</p><p class="calibre1">Then she narrows her eyes and gives a thin smile.</p><p class="calibre1">"――――Yes, I want to be with you forever." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">That is pure, unadulterated goodwill.</p><p class="calibre1">I avert my eyes from Rei and look up at the sky again.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ygvQyfh/u9785-c168ce90-3044-4253-a315-28488f9b6445.jpg" alt="u9785-c168ce90-3044-4253-a315-28488f9b6445" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">"Yeah...... me too." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Of my own volition, I said that for sure.</p><p class="calibre1">There's no way I can say such a thing while meeting her eyes.</p><p class="calibre1">I finally feel calm and can make eye contact with Rei again.</p><p class="calibre1">"Is that ...... true?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"I'm not going to lie in a situation like this. And I'm not going to change my mind once I've said it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"......I'm glad." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei is closing the distance between us a little.</p><p class="calibre1">The only distance between us is such that if we move even a little, we might touch each other.</p><p class="calibre1">It is irritating and frustrating.</p><p class="calibre1">If and only if <i class="calibre6">"I were not me"</i>, and <i class="calibre6">"Rei were not Rei"</i>, I could have ignored everything and touched her――――.</p><p class="calibre1">"Hey, Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"......What is it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"...... No, it's nothing." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"I see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">We both keep our mouths shut right there.</p><p class="calibre1">It is too early to move on from our current relationship.</p><p class="calibre1">As long as she continues to hold on to her dream, it is difficult to change our relationship.</p><p class="calibre1">Even if both Rei and I harbor a mutual feeling――――.</p><p class="calibre1">"Do you want to enjoy this sight a little longer?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Yes...... I do." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">We just look up at the sky and enjoy the starry night.</p><p class="calibre1">I shall keep this feeling a secret and leave it here, in this place, in this summer.</p><p class="calibre1">I hope one day I can come back here again and convey this feeling to her.</p></p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-18"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>

<p class="calibre1">"Why the h*ll is this happening ......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">When I wake up, I'm just stunned by the sight of the wrestling scene unfolding before me.</p><p class="calibre1">Or perhaps it's too one-sided to be called wrestling.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei and Kanon are sleeping in the same bed, and for some reason, Kanon's arm is wrapped around Rei's neck.</p><p class="calibre1">Or should I say, entangled from behind? Poor Rei, who is being subjected to such a technique, has been groaning in agony since a while ago.</p><p class="calibre1">The strength of the stranglehold is not death-defying, but Rei must be having nightmares about being entangled with an octopus right now.</p><p class="calibre1">When I think about it, Kanon's hair color is starting to resemble a boiled octopus, too.</p><p class="calibre1">"Eh, good morning, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah, you're awake. Oh, good morning." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia picks herself up behind me as I look at Rei and Kanon.</p><p class="calibre1">She spills a single sigh and gives me a grin and a teasing look.</p><p class="calibre1">"By any chance, were you enjoying Rei's and Kanon's sleeping faces? If so, I'm sorry to have disturbed you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Don't be ridiculous. Look at this scene before you start spouting off like that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I point to the bed with my chin, and Mia gets up from the bed and looks down at them as I do.</p><p class="calibre1">Then, as if sensing the situation, she let out an "ah" sound.</p><p class="calibre1">"This is, by far...... the worst sleeping posture I've ever seen." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Heeh, you can call this a masterpiece." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">'It's not like she's falling out of bed or anything. But I'm starting to feel sorry for Rei." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"....... I agree, shall we wake her up." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Mia reaches for Kanon's shoulder and shakes her body.</p><p class="calibre1">Then, slowly she comes to her consciousness and wakes up.</p><p class="calibre1">"Good morning, Kanon. Can you please let Rei go now?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Mmm...... kay...... eh? Hey, why is Rei here?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">She still seems to be half awake.</p><p class="calibre1">Kanon, who takes her arm away from Rei, slowly raises herself from the bed.</p><p class="calibre1">"......Ah, yes. I'm staying at the cottage, right? And......" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"You're still weak in the morning as usual, aren't you? There, go wash your face." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Okay......" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Without seeming to comprehend anything about the situation, Kanon is making her way out of the room.</p><p class="calibre1">Yup, it's dangerous.</p><p class="calibre1">"I don't want her to fall down the stairs, so I'm going to go along with her. Can you wake Rei up for me?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Okay. I'll leave her to you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">After exchanging such a conversation with Mia, I follow Kanon out of the room.</p><p class="calibre1">Kanon is walking down the stairs in a daze as she exits the hallway.</p><p class="calibre1">I rush over there and support her body.</p><p class="calibre1">"Hey, walk properly." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Mmm......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"You look astonishingly dazed." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">While supporting her with my hands around her waist, I go down the stairs.</p><p class="calibre1">I walk her to the bathroom and stand her in front of the mirror.</p><p class="calibre1">"Here, wash your face." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Mmm......" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">I turn on the tap, and she begins to wash her face in front of my eyes.</p><p class="calibre1">It feels somewhat like I'm taking care of an animal――――.</p><p class="calibre1">"Eh... Rintaro?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Oh, good morning." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Through the mirror, I meet Kanon's eyes.</p><p class="calibre1">Her face gradually turns red, and she suddenly turns around vigorously.</p><p class="calibre1">"Why is Rintaro in my house?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"This is not your house. Look closely." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"What!? A-ah, yes! You're right! We are at the cottage......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Looking flustered, Kanon mended her remarks.</p><p class="calibre1">What is there to be so flustered about? As I am puzzled, she begins to repeatedly splash water on her face as if to cool her heated face.</p><p class="calibre1">"I thought you finally brought me into your home......." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"As if that would happen." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"How can you hear me!? If this is a romantic comedy situation, your hearing loss should be on full display." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"How can I not hear you when you're talking to me at this distance? Think realistically." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I know that! I know, but!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Why on earth am I being pissed off?　</p><p class="calibre1">Well, I've always been thinking that they are incomprehensible people, so let's not argue with them at every turn.</p><p class="calibre1">"So, why were you behind my back?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"I just worried because you were half awake and staggering down the stairs." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Nursing......!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"You shouldn't have arrived at that conclusion." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I did think that on the way down here.</p><p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes, you two. Don't start flirting in the morning and vacate the washbasin. I'm having a hard time behind you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"...... sleepy." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">It seems that the second nursing need has arrived.</p><p class="calibre1">Mia pulls Rei's hand, who is rubbing her sleepy eyes, moves her to the front of the washbasin, and makes her wash her face in the place of us.</p><p class="calibre1">Now――――let's make breakfast while they're at it.</p><p class="calibre1">I move to the kitchen and put the eggs and bacon on the stove and the bread in the toaster.</p><p class="calibre1">I'm kind of sad to think that I'll have to say goodbye to the island kitchen.</p><p class="calibre1">I hope I'll get to live in a house like this someday.</p><p class="calibre1">◇◆◇</p>


<p class="calibre1">"You guys, is there anything you forgot?" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Kanon, who is pulling a suitcase, turns around and asks us.</p><p class="calibre1">Originally, I had only stayed one night, so I didn't have much luggage, and one rucksack was all I needed. I didn't need to take out any valuables, so I can assure myself that I didn't forget anything.</p><p class="calibre1">What worries me is the two girls who are pulling their suitcases rattling behind me.</p><p class="calibre1">"I checked it several times, so I'm fine. What about you, Rei?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"I'm fine too.......I think." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Hmm, I'm worried.</p><p class="calibre1">Well, I've reviewed it many times to assuage that concern, and it's probably fine. If worse comes to worst, I'm sure they'll find it when they clean up.</p><p class="calibre1">"Ah, but there's something I forgot, or rather...... left undone." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"What? The cab's already here." (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">"Let's all take a picture." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">――――Oh, I see.</p><p class="calibre1">I can see Kanon and Mia smiling at each other.</p><p class="calibre1">They stand around Rei and put their bodies together.</p><p class="calibre1">"C'mon, Rintaro-kun." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hurry up and get over here! Get in the picture together, the four of us!" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Even though it is summertime, being so close together ...... is very hot and uncomfortable.</p><p class="calibre1">Even though in my head I think so, my feet are naturally walking under these girls.</p><p class="calibre1">After all, it is no exaggeration to say that I enjoyed myself this summer frolicking around without worrying about the eyes of those around me. Refraining from doing so in a place like this would benefit nothing.</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, come to the middle." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hey...... isn't this too extravagant?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"What is?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"......Nothing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Taking a picture surrounded by these three popular idols.</p><p class="calibre1">This will be a treasure of a lifetime.</p><p class="calibre1">Kanon and Mia pull me and lead me to come under Rei.</p><p class="calibre1">I crouch down, and as I raise my eyes a little, I see Mia's smartphone in my field of vision.</p><p class="calibre1">Is this the rumored selfie? I don't know whether it was a rumor or not.</p><p class="calibre1">"Now, I'll take a shot. Gather more in the middle." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"Wa-wait a minute! I'll lost my balan――――" (Kanon)</p><p class="calibre1">Just before the shutter is about to be pressed, Kanon, who is to have been gathered in the middle, loses her balance.</p><p class="calibre1">As a result, she comes leaning on my back, and Rei, which is on top of her, is pushed away. Furthermore, Rei gets pushed to the side and collides with Mia, and the four of us end up spectacularly crumpled altogether on the spot.</p><p class="calibre1">In the midst of all this, the sound of the shutter snapping can be heard mercilessly.</p><p class="calibre1">We all checked the picture, and it showed us crumpling to the ground.</p><p class="calibre1">For some reason, the fact that all of our faces were captured without blurring gave the photo a strange flavor, as if it were a miracle.</p><p class="calibre1">"Yes...... well, failure is a failure, but what shall we do? Shall we reshoot?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">"......No. I like this one. We look somewhat having fun." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Fufu, I guess so. It doesn't look good at all, but we'll never be able to get the same picture as this one again, so let's treasure it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre1">Next to me, Kanon, who is the cause of the failed pose, is nodding her head while sweating coldly.</p><p class="calibre1">While I am amazed at her, I also agreed with both Rei's and Mia's opinions.</p><p class="calibre1">Rather than any conventional picture, this distorted picture is the most fitting for us――――</p><p class="calibre1">That's what I thought.</p>
