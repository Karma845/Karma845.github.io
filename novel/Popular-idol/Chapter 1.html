  <h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 1 - Summer Break is Full of Upheaval</h1>

<p class="calibre4"></p><p class="calibre4">The shrill of cicadas stung my ears.</p><p class="calibre4">The sun was shining so brightly that it was making me furious, and it was burning my brain as if it would never stop.</p><p class="calibre4">It's summer. My least favorite season.</p><p class="calibre4">Dressed in three-quarter-length pants and a white short-sleeved T-shirt, I was walking on the sun-drenched asphalt on the first day of summer break, the day I was supposed to be grateful to have.</p><p class="calibre4">If it were true, I would have been sitting in my air-conditioned room doing my summer homework by now――――</p><p class="calibre4">(Yet, I can't just turn around and not go there, can I?......)</p><p class="calibre4">I look up at the annoyingly clear sky and let out a sigh.</p><p class="calibre4">In an attempt to escape reality, I stopped and looked at the screen of my phone.</p><p class="calibre4">[I'm waiting for you at a family restaurant near the station.]</p><p class="calibre4">It was our class rep, Nikaido Azusa, who was sending me this message.</p><p class="calibre4">I had to explain to her why I had an aquarium date with a national idol the other day.</p><p class="calibre4">I wondered many times why she bothered to do that....... But it would be a disaster if I refused the invitation and in case it was spread.</p><p class="calibre4">After all, I hardly knew what kind of person Nikaido was. All the knowledge I had now was based on rumors, and it was quite possible that her serious attitude was just a facade, just like mine.</p><p class="calibre4">I could only hope that she wouldn't use this as a ploy to demand money or anything else.</p><p class="calibre4">I arrived at the family restaurant shortly and opened the door with a melancholy feeling.</p><p class="calibre4">I told the waitress that I was meeting someone and looked around the restaurant. Then I saw a familiar face sitting at the far end of the table.</p><p class="calibre4">"......sorry to keep you waiting, Nikaido-san." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Shidou-kun...... sorry for calling you out of the blue." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">As I approached, Nikaido bowed her head with a complicated expression.</p><p class="calibre4">Haa, if you're feeling that way, why didn't you just shut up?</p><p class="calibre4">"No, it's okay....... I kind of understand your concern." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I finished ordering a drink at the drink bar.</p><p class="calibre4">After pouring a melon soda and bringing it back, then I waited for her to start talking.</p><p class="calibre4">"I've been thinking about it for a while now." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"The one who was at the aquarium, that was Otosaki-san, wasn't it? You two were wearing matched T-shirts...... could it be that Shidou-kun's girlfriend is Otosaki-san?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">The questions came as generally expected.</p><p class="calibre4">I used a straw to take a sip of my melon soda and let out a sigh for the umpteenth time today.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Nikaido-san, you've got it all wrong." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huh?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">For the past four days since I received the first Line message from Nikaido-san, I have been incessantly thinking of excuses to make to her.</p><p class="calibre4">And I had already created the perfect script for my excuse.</p><p class="calibre4">"Actually, I was being a bit pretentious at that time. Nikaido-san and the others were having a good time with the four of you, right? I was kind of jealous of that, so I lied about having a girlfriend." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"S-so that was what happened....... But then, why were you with Otosaki-san?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"――――I can't tell you anything from here on out unless you promise not to spread this." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I stared right into Nikaido's eyes, creating a serious atmosphere.</p><p class="calibre4">Perhaps noticing the change in the atmosphere, she nodded her head, seemingly overwhelmed.</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay. I'll tell you then.――Actually, Otosaki-san and I are somewhat distant relatives." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"I guess you can say we're "second cousins". Since we were able to enter the same school, so I sometimes help her write new songs. This time it was a song about love, so we decided to do something date-like." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... S-so that was it." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Seeing Nikaido's stunned expression, I was convinced I'd won.</p><p class="calibre4">This was my idea of a lie that would be just barely believable.</p><p class="calibre4">By bringing up the exquisitely distant kinship of being second cousins, I first made it impossible for her to go into the matter. If it was a cousin, she might be able to find out some information, but if it was a second cousin, there would be no way to find out unless she was the police.</p><p class="calibre4">This should be enough to fool her for the rest of my high school life.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Well, I know it's impossible, though.</p><p class="calibre4">"Otosaki-san is an idol, so she can't have a boyfriend. Which is why I, as a relative of hers, help her with that role. It is just an occasional thing." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see, so you two aren't a lover......." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeah, I've never had a girlfriend in my life." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Hahaha, I spilled a dry laugh out.</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido, on the other hand, was patting her chest as if relieved for some reason. What in the world is this a reaction to?</p><p class="calibre4">"Th-then! Shidou-kun, is there someone you like right now......?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Huh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I kind of wanted to ask......." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido suddenly uttered such a thing while fidgeting.</p><p class="calibre4">As expected, I could tell that it was this blatant.</p><p class="calibre4">This girl, probably had feelings for me.</p><p class="calibre4">Or, rather, if I think about it, it was just a matter of course.</p><p class="calibre4">When we met at the aquarium, I already had the feeling that she was somewhat conscious of me, but that feeling disappeared once she heard that I had a girlfriend. However, once she learned that the obstacle was actually no longer there, it was a different story.</p><p class="calibre4">"Someone I like, huh......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">It's fortuitous for me that we had strayed from the topic of my relationship with Rei. Let's get on to the new topic then.</p><p class="calibre4">If I had to ponder about the person I like.</p><p class="calibre4">What came to mind was that beautiful blonde girl.</p><p class="calibre4">I shook my head and shook off the image of a girl that came to mind.</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't have any. There are a lot of people I like, but...... I don't have anyone who I'm interested in being my girlfriend right now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see......." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"What about you, Nikaido-san? Do you have a crush on one of those you're always with?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I-I don't have! No, no, no!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Judging by the way she was shaking her head frantically, she was really serious.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara, you can cry all you want. I'll at least buy you a beef bowl. I'll treat you if it's up to a special serving.</p><p class="calibre4">"Kakihara-kun and Doumoto-kun are both very dependable and cool boys, but I've never considered them as romantic partners. I think they're great friends, but I don't think I can see them in that way." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"......Heeh, So that is it. Maybe you have been together too long with them to feel that way, yes." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yes, I guess. I don't feel this kind of pounding, except...... When I think of the person I like." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">――――Seriously, Kakihara is getting pathetic.</p><p class="calibre4">It's no longer even a joke.</p><p class="calibre4">I'd like to assist him somehow.......</p><p class="calibre4">"So there's no one you're interested in after all......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Mmm. Right now, there is." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"I-I see! That's great, yes! What a youth!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Stop it, don't look at me with such moist eyes.</p><p class="calibre4">At times like this, I regretted from the bottom of my heart that I was not such a dense protagonist. No, why don't I just act like a dense one already?</p><p class="calibre4">Alright, that's it. Let's just pretend that I hadn't noticed at all.</p><p class="calibre4">"I wonder who he is. I'd like to take a guess, so why don't you tell me what type of the guy you like?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh!? O-okay......." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">If I could get the type of person she liked with this, I might be able to tell Kakihara about it. Even if she didn't see him as a man right now, it didn't mean that the future is set in stone. If he can make up for this, I'm sure that Kakihara's love won't be unattainable.――――I thought. I was not sure, though.</p><p class="calibre4">"I think it's someone who is "family-oriented" and who suddenly shows a fragile expression....... I like someone who allows me to stand next to him, rather than following behind or in front of him." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ho...... hoo~h." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I flinched a little when I received such an answer that was more serious than I had imagined.</p><p class="calibre4">If Nikaido was really starting to like me, I wonder which part of me she would find attractive.</p><p class="calibre4">The only time we had any contact with each other was during the cooking class.</p><p class="calibre4">I did stand next to her, though. I showed her my family-oriented side by cooking with her. And she said, "I just thought you had such a kind of face."</p></div>

  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
  
  <p class="calibre4">"Shidou-kun, what...... kind of girl is your type?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"My type?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Putting the melon soda I was drinking on the table to calm down, I thought about the answer to the question Nikaido threw at me.</p><p class="calibre4">The type of girl I like, huh? To be honest, I had never thought about it.</p><p class="calibre4">First of all, I couldn't think of anyone I liked as the opposite sex. Maybe Hana-chan (vague), whom I used to play with in kindergarten? After elementary school, because of my mother's case, I no longer considered contact with the opposite sex to be that much fun. It was right around that time that I stopped having romantic feelings.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm...someone who has a pretty smile, I think." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I managed to muster myself out of it and reply.</p><p class="calibre4">I was watching TV the other night, so I told the words I heard an actor had said that time.</p><p class="calibre4">Actually, "someone who will support me" would be added to the list, but as expected, the relationship between us is still too young to say this.</p><p class="calibre4">"Wh-what else!?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Else!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">What the h*ll is this lass? I've answered your question, so back off.</p><p class="calibre4">"Let's see......th-then, someone who I can rely on? I can't have a worry-free relationship with someone who is not going to carry the burden by herself when it's at a critical time, and who can say that she's in pain when she's in pain, I think?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">For words I uttered so impulsively, they were unexpectedly honest.</p><p class="calibre4">The other person is in pain and suffering, but I, the partner, am oblivious to it and living comfortably. What kind of shameful situation is that?</p><p class="calibre4">At the very least, I would like to be able to talk to my partner about what is bothering her, and I would like to help if I can.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, if it's something she doesn't want to talk about, she doesn't have to. But if she doesn't want to tell me because she thinks it will cause me trouble, then she should back off.</p><p class="calibre4">"That's...... pretty hard, isn't it?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">I looked at her and my eyes widen at the opinions that come out of her mouth.</p><p class="calibre4">It was just what I was thinking.</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeah, maybe. I'm not that good at relying on others myself." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I understood that it's more rational to have a spirit of taking advantage of all that is available, but people can't be that way so easily.</p><p class="calibre4">"In the end, it will be difficult to talk only about preferences. Maybe the type of person you like isn't something that can be described on the spur of the moment." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm, that might be true." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido laughed happily.</p><p class="calibre4">Now it looked like we could get back to normal chit-chat. I could safely say that I'm out of a difficult situation now.</p><p class="calibre4">"We haven't ordered any food yet, have we? I'll treat you today. &mdash;&mdash;Though it's just a cheap family restaurant." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eeh!? You don't have to do that! Rather, I came here with the intention of treating you......." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's no problem. It's just like a boy's natural instinct to act cool in front of a girl." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"U-ummm......... if you say so." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Alright, if this had made a good impression on Nikaido, it was a small price to treat her at a family restaurant. Please, don't bring up the subject of Rei again. I'll treat you to another bowl of mi**no-style doria, if you want. <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: Milano-style Doria)</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">After ordering from the menu, we enjoyed our meal while chatting with each other.</p><p class="calibre4">Surprisingly, Nikaido seemed to like to talk, and the conversation centered around her. Her face breaks into smiles as she happily talks about her friends, Kakihara, Doumoto, and Nogi.</p><p class="calibre4">She really seemed to care about them. "As friends."</p><p class="calibre4">And time went on, and soon we were talking about our career paths.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hee~, Nikaido-san, you're aiming for Waseda-Keio-Sophia, huh." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yep. Since I got into a high school with a high deviation score, so I wanted to go as high as I could." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Waseda-Keio-Sophia was a line of extremely difficult universities in Tokyo.</p><p class="calibre4">Even if I wished to enter one of those universities, they wouldn't even take me seriously with my ordinary efforts.</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido's grades other than physical education were excellent. Her test scores alone were always in the top five of our grades. It was said that her scores fluctuate considerably depending on her physical condition, but even so, she still managed to finish in the top five, which could only be described as impressive.</p><p class="calibre4">Incidentally, our good friend, Inaba Yukio, was also in the top ranks every time, but this was a complete aside.</p><p class="calibre4">"I am impressed. I really admire people who have high goals." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What about you, Shidou-kun? Do you have a college you want to go to?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Umm...... I think, Chuo University. I can't really think of anything I want to do at the moment, so I'm just going to go to a college that will give me more options and see how it goes."</p><p class="calibre4">"[GMARCH], huh? I guess I'll have to say goodbye to Shidou-kun in college then......." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Hey, no need to get depressed there.</p><p class="calibre4">"Y-you're overreacting. You know, we can still communicate on Line, and hang out again like this or something." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Can I ask you out again then?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Of course. Ah, but if Nikaido-san gets a boyfriend, please refrain from doing so. I would feel bad for him." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">This feeling was even stronger because that partner might be Kakihara. I don't want to do anything to pick a fight with that guy.</p><p class="calibre4">"I-I don't think...... it's that easy to get a boyfriend......, you know?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"......I see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">So don't look at me with those moist eyes――――.</p><p class="calibre4">I stifled out a sigh and pick up my glass of melon soda to drink.</p><p class="calibre4">But it's already out, and the ice cubes make a small clinking sound.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm going to go get a refill. I'll get Nikaido-san's as well, is there anything you want?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I pointed out Nikaido's empty cup on the table, and she looked surprised, then offered it to me.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then...... Can I ask ginger ale?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"All right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I took two cups and got up from my seat.</p><p class="calibre4">Let's reset the atmosphere for a moment.</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido's look of fondness was blatant. I inadvertently thought, if I were to make fun of her by saying "Could it be that the person Nikaido-san likes is me?", she would just reply "......Mm" and confess her feelings to me. I felt that her feelings had matured to such an extent.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, in reality, I guess she is not that organized in her feelings, but even so, it is hard to fool her by saying, "Your feelings are just a misunderstanding".</p><p class="calibre4">If you ask me whether I am "happy" or "not happy," the "not happy" slightly outnumbers the "happy" by 6 to 4.</p><p class="calibre4">After all, the guy who is ranked first in our grade caste is the one who likes her. I don't want him to get the wrong impression of me and have our relationship strained. I don't want to make my daily school routine a depressing one.</p><p class="calibre4">For now, let's calm down and talk about Kakihara more.</p><p class="calibre4">And I'll just have to tell her that the guy she usually hangs out with is the guy everyone wants to have as a boyfriend, even if it's hard to convey.</p><p class="calibre4">There's no element of lying anywhere, and if I tell her patiently and repeatedly, she will notice――――I hope.</p><p class="calibre4">"Alright." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">With great enthusiasm, I poured a drink for two into each of our cups.</p><p class="calibre4">As I was about to return to my seat, being careful not to spill anything, I heard a conversation coming from that direction.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――Isn't it Azusa! You're at a family restaurant by yourself? You should have asked us out." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"He's right! If you'd asked us out, I wouldn't have had to go through all that stuff with both of us." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">As I turned the corner of my seat, I saw the backs of two men standing in front of the seat where Nikaido was sitting.</p><p class="calibre4">Ah――――that's the worst thing imaginable.</p><p class="calibre4">"Sorry, but I couldn't invite you guys today because I had a prior appointment. Did Kakihara-kun and Doumoto-kun come to study?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, I just wanted to talk to Ryuuji about something....... But more importantly, is your prior appointment with Honoka? It looks like there are enough plates for two......" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yup. He just went to get me a drink....... Ah! He's back!" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">There was no turning back even if I wanted to.</p><p class="calibre4">All I could do was stand there.</p><p class="calibre4">"......! Rintaro!?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">"Y-yo~...... Yuusuke-kun and Doumoto-kun. Uum...... what an odd coincidence." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">With a glass in each hand, I smiled a drawn-out smile.</p>

  <p class="calibre4">O My Lord――――is this harassment from the first day of summer break?</p><p class="calibre4">This is too much of a challenge from the beginning, so if You don't mind, can You make the second half all good things? Otherwise, it's not worth it at all, seriously not.</p>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-25">
  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">"W-why...... Rintaro and Azusa are together......!?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">I'm overclocking my brain in front of a visibly flustered Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre4">The situation can be described as a "fighting scene" situation. The best way to handle the situation is to choose the right words and the right way to say them.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ermm, Yuusuke-kun――――." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I was asking for love consultation. I have something I really want to consult Shidou-kun." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">I almost spewed it out.</p><p class="calibre4">It's bad――――but in this situation, maybe it's a good job.</p><p class="calibre4">Love consultation. Yes, let's get on with this.</p><p class="calibre4">"Right. I told you both the other day that I have a girlfriend, didn't I? That's why Nikaido-san, who mistakenly thought I was experienced in love, wanted to consult me." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I-is that so? I thought the two of you were getting close without my knowledge! Hahaha!" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Hey Kakihara, your laugh is fading. Don't force yourself to laugh.</p><p class="calibre4">Anyway, with this reaction, there is an atmosphere of not being fully trusted. Shall I push it one more step?</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm sorry, but I can't tell the two of you what we were discussing. Especially you,&nbsp; Yuusuke-kun!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"M-me⁉" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Guess it, Kakihara Yuusuke. And misunderstand it.</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that I can't tell especially you mean that what we were discussing is about you.</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that you were mentioned in the love consultation means that Nikaido is aware of you in some small way.</p><p class="calibre4">It's all just a misunderstanding! Please!</p><p class="calibre4">"A-ah! So that's what this is about! Then it can't be helped. Yeah. I won't ask any further." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">――――Great.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara looks convinced about something, crosses his arms, and nods his head up and down repeatedly.</p><p class="calibre4">It went too smoothly and unexpectedly, and the corners of my mouth almost hang open. I try not to let that happen as I approach my seat.</p><p class="calibre4">"......? I'm not――" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oopsie! Nikaido-san's is ginger ale, right? Here you go!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh? Th-thank you." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Before she says anything else, I put the ginger ale in front of her.</p><p class="calibre4">I am worried about the future, but if I can get through today, I should be able to avoid seeing these guys for a while. This summer should bring progress in Kakihara's love life in one way or another. If the situation changes, I will no longer have to worry about Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre4">Until that happens, you must endure, Shidou Rintaro.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Hey, whatever sounds good....... I'm starving, so why don't we get something to eat first?" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're right. Since we're here, do you mind if we sit down together?" (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Both Nikaido and I shake our heads at Kakihara's idea.</p><p class="calibre4">The meal itself is already over, but it feels bad to leave now.</p><p class="calibre4">Besides, I'll have to stay here so that Nikaido won't say anything unnecessary.</p><p class="calibre4">"That helps. Since this is lunchtime so many people are coming in." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara and Doumoto take their seats.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara, perhaps as a gesture of gratitude, sends me a surreptitious wink. Seriously, I don't want it, so don't do it.</p><p class="calibre4">A short while later, the menu they ordered is brought to the table.</p><p class="calibre4">Only in front of Doumoto there is a mountain of food, is he seriously planning to eat all of these? If so, he's not inferior to Rei――――No, I should be surprised that she can head-to-head with this big and athletic guy. Yep, I should.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm a little surprised. Before I know it, Shidou and Yusuke were calling each other by their given names." (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"It was during the tripartite meeting that we started calling each other by name. We were in the same boat having the bipartite meeting, so we had time to talk while we were waiting." (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">I nod at Kakihara's explanation.</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that he was able to close the distance in such a short period of time, I have to say that he is indeed the pinnacle in the caste of our grade.</p><p class="calibre4">"Aah, I see. Then let me call you Rintaro too! Since I'm here!" (Ryuuji)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh? Ah, okay. I don't mind." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I don't get to his sense, but I allow it anyway.</p><p class="calibre4">Even if we call each other by name, I don't think it necessarily leads to a good friendship. So I think he can at least call me what he wants.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"In that case, I can call you Rintaro-kun, too!?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm sorry, but I'd appreciate it if you refrain from calling me that way, since it makes her a little cranky when girls do." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah...... I see." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">Nikaido seems to see what I mean when she sees my desperate eyes.</p><p class="calibre4">From her point of view, I would look like a guy who just wants to look good in front of them. In fact, I have to keep her mouth shut about what I have just said, so there should be nothing suspicious about this.</p><p class="calibre4">Phew, thank goodness. I almost had Kakihara staring at me like a devil.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder why Nikaido calls Kakihara by his surname, even though they've known each other longer than I have?</p><p class="calibre4">"......Then, I'd better go home now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I check the time on my phone and tell them.</p><p class="calibre4">I plan to cook an after-work dinner for Rei this evening. I still have some food, but there are a few things I want to buy to avoid having to go out multiple times.</p><p class="calibre4">Frankly, I still have time to spare, but it's a good excuse to get rid of the guilt of leaving first. Besides, the three of them would have more to talk about if I wasn't around, which I'm not usually with them.</p><p class="calibre4">"Shidou-kun, thank you for today." (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"No problem. If you need anything else, just let me know." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I leave Nikaido with these words as a courtesy and put the 2,000 yen on the table.</p><p class="calibre4">Kakihara and Doumoto came over to complicate things, but I consider my statement to her that I would buy her a drink to be a live one. The order for the two of us is not even close to 2,000 yen, but I'll consider the remainder as an apology to Kakihara.</p><p class="calibre4">"Please pay for me and Nikaido-san with this. You can keep the change." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh, Is it okay?" (Azusa)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's okay. That's what we were originally going to do. Besides, I wanted to say keep the change at least once." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I walk out of the restaurant, making some kind of banter.</p><p class="calibre4">The moment I'm alone, I feel a sudden surge of exhaustion.</p><p class="calibre4">The risk of Nikaido leaking information about my relationship with Rei to the public is now infinitesimally small. I'm sure she was convinced by our distant relative relationship, and although it's not fair, she won't do anything to make me dislike her for the time being.</p><p class="calibre4">"HAAAAAH......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Letting out a sigh, I get on the train and move to the nearest station where my home is located.</p><p class="calibre4">One of the good things about moving here is that there is a large supermarket between the station and my apartment. In addition, it is open 24 hours a day. With such convenience,&nbsp; can't move from here anymore.</p><p class="calibre4">I stock up on onions, pork ribs, and udon noodles, which I often use, also some seasonings along with them.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei is a ketchup lover and consumes a lot of ketchup. Therefore, I buy two more and finish shopping for the day.</p><p class="calibre4">While shaking the plastic bag, I walk back to the front of the apartment.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">As I'm about to unlock the door to my house, my phone in my pocket suddenly beeps a notification.</p><p class="calibre4">I check it and find a LINE message in the name of Kakihara Yuusuke.</p><p class="calibre4">[Wanna go to the pool with us this Wednesday?]</p><p class="calibre4">――――Heck, what's really going on?</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-19">
  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">I enter the house, put the contents of the plastic bag in the refrigerator, and sit down on the couch.</p><p class="calibre4">After a few minutes of exchanging messages with Kakihara, I barely managed to understand what was going on.</p><p class="calibre4">According to him, the three of them had talked about going to the pool after I was gone. Nogi, who wasn't there, was invited to join them, and it seems that "Nikaido" suggested that they invite me as well, who had been with them earlier, anyway.</p><p class="calibre4">What an unnecessary thing she had done...... but I was the one who told her to call me if she needed anything. Although it was just a courtesy, I didn't feel comfortable rejecting it.</p><p class="calibre4">Besides&mdash;&mdash;yep, it's a little hard to refuse when you get a message like this.</p><p class="calibre4">[I'm going to try to appeal more to Azusa at the pool. Rintaro is the only one who knows about this, so could you help me?] (Yuusuke)</p><p class="calibre4">Ye~ah, I don't want to. Frankly speaking, it's a hassle and I hate it so much.</p><p class="calibre4">However, I will be most grateful if Nikaido and Kakihara become getting intimate. Maybe I should try to cooperate with them here.</p><p class="calibre4">I feel like I should stay away from Nikaido anyway, but on the other hand, it's a chance to disillusion her.</p><p class="calibre4">I can't think of anything groundbreaking that would lower my value and raise Kakihara's, but it should be worth a try.</p><p class="calibre4">And well――――I'm ashamed to say that I've never had the experience of playing with others during summer break, so I have a slight feeling of longing for it.</p><p class="calibre4">At least once in my high school experience, I think it'll be nice to take the plunge.</p><p class="calibre4">[Got it, I'll go.] (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I type that message and send it.</p><p class="calibre4">Shortly after that, I receive a message from Kakihara, who was happy to have me participate and sent me detailed information about the time and place of the meeting.</p><p class="calibre4">Truly, Kakihara is a good guy. He only goes blank when it comes to Nikaido.......</p>
<p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">"I'm home." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, welcome home." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">A few moments later, Rei comes into the living room.</p><p class="calibre4">She's looking somewhat tired and is brushing her hair, which is sticking to her face with sweat, out of her face in a look of exhaustion.</p><p class="calibre4">"You are pretty drenched, yes. I'm going to boil some somen noodles now, so you can go take a shower." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm...... Thank you. I had a dance lesson today for a new song, so I'm pretty worn out." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">She turns from the living room to the hallway and heads for the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre4">I begin preparing the somen while I boil water in a pot.</p><p class="calibre4">There is not much to do, though. I cut up some scallions for condiments and grated some frozen yuzu. I also add a little sesame oil to the noodle soup base to give it a different flavor, which I prepared myself. There is nothing special about the somen itself, but I personally like being able to customize the sauce in this way.</p><p class="calibre4">(......Ah, did she leave the towel?)</p><p class="calibre4">I think of that when the somen is finished boiling.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't think there was a spare bath towel in the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre4">I finish putting the somen on a big plate and go to the bathroom with a clean bath towel.</p><p class="calibre4">I can still hear the sound of the shower. So I have avoided such a lucky situation of bumping into Rei, who had just finished taking a shower here.</p><p class="calibre4">However, there are miscalculations in everything――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ugh......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Such words leaked out unintentionally.</p><p class="calibre4">White fabric can be seen through the gaps in Rei's clothes, which have been messily removed and scattered.</p><p class="calibre4">Those are...... probably underwear.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't mean to be so blunt, but I have seen her underwear before. I'm in charge of the laundry in place of Rei, who is very busy. Obviously, I have seen them.</p><p class="calibre4">However, in those cases, I had her put them in a net or something similar that would make it difficult to see the contents before washing them, so I didn't see them clearly.</p><p class="calibre4">(Da......! Damn!)</p><p class="calibre4">I shake my head to cool my hot cheeks.</p><p class="calibre4">Forget 'em, forget 'em all.</p><p class="calibre4">I put the bath towel near her clothes, telling myself that over and over again. Then I gently shifted her clothes to hide her underwear.</p><p class="calibre4">With this, she won't know I saw her underwear――――I hope.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Really ridiculous." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">If I think about it calmly, there is a good chance that Rei won't mind at all. If I was the only one who panicked, that was a little unfair.</p><p class="calibre4">Recently, I've probably been acting somewhat strange.</p><p class="calibre4">However, I have spent my time trying not to be aware of it. I feel that if I become aware of it, something would change――――.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"For letting me take the bath first. Thank you." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yea. Dinner's ready, so have a seat." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm, okay." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I urge Rei to sit down after she got out of the bath and put a plate of somen noodles and a bowl of noodle soup on the table.</p><p class="calibre4">She and I both put our hands together and then begin to dig in.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm, delicious." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Glad to hear. I'm cutting corners a little, though......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's not a problem. There are a lot of creative things on the table, so this is fun." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei said that and put some green onions in the sauce. Then she adds three drops of red chili oil and sips the somen again.</p><p class="calibre4">"Is it okay if we change the dipping soup?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"No problem. If we want to reset it, I can go in and make some more." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Dripping red chili oil or sesame oil on the soup is certainly tasty, but the problem is that if you want to change the taste, you can't change it back. If that's the case, just prepare it "plain". I feel it's a bit of a waste, but I have no choice, since there will be no other way, even from a hygienic standpoint.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, I'm off tomorrow, and I want to go shopping. Will you go with me?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Wait, wait, ...... I don't know how many times we've had this conversation, but wouldn't it be bad for us to walk out together?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"It'll be fine. I've got a wig to make it easier for us to walk out." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Saying that, Rei pulls out a clump of hair from her bag.</p><p class="calibre4">It is a wig that imitates flowing black hair. It is the exact opposite of Rei's blonde hair.</p><p class="calibre4">"If I put this on, people won't be able to tell it's me. Hair makes a big impression after all." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, indeed."</p>
<p class="calibre4">She certainly gives a completely different impression when she puts on the wig. Her natural hair is not put together, so her blonde hair sticks out in places, but once that is taken care of, it will be safe to say that she is a different person.</p><p class="calibre4">"......I get it. I'll go out with you then." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Thank you. I want to buy some more clothes for the summer." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, in that case, can I go shopping while you're at it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't mind. What are you going to buy?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Men's swimsuits." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh......?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I thought it over, but I only have a school swimsuit.</p><p class="calibre4">At worst, I can take it with me, but that would be too tacky. At this point, I should probably bring one swimsuit, even if I have to spend my savings.</p><p class="calibre4">"I have an appointment to go to the pool in the near future. So I thought I'd buy one......eh, what's wrong?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei, who had been relatively talkative until then, suddenly fell silent.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm worried and call out to her, and she finally opens her mouth.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――with whom?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"With whom?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Eh, Rei-san, are you angry about something?</p><p class="calibre4">I flinch at her words, which are more forceful than ever.</p><p class="calibre4">And I, for some reason, explain the situation to her in polite words.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, I didn't tell her about Kakihara's situation.</p></div>
