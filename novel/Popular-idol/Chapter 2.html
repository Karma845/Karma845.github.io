  <h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 2 - One Day Boyfriend</h1>
  
<p class="calibre1">Hot.</p><p class="calibre1">That's the only word that comes to mind as I look up at the sky, which is as blue as ever.</p><p class="calibre1">I am sitting on a bench at the bus stop.</p><p class="calibre1">And sitting next to me is a beautiful, black-haired girl.</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmm? Is there something on my face?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"No...... there isn't." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei is looking at me with a puzzled look on her face.</p><p class="calibre1">I look away from her and let out a breath.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei is now wearing a wig and black-colored contact lenses. Unlike the previous time when I was shown only the wig, today she had set her blonde hair so that it's completely concealed. Therefore, even if I see her up close like this, I won't notice that she is Otosaki Rei.</p><p class="calibre1">I didn't think I would end up falling head over heels for her because of her freshness, though.......</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, the bus is here." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmm? yeah......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">We board the bus that stopped in front of us and sit down on empty seats next to each other.</p><p class="calibre1">The reason why we took the bus is that we are going to a shopping mall located a short distance away from the station.</p><p class="calibre1">If we just need to buy clothes or swimsuits, we can do so in front of the station, but it is difficult to complete all of them in a single store.&nbsp; In that case, we would have to go to several stores, but walking around in this heat would be suicide.</p><p class="calibre1">After some discussion, we decided that a shopping mall with all kinds of stores would be the best place to go.</p><p class="calibre1">"It's a holiday, so there's going to be a lot of people around. Try not to get too much attention." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I know. But I think I'll be okay today unless something really bad happens." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Well, I guess......." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre1">Indeed, if anyone could recognize her today as Otosaki Rei at a quick glance, it would be only Mia and Kanon, who are also fellow MilleSta members.</p><p class="calibre1">This way we won't have to walk around freaking out about the surroundings――――</p><p class="calibre1">The bus stops in front of the mall and we follow the flow of others down the sidewalk in the parking lot.</p><p class="calibre1">It is the largest commercial mall in the area, and since it is early in the summer vacation season, many students and families with children visit here. The parking lot is almost full, and it is impressive to see cars wandering around waiting for a space to open up.</p><p class="calibre1">"Where do you want to start? I don't mind if you shop first." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Then I want to go to the first-floor clothing store." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I let Rei lead the way for now and follow behind her.</p><p class="calibre1">I'm not that particular about clothes, so I always buy the cheapest and least flashy clothes I can find.</p><p class="calibre1">I've always been a frugal person, so I don't really want to try on a branded one.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei, on the other hand, must be wearing something expensive. The mall should also have some brand name stores――――</p><p class="calibre1">"Eh, isn't this Uni*lo?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Yes, but is there something wrong with that?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"No, it's just a little unexpected......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">The first store Rei chose is Uni*lo, a store that is a friend to the common people.</p><p class="calibre1">I was so familiar with this place that I honestly felt a bit disappointed.</p><p class="calibre1">"I buy underwear here. There are lots of cute and inexpensive things here." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"......I feel somewhat relieved." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">We both enter the store and I watch Rei shop from behind.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei purchases a few pairs of underwear, as she had declared, and leaves the store.</p><p class="calibre1">"The next is, that way." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I have often heard that shopping for girls is a long process, and she seems to be no exception to this rule.</p><p class="calibre1">She would go into one store at a time, take a quick look at the clothes and try on the ones she was interested in. If she didn't find anything she liked, she would leave without buying anything.</p><p class="calibre1">Whenever I heard about girls shopping, I often thought it was a hassle. However, to my surprise and amazement. I don't find it with Rei boring at all.</p><p class="calibre1">On the contrary, I even consider it a privilege to watch her change into various outfits.</p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, does this look good on me?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei comes out of the fitting room wearing a white one-piece dress.</p><p class="calibre1">The hem of the dress sways softly as she spins once in front of me.</p><p class="calibre1">I thought it fit her well, but that might be because Rei has her "current hairstyle". Thinking of the original her, I think――――</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmmm...... I think I liked the one before better." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">The outfit she showed me before was very casual.</p><p class="calibre1">She was wearing a black sleeveless top with a thin shoulder-revealing T-shirt and jeans fabric hot pants.</p><p class="calibre1">The fact that her bewitching legs were visible made her look attractive to my simple eyes.</p><p class="calibre1">By the way, I have a hot pants fetish.</p><p class="calibre1">――――not interested, huh.</p><p class="calibre1">"I see. Then I'll buy it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Are you okay with that? Depending solely on my opinion." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I'm okay. The one that Rintaro said would look better on me is the best." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">I try my best to keep my heart, which is about to writhe in agony, calm.</p><p class="calibre1">She's always saying things that could make me misunderstand...... and that's really not good for my health.</p><p class="calibre1">Rei, who had bought the one I said I liked it better, stands beside me again.</p><p class="calibre1">"I bought it. Then let's go." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Wait, wait...... I'll hold it for you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Eh?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">I snatch some of Rei's belongings from her side.</p><p class="calibre1">Even though they are clothes, the more they are, the heavier they become.</p><p class="calibre1">Feeling a definite weight in my hands, I look forward.</p><p class="calibre1">"Cmon, let's go next." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"......Yes." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">What's with that happy look on your face? Damn this sweetheart lass.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre1">◇◆◇</p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, Rei's shopping lasted more than an hour.</p><p class="calibre1">As expected, my arm is no longer enough to hold her belongings from the middle, and Rei has also one of her arms fully occupied.</p><p class="calibre1">However, she looks very satisfied.</p><p class="calibre1">That being said, while Rei is paying, I look at the price tags on the other clothes. Needless to say......, there are prices on them that someone like me would never be able to afford.</p><p class="calibre1">"My shopping is done. Next, it's Rintaro's turn." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Yea. I'm just going to buy one appropriate swimsuit......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">This is summer, and several stores are having swimsuit sales.</p><p class="calibre1">It'll be fine if I can buy one of the cheapest ones I can find.</p><p class="calibre1">"Then, can I pick one out for you?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Sure, but......no boomerang pants or anything like that." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Rest assured. I will have you show me in private. I won't let you wear it outside." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"I ain't even gonna show it to you, okay?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I imagine myself wearing boomerang pants, and I start to feel nauseous.</p><p class="calibre1">Yeah, I'll absolutely never do it.</p><p class="calibre1">"Just pick the coolest one you can normally find....... the cheapest one possible." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Ummm......... I understand." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Why do you look so disappointed?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">I don't understand this girl.</p><p class="calibre1">Well, if she says she'll help me choose one, I'll take her word for it.</p><p class="calibre1">We move to the swimsuit section and compare the men's swimsuits that are placed side by side.</p><p class="calibre1">――――Any of them is fine.</p><p class="calibre1">"Rintaro, how about this?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei brings a swimsuit made of blue fabric.</p><p class="calibre1">The drawstring that ties around the waist is white, what a nice accent.</p><p class="calibre1">It's not flashy, and I like it.</p><p class="calibre1">"This one is good. I'm going to choose this one." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"Mm. I'll go paying this then." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Hey hey, wait, wait a minute! Why are you the one who's paying for it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"What? Because I picked it out......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Then I'll have to pay for some of yours!? I'm the one who has to pay for my stuff, okay......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">Rei is a little dissatisfied, but this is non-negotiable.</p><p class="calibre1">If I become a full-time househusband, my wife will be the one to pay for everything after all, but that is that, and this is this.</p><p class="calibre1">"Here, hand me over." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre1">I snatch the swimsuit from her and take it to the cash register.</p><p class="calibre1">The price isn't insanely cheap, but it isn't expensive either.</p><p class="calibre1">I quickly pay for it and return to Rei's place.</p><p class="calibre1">This time, I see her standing in front of a women's swimsuit.</p><p class="calibre1">"...... What are you doing?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I'm looking for a swimsuit for me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">"Do you even need it? You know the crew will have it for you at the next shoot, right?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre1">"I'm going to take a bath with Rintaro and show it to him." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre1">Hmm? What is this lass talking about?</p>
</p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-2">
  
  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Wh-what are you talking about?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">The words that had been popping into my head flew straight out of my mouth.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei was looking at the swimsuits lined up in front of her, and declared as if it was nothing.</p><p class="calibre4">"If Rintaro went to the trouble of buying a swimsuit, I'd like to be the very first one to see it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ummm...... I don't really understand when you put it that way." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's a matter of feelings, so it's hard to explain. In other words, I'm going to wear a swimsuit, so I want Rintaro to put on a swimsuit and take a bath with me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I have no idea what that means.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei picks up two pieces of the appropriate swimsuit and brings each one to the front of her body.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, which one do you prefer?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"E-ee......?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Puzzled, I compare the two swimsuits.</p><p class="calibre4">One is a bluish-black――――or, a navy blue bikini. More specifically, it is a "cross halter bikini", which is a swimsuit that is crossed in front of the neck and secured at the nape of the neck. I am sure that this is what was written in the materials that I found in Yuzuki-sensei's office.</p><p class="calibre4">The other one is a "micro bikini," which has an extremely small area of fabric. I don't know why such a swimsuit, which I can only think of as a joke item, is sold in this wholesome shopping mall, but at least there's only one option here.</p><p class="calibre4">"Let's see......, that navy blue bikini, I guess." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mn. Then I'll buy this one." (Rei)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before I can say anything more, Rei has already made her purchase.</p><p class="calibre4">I have a hard time grasping what was going on, yet I come to stand by her.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm a little tired. I wanna have a cup of bubble tea before I go home." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, yeah. Okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's wrong?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's nothing...... it's been a while since I've had a chance to talk to you, so..." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Anyway, what I found out is that Rei wants to put on a swimsuit and take a bath together with me so that she can be the first to see me in my swimsuit.</p><p class="calibre4">No, I don't get it, even if I try to sort it out.</p><p class="calibre4">For now, I'll just be quiet and follow Rei's lead. It's probably just a joke anyway.</p><p class="calibre4">Shaking the clothes we had bought, we headed toward the bubble tea shop in the shopping mall.</p><p class="calibre4">Even though the boom had subsided, there's still a long line of people waiting to buy bubble tea on holidays when students are freed from their routine.</p><p class="calibre4">"Tapioca pearl is made from starch, right? What kind of texture does it have?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"You've never had it before?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeah. To tell you the truth, I missed the boom of its popularity. I never had a chance to go there, so today is my first time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see. Hmmmm, it's...... mochi-mochi?" (Rei) <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: springy, chewy.)</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">"Now I understand your lack of vocabulary." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">When it's our turn, I order the best-selling bubble tea without much ado.</p><p class="calibre4">On the other hand, Rei chooses the matcha milk flavor. It looks delicious.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――Ah, I see it now." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I chewed the tapioca pearls in my mouth, swallowed them, and then spilled those words.</p><p class="calibre4">The word "mochi-mochi" is certainly the best word to describe it. If I were to say just how chewy it is, the texture is similar to konnyaku.</p><p class="calibre4">However, I think this one is going to be a bit of a piling up in the stomach......</p><p class="calibre4">It tastes good, though.</p><p class="calibre4">"Deuishoosh." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei's chewing tapioca pearl with her cheeks puffed out, as if I can hear the sound effect of "munch munch".</p><p class="calibre4">What an expression. It's hard to believe that she is a national super idol.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, I want to taste that one too. Shall we trade?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"H-hey...... that's――――." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei leans toward me and forcefully puts her mouth on the straw and sucks the contents.</p><p class="calibre4">Some of the tapioca pearls that had accumulated at the bottom went through the straw and into her mouth.</p><p class="calibre4">This girl, isn't she too aggressive these days?</p><p class="calibre4">Well, my experience in love is not so great that I am upset by this level of indirect kissing.</p><p class="calibre4">From her point of view, this might be in the normal category.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm...... delicious." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... That so." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then I'll share mine with you." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Saying that, Rei points her drink at me.</p><p class="calibre4">Her eyes are tinged with anticipation――――.</p><p class="calibre4">She's not going to let me say no.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――O-okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I put my mouth on the straw she had been drinking from and suck the contents.</p><p class="calibre4">That's when the incident happened.</p><p class="calibre4">I sucked it down with more force than I intended, perhaps because I was strangely nervous, and a large number of tapioca pearls popped into my mouth.</p><p class="calibre4">Barely managing to swallow it, I was unable to swallow the liquid, which flowed uncontrollably into my windpipe.</p><p class="calibre4">As I choke, a dribble of matcha milk drips from my mouth.</p><p class="calibre4">As I see the stain spreading to my clothes, I feel like I've goofed up.</p><p class="calibre4">"Are you okay?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Gahaa....... Y-yeah, I'm fine." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"But......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm going to go wipe in the bathroom. Please wait here." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I leave Rei there with an apologetic look on her face and look for a nearby restroom.</p><p class="calibre4">It's a little far away. Well, it can't be helped.</p><p class="calibre4">After walking for a while, I finally found a men's restroom, borrowed some toilet paper from a private room, and stood in front of the faucet.</p><p class="calibre4">I put the dry toilet paper on the back of my clothes and dab it with the moistened toilet paper from outside. This is the only first aid treatment I can do when I'm out of the house where I can't do laundry right away.</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew...... it's diminished a bit." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">After confirming that it's somewhat less noticeable, I once again recall what just happened.</p><p class="calibre4">No matter what anyone says, it was an――――indirect kiss.</p><p class="calibre4">The more I'm aware of it, the hotter my cheeks become.</p><p class="calibre4">"She's still a kid, I guess...... same for me too." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I should always want to grow up as soon as possible, but I'm distraught over one thing like this. It's proof that I haven't grown up yet.</p><p class="calibre4">(If I spend enough time with her...... will I get used to these feelings?)</p><p class="calibre4">I throw a question to Shidou Rintaro, who is nothing more than a high school student reflected in the mirror.</p><p class="calibre4">Naturally, no answer comes back.</p><p class="calibre4">I feel like such a fool and laugh it off scornfully.</p><p class="calibre4">"You should know your place." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I wipe my hands with a handkerchief and leave the bathroom.</p><p class="calibre4">I just want to be prepared so that one day, when this relationship comes to an end, I won't be bitter.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't want to get carried away and lose myself.</p><p class="calibre4">The place where I have Rei waiting for me is a little far away.</p><p class="calibre4">I decided to run back there a bit because I'm anxious to leave her alone.</p><p class="calibre4">Then――――</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Hey you, you're pretty cute, aren't you. Are you alone?"</p><p class="calibre4">――――Aah, what a template.</p><p class="calibre4">Two men are standing in front of Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">They have dyed hair, wear a lot of accessories, and are what you can call the flirtatious guys in the street. They are looking down on Rei from above, who is sitting on a bench, grinning and smiling vulgarly.</p><p class="calibre4">It's a pick-up, no matter how you look at it.</p><p class="calibre4">Well, I can understand their feelings. Rei is a beautiful girl from any angle, and if she were alone, I would be tempted to ask her out for a chance.</p><p class="calibre4">But those people, whose brains have been roasted by summer heat, don't know the meaning of restraint.</p><p class="calibre4">Normally, they would not call out to anyone for fear of causing trouble, but they go ahead with it as if they were testing their mettle.</p><p class="calibre4">That's why they are so disgusting.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not alone. The fact that I have these two cups proves it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Is the one you are with a girl? Then it's just right, two to two! Let's have tea together. We have a lot of money for college students, I'll buy you all drinks."</p><p class="calibre4">He interrupts Rei's words and seems to be determined not to give up the initiative at any cost.</p><p class="calibre4">It's only natural. If they prolong the situation, there is a possibility that the police or security guards will be called. Whether they succeed or fail, they intend to make this a short-term battle.</p><p class="calibre4">I have seen that catchy guy in the city at night on my way home from Yuzuki-sensei's place. Maybe he really works part-time at a place like that.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Boy, is not the time for a calm analysis, you know.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm racking my brains to figure out what to say to get out of the situation, but for now, I start walking to get closer to Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">"Not a girl. Even if she's, I don't have time for you two." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hee, could it be your boyfriend?"</p><p class="calibre4">"......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">My feet stop for a moment as I hear those words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wonder what――――Rei will answer.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Yup. He is. I'm waiting for my boyfriend." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">A sense of elation that I can almost smirk at slowly begins to creep up from deep within me.</p><p class="calibre4">It's supposed to be just an impromptu remark, but this destructive power.</p><p class="calibre4">This is no good. If it becomes a habit.</p><p class="calibre4">Before it becomes so, I shake my head and shake off this feeling.</p><p class="calibre4">Now, I've let that Otosaki Rei tell me this much. Let's help her out first and foremost before I begin to consider it a perk or something.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――What do you want with my girlfriend?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">How, I may have been a little too cool.</p><p class="calibre4">My face is a little distorted with embarrassment in this situation, which can be called a predicament.</p><p class="calibre4">"Aah...... Tsk, such a pain in the ass."</p><p class="calibre4">"Let's go."</p><p class="calibre4">"Yeaaa, Although I thought she looked like "REI"."</p><p class="calibre4">That's a close call. Thank goodness they're at least intelligent.</p><p class="calibre4">They must have decided that there's no point in prolonging the conversation. The two left us, glaring at me with a really bitter look.</p><p class="calibre4">"Pheeew~. Looks like...... there's no problem." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, thank you. You saved me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm sorry I left you alone. The stain was a little persistent." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"It was my fault to begin with, so......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Sooo~ I guess we're even, then." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I take my own cup of bubble tea from her hand and smile.</p><p class="calibre4">Seeing me like this, she smiles relievedly.</p></p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-12">
  
  <p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p>
  
<p class="calibre4">After we had finished our bubble tea and had a light lunch, we boarded the bus.</p><p class="calibre4">As the bus rocked us along, we looked at the scenery outside without having any conversation.</p><p class="calibre4">This is the usual pattern when Rei and I are alone. There is no conversation, and we each do what we want to do.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei has her earphones plugged into her phone and is listening to music.</p><p class="calibre4">On the screen is the name of an unfamiliar MilleSta's song, presumably a new song the girls are currently practicing.</p><p class="calibre4">Her attitude of engaging in practice as soon as she has time is a likable earnestness to me.</p><p class="calibre4">I often hear opinions on the pros and cons of fiddling with one's phone while on a date, but as for me, I don't care if she does something else while we are together.</p><p class="calibre4">I can understand why people find it boring or something, but this is not the case with Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">Both Rei and I like this kind of time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A sense of distance, as if the other person is part of your world and you don't have to pay attention to them. It is truly rare to find someone with whom you can feel this sense of distance.</p><p class="calibre4">Aside from her, Inaba Yukio is the only other person who can feel that kind of distance.</p><p class="calibre4">I strongly feel that I want to cherish these people.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Suddenly, I hear my name called and turn my head toward her.</p><p class="calibre4">Rei takes off her earphones and looks me in the eye.</p><p class="calibre4">"Do you hate it when I say that you are my boyfriend?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's that, all of a sudden?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm just...... curious." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei looks away with a somewhat dismayed expression on her face.</p><p class="calibre4">I know how it feels to be concerned. I think I had the same look on my face when I addressed Rei as "girlfriend" at the aquarium, even if it was a lie.</p><p class="calibre4">That's why I'm borrowing the words that Rei said to me back then.</p><p class="calibre4">"It's okay. I didn't mind." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah......." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I give a big grin and Rei narrows the corners of her eyes, as if relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Besides, I think that was the right thing to do in that situation. With people like them, you can't say things that will drag on and on. They will come at you more aggressively, looking for a chance. The best thing to do is to speak clearly to them so that they don't come at you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm. I'll be sure to be clear next time." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's wise. I mean, you're an idol and you're going to get picked up? I feel like it would be moderately reckless to try to talk to a celebrity." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Surprisingly, some people approach me. Some people don't even notice that I'm "REI", but others do notice and approach me. I think they expect me to be an easy target because I am still in high school." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">While she's a minor, it is inevitable that she has to listen to adults, and there are, well, a lot of people who try to take advantage of that part of her.</p><p class="calibre4">If you don't try to know her well, she's just a successful girl on a cloud. But in reality, she's an extraordinary hardworking person who has made a lot of effort and overcomes a lot of difficulties.</p><p class="calibre4">That is why I respect her but do not yearn for her.</p><p class="calibre4">"I guess it's not as easy as people think to be beautiful and pretty." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm happy Rintaro calls me beautiful and pretty." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"You feel so. Then, I'll say it as many times as you want for 100 yen a time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"If I pay you 100,000 yen, how many times will you say it?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......One thousand times?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Deal then." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's a lie. I don't need money." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"So you'd say it for free?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Only if I feel it from the bottom of my heart." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then I'll do my best." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then do so." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">While saying that, when the time comes to say it, I'm sure I'll be embarrassed. But now that I've made the declaration, I should probably get my act together.</p><p class="calibre4">It is my role now to fulfill Otosaki Rei's expectations.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm... I'm getting, a little sleepy." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">A modest weight rest on my shoulders.</p><p class="calibre4">I gulp at the sight of her face, which is so close to mine.</p><p class="calibre4">She is a beautiful girl in every way. The shape of her face alone is worth more than a work of art.</p><p class="calibre4">"Kanon told me. Rintaro's shoulder can be borrowed for up to five minutes." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What the hell is that lass informing......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">That's an account of when I heard about Kanon's weakness. I did indeed lend her a shoulder to lean on for five minutes.</p><p class="calibre4">It's nothing to hide, but for some reason, I feel a little awkward.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"How many minutes would you lend me?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......You're sleepy, right? Then I'll lend you until we get to the station. Just another twenty minutes or so." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see...... That's fine...... for now." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei's voice gradually trails off and eventually turns into a sleeping breath.</p><p class="calibre4">Seeing her snuggle up to me, sleeping comfortably, I inwardly hold my head in my hands.</p><p class="calibre4">(I told you...... you're too defenseless.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Otosaki Rei is in a position where I can touch her if I want to.</p><p class="calibre4">She has beautiful skin without a single blemish or pimple, and long eyelashes. Her face is beautifully sculpted, with no flaws to be found. She is also very Japanese in style, with a hint of cleavage peeking out, even though she is not wearing a dress with an open chest. If they are this big, it's probably inevitable that this happens. No doubt.</p><p class="calibre4">Suddenly the bus stops and a new passenger gets on from the bus stop.</p><p class="calibre4">The man, who is left standing as there are no seats available, probably unconsciously glanced at the chest of the sleeping Rei.</p><p class="calibre4">Immediately, a burning sense of disgust rises from the depths of my heart.</p><p class="calibre4">I take out a handkerchief from my pants pocket and drape it over Rei's chest.</p><p class="calibre4">It is the handkerchief I had used to wipe my hands after removing the stain from my clothes earlier, but I can't afford to worry about that.</p><p class="calibre4">The man, who thus could no longer look at her chest, turns away, somewhat dissatisfied and trying not to let me know it.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't blame him. I, too, once followed my male instincts and looked at hers. At least I have no right to blame him.</p><p class="calibre4">But even though I thought so, I couldn't allow him to do so freely.</p><p class="calibre4">"Let me monopolize her at least at a time like this......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I mumbled, so that the man cannot hear me.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Twitch, and I feel like Rei moved.</p><p class="calibre4">I pretend not to notice it and look out the window again.</p><p class="calibre4">The sky today, for some reason, is a deep blue, clearly indicating that it is summer.</p><p class="calibre4">◇◆◇</p><p class="calibre4">"C'mon, Rei. Wake up." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Nn......hmmm." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I shake Rei's head on my shoulder with a gentle shake.</p><p class="calibre4">Still sleepy, she glances around, then looks at me.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Where's?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"We're on the bus. Look, we're almost at the station, so get straightened up."</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm...... Ah, so that's it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei, who has awakened to consciousness around here, swallows the situation and grabs her luggage.</p><p class="calibre4">I do the same, holding a paper bag full of clothes in both hands, and prepare to get off the bus.</p><p class="calibre4">A few moments after pressing the "get off" button, we arrive at the bus stop in front of the station and get off the bus hurriedly.</p><p class="calibre4">"We're back in front of the station, do you want to do any other shopping?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"No, we can't carry more than this, so let's just go home. I've stocked up on groceries so I don't have to go out as much as possible." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm, that's very wise in this heat."&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4">We manage to make it back to the apartment, suffering from the heated asphalt.</p><p class="calibre4">First, we have to go into Rei's room to put the luggage down.</p><p class="calibre4">I accompany Rei as she unlocks the door to her room and we enter through the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Needless to say, Rei's room and mine were built the same way.</p><p class="calibre4">And since I had visited hers several times for cleaning, there's not a millimeter of novelty in this room.</p><p class="calibre4">"I haven't been back much lately, but it's still beautifully clean." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yup. No room for dirt." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">The scenery of the room had hardly changed since the last time I cleaned it.</p><p class="calibre4">There are only a few plastic bottles and juice cans on the table, but nothing that gives the impression of clutter.</p><p class="calibre4">This is not surprising since I clean the room on a regular basis.</p><p class="calibre4">In fact, it is obvious that if I leave her alone, which she is catastrophically unfit to live alone, she will be buried in garbage.</p><p class="calibre4">"Where do you want to put your clothes?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, preferably in the wardrobe." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I open the wardrobe in the bedroom and carefully put the clothes in it. Of course, I take off the price tags.</p><p class="calibre4">"And, it's done." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Thank you, for all you've done." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't worry about it. After all, I am your boyfriend today. I will listen to what my girlfriend wishes." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Just kiddin'――――.</p><p class="calibre4">When I joked about it, she looked more contemplative than I had expected.</p><p class="calibre4">I just rubbed a little bit of what we talked about on the bus, but did I do something wrong?</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Then, will you listen to my request today?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Pardon?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I have one thing, I sincerely want you to listen to." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">――――Yep, I have a bad feeling about this.</p></p>

<p class="calibre4">"C'mon, Rei. Wake up." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Nn......hmmm." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I shake Rei's head on my shoulder with a gentle shake.</p><p class="calibre4">Still sleepy, she glances around, then looks at me.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Where's?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"We're on the bus. Look, we're almost at the station, so get straightened up."</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm...... Ah, so that's it." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei, who has awakened to consciousness around here, swallows the situation and grabs her luggage.</p><p class="calibre4">I do the same, holding a paper bag full of clothes in both hands, and prepare to get off the bus.</p><p class="calibre4">A few moments after pressing the "get off" button, we arrive at the bus stop in front of the station and get off the bus hurriedly.</p><p class="calibre4">"We're back in front of the station, do you want to do any other shopping?"

<p class="calibre4">"Besides, I think that was the right thing to do in that situation. With people like them, you can't say things that will drag on and on. They will come at you more aggressively, looking for a chance. The best thing to do is to speak clearly to them so that they don't come at you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm. I'll be sure to be clear next time." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's wise. I mean, you're an idol and you're going to get picked up? I feel like it would be moderately reckless to try to talk to a celebrity." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Surprisingly, some people approach me. Some people don't even notice that I'm "REI", but others do notice and approach me. I think they expect me to be an easy target because I am still in high school." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">While she's a minor, it is inevitable that she has to listen to adults, and there are, well, a lot of people who try to take advantage of that part of her.</p><p class="calibre4">If you don't try to know her well, she's just a successful girl on a cloud. But in reality, she's an extraordinary hardworking person who has made a lot of effort and overcomes a lot of difficulties.</p><p class="calibre4">That is why I respect her but do not yearn for her.</p><p class="calibre4">"I guess it's not as easy as people think to be beautiful and pretty." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm happy Rintaro calls me beautiful and pretty." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"You feel so. Then, I'll say it as many times as you want for 100 yen a time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"If I pay you 100,000 yen, how many times will you say it?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......One thousand times?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Deal then." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's a lie. I don't need money." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"So you'd say it for free?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Only if I feel it from the bottom of my heart." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then I'll do my best." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then do so." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">While saying that, when the time comes to say it, I'm sure I'll be embarrassed. But now that I've made the declaration, I should probably get my act together.</p><p class="calibre4">It is my role now to fulfill Otosaki Rei's expectations.</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm... I'm getting, a little sleepy." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Eh?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">A modest weight rest on my shoulders.</p><p class="calibre4">I gulp at the sight of her face, which is so close to mine.</p><p class="calibre4">She is a beautiful girl in every way. The shape of her face alone is worth more than a work of art.</p><p class="calibre4">"Kanon told me. Rintaro's shoulder can be borrowed for up to five minutes." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What the hell is that lass informing......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">That's an account of when I heard about Kanon's weakness. I did indeed lend her a shoulder to lean on for five minutes.</p><p class="calibre4">It's nothing to hide, but for some reason, I feel a little awkward.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, Rintaro." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"How many minutes would you lend me?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......You're sleepy, right? Then I'll lend you until we get to the station. Just another twenty minutes or so." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see...... That's fine...... for now."

<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4">"I want you to take a bath with me." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">My bad premonition is immediately confirmed.</p><p class="calibre4">"Are you talking about getting in a swimsuit earlier?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm, I want to see Rintaro in his swimsuit first. And since we are going to all this trouble, I'd like to give him a back rub." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's the point of that......" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Self-satisfaction." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......It is?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">That's a strong word, self-satisfaction. I think I'll use it from now on, too.</p><p class="calibre4">"Can I?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Okay, I get it. I'm in a swimsuit. I don't mind if you see me in it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, after dinner, we'll take a bath together." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay, okay. Geez, what's so great about a guy in a swimsuit." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Essentially, I think the one who gets benefits the most is me.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4">I get to see a very popular idol in a swimsuit right in front of my very eyes. If I were a devoted fan, I would have paid my entire month's salary to have this opportunity.</p><p class="calibre4">But the fact that she is offering to do it for free is...... more than a benefit, it's a little uncanny.</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, I'm going to serve chilled chuuka tonight by the way, can I ask you if you prefer normal sauce or sesame sauce?" (Rintaro) <i class="calibre8">(PTW/N: </i>冷やし中華<i class="calibre8"> [hiyashi chuuka; Chilled Chinese Noodles].)</i></p><p class="calibre4">"I prefer the former." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay. I'll prepare it then." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">We move to my room together, interspersing our conversation to divert our attention from the big event of the evening.</p><p class="calibre4">When we spend holidays, we are usually alone in my room.</p><p class="calibre4">We watch TV dramas and read various mangas together without doing anything else.</p><p class="calibre4">But only today, none of those were going through my head.</p><p class="calibre4">I hadn't taken a bath with someone since a school trip in middle school.</p><p class="calibre4">And this time it's even with a girl――――Aah, I feel like I'm doing something inappropriate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After what felt like a long but short time, and eventually even the dinner was over, I stand there in the changing room in a daze.</p><p class="calibre4">I have taken off all my clothes, and the only thing that exists on my lower body is the swimsuit I just bought.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Seriously, what the h*ll is this situation?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I can't help but mumble to myself as I look at my reflection in the mirror attached to the washbasin.</p><p class="calibre4">All this makes me look like a guy who is just trying on a new swimsuit he just bought to see if it looks good on him. But what is about to happen is an outrageous event that was never meant to happen in my life. To be honest, I still can't wrap my head around it.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――Rintaro, may I come in?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hyuu...... Y-you may." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Sh*t, I made a weird noise.</p><p class="calibre4">The door between the hallway and the changing room opens, leaving me in a state of shock.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/12b45bg/u9785-20b1a1e1-5aa9-4258-b755-fd8e3b44a91f.jpg" alt="u9785-20b1a1e1-5aa9-4258-b755-fd8e3b44a91f" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre4">What comes in through there is a single girl who is just simply way too beautiful.</p><p class="calibre4">"......I know it's a little late for this, but I'm a little embarrassed." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Then why don't you just stop it――――but it's too late now.</p><p class="calibre4">Her skin-colored limbs, which can only be described as a fine work of art, are gracefully elongated, giving the impression of being slender, while her thighs and other parts are firmly covered with soft-looking flesh.</p><p class="calibre4">And the most horrifying part is, those breasts of hers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The "cross halter bikini" lifts the adipose chest and accentuates her deep cleavage to a degree that is almost too much.</p><p class="calibre4">I can't. This is too much poison in the eyes.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre4">In standard Japanese, it's "dangerous". While in the Kansai dialect, it's "not good". <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: former: "Yabai", latter: "Akan".)</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">Hmm? Is "dangerous" a standard Japanese in the first place? Think, think of something else.</p><p class="calibre4">Gugigi, help me. <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: sorry, I have no idea with the "gugigi".)</i></b></p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro, are you nervous?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Naturally I am <b class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">(PTW/N: -desu wa)</i></b>." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Why are you talking like a young lady......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I don't know what I'm saying anymore.</p><p class="calibre4">Anyway, I'd better quickly get it over with. That's the best way to protect my heart and mind.</p><p class="calibre4">Then Rei takes the shower off the hook and begins to apply it to my feet.</p><p class="calibre4">"Is it cold?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, yeah......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I see." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">The shower starts at my feet and continues up to my shoulders.</p><p class="calibre4">When it reaches my shoulders, Rei's hand gently strokes the area where the hot water hits.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hyu――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah, did I tickle you?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"N-no......, it just startled me." (Rintaro)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why did you touch me? No, she did say earlier that she wanted to rub my back, though.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder what. But I feel like I have gradually fallen into indecencies.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm starting to feel like I'm doing something so wrong that I'd rather be stabbed by MilleSta's fans here for the sake of humanity.</p><p class="calibre4">But first, my heart may not be able to bear the strain of this situation and may stop.</p><p class="calibre4">"Can I wash your hair?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"......you can, but." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I can't even muster the energy to pick up the pace.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm made to sit on a plastic chair in the bathroom, and then, hot water is poured over my head.</p><p class="calibre4">I close my eyes and wait. Soon a slender finger, covered in shampoo, is rubbing my hair.</p><p class="calibre4">I feel a rush of pleasure.</p><p class="calibre4">As someone who likes to have my hair washed at salons, I have a weakness for this kind of thing.</p><p class="calibre4">Of course, she doesn't have the same technique as a hairdresser, but just the thought of having my head washed by her enhanced my senses beyond compare.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll rinse it off." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">No words are spoken, all I can do is nod.</p><p class="calibre4">Hot water is poured over my head and bubbles run down the drain.</p><p class="calibre4">I can eventually open my eyes, and then I immediately regret it.</p><p class="calibre4">The sight of Rei standing behind me comes into view once again through the mirror.</p><p class="calibre4">Her bikini, which is now wet from the hot water, is tight against her skin, d*mn intensifying her allure.</p><p class="calibre4">Does this lass want to kill me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">"Next up, your back." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ay." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I'm being exactly as meek as a lamb.</p><p class="calibre4">I just keep quiet and pray that this time will pass quickly.</p><p class="calibre4">"Rintaro's body is surprisingly sturdy. You look a little different when you're fully clothed." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"W-well...... househusband work is sometimes harder than I thought, also sometimes I want to move my body, so I do muscle training......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Because I am not a member of a club, I sometimes do exercises at home that cannot be compensated for in PE classes. I don't think I'm so old-fashioned as to be afraid of not getting enough exercise, but it can't be helped because I had no one to rely on when I got sick.</p><p class="calibre4">Since there was no one to take care of me, I had no choice but to take care of myself so that I wouldn't get sick in the first place.</p><p class="calibre4">"You have a broad back, and this is worth washing." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei takes the body soap out of the bottle and thoroughly rubs it in with the palm of her hand.</p><p class="calibre4">――――wait, why don't you use a towel for washing? It's hanging right there.</p><p class="calibre4">"......hold still." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">She slips her hand on my back.</p><p class="calibre4">Wait, wait wait wait wait wait.</p><p class="calibre4">I want to stop her, but I am too agitated to speak.</p><p class="calibre4">While I'm in such a state, Rei's hand is moving.</p><p class="calibre4">I felt more pleasure than when my head was being washed, and my breath leaked out.</p><p class="calibre4">As I thought, I'm going to die today, aren't I?</p><p class="calibre4">"Does it feel good?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I barely move my head and give a single nod.</p><p class="calibre4">It is nothing but a reflex. And the fact that I nodded here only encouraged her more.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――Then, how about this?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">*Squeeze*</i></p>
<p class="calibre4">Such an onomatopoeic sound sounded.</p><p class="calibre4">A temperature different from that of hot water spreads over most of my back.</p><p class="calibre4">It is coming from human skin. A little warmer than mine.</p><p class="calibre4">And the object flexibly changing shape against my back is probably her breast――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"――――AAAAAAHHH! This is no good!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Ah!" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">I finally exceed my capacity and stand up on the spot to shake her off.</p><p class="calibre4">......That action is a big mistake.</p><p class="calibre4">I get up vigorously and lose my balance due to the bubbles of body soap that were flowing on the floor.</p><p class="calibre4">I quickly invert my body and do attempt to protect myself with my hands, but then I see Rei's figure in front of me.</p><p class="calibre4">By the time I realize my failure, it is already too late. My body collapsed together with Rei's.</p><p class="calibre4">"............My bad." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"......" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Underneath my body, which was barely supported by my arms, is Rei with a stunned expression on her face.</p><p class="calibre4">The composition will appear to be me pushing her down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yeah, I guess the only thing I can do now is to commit seppuku.</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Rintaro, are you hurt?" (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"U-uh, no." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Thank goodness then." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">Rei's face is blushing, though she is trying to look nonchalant as she states it.</p><p class="calibre4">Seeing her eyes swimming with embarrassment, a question pops into my head.</p><p class="calibre4">Why did, Rei suddenly act like this?</p><p class="calibre4">I had accepted her acts up to halfway because she originally is an unpredictable girl.</p><p class="calibre4">However, there is something strange about this embarrassment of hers.</p><p class="calibre4">Maybe, very possibly.</p><p class="calibre4">"You got, somebody blowing some sh*t into your head, don't you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"......You're wrong." (Rei)</p><p class="calibre4">"No matter what you insist, it's all too obvious!" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">After all, it is likely that Rei had been influenced by someone.</p><p class="calibre4">I can think of only one person who would do something like this.</p><p class="calibre4">The cool member of MilleSta――――who often threw teasing words and deeds at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that "that lassie" needs to be told off once and for all.</p>

<p class="calibre" id="calibre_link-3"><p class="calibre7">◇◇◇</p><p class="calibre4">After Rei, who looked all embarrassed, returned to her room, I sat on the sofa and fiddled with my phone for a while.</p><p class="calibre4">[We need to talk.] (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">I send such a message to Mia.</p><p class="calibre4">Ten minutes later, the intercom rings, and I go to the entrance.</p><p class="calibre4">".......Yo." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What's up all of a sudden? Inviting a girl into your room at this time of night?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">On the other side of the door is a girl with a different countenance from Rei's.</p><p class="calibre4">She is Ugawa Mia. She is also known as MIA of the Millefeuille Stars.</p><p class="calibre4">She looks at me with a somewhat amused look on her face as she runs her fingers through her shoulder-length black hair.</p><p class="calibre4">"Come inside for now. I have a lot of questions I need to ask you......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't ask anything obscene, okay?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm going to put mayonnaise on the ends of every strand of your hair and lick them all over." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's an unusual way to harass me." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">I take Mia with me and return to the living room.</p><p class="calibre4">I sit her down on the sofa and place the black coffee I have prepared in advance on the table in front of her.</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh my, I thought you are going to be mad at me, but you're surprisingly hospitable, aren't you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well yeah, I'm not mad at you. I'm not so small-minded that I can't even offer my guest a cup of coffee." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmmm...... I'll take it without reservation, then." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">I sit down beside her as she drinks her coffee and I let out a breath before starting the conversation.</p><p class="calibre4">"Phew...... you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mm." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You infused Rei with some weird sh*t, didn't you?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmmm...... I'm getting found out, yes." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia smiles at me defiantly.</p><p class="calibre4">Facing her like that, I let out another sigh of exasperation.</p><p class="calibre4">"You know what? Rei said she wanted to see your swimsuit, so I gave her a little advice. I told her to go in and take a bath together with you." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......I knew it. That's what got me into all this trouble." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmmm? Trouble, huh. I'm certain it must have been a wonderful event for a boy your age, right?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, I won't deny it." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Oh my, you're being surprisingly honest here." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">It is normal for the average guy to be pleased with that situation. Therefore, I will not deceive myself.</p><p class="calibre4">"By the way, did you enjoy the shopping date? I also taught her some techniques for indirect kissing." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"So that was also your idea, huh!?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Unfortunately, Rei knows very little about such romantic techniques. It was fun and worthwhile........ Though I have to say, I never actually tried it myself." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"You're just like a demon lord, you know......." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I'll take it as a compliment." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia giggles in front of me.</p><p class="calibre4">Seeing her enjoying herself like that, the poisonous feeling in me slips away.</p><p class="calibre4">I can't hate this girl either....... really.</p><p class="calibre4">"So in the end, overall, did you enjoy it?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Mmm........., I guess. I had a good time." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I think there should be a small reward for my efforts in directing such a date, don't you think?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"What? Why would I――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">As if to cut me off, Mia suddenly thrusts something in front of me that seems to have been hidden behind her back.</p><p class="calibre4">It's a notebook and an English problem book.</p><p class="calibre4">"Can you help me with my English homework?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... Do it yourself." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Don't say that. You get good grades, don't you, Rintaro-kun? I would like you to teach me how to solve them." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">English, huh?</p><p class="calibre4">I'm certainly not bad at it, but if someone asks me if I put enough effort into it so that I can teach it, then that's a no.</p><p class="calibre4">But it's not something that I'm going to have trouble with, so I'll decide whether or not I'm going to teach her after I've had a look at the problem book.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then lend me the problem book." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay."</p><p class="calibre4">I take the English book from her and look through it.</p><p class="calibre4">The questions are in a slightly different format than the ones I know because we are attending different schools. However, the questions themselves are not difficult.</p><p class="calibre4">As long as I remember the basic sentence structure, even I can handle it.</p><p class="calibre4">"I think I can teach you a thing or two. Guess I can keep you company for a while." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Thank you, you're a big help. I've been missing a lot of classes this school year, and there have been several things I didn't understand." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">It must be quite difficult to balance both entertainment and student work.</p><p class="calibre4">It can't be a bad thing to help someone who is making such an endeavor.</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, can I ask you to start on this page?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Okay, then the translation here is――――" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Thus begins an abrupt evening study session.</p><p class="calibre4">Mia's school is not particularly low in deviation scores, so she easily solved problems without any particular guidance.</p><p class="calibre4">I explained to her carefully the parts that she sometimes stumbled over, as if they were parts she had not learned in class. I had little difficulty in teaching her, as she quickly learned the material.</p><p class="calibre4">"......Say" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"What?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Why are you working so hard on it?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Isn't it natural for students to study hard?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">That is true.</p><p class="calibre4">But that's not what I want to ask right now――――.</p><p class="calibre4">"I understand what you mean. You're asking why I'm studying so hard when I'm selling so well as an idol." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Well, to put it simply." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">If you've secured such popularity as an idol, what's the point of staying in school any longer? That's what I think.</p><p class="calibre4">However, the three girls still continued to attend school. And they were doing so diligently.</p><p class="calibre4">"I think it's because I want to graduate from high school at least. Even the smallest incident could easily destroy what we have built up, right? So taking it as insurance is the best way to put it." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"......You're absolutely right." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"I think this is a common understanding among the three of us....... and from here on it's my personal reason." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">She continues her words in a calm voice with eyes that seem to be looking at something far away.</p><p class="calibre4">"I'm not trying to do well in all subjects. It is only English that I want to learn at all costs." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Only English?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Yup, I want to be able to speak fluent English so that I can live abroad in the future." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Those words are shocking to me, enough to render me speechless.</p><p class="calibre4">"I don't have a concrete plan for the future yet, but I want to be someone who can work abroad. Be an actress, a singer, or something else." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"That's a...... huge dream." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"That is. I think it was my mother's influence....... I've had that kind of dream for a long time." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Mia's mother is a famous actress, as I recall.</p><p class="calibre4">The fact that I don't know her name, not that I don't watch TV at all, means that maybe she is someone who is working abroad. If so, it would make sense that Mia was influenced by her.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hey, hey, Rintaro-kun, you're aiming to be a full-time househusband, aren't you?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hmm? Well, I am." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Then, why don't you accompany me?" (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">Our eyes locked, and the time stops.</p><p class="calibre4">Eventually, I caught on to what Mia was meaning and laughed it off as a joke.</p><p class="calibre4">"Hufft, If you become my wife in five or six years, I'll accompany you wherever you go. Serving one beloved woman is the way I think of being a full-time househusband." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">"Hee~ that's a surprisingly low hurdle to jump." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"It's all up to you. I'm not going to change myself, and I'm not going to go out of my way to match you." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">If there is someone I will be willing to bend over backwards to be with, it is someone I will spend my entire life with. There is no way I could meet someone like that so easily. In fact, I don't think it would be so easy.</p><p class="calibre4">So I will stay calm and not make any decisions based on my feelings on the spot.</p><p class="calibre4">――――Well, I'm already losing my calmness, though.</p><p class="calibre4">I'm aware of it.</p><p class="calibre4">"Pfft, that's just so like you.......It might not be a bad idea to live alone together in a place where I don't know a single person, Just you and me." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">".......Did something happen?" (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">Despite the tone of her voice, her expression is tinged with melancholy, and I couldn't help but ask such a penetrating question.</p><p class="calibre4">But Mia just shakes her head.</p><p class="calibre4">"Nothing in particular, nothing at all. Really." (Mia)</p><p class="calibre4">"...... I see." (Rintaro)</p><p class="calibre4">For a while, there's only the sound of a mechanical pencil moving.</p><p class="calibre4"><i class="calibre6">*Nothing in particular, nothing at all.*</i></p><p class="calibre4">That statement sounds like a "precedent" to me.</p><p class="calibre4">"If it's you then, it's nothing."――――</p><p class="calibre4">I'm not a nice guy.</p><p class="calibre4">I don't want to get involved in anything messy, and I'm not superhuman enough to solve things brilliantly when I do get involved.</p><p class="calibre4">So I won't go any further into it.</p><p class="calibre4">I wonder if one day, when I am recognized as someone who is truly worth relying on, she will talk to me about it――――</p>
