<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>They probably thought of us as ideal children who quietly accepted their new life after their parents’ re-marriage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I was sure that not even in their wildest dreams had they thought that their two kids were actually dating and flirting in their shadows, behind their line of sight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today was Saturday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother and Neneka’s father had to go to work.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was a nurse at the university hospital, so she often got shifts on Saturdays.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s father worked for an IT company and basically had his days-off on weekends and holidays. However, sometimes he was called to work on weekends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Therefore, right now, there was only Neneka and I at home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words… today, there would be no one to get in the way as I flirt with Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Perhaps today I could at last kiss Neneka…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I expected that, my heart started pounding on that thought. Our parents would probably return around the evening. Although it was earlier than usual, it was more than enough time to spend alone with Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the meantime, we didn’t have to pretend to be siblings. I could treat Neneka as my girlfriend, and Neneka could also treat me as her boyfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a week had passed since we started living together. At last, it was finally our bonus lover’s time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka… About today, do you…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I went to the living room in order to discuss how we should spend our time together. But, Neneka was back in the kitchen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh? What are you doing there?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I asked Neneka, who was busy cooking in the kitchen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fufu… I’m cooking.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka replied while wearing a floral apron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She had prepared many ingredients and was already finished with some dishes, consecutively putting them in storage containers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was to the level that someone might even think it was for some night party.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What will you do with such a large amount of food?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I will keep them refrigerated or frozen. If I make a batch of them this weekend, then all that would be left to do would be to microwave it on weekdays, and we could have something to eat right? It would save time and money, and all in all, it’s convenient.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Near Neneka, there was a book titled, &#8220;The strongest pre-made recipe collection.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I flipped it open, my fingertips touched a sticky note that I thought Neneka had put on it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;What should I do… My sister-in-law was just too good of a person…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even after the re-marriage, our parents were still working, and it became us, children&#8217;s responsibility to prepare weekly meals. The custom was to be continued without a change even after the re-marriage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But now that I had a sibling, I didn’t have to do things I had been doing all alone. With such a sense of security, I felt really relaxed, however…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;After living with Daiki’s family, I was at last able to learn something over this past week. It&#8217;s that I could enjoy cooking together with Daiki. Still, it&#8217;s indeed difficult to cook for four people right after returning from school and buying ingredients for the food… Daiki? What’s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who was putting several containers in the freezer, saw me speechlessly standing in awe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No… I just thought Neneka would become an excellent wife in the future…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? E-Eh, wife?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, Neneka’s cheeks turned red.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;D-Do you think I-I can be a good wife…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka asking that timidly looked just incredibly cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You can definitely be!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really? Does… Daiki also feel like it would be good if I became a wife in the future?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing Neneka’s embarrassed expression, my stove made a ticking sound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey, hey, don’t light up with just this, my stove!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… I do think so.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I told Neneka calmly so that she wouldn’t feel anything suspicious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really? I&#8217;m so glad…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s shy smile looked just too adorable. Neneka happily, smiling, peeled off the skin of the carrots one by one. For some reason or another, I averted my eyes from the peeled carrots and looked out the window.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ah… What a clear sky!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While looking at this refreshing blue sky, I went on to purify, my evil, lustful thoughts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, our parents were not at home with us, so it might not be a problem even if my stove ignited with its flame in full strength.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I didn’t want to disturb Neneka, who was doing her best to cook for our family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Can I also help in one way or another…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka immediately reacted when I whispered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, then, can you take care of washing the laundry with the machine? I still don’t know to to use the washing machine at Daiki’s house…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Roger that…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wanting to show some of my good sides, I briskly headed to the washroom. A thick pile of clothes was accumulated when I looked at the laundry basket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;As expected from a family of four, the laundry did pile up rather quickly…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We had a front-loading washing machine with a dryer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It might have been too sophisticated to wash clothes in it in a household containing only a mother and her son.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, its size was just about right for washing a large amount of laundry for four at once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having a dryer was very convenient. Put things in the laundry basket into the laundry net appropriately, then throw them into the washing machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother taught me how to use a laundry net, but to be honest, I didn’t really know what to put in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost everything was done, not overthinking about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, my hand somehow touched something resembling a beautiful lace.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I should probably put the lace-type materials in the net.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even I knew that much. When I pulled out the lace material with a triumphant look, what appeared there was a pink brassiere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was a healthy high school boy who grew up in a single-mother household. Thanks to the daily housework, I instantly knew that this bra was clearly bigger than my mother’s bra.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;It was Neneka’s!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just couldn’t take my eyes off it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No… Before I think of something unwarranted, I should take my hand off that bra!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Don’t try to synthesize my imaginations of this bra with Neneka’s naked body that I saw on the first day of living together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;…!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was so surprised that I forgot how to breathe. Neneka’s voice came from behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I fearfully turned around, Neneka was standing at the entrance of the washroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was staring at me with her eyebrows curled up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I came to ask where the olive oil is…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s eyes staring at me must have already caught the existence of her bra being ravaged by my hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My blood suddenly felt drained, and a cold sweat flowed down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No… umm… this is…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey… Daiki! That thing, isn’t that supposed to be a bad thing to do…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She would get angry. No, that might not even be it at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;She might get disillusioned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I prepared myself, Neneka continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Since it’s your younger sister’s underwear, shouldn’t you just wash it right away…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She wasn’t offended…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing that unexpected reaction from Neneka. I was taken aback.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka calmly approached me and said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Since we’re now living together. I’m sure there will be many more opportunities to see them from now on. If you overreact like that each time… Our mother will get suspicious of you and think that you’re probably looking at me as a member of the opposite sex, right? Therefore, rule addition. Rule 8! My underwear should be splendidly ignored!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I-Is that so… Then I should just think of it as just a piece of cloth and ignore it…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to gently move Neneka’s bra, which I had been holding in my hand for a while, into the washing machine. Still, for some reason, Neneka grabbed onto my hand and stopped me immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wait!! I won’t ask you to wash it with your hands, so at least put it in a net first!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I-I understand…!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurriedly put it in the net and threw it in the washing machine. I knew that I should put things made of lace into the net until just a little while ago, but I was so flustered that I just forgot about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dangerous, dangerous…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I calmed my pounding heart, Neneka said, staring at the washing machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki. This washing machine has a dryer, right? So, can you take out the clothes that you just put before you put it in the dryer? I heard that if you put them in a dryer, they get damaged faster.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, after it’s finished washing, I’ll only take out the clothes that shouldn’t be dried by it. At that time, I will also take out my mother’s… So well…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see… Daiki is really upright. Ah, it is not like I noticed it just now though.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was fidgeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all, it might have been embarrassing for her to have her own underwear touched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… I’m sorry to have touched your underwear… without permission. Should I try not to touch it from now on?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Uh… huh! It’s okay! But basically I will try and put my underwear in the net and put it in the washing machine by myself. Even so, there might be chances when you encounter it… So, I will think of it as, since Daiki is my Onii-chan, it can’t be helped if it’s seen, so I will ignore it!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, more importantly, where is the olive oil…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, umm, it must be in the storage shelf under the stove.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I’ll look for it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Neneka left the washroom, I breathed a sigh of relief. When I was alone, my eyes naturally turned to Neneka’s bra.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her bra was now wrapped in the laundry net and was almost invisible. Thinking that it was my younger sister’s bra, I decided to let go of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there was one thing that really bothered me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I wanted to see the size…!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This couldn’t be helped! Even brothers got curious about their younger sister’s size…!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the time I saw her naked, I was curious about it. What was her chest size in terms of cups?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gently reached for the laundry net that was just put in the washing machine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Over the net was fine. I wanted to see the size…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I picked up the laundry net without opening it and was just about to find the size written down on the tag…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Onii-chan…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My body suddenly had a lightning bolt run through it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ne-Neneka…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I turned around, I saw my sister-in-law smiling gently. No, her eyes were not smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah… umm… I was wondering if the net zipper was properly closed…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see… that’s fine, but… it’s embarrassing if you stare at it that much, so I would like you to stop looking at ITS details…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m sorry! It was just a sudden impulse!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt disqualified as a brother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I dropped my shoulders to my actions and my pathetic figure who gave in to temptation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that, it was already evening while busy cooking, washing, cleaning and tidying up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The four of us had just moved in together a week ago, and there were things scattered around the house that we couldn’t find a place to put them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, Neneka and I worked diligently to make things tidy. That included tidying up the washroom and the shoeboxes so that everyone could use them easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While talking with Neneka and devising various things, it became so much fun that I lost track of time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our family was no longer just &#8220;us and our single-parent.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After our parents went off to work, we no longer had to be all alone at home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that was probably what made Neneka and I both happy and excited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And before I knew it, I had forgotten that today was the day I had planned to kiss Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later today, at four o’clock in the afternoon, our parents came home together. It seemed that my mother, who had finished her work earlier went all the way to pick up Neneka’s father from his office by car and brought him home rather than having him take the train to come home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After that, we all ate the dinner that Neneka and I had prepared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later on, I took a bath, and Neneka took one afterwards…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that, now I was fooling around in my room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt that Neneka would come to my room today for some reason, so I waited for her to get out of the bath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even after more than an hour had passed, there was no sign of Neneka coming upstairs, let alone coming back to her room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I wonder what&#8217;s taking Neneka so long…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Curious, I headed downstairs. I looked into the living room, but only my parents were there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where was Neneka?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki? What happened?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother noticed my presence, called out to me while sitting beside Neneka’s father. At that time, I saw the two sitting side by side on the sofa, holding hands and watching TV. Really, they were such close newlyweds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you know where Neneka is?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother pointed at the upper floor with her free hand when I asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Isn’t she in her room upstairs?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I felt like she wasn’t there, though.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, then maybe she is still busy folding out the laundry. I just asked her to help me do it, but she told me to take it easy since I had just returned from work. Neneka-chan is really a very sweet and kind girl.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka who continuously worried about our parents, was definitely the image of an adult. If I was alone, I would have done the housework during the day and probably would have asked my mother to take care of the rest at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I wondered if I should go and help her…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I saw my parents getting along well and flirting, I also felt the urge to flirt with Neneka. As a reward for my hard work during the day, I wanted to spend some sweet time and ambiance with Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She would probably be in the washroom if asked to fold the laundry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without hesitation, I headed to the washroom where I could see the lights turned on through the small window glass above the door. I was sure that she was indeed inside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I opened the door without knocking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Gacha.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I just stared at each other without uttering a single word. Neneka was wearing my school Y-shirt while she was in the washroom for some reason or another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She seemed to be wearing shorts too, which was her room wear. But since she was almost entirely covered till the hem by my Y-shirt, I got perplexed, thinking that she might not have worn anything underneath for a moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well even if I had known that she was wearing something right underneath, other factors made my blood rush in excitement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What are you doing…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I asked in confusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No! Th-This… this is just a little, yes, a slight improvisation!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A startled Neneka turned bright red and hid her chest area with her arms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Did she wear my Y-shirt on a whim?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, no, instead, it was way too cute…!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was this the rumored Kare-Shirt?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why did she look so cute even though she was wearing a baggy shirt like a one-piece?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it perhaps because I knew she was smaller than my own body size that it intrigued me and caused a sense of wanting to protect her?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, if I looked closely, I could even see the bra line under her thin Y-shirt. I could also catch a glimpse of the deep cleavage formed by her chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Strange…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though I wanted to protect her, what was this contradictory feeling that seemed to have zero interest in protecting her…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m going to take it off immediately… Or so I would like to say, but I’m not wearing any clothes underneath… So, can you go out for a bit?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I obediently complied with Neneka’s request and left the washroom. And then, specific thoughts surfaced in my mind. The other day, Neneka’s grandmother called me a &#8220;beast,&#8221; which had me surprised at that time, but now that I thought about it, every healthy high school boy had at least one &#8220;beast&#8221; sleeping deep inside their heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, a mischievous, vicious beast that could go on a rampage if we made even a single mistake. However, we, high school boys had no intention of letting that beast go unchecked and wild.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was trying to tame it so that it didn’t bother the people living around me. However, sometimes there were girls like Neneka who could quickly liberate these sleeping beasts, who then went wild instantly, so it was definitely a problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then again, it was incredibly troublesome because all that would happen would be somewhat done unconsciously. Even now, the &#8220;beast&#8221; inside me was licking its lips and teeth with its tongue when I suddenly saw Neneka wearing my shirt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I waited for Neneka to change into her clothes, I took constant deep breaths making sure to keep my mind calm. Maintaining an animal was no easy task.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You can come in now, I have changed into my clothes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I heard a voice and gently opened the door. Neneka was now wearing her T-shirt in the washroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… could it be that you came to help me?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah… I thought it would be faster if we worked together.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you. That helps a lot.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka took out the dried laundry from the washing machine, folded it, and put it in the basket. There were four baskets, each dedicated to me, Neneka, my mother and Neneka’s father’s clothes separately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Standing next to Neneka, I also reached out for the clothes. I picked up my pajama pants and suddenly looked at Neneka. Looking at Neneka’s T-shirt felt weird.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Why could I see the seams of her T-shirt?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Checking the back of the neck, sure enough, there was a tag hanging visible on the front side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm? Neneka… your T-shirt is probably worn inside out?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh!? No way!? Oh my… so embarrassing…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s face turned bright red when she realized that her T-shirt was worn on the seams-end. Probably while changing from my Y-shirt, she was in a hurry to put on her T-shirt and in that rush, didn’t notice that she wore her clothes on the opposite, seams-end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Mou… No more… I’ve been showing you my embarrassing sides ever since we started living together… Y-You ar-aren’t disillusioned, are you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s eyes were watery. I could tell easily that she was worried about what to do if I started hating her. Although there&#8217;s no way that someone like me, who thought her every action was cute and adorable, would ever hate her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m not disillusioned at all. I’m happy to witness various sides of Neneka. If we hadn’t started living together as siblings, I probably wouldn’t ever have had the opportunity to see Neneka like this. I’m lucky…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fufu… then that’s fine, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka smiled happily and threw her body at me. When I catched and pushed her, she again threw herself at me. While joking around for a while like that, I started feeling that Neneka was lovely and charming.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I embraced Neneka tightly as she again jumped onto me. Neneka’s shampoo’s smell emanating from her hair smelled good. I could clearly feel Neneka’s warm and soft body through her thin T-shirt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka embraced back tightly while calling my name.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;W-Wait! Neneka… W-What about the rules?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s not in front of our parents, so it’s not against the rules. So, please, just for a little bit longer…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka came yet closer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Oh no, this was bad… what should I do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t think I would be able to let go of her anymore if it went on like this…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was getting tempted. A little was starting to feel not enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Greed started assaulting me, wanting me to spend time forever like this…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly right after, Neneka separated her body from mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before I could hear her reply, I noticed the current situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Footsteps…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interactions…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother and Neneka’s father were approaching…!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I instantly switched to sibling mode. I hurriedly took the laundry out from the washing machine and started folding them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Gacha.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka-chan. Are you done? You’ve already worked hard enough during the day, so let me help with the rest, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Father will help too, so you don’t need to worry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While my mother opened the bathroom door. Neneka’s father appeared, peaking from behind. At that time, Neneka said sharply to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan! Fold the laundry more carefully!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m sorry!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ara-Ara Daiki… did Neneka-chan already find out that you’re sloppy?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s difficult, isn’t it? Folding out the laundry neatly. I’m always warned by Neneka too… So, umm… Neneka? Isn’t your T-shirt worn inside out?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah! This is, umm… it’s true! I also just noticed!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really, Neneka is also quite sloppy as well…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ahaha…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the end, everyone ended up folding their own laundry while arguing. It&#8217;s a pity that I got interrupted when I was enjoying my lover’s time with Neneka, but I didn’t feel that bad. This was also a fun and fulfilling time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, I had to say, Neneka was so quick to switch and also good at acting in an instant. The two of us were doing our best to fold the laundry just a little while ago. It was really extraordinary to give out such an ambiance so readily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;We were safe, thanks to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It felt like we had crossed a dangerous bridge today, but somehow our relationship didn’t get exposed today either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The very next day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that since today was Sunday, the whole family would be at home since it was a holiday. However, here I was, at home alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My parents went on a shopping date, while Neneka said, &#8220;Last night, my friends suddenly called asking to study together,&#8221; and left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I thought it was important to socialize with friends, it was a chance to be alone together with each other… Thinking on those lines, I started feeling terribly lonely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Don’t think about something so uncool…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Being jealous of her friends was just being too narrow-minded, wasn’t it? Wanting to get rid of my sullen self, I washed my face in the washroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I took a plastic bottle of soda from the refrigerator and went upstairs. As soon as I entered my room, I opened the window and went to my study desk. Even though I had to take exams next year, now was a bit different from before, when I could only meet Neneka back at school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right now, we lived in the same house together as siblings and had a relationship where we ate and slept under the same roof.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though we had already become close to this extent, I knew I was just being too greedy, wanting to spend time together even more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Was I being pushy?&#8221; Because she was my very first girlfriend, I just couldn’t calmly analyze my emotions. Since I decided not to tell anyone that we were dating, there was no one I could talk to casually.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I started worrying about this, I felt that it would eventually affect my mental health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Even if I did worry, it was useless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I had that kind of free time to worry uselessly, it was better to use that time to focus on the problems at hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I opened my math reference book and started solving problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would take my university entrance exam at the beginning of the following year.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I didn’t study hard, Neneka would eventually be disappointed if I became a ronin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even now, Neneka must also be working hard on her studies with her friends…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka said she would come back early, but I wonder what time it will be…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The clock on the wall already showed 10.50 a.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said she would come back after lunch. So, if she was to come back, it would be around 3 p.m.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Wait… Why was all I was doing was, constantly thinking of Neneka since a while ago? I hadn’t even done an ounce of the problems!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hating myself for thinking about Neneka, the next moment, I heaved a sigh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as if to stop me from deviating from my studies again, I ate instant cup ramen for lunch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then, just when I was fooling around, almost falling asleep on my bed, I heard the sound of the front door opening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m home…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;It was Neneka!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as I heard Neneka’s voice, I rushed out of my room, ran down the stairs and headed for the front door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing me run straight up to the entrance, Neneka smiled softly saying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What’s wrong…? You just looked like a dog that was happy to see its owner return back home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My face instantly heated up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I guess I looked too desperate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mean…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The analogy of a dog that was happy to see its owner come home fit just too perfectly in my case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are our parents back yet?&#8221; Neneka came into the house while asking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;&#8220;Nuh-huh. They haven’t come back yet.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see. I guess it’s… our lover’s time now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s words blew away the shame I had till moments ago. I could also see Neneka fidgeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, I became nervous as I became conscious that it was just the two of us alone at home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka must have also returned home early, intending to spend time with me as a lover.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words… Neneka also wanted to do such lovey-dovey-like stuff with me as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even for me, as I wanted to enjoy such an ambiance with Neneka. I had been waiting for her since this very morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, when it came to that kind of atmosphere, somehow I started getting defensive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though we were still standing in front of the hallway, near the entrance. The atmosphere had become unapproachable and irritating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I guess&#8230; we could enjoy some quality time together before our parents come home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah… it&#8217;s now or never.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm, where do you want to start?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm… what should we do?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until now, when I got into a good mood with Neneka, it wasn&#8217;t because we were trying to get into that kind of atmosphere. It just happened naturally, as if we were being guided. It seemed that we couldn&#8217;t just say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting kind of… nervous.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said as she laughed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could feel that she was trying to soften the atmosphere of the place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well… it might be tough to suddenly switch to lover mode, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, let&#8217;s take a pause and start in sibling mode, as usual! Right? Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saying Onii-chan… Neneka hugged my arms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was so cute that I thought she was going to win the cute little sister grand prix.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;For a little sister, you&#8217;re a little close to your brother, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I love you so much.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re too cute, I think your brother will get in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm. In what way?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Big, patchy eyes stared at me. They sparkled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I think it will turn on your brother&#8217;s… wolf switch.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wolf switch? What would happen when that switch would be flipped?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Your brother will turn into a wolf.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What would it be like to be a wolf, Onii-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Like a little sister in elementary school, Neneka repeatedly asked innocent questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, the actual Neneka was in the same grade as me. As a healthy high school girl, Neneka should be able to imagine the answer to my question. Knowing this, she dared to ask such questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There&#8217;s no way my wolf switch would stay asleep after she was being such a little devil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I put my hands on both of Neneka&#8217;s cheeks. Then, Neneka, who had her face caught between my two hands, looked down in embarrassment. Her cheeks were distorted because she was caught between my hands.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Look at me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I said that, Neneka looked up with a downcast, bewildered look on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Are you that embarrassed?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s embarrassing…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, do you want to stop…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh when Neneka looked at me as if she was in a panic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey! Don&#8217;t make fun of me!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Sorry, sorry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No more. I won&#8217;t do it anymore.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka turned away in a huff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh shit, I teased her… too much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry… Neneka. My bad.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Fufu&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was apologizing in all seriousness, and Neneka bursted out laughing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, it was done back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, that seriously worried me!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ehehe. But it was you who did it first.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, but…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Hey, don&#8217;t you want do that anymore?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka looked up at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was asked, &#8220;don&#8217;t you want do that anymore?&#8221; But I felt like I was being told to hurry up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew I shouldn&#8217;t make her wait, so I quickly brought my face closer to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka looked surprised for a moment, but quickly closed her eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, our first kiss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had been two months since we started dating. We had been living together for one week, and this was finally the day…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Don.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Gofu!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a moment, I didn&#8217;t know what had happened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got a big jolt on my chest, choked up, and found myself rolling in the hallway.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back!&#8230; You&#8217;re back early!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka ran up to my mother as she came in through the front door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was when I had finally grasped a hold of the situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was about to open the front door when we were about to kiss. Neneka noticed this and pushed me out of the way so that she wouldn&#8217;t see us kissing, and I fell on the floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;As expected of Neneka. I couldn&#8217;t believe that she was trying to kiss me just a moment ago, it was the speed of her transformation&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps Neneka was so desperate that she couldn&#8217;t control her strength, but I took a pretty good one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I bought a delicious-looking cake and decided to come home before it went bad… Huh? Is that you, Daiki? What are you doing there?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother found me lying on the floor and called out to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Nan demo nai desu…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t be sitting here… if it wasn&#8217;t something, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so hot&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My voice was as inorganic as a robot&#8217;s because of the pain in my body and my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t say that I was about to kiss my sister-in-law when my mother came home and my panicked sister-in-law pushed me out of the way and thus fell on the floor. I didn&#8217;t want her to mention why I was getting along so well with the floor though.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I picked myself up, I saw Neneka looking at me with an apologetic expression on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her mouth moved without a sound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I smiled wryly and nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought it was better than being seen kissing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was time for dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today&#8217;s dinner was mainly the side dishes from the department store that my mother bought and brought home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, after dinner, we ate the cake that my mother had bought for us. All four of us had the same kind of chocolate shortcake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Neneka&#8217;s father was telling me about a famous pastry chef&#8217;s limited-time traveling sales store, my mother brought Neneka a paper bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I was shopping with Ryosuke-san today and found some loungewear that I thought would look good on Neneka-chan. I only had a son, so it had always been a dream of mine to pick out girls&#8217; clothes. Would you be willing to take it if you would like?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wow, thank you, mother-in-law!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I was going to give it to you before you took a bath, but the timing wasn&#8217;t right, I’m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No! I&#8217;ll try it on later! I&#8217;m glad, too, because I hardly remember having my… mom pick out clothes for me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Receiving the paper bag, Neneka looked really happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Dad, I&#8217;m glad you got remarried to such a nice person, I&#8217;m happy too. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s father smiled shyly when Neneka thanked him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear you say so, Neneka. I feel really lucky to have met Sana-san.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, where did dad and mother-in-law meet?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents’ meeting. I had never heard of that either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents looked at each other with embarrassment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka waited to hear from our parents with an excited look on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I ate a piece of chocolate cake, thinking, &#8220;This is going to be a long story.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, do you remember when… I got sick from overwork and ended up in the hospital?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Neneka&#8217;s father asked, Neneka&#8217;s mouth twitched as if she remembered those days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I remember. How could I forget? When I got a call that you collapsed at work, I thought my heart was going to stop.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. The hospital where I was taken to was the university hospital where Daiki-kun’s mother works. I was taken care of by his mother while I was in the hospital.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Does that mean my mom hit on a patient at work?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was quite taken back when I imagined my mother, who fell in love with Neneka&#8217;s father, nursing him with such devotion, while including her personal feelings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, my mother&#8217;s eyes set on my statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t imagine anything strange, will you? I&#8217;m only a nurse. Well, I did give him a little lecture for working in a way that didn&#8217;t take care of himself, even though he had a daughter.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, Daiki-kun. Your mother treated me only as a nurse. But I was the one who made a fierce approach on her, saying I liked her and asking her to go out with me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s father said with a scratch on his head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this, Neneka&#8217;s eyes lighted up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Dad confessed to mother-in-law?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, I thought, I&#8217;m this old, and I have a daughter who&#8217;s old enough, but I couldn&#8217;t stop myself. As we talked, I learned that Sana-san had also lost her spouse and was raising her son on her own. I felt like it was fate…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was apparently quite a hot love affair for this remarried couple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No wonder they had been making out ever since they moved in together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yesterday was a week since we started living together, but I couldn&#8217;t believe that it had only been a week. That&#8217;s how comfortable I feel living here together.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother said with a sincere look on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… I&#8217;ve been so desperate that I didn&#8217;t realize it until now, but I guess I&#8217;ve been lonely too. I&#8217;m very happy now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Sana-san…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s father laid his hand on my mother&#8217;s tightly clasped hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents were supposed to have had a lovey-dovey date during the day, but apparently they hadn’t flirted enough just yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t give you the same things as Sana-san&#8217;s former husband, but I will support Sana-san in my own way so… don&#8217;t hold it in alone anymore.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ryosuke-san…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was touching to see them holding hands with each other, having lost their spouses more than ten years ago and having raised their children alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But as I ate my chocolate cake, I thought to myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;This flirting is going to be a long one… I guess it is time to escape to my room before it had a negative impact on my mental health.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had something on my mind all week. It was about the question, &#8220;Why do I get so angry when I see my parents making out?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first I thought it was because I had no tolerance for this sight. I also thought it was because I was an adolescent and physiologically unable to accept my parents&#8217; flirting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But now I suddenly understood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was jealous that my parents were free to make out while I was trying my best to make time for Neneka and I alone, taking care of what people around me thought. In other words, it was jealousy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I quickly shoved the rest of the chocolate cake into my mouth to get off from the table. Just then, under the table, Neneka poked my leg with her toes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I glanced over at Neneka, but she was eating cake with a clear face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, Neneka was also envious of our parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tugged back at Neneka&#8217;s toes with the thought that Neneka should finish eating as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t work too hard on your own anymore, okay, Ryosuke-san? You&#8217;ve been working hard all this time by yourself, so don&#8217;t push yourself too hard.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sana-san.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents looked at each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think they forgot that there were children in the same space as they were in right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I bet they would go off into their own world and then disappear into their bedroom together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was drinking milk to leave them alone and return to my room, my mother unexpectedly spoke to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;By the way, Neneka-chan? Did Daiki do something rude?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I guess Neneka didn&#8217;t think she would have to talk about herself here. Surprised, she raised her voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, not at all…!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We suddenly became the topic of the conversation, which made Neneka and I nervous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm… Speaking of problems, did someone peek during your bath?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I almost spitted the stuff in my mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking to the side, I saw that Neneka was also holding her mouth with her hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I kept my cool and told my mother as I gathered up the dishes I had used and carried them into the kitchen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do that. Problems are… incidents that don&#8217;t happen often.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Onii-chan is not the kind of person who would commit such a crime.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know, right? In the first place, there&#8217;s no way that Daiki would have the guts to do that. Well, if you ever need anything in the future, you can always talk to me, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes! Of course!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To our parents, our faces would have looked the same as usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, my heart was drenched in sweat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because, in fact, we had already met in the bath on the first day of living together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s father listened to our conversation with a cheerful smile on his face. Then, after a few moments, he said to my mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I trust Daiki-kun, too. I can tell by looking at his intelligent and sincere eyes, similar to Sana-san&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother&#8217;s expression melted by Neneka&#8217;s father&#8217;s sweet words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh? Did I ever have eyes like that?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You do… Here, show me more of those beautiful eyes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are you sure? You want to look more&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My parents looked at each other again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What the hell were we being shown?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As if to escape from the lovey-dovey aura of our parents, Neneka also brought her dishes to the kitchen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Shall we go now so as not to disturb them?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka smiled wryly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seriously&#8230; it was our parents who were troublesome to make their children care so much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the food!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you for the food!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We said that much and retreated from the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I returned back to our own rooms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Around eight o&#8217;clock at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was in my room, stumbling around and looking at my phone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I checked the new arrivals of the manga app I had installed, looked at SNS at random, and started surfing the net from links that interested me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having studied during the day today, I was in the mood for a relaxing evening. Besides, maybe… Neneka would come to my room soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was no set date for Neneka to come to my room, nor did we make any promises. But yesterday, she went back to her room after folding the laundry. So, I had a feeling that today was the day Neneka would come, and I was very nervous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After spending some time looking at my phone, I heard the door of the room next to mine open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, the footsteps stopped in front of my room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a knock-knock sound, and Neneka&#8217;s small voice could be heard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, can I come in?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka gently opened the door and walked into my room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… I was shocked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because Neneka was wearing different clothes than she had for dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above-the-knee length dress in a floral pattern. With lace around the collar and ruffles on the sleeves and hem, she looked like a lady from a nice family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;This is the loungewear mother-in-law gave me… I&#8217;ve never… worn something this cute, but what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It looked gorgeous for a high school girl&#8217;s loungewear. I could imagine my mother, who was in a good mood in her first situation of picking and choosing girls&#8217; clothes, getting excited trying to choose the cutest one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I didn&#8217;t think of such a mother as a pain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Good job, mom…!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made a gut-punch pose in my heart and thanked my mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perfectly my kind of thing. Mother and son seemed to have the same taste in what they thought would look good on Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey… Daiki. Can I hug you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said, looking extremely cute in her new loungewear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The way she stood there staring at me was now that of an angel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly the pounding accelerated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with you all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Because when I saw our parents being lovey-dovey… I wanted to be lovey-dovey with you too…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! When you enter my room and suddenly say such a cute thing, I&#8217;m not prepared… for it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The new loungewear had caused the attractiveness level of Neneka to jump.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>High cuteness attack. If I carelessly touched it, it was likely that my soul would be taken to heaven.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Embarrassed to even look directly at her, I involuntarily turned away from Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Neneka didn&#8217;t back down. Not only did she not pull away, but she came on stronger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to be so hesitant, is there? We&#8217;ve been dating for two months now…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if it was the effect of our parents lovey-doveyness being shown to me but Neneka was more aggressive than ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could it be that parents&#8217; flirting was toxic to adolescents?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it a bad influence?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So… can you give me a hug…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was so overwhelmed by Neneka&#8217;s cuteness that I couldn&#8217;t do anything, and Neneka finally made a sultry face. Her slightly pouty lips were also cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Of course I will but&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You will?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could understand why Neneka might feel jittery, but Neneka really was just too cute to reach out to. It&#8217;s hard for me to prepare myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I would like to ask you a few questions about English sentences, if you don&#8217;t mind. I&#8217;m going to have to answer tomorrow, but I&#8217;m having trouble translating them into Japanese.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to do something else, to buy myself some time to get used to seeing Neneka this way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Neneka looked unconvinced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We can do that later.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then she said something outrageous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh… maybe it&#8217;s because of my clothes that you can&#8217;t hug me? Then I&#8217;ll take them off.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What…!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka removed a pair of shorts with the same pattern, which were hidden by the hem of her one-piece dress.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt a hint that she was really trying to take off her clothes, and I began to sweat with impatience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re gonna take it off?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk too loudly… okay? We&#8217;re… dating.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said in a whispery little voice. Then… she took off her dress at once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Don&#8217;t look!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurriedly covered my eyes with my hand and appealed to Neneka in a whisper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But! We&#8217;ve only been dating for two months! We&#8217;ve seen each other naked, but we haven&#8217;t even kissed yet…!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought is was too early for the two us to climb the stairs of adulthood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But yeah, that kind of timing came all of a sudden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;There&#8217;s a timing to everything, and there must be an appropriate time for the relationship between Neneka and I to progress. And when that time would come, I would have a revelation that &#8220;Now is the time! &#8221; Maybe&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt like… I thought about that before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a sudden development, and I couldn&#8217;t hide my confusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never expected that today would be the day for that timing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if today was the day, then I had to… become a man!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Hah!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly Neneka&#8217;s voice became bright and cheerful. Feeling something completely different from the atmosphere she had earlier, she removed the hand that was covering my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then… there was Neneka in a white bikini.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Swimsuit!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a gorgeous swimsuit with lily-like decorations, even though it was all white.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, it was probably the proportions of Neneka that made it look gorgeous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dazzling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was hundreds of times more dazzling than the loungewear she was wearing earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm. Surprised? Actually, I pretended I was here to show you my new loungewear, but I was here to show you my swimsuit! I bought this swimsuit at a bargain price at the end of last summer, and I had forgotten it existed for a long time, but when I was preparing to move out, I found it and remembered it. I was hoping to wear it at the pool this year with Daiki…&#8221;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka spun around with a smile that was so light and bouncy that it felt like summer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was really happy to have surprised me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was proudly showing off… her swimsuit to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I couldn&#8217;t even look at her…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She probably thought she had nothing to be embarrassed about because she was wearing a bathing suit, but I was puzzled by the amount of skin-colored area on Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Especially around the chest area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I bumped into her in the bath or touched her bra in the washroom, I thought… its presence was amazing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When a male friend at school said to me, &#8220;Torii-san looks so big,&#8221; I replied, with a personal note of &#8220;Don&#8217;t look at her like that, it&#8217;s just normal, right?&#8221; I had the same feeling, too, but when I actually saw it… it was quite a&#8230; volume.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t… look good on me?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I heard Neneka&#8217;s shushing voice and came back to myself with a huff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before long, the cheerful expression on Neneka’s face that I had seen earlier had disappeared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry! It suits you very well! I was so surprised that I couldn&#8217;t say anything! And&#8230; I think it&#8217;s important for students taking exams to take a break once in a while&#8230; So, let&#8217;s go to the pool together this year.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After a delay, I told Neneka how I felt about her swimsuit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka smiled reassuringly and said, &#8220;Ehehe… Thank goodness.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I thought it didn&#8217;t look good on me, and I thought you were having trouble reacting.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so! I just couldn&#8217;t keep up with the development of suddenly taking off your loungewear and putting on your swimsuit, so I was just a bit slow-witted… It’s very cute. Really, really cute.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then can you… give me a hug?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka spread her hands, her cheeks blushed with embarrassment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Come to think of it, this had been Neneka&#8217;s goal from the beginning!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While admiring Neneka for sticking to her original intentions, I wanted to reward her&#8230; No, it was more difficult than before.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I was a man… and I couldn&#8217;t back down twice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, but… if our parents see us like this, there&#8217;s no excuse, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it common for a sister to show her brother her bathing suit?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But, I don&#8217;t think any brother would hug his sister in a bathing suit…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right but&#8230; you’re going to be a naughty Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had to do it. I had to embrace Neneka in her swimsuit now…!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gently reached out to Neneka&#8217;s body and prepared to embrace her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure I would touch a lot of places, and a lot of places would be in close contact with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, no problem. Neneka and I were lovers. There was nothing wrong with that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Kon-Kon-Kon…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s body shooked and I pulled my hands away from Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki? Are you awake?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was my mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The expression on the faces of Neneka and I changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Unbelievable. Why at this time!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the way my parents looked after dinner, I assumed that the rest of the night was for the two of them to make love all night. So, I thought they would never visit my room…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the room, there was Neneka&#8217;s loungewear, which she had taken off, and Neneka in a bathing suit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Behind the door was my mother, who had zero delicacy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never knew when she would open the door. The tension made my face tense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki? Are you sleeping?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m not sleeping, but wait a minute!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I shouted as I felt like she was about to open the door to see if I was sleeping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are you awake? Then can I come in for a minute?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No! Wait! Don&#8217;t open the door for now, just tell me what you want!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a weird email on my phone. Can you take a look at it for me?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If she opened the door now, it was over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If Neneka in her swimsuit was seen in my room, there would be no way to get away with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I did restrain her at one point, but whether or not my mother would listen to me was another matter. The chances of having a conversation without opening the door was almost zero in my mother&#8217;s case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I had to hide Neneka!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I immediately picked up Neneka&#8217;s loungewear, which had fallen on the floor, and pushed it between the bed and the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then I got into bed, too, and signaled Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka immediately sensed my thoughts, climbed onto the bed and crawled under the covers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, can&#8217;t you take a quick look? I&#8217;m coming in.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had finished hiding Neneka under the futon, and my mother came into the room at about the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;In the end, she came into the room before I gave her permission…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was annoyed by her pace, as one could imagine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And my mother, who was going at her own pace, raised her eyebrows when she saw me sleeping under the futon in bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Why did you have to make me wait when you were lying around in bed?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;There was various circumstances!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lying on my side, Neneka in her swimsuit was gasping for breath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Huddled up and still, Neneka&#8217;s heat was caged in, and it was hot under the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother laughed and said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I could imagine that, it was your own son. Now that Neneka-chan is living in the same house as you, don&#8217;t you dare show your disgusting appearance, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could only imagine what kind of imaginations she had in mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to scream, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s not!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if she asked me what the circumstances were, I wouldn&#8217;t be able answer, so I had no choice but to leave it at that. It was frustrating and it pissed me off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Isn’t the futon more puffy than usual?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why did my mother, a living being, pinpointed and touched the parts that I didn&#8217;t want to be touched? What kind of sensor did she have?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I struggled to hide Neneka and I hugged her tightly under the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, I bought a cuddle pillow! It made it easier for me to sleep on the side!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? Well, I assume you won&#8217;t let me see what kind of picture is drawn on it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt like she thought it was a cuddle pillow of an animated character in a bathing suit or an underwear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But that too, didn&#8217;t matter now. As long as she didn&#8217;t know I was holding Neneka in her bathing suit under the futon, I didn&#8217;t care.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s skin, which was unintentionally hugged as a hugging pillow, was sweaty and moist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, maybe this sweat was mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s skin seemed to stick to my palm because of the sweat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was touching something I wasn&#8217;t supposed to touch like this, and now I couldn&#8217;t take my hands off of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, it was getting hotter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I mean, what did you say? A weird email?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My words became blunt with the single-minded desire to get this situation under control as soon as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right… from an email address I don&#8217;t remember…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Delete strange emails immediately. Never open links!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a link?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Where the numbers and alphabets are all lined up in rows and the colors change! Don&#8217;t press there!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It said something about a demand letter…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t remember it, do you? Then it&#8217;s a scam email.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Then I&#8217;ll delete it&#8230; Ah, should I set it to reject reception&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was operating her smartphone while saying &#8220;Uh-huh-huh.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took the opportunity to check on Neneka under the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She would be hot and stifling if covered up to the head under the futon. Neneka was huffing and puffing and breathing painfully, though she was holding her breath so that my mother wouldn&#8217;t hear her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her eyes were moist and she looked sexy, even though I knew that Neneka had no intention of doing so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trying not to be conscious of Neneka&#8217;s sexiness, I asked in a whisper, &#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay&#8230; I&#8217;ll do my best&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka whispered back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her sad expression. Her upturned cheeks.&nbsp; Her short breathing. Her sweaty body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With all this stimulation, could I keep my everlasting summer voltage from rising? No, I couldn&#8217;t. Even though it was still June, my mischievous worldly desires wanted to go outside in the heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But if I let it out, my summer would be in full swing…!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey! Why don&#8217;t you ask father-in-law about that?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s cold. Lately, I&#8217;ve been so attached to him, so I was wondering if Daiki was getting lonely, and thought I would come to see how you were doing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about me! So keep on flirting to your heart’s content!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that moment, Neneka clung to me tightly. She pressed her head against my stomach.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew she was saying it&#8217;s hot and she couldn&#8217;t wait to do something about it…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, near the belly where Neneka was gurgling, there was a place for party people, which made the hot summer even hotter…</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka! I know it&#8217;s hot and you wanted my mother to leave as soon as possible, but if you did that, even the serious reasoned person in me would go crazy!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I became an outcast to reason, no one would be able to stop me anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At a summer festival full of desires, I would follow my instincts and have a mid-summer party.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My body temperature rose even higher because of Neneka. And it got even hotter under the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;High temperature warning was being issued&#8230;!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Chill out, my cells. It&#8217;s not summer yet. Calm down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reduced number of rational people put on police uniforms and headed out to suppress the crispy instincts that were on the verge of rioting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a big fight. All kinds of emotions collided inside me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, my mother, who didn&#8217;t know that, spoke to me without hesitation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, are you sure you&#8217;re okay with Neneka-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You should never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, peek into her room. And you should do as little as possible, even touching her laundry. Neneka-chan might not say anything herself, but that&#8217;s good manners. Then, there’s the habit you had of going to the bathroom completely naked, Daiki. I don&#8217;t think you did it anymore, but don&#8217;t ever do it, okay? It would be a big problem if you met each other in such a state.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah… yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I nodded honestly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was okay. I was prepared to take the fact that I had already done it to the grave.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You should also be careful about talking to yourself, just because you are alone in your room. There’s a possibility that Neneka-chan would accidentally hear you if you said in a loud voice, &#8220;I want to hug Neneka in a bathing suit.&#8221; Even if you didn&#8217;t say it directly, they were things that made one uncomfortable. Don&#8217;t say strange things thoughtlessly.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So-Soudesune&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother did damage to me as accurately as possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was she aware of everything we did?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t stop sweating. It was hot under the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay if you&#8217;re a grouch, but be a gentleman, at least on the surface. It&#8217;s polite to be gentlemanly. Understand?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, all right! Go back to father-in-law! I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll miss you if you leave him alone too much. He seems to love you a lot.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I said desperately, and my mother finally headed for the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry to have bothered you while you were busy.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother opened the door and tried to leave the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As she was leaving, she suddenly turned to me and smiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Thank you. For accepting my re-marriage.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Oh!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if she came to my room wanting to say that one thing from the beginning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that, and I was a little embarrassed as I watched my mother close the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I heard my mother&#8217;s footsteps going down the stairs. The footsteps became smaller and smaller, and I felt her walking towards the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;It&#8217;s all right now!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as thought that, I removed the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The air from the futon was muffled and hot, and the sweet smell of Neneka was fragrant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka! Are you alright!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was huffing, puffing and breathing roughly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It must have been very hot… her long hair had become damp, and her disheveled hair was stuck to her shoulders and chest. Sweat was running down her cleavage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I thought, I would lose my…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a glamorous expression, Neneka let out a sigh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was shown such a Neneka, my battery turned upwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… I involuntarily sat up on the bed and bent forward.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My fireworks were ready to be ignited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All the bothersome people who gathered at the party site earlier were waiting impatiently for the fireworks to go off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! I wouldn&#8217;t let them do that!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mobilizing all of my reason, I suppressed the vexation of trying to ignite the fireworks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, there were not enough suppressors. I was outnumbered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As long as it was summer, their summer mood would never end. There was no choice but to end summer!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m sorry… Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? It&#8217;s my fault that this situation happened, so you don&#8217;t have to apologize to me, Daiki…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t mean that… end the summer…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Umm, I&#8217;m kind of confused about what you&#8217;re saying?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m getting all kinds of stimulation and I think it&#8217;s time you get dressed…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was momentarily stunned. But she quickly huffed and held her mouth with her hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Could it be, your son&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry! I&#8217;m so inconsiderate…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka got off the bed in a hurry. Then, she picked up her loungewear, which had fallen on the floor when I peeled off the futon, and put it on over her swimsuit with her back to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who was in the middle of changing her clothes, asked me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is everything alright with your son, Daiki…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t understand what Neneka was saying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was my son?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, what’s my son?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Umm&#8230; that&#8217;s because Daiki said, foolish son in the bath before&#8230; right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said in a shy little voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was when I finally connected foolish son and son in my brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! She didn&#8217;t seem to understand what I was saying in the bathroom, but now she could understand it! Besides, it was Neneka&#8217;s sense of speech to call my &#8220;foolish son&#8221; my &#8220;son!&#8221; What was I making the innocent and pure-hearted Neneka say! Well, it was my fault for trying to have a conversation with her in such a way!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was embarrassed and felt dizzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… I didn&#8217;t care anymore. I had no choice but to tell her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry… My son is in the mood for an early summer, and it got carried away again…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No! After all, when it&#8217;s hot… there are times when you just want to get away with it, right? I understand how you feel.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you for your understanding…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;… Wait, what was I trying to get her to understand!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was this desire-driven summer festival?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was the mid-summer festival?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was my fireworks?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was pretty sure it was my head that was the craziest because of the heat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seriously&#8230; I wondered if it was okay for me to have such a messed up world unfold in my brain every time I saw Neneka&#8217;s sexy appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a thought process that was so damn embarrassing that I couldn&#8217;t tell anyone about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And at the end of the day, even Neneka was involved in that worldview… Yeah, if there was a tomb, I would want to go in it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was that beaten down, but Neneka seemed to be a bit excited about something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Somehow, Neneka’s face was saying, &#8220;This time I understood exactly what Daiki was saying! Whoa!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, I&#8217;m it was just my imagination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure she had that look on her face because she had a sense of accomplishment that we got through this predicament without my mother finding out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m soaked in sweat, I think it&#8217;s time for me to go back to my room.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said, while wiping the sweat from her forehead with a refreshing smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, okay. Be careful not to catch a cold.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You too, Daiki… get some rest.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah… yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka returned to her room, soaked in sweat, and I was left alone in my room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, we were able to keep my mother from finding out that we were spending lover&#8217;s time in secret. However, it was still too early to pat my chest and say, &#8220;That&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Now… what should I do with this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My foolish son was ready for a fantastic night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, the festival was interrupted. There was no point in letting it get any hotter alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I was quietly cleaning up after the festival on my own, the night drew to a close.</p>dic
