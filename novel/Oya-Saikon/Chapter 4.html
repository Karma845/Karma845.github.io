<h3>Chapter 4</h3>

<p>While brushing my teeth in the bathroom, I looked at myself in the mirror. Somehow, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel that my face had become thinner. I was sure it was due to the frustration of trying to spend lover&#8217;s time without my parents noticing, and usually getting interrupted at the right moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that case, there was a way to prevent frustration from accumulating by avoiding that kind of atmosphere with Neneka, but it didn&#8217;t work well either. This was because Neneka had a tendency to want to be spoiled and unconsciously tempted me like a small devil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not that it was Neneka&#8217;s fault, since she didn&#8217;t mean to, but I was the victim of the pheromones that were unconsciously dripping out of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I guess it was the sad nature of adolescent boys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a snake was kept alive and killed over and over again, its mental faculties would be worn out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt like I wanted to go all out and approach her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But we hadn&#8217;t even kissed yet, and I didn&#8217;t know if Neneka was ready to cross the line with me. I didn&#8217;t want to go overboard and make a move on Neneka, only to have her pull away from me. If that were to happen, it would cast dark clouds over our cohabitation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As long as we lived as brother and sister-in-law we would have to see each other everyday. No matter how awkward it would be, we would have to act like we were close siblings so that our parents didn&#8217;t find out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;First of all, it was impossible to cross the line with Neneka at a time when our parents were home… And from the way she reacted when my foolish son change of state occurred, I didn&#8217;t think Neneka was ready for that kind of thing…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I became like that, Neneka always apologized to me and immediately went back to her room. I felt her gentle concern that she had to leave me alone, but I didn&#8217;t get the impression that she was looking for any further development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words, I would have to continue to fight against my worldly desires like a monk in training for a while.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After brushing my teeth, I washed my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was bracing myself in the cold water, something soft covered my body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt two particularly soft lumps around my… waist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Mmm-hmm.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka smiled happily as she remained attached to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come to think of it, I left the bathroom door open to brush my teeth. That meant that anyone passing by the hallway would be able to see Neneka clinging up to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka… it&#8217;s not a good idea to do that when the door is open&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I whispered to Neneka, but she kept her breasts pressed against me, swaying and playing with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just here to recharge my batteries.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Charging…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of Neneka&#8217;s embrace that covered me, I was left in a bent-over position, bending my waist. My face was still soaked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be found out.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave as soon as someone comes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a rule to act like brother and sister in places where our parents were likely to find out, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. That&#8217;s why Neneka just came to hug Onii-chan!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, that&#8217;s not the kind of thing she was allowed to do just because I was her Onii-chan…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Siblings were brother and sister, but we were brother and sister-in-law. Moreover, regardless of the age difference, we were both a male and a female. The physical contact known as hugging was not an objectively permissible thing to do in this kind of relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although we were supposed to be careful not to reveal our relationship, Neneka was becoming bolder and bolder by the day. At first I thought she had gotten used to it and thought she was getting confident that she wouldn&#8217;t be found out if she did things properly. But, that wasn&#8217;t Neneka&#8217;s true intention.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But the thought of what we would do if we are found out makes my heart pound…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My sweet little girlfriend smiled mischievously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, Neneka… got addicted to the thrill of trying to make out as much as possible without being discovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unfortunately, she was a believer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s my dad&#8217;s footsteps.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saying that, Neneka suddenly left me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, when you are ready to go to school, wait for me at the door!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka left the washroom and walked up the stairs. Then, from the hallway on the opposite side of the hallway from where Neneka left, came Neneka&#8217;s father.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, Daiki-kun, good morning.<a>&#8220;</a></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good morning.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though it hadn&#8217;t even been a month since she started living in this house, Neneka seemed to be starting to grasp where the family&#8217;s footsteps and noises came from.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I went to school, attended classes while fighting sleepiness, and came back home. I went through the usual routine, and then it was night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while I was in my room studying, Neneka brought a basket full of laundry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Here, this is for you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you. But, I told you that you could leave it in the washroom because it was too hard to carry it upstairs every time.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not that heavy, so I just brought it when I was carrying mine. There might be my dad&#8217;s things in there by mistake, so check it out as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I put the basket I received in my room. Neneka&#8217;s folded laundry was always clean. The edges were evenly aligned, and no matter how hard I tried to fold them neatly, I didn&#8217;t think I could fold them like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was told to check the basket&#8230; as there might be some of Neneka&#8217;s father&#8217;s things mixed in. I remembered that Neneka&#8217;s father&#8217;s underwear was mixed in my basket before, and I had a hard time finding the missing underwear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of those things were interesting to me though, because I thought that there were a lot of things that happened when one had a lot of family members…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I pulled the end of the clothes that felt weird, Neneka&#8217;s camisole came out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, was this really the one that got mixed up by accident?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I rushed to the room next door with Neneka&#8217;s camisole and knocked on the door. Then, Neneka didn&#8217;t open the door herself, but just replied, &#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I reluctantly opened the door and glanced into Neneka&#8217;s room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s room was pale and pretty, with white and pink as its base color. A neatly organized bookshelf. Cute animal mascots placed here and there. Her room was exactly how I imagined it to be.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a bleak storage room before it became Neneka&#8217;s room, but there was no sign of it anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Above all, this faintly sweet, nice smell. How could such a good smell be produced?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was preparing her school bag, or perhaps replacing the textbooks and notebooks in her bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;The… laundry, I brought it because Neneka&#8217;s was mixed in…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Can you leave it on the dresser, Onii-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka smiled and said. I guessed from the expression on her face that it was still intentional.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; it&#8217;s a rule not to enter Neneka&#8217;s room at night.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I whispered, Neneka put her index finger on her chin and said, &#8220;Hmm,&#8221; and was troubled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But, it&#8217;s inevitable for Onii-chan, who came to deliver my laundry, would have to go into my room, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Certainly&#8230; it might be unavoidable&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Frankly, it wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t want to go in. I was happy to be able to talk with Neneka even for such a short time, and it wasn&#8217;t that I wasn&#8217;t interested in Neneka&#8217;s room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Even though we had gone to great lengths to make those rules&#8230; But well, sometimes it was important to be flexible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Eventually I succumbed to Neneka&#8217;s temptation and stepped into her room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was my sister&#8217;s room. I was the older brother who came to deliver the laundry to my sister&#8217;s room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I told myself that, but no matter how I looked at it, this was the room of the girl I liked&#8230; and I felt a little uneasy around my chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to be as normal as possible and put the laundry on the dresser.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is this the right place?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Thank you. Good night, Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, good night.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought she had decided not to come to my room today. She had been coming to my room for the past few days in a row, so I guess it was time to make a day of not coming, as per the rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Maybe she did this prank because she had decided not to come to my room today, but she still wanted to see me just for a little bit…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was a real tease. Did she really want to be with me that badly?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This involuntarily made my face grin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was happy with the result because our parents didn&#8217;t get suspicious this time, even though we had already decided on the rules.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was beginning to feel like I was being carried along at Neneka&#8217;s pace these days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the middle of July and exactly one month had passed since our family had started living together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One morning as summer vacation was approaching. I was walking with Neneka to the station nearest our house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We both walked out the front door and then walked together to the nearest station. Once at the station, we separated and took separate train cars to the station closest to school. Then, by chance, we met up on the way to school. We had become accustomed to such a rule-based flow of going to school. It was a little troublesome, but thanks to this ingenuity, our school friends had not yet found out that we lived in the same house or that we were dating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we walked together under the hot sun, I gave Neneka a hard time about what happened at the dinner table this morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Neneka… aren&#8217;t you being a little too bold lately?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you put mayonnaise on my egg rolls, but don&#8217;t write &#8220;dai-suki&#8221; or anything like that… What if our parents saw it…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;My dad was busy getting ready to go to work, and mother-in-law was off work, so she was very busy with housework in the morning, so she wouldn&#8217;t look at me. If she did see me, I would’ve told her that I was into playing maid café with my friends and I was practicing, so it would’ve been fine.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Playing maid café…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I could&#8217;ve come up with a number of excuses to make it less suspicious, so leave it to me!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka confidently puffed out her chest, her Y-shirt looked a bit tight around her chest area.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;As long as they don&#8217;t find out, it&#8217;s fine. Right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But, it makes us feel nervous&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the fun part, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s smile was innocent. She seemed to be enjoying this thrill with all her heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I was in trouble too, because I was starting to feel that it might indeed be a little fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But we can&#8217;t keep it a secret that we&#8217;re dating forever. Even Neneka doesn&#8217;t want to keep it a secret forever, does she?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s right. Someday, we&#8217;ll have to talk to them properly and get their approval.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;When is that? When we&#8217;re college students?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah… Maybe after we leave home, after becoming college students?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered how our parents would react if we told them about our relationship one day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would they support us?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would they be surprised?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;By then though, there&#8217;s a chance they might inadvertently find out.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said jokingly. That&#8217;s why I said this jokingly too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I agree. If Neneka keeps doing things that are so far above the rules, we might get caught before we become college students.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh. Is it my fault if we’re found out?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m always careful not to get caught.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to stay on the edge, being careful not to get caught.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our family of four was doing so well together that even if we were to be found out, we could manage. We must have had that kind of carelessness in our hearts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But our thoughts were naïve.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was returning home alone that day.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since my mother was home today, I decided to stagger my return time with Neneka. The reason for this was so that my mother wouldn&#8217;t think that I always came back home with Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was the first to arrive home. As soon as I did, my mother greeted me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Daiki. Yuzuru-chan came to visit.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Yuzuru-neechan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing the name of an unexpected person, I quickly headed to the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, there was a familiar person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan! Long time no see!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sitting on the sofa in the living room was my second cousin. She must be a college student by now. Yuzuru-neechan was wearing an adult-like outfit with exposed shoulders.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remembered playing with her a lot when I was little… I was surprised to see that she had become an adult woman after not seeing her for a while.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki, you&#8217;ve grown taller&#8230;! What&#8217;s more, you&#8217;ve become a nice man.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t think so&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan smiled, showing her teeth. Her smile was the same as it used to be, but it made me strangely nervous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-chan, brought a gift for your mother’s re-marriage. I’m going to have Yuzuru-chan stay overnight, so we can all party together at night.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was surprised to hear my mother&#8217;s words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Yuzuru-neechan, are you staying over today?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Of course! I had been wanting to come visit ever since I heard that Daiki&#8217;s mother remarried. I had to hear about how Daiki&#8217;s mother got remarried and all that, and I also had to say hello to Daiki&#8217;s sister-in-law!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan looked like she was having fun.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I had a bad feeling about it. I had a feeling that if Yuzuru-neechan stayed at our house, something nasty would happen…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, where&#8217;s your sister-in-law?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as Yuzuru-neechan said this, there was the sound of the front door opening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, it looks like she&#8217;s back now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother went out of the living room and called out to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Neneka-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka came to the living room, accompanied by my mother. Then, she rolled her eyes at the sight of Yuzuru-neechan. She must have been surprised to see someone other than her family.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… hello.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka greeted Yuzuru-neechan, who she was meeting for the first time, a little nervously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh! So, this is your sister-in-law!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan got off the couch, approached Neneka, and squeezed her hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;My name is Yuzuru. My mother and Daiki’s father are cousins, so I&#8217;m his second cousin. I used to live in this neighborhood when I was little and we used to play together. I moved away before I entered high school, so I haven&#8217;t seen Daiki for a while. So, I wanted to see him as soon as possible!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan laughed heartily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that she had become more mature, but I felt that her power had increased.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan, my older cousin with a manly personality, immediately flew in to help me out when I was being bullied by the neighborhood&#8217;s older children. I remembered her being called &#8220;Ojou-sama&#8221; because she had them become her subordinates.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-chan brought me a gift for my re-marriage. I&#8217;ll have her stay over today, so please take care of her too, Neneka-chan&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When my mother told Neneka, she nodded her head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see! Thank you! My name is Neneka. Pleased to meet you!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm You&#8217;re in the same grade as Daiki, aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan looked at me and grinned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you suddenly have such a cute sister, you&#8217;ll fall in love with her, won&#8217;t you? Hmm? Maybe you&#8217;re already in love with her? Or are you going out with her?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s statement, a bewildered &#8220;Huh?&#8221; came out from me and Neneka’s mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We had been dating since before our parents got remarried, and we had been living together for a month without telling our parents. Perhaps, if I said, &#8220;Actually, we are…&#8221; I wondered if my mother would accept it naturally.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I glanced at Neneka&#8217;s face. Neneka also glanced at my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka shooked her head short and small.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s right…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was risky to come out in the presence of non-family members when I didn&#8217;t know how my mother would react.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While looking at Neneka, I shooked my head short and small too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong? You are staring at each other&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was making eye contact with Neneka, Yuzuru-neechan appeared in my field of vision.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was inwardly cringing, but tried not to let it show on my face as I replied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I was thinking, &#8220;Oh… I&#8217;ve only ever seen her as my sister-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I also only saw him as my brother-in-law, so I thought there was no way we were going out or anything like that…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka also told Yuzuru-neechan clearly with a calm, smiling face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, when Yuzuru-neechan heard our response, she said, &#8220;Oh, really?&#8221; I didn&#8217;t know if she was convinced or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan had always been a sharp person. And once something caught her attention, she wouldn&#8217;t be satisfied unless she pursued it to the end. So, when… Neneka&#8217;s father came home and we were all having dinner together, Yuzuru-neechan was still suspicious of my relationship with Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;But&#8230; it&#8217;s kind of suspicious that a man and woman of that age living together under the same roof didn&#8217;t develop romantic feelings&#8230; Anyway, if you say you aren&#8217;t physiologically compatible that&#8217;s a different story, but you seem to get along normally?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan… enough with this bullshit, okay? The fact is, we&#8217;re not dating.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was supposed to be here to celebrate my my mother’s re-marriage, but all Yuzuru-neechan talked about was us, siblings-in-law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My parents, who had been drinking, seemed to have already entered their own world, and they were drinking together without us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that too much, you&#8217;ll trouble Neneka. She doesn&#8217;t know how Yuzuru-neechan is, so she must be confused.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just curious. Don&#8217;t you make out in the bathtub or hide in bed?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan said in a whisper. I guess she was whispering so that our parents wouldn&#8217;t hear her, but at this distance it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if they heard her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I answered without hesitation to Yuzuru-neechan, who was grinning and waiting for my answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not true. We just get along with each other as normal siblings. Nothing more, nothing less.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, Yuzuru-neechan was still not backing down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But, maybe you&#8217;ll become lovers in the future? Does aunt allow that kind of thing?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, Yuzuru-neechan turned the conversation towards my mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was laughing with Neneka&#8217;s father while talking about something, but when Yuzuru-neechan asked her, she immediately responded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not opposed to… dating, but living together might be a bit of a bad idea.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes… they are both still minors, especially when they are in school, and there should be no mistakes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She seemed to be in her own world but she was listening closely to our conversation. My mother wasn&#8217;t to be underestimated for this kind of thing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inwardly nervous, I asked my mother in a light tone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you say living together is a bad idea… Then, if we end up dating, would we live separately?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I don&#8217;t know. But well, you&#8217;re both students taking entrance exams this year, so you don&#8217;t have time to fall in love, right? If Daiki goes to college, he&#8217;ll probably live alone anyway, so I think that kind of worry is pointless. Right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I have the time for a relationship or anything like that, right now. I have exams coming up… so honestly, I don&#8217;t have time for romance or anything like that, right now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said, riding on my mother&#8217;s statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, seeing Neneka, Yuzuru-neechan smiled at her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, can I become Daiki&#8217;s girlfriend?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s face tensed up slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, Yuzuru-chan, you&#8217;ve always said you wanted to become Daiki&#8217;s wife&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother, said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! But, I can&#8217;t be his wife yet, so I&#8217;m going to start by being his girlfriend.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan, said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka froze as she listened to the conversation between my mother and Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurriedly interrupted the conversation between my my mother and Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That was when we were kids, right? Yuzuru-neechan is already in college, and Yuzuru-neechan is probably already dating someone, isn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I used to say that I wanted to be Daiki’s wife when I was a child, but today when I met you for the first time in a while, I thought that it would be nice. You’re totally my type now, Daiki. Right now, I’m not dating anyone, so don&#8217;t worry!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s eyes were straight and… I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off of her as she smiled saying that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t find the words I wanted to say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I liked someone. I had someone I was dating. Our parents remarried and we were now brother and sister-in-law, she was someone who was more important to me than anyone else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to say that, but I couldn&#8217;t say it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to make it known. But, I didn&#8217;t know what would happen if it was known.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what the right thing to say was in this situation…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no chance of you becoming lovers, is there? If that&#8217;s the case, then Neneka-chan will support my love, won&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan smiled at Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka had no choice but to say yes. I was sure that Yuzuru-neechan knew this and was waiting for Neneka to respond.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was worried about what Neneka would think.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was the most important thing to me, but I couldn&#8217;t tell her that. Neneka was also unable to express her true feelings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t know how serious Yuzuru-neechan was, but if this story continued at Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s pace, the relationship between Neneka and I would deteriorate…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Umm… yes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who had been thinking for a while, looked at Yuzuru-neechan and smiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I will support you. However, only if Yuzuru-san is really a woman who is suitable for being Onii-chan&#8217;s wife… If not, as his sister, I will not approve of your relationship.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;What&#8217;s that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While supporting the love between Yuzuru-neechan and I&#8230; Neneka didn&#8217;t take a step back. Rather, she was standing in front of Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka appeared to be smiling peacefully, but no matter how one looked at it, her eyes were not smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Yuzuru-neechan, who was smiling at Neneka, was not smiling either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see. Then, I&#8217;ll have to work hard to get Daiki’s sister&#8217;s approval.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I want Onii-chan to be happy, so know that my judging will be tough, but please do your best.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though the two of them were facing each other with smiles, it looked like sparks were flying in the middle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;What should I do…? Was this okay…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If our parents found out that we were lovers, we might end up living separately, so we couldn&#8217;t break our sibling stance. And tonight, Yuzuru-neechan would be staying at our house… I didn&#8217;t think Yuzuru-neechan, who was staying at our house, would sleep quietly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I had a feeling that there would be a storm in our house tonight&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe this was the bad feeling I had earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gulped when I saw Neneka and Yuzuru-neechan glaring at each other over me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After dinner was over, I quickly brushed my teeth in the washroom and returned to my room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan had a hunch that there was something going on between Neneka and I. I was afraid that if I stayed in front of Yuzuru-neechan any longer, I would get ripped off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka probably wouldn&#8217;t come to my room tonight either. She must have noticed Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s sharpness too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka, I hoped she was OK…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was puzzled because Yuzuru-neechan said something weird like, &#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of becoming Daiki’s girlfriend…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to say that my girlfriend was Neneka. But, I couldn&#8217;t say that because I knew that I might not be able to live with her if our relationship was discovered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, should I have said it? For the sake of Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka might be angry. I couldn&#8217;t tell Yuzuru-neechan about us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I would like&#8230; to at least say a few words to her, &#8220;I like you, Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made up my mind and left my room. After confirming that there was no sign of anyone in the hallway on the second floor, I knocked on the door of Neneka&#8217;s room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… No reply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I called out to her in a whisper, but she didn’t answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was she in her room doing something else and not noticing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was she aware of it, but was ignoring it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was she sleeping?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was she not in her room?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had no idea what was going on in her room, but I couldn’t open the door without permission. I had no choice but to go downstairs. If she was nowhere to be found on the first floor, Neneka would be in her room on the second floor. It was a roundabout way, but it was the best way to find out where Neneka was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gently opened the living room door to find my parents sitting side by side on the couch watching TV. There was no sign of Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, the washroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I started walking towards the washroom, my vision suddenly went dark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was whispered in my ear. A hand, softer and smaller than mine, seemed to be blocking my eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Yuzuru-neechan, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Correct.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My vision brightened and I was hugged tightly from behind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;How did you know so quickly? It could have been your sister.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If I listen to the voice, I&#8217;ll know, it&#8217;s normal.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? I thought I was imitating your sister just now!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t even sound like her. You sounded just like Yuzuru-neechan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really? I&#8217;m so glad you know me so well.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan hugged me tightly. The soft parts of her body were pressed against me and I twisted my body to escape from Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan, get away from me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Why not? Isn&#8217;t it nice? Oh, maybe you&#8217;re just conscious of me and it makes you feel weird?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m not!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I don’t mind. I want to be Daiki’s girlfriend.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan whispered in my ear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was surprised by the exhalation. My face heated up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Wait, wait, wait! I had someone named Neneka!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to pull her away from me in a panic, but she was insistent and wouldn&#8217;t let go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other person was a woman, and I couldn&#8217;t just roughly pull her apart. While I was wondering how much force to use, Yuzuru-neechan touched my body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;? Daiki, you have a nice body. Do you do sports or something?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don’t, but I&#8217;ve been doing physical labor at my… part-time job, so maybe I have some muscle.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I like you more and more! Let&#8217;s sleep together tonight.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make fun of me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not kidding. I&#8217;m serious? So, you can sleep with me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? I can&#8217;t sleep with you! I told you my mom set up a futon in the other room!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? It&#8217;s lonely being alone.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey! Don&#8217;t put your hands in my clothes, it tickles!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wow! You have abs! Let me touch them!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Seriously, stop tickling me! Pff-ha-ha-ha!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan put her hand inside my T-shirt and touched my stomach. I couldn&#8217;t hold back my laughter as she rustled and stroked me with her small hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;You look like you&#8217;re having a lot of fun… Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I suddenly heard a voice, and my body jerked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sweating with impatience, even though I wasn&#8217;t supposed to have done anything wrong…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka appeared from the washroom, arms folded, staring at me and Yuzuru-neechan. She had no expression on her face, and it was obvious that she was angry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I was wondering what I should say in my defense, Neneka walked up to me, grabbed my arm… and pulled me towards her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Was she pissed off? Maybe I would get punched in the face?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, it was also my role to take Neneka&#8217;s uncontrollable anger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I closed my eyes tightly and prepared myself, but even after a while, Neneka didn&#8217;t slap me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gently opened my eyes and looked at Neneka, and she was staring at me with her squeaky eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I thought she was angry, what did this mean? She was just cute&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan&#8230; there&#8217;s a strange sound, so can you stay with me?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t get my head around the sudden change in Neneka&#8217;s attitude. I thought she was going to be absolutely furious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The anger that had been floating around her earlier was clearly gone, and what floated in the air was a fleeting anxiety. She gazed at me with puppy eyes, and spoiled me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;When I was in the washroom earlier, I heard a strange sound… Neneka is too scared to be alone…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her deadly sister voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The big brother component in me screamed out, &#8220;Ooooh Neneka, your big brother will protect you!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, well… then, I&#8217;ll stay with you until you calm down. &#8220;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you! Onii-chan!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I tried to go to Neneka, the opposite arm that Neneka had pulled was pulled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Strange sound? Isn&#8217;t it the sound of the wind? It was windy earlier.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one who pulled me was Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you are spoiled by your brother just because the wind is a little strong, it&#8217;ll be a nuisance to him, okay? Your brother is going to sleep with me from now on, so you should sleep in your own room.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good! Today, I&#8217;ll have Onii-chan stay with me all night!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Yuzuru-neechan pulled, Neneka pulled next.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Why? You can&#8217;t hear the wind anymore, can you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;My friend showed me a scary video at school, so I don&#8217;t think I can be alone tonight!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After clearly telling Yuzuru-neechan the reason, Neneka looked at me again and her eyes got all watery.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan… you won’t abandon Neneka, right…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Quick answer. No room for hesitation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For some reason, when Neneka acted like a little sister, I reflexively went into big brother mode. That was how much sisterly power Neneka had.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey…? Little sister, aren&#8217;t you being bold?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was about to be taken away, Yuzuru-neechan showed a drawn smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve only been living together for a month. Isn&#8217;t it too soon for him to be a brother?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;When I have such a wonderful Onii-chan, it doesn&#8217;t matter how long we&#8217;ve been together, I can&#8217;t help but be a brat, can I?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without letting go of my arm, Yuzuru-neechan and Neneka stared at each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan who wanted to be my girlfriend VS Neneka who was my girlfriend but couldn&#8217;t say she was my girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who was unable to speak out her true feelings for me due to her position seemed to have decided to monopolize me as her brother&#8217;s favorite sister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;How could I get out of this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both of them seemed to feel compelled to monopolize me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for me, I would like to sleep alone…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve come to visit you, so hang out with me! Daiki!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your little sister&#8217;s emergency, okay? You&#8217;ll help me, right? Onii-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to choose the path of spacing them out and having them both give up, but neither of them would back down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They were so intent on pulling me towards them that they didn&#8217;t seem to care that my arms were wedged in their respective cleavages.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Oh God, I don&#8217;t care who it is, just do something about this situation…!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was thinking that… I didn’t care if it was an angel or devil, something moving appeared on the wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Black pest. But, I don&#8217;t think it was the messiah, was it? The initial &#8220;G&#8221; moved along the wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I stared blankly at that figure, both Neneka and Yuzuru-neechan also noticed its existence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Unbelievable! Cockroaches!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan shouted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka screamed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Kyaa, cockroaches!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka clung to my arm, half-crying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Calm down, Neneka. I&#8217;ll bring the bug spray!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An opportunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fight between the two of them was temporarily interrupted by the cockroaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to go get some insecticide spray, but Neneka grabbed my arm and wouldn&#8217;t let go.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No! No! Don&#8217;t go! I don&#8217;t like cockroaches, I don&#8217;t like cockroaches…!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Neneka, you’ll be fine!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was really shaking. It seemed that she wasn&#8217;t acting like she was afraid of cockroaches.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making too much fuss over a few cockroaches! I&#8217;ll go to my aunt and borrow some bug spray! I&#8217;ll kill them myself.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s dismay must have made Yuzuru-neechan worried&#8230; She volunteered to get rid of the cockroaches herself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan… Will you be okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Of course I’ll be fine. Who do you think I am?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was a dependable, masculine, and reliable older cousin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, her big sister switch had been turned on for Neneka’s sake.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Since long ago, Yuzuru-neechan had always been kind…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan ran into the living room. And soon after, I heard the sound of flapping in the living room. She seemed to be looking for insecticide spray.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka&#8230; let&#8217;s leave this to Yuzuru-neechan and go upstairs for now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I walked up the stairs with the trembling Neneka. When we reached the second floor corridor, Neneka suddenly grabbed my arm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki, over here!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, Neneka&#8217;s movements became snappier and better, and I was pulled along with her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moving with the same momentum, we entered my room, which was familiar to her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hah&#8230; we finally got to be alone&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka sighed in my room. Her appearance was completely different from the Neneka who was frightened of cockroaches earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Huh? There’s no way…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh… maybe Neneka isn&#8217;t so scared of cockroaches…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah. The apartment where I lived with my dad was old, so I had my fair share of encounters with cockroaches… I spent a lot of time alone at home, so I&#8217;m used to taking care of them.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said so with a dejected face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, what you did earlier was an act?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Yuzuru-san had a solid atmosphere, so I thought she would protect me in case of an emergency. The moment I saw the cockroaches, this plan came to me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was surprised. It seemed that Neneka, with her sisterly power, not only put me in brother mode, but also brought out the sister mode in Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;More importantly, I have something I want to say to Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka stared at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I braced myself, thinking that this time I would be blamed for being touchy-touchy with Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear that… Daiki had promised to marry such a beautiful cousin.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka puffed out her cheeks and stared at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t have time to think about how cute… Neneka with her cheeks puffed out was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was when I was a child, and it was something Yuzuru-neechan said one-sidedly. Besides, Yuzuru-neechan and I haven&#8217;t seen each other since I entered junior high school, so I was surprised that Yuzuru-neechan hadn&#8217;t forgotten about it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; is that so&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right! I really, really like Neneka&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew this wasn&#8217;t the time to be shy, so I told her clearly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had told her many times already, but I was a little embarrassed. But, if that made Neneka feel at ease, I wouldn&#8217;t hesitate to say it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as I thought, when I said I liked her, Neneka&#8217;s expression softened a little.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, just a little.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But I think Yuzuru-san really likes Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know it because&#8230; I also love Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Does Yuzuru-neechan really like me?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t get my thoughts together and I didn&#8217;t know how to reply back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka said to me, who was frozen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If Yuzuru-san really likes you, what do you want to do?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wh-What do you mean&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you have been close for so long, I think there must have been a time when Daiki liked Yuzuru-san, too. If you are second cousins, marriage isn&#8217;t a problem, and if you have feelings for Yuzuru-san, you can choose to break up with… me and go out with Yuzuru-san, can&#8217;t you? I would like to know&#8230; how Daiki honestly feels.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka stared straight at me. She had eyes that didn&#8217;t miss even the fluctuations of my emotions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just when I was determined to say it properly, I heard the sound of someone&#8217;s footsteps coming up the stairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka also noticed the sound of the footsteps and her complexion changed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s Yuzuru-neechan!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With this, our time alone together was over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure Yuzuru-neechan, who had finished exterminating the cockroaches, would come to separate us. And Neneka, who didn&#8217;t want to do that, would start fighting again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a brief respite. As I was thinking this, Neneka turned her face towards mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki. Is there a place to hide?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? A place to hide?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We conversed quietly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Neneka asked me where she could hide, I reflexively recalled the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a space on the lower level of the closet&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before Neneka and her father moved in, my mother and I did a lot of house cleaning. At that time, I also got rid of all of my unneeded items, and there was enough space in the closet for one person to hide.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as she heard the information, Neneka opened the sliding door of the closet and checked the inside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, she grabbed my hand&#8230; and pushed me into the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Go in.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The door was closed with a snap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was pitch black inside the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the small space inside the closet, I was sitting on my buttocks and on top of me was Neneka. She was straddling my abdomen and covered me closely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She seemed to be doing her best not to crush me, but my face was pressed against Neneka&#8217;s chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Daiki? I took care of the cockroaches. May I come in?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s voice came from the other side of the door, followed by a knocking sound.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, why do we need to hide?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was frightened by cockroaches and upset. If so, there shouldn&#8217;t be any problem if she saw us together in my room now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, why did we need to hide together in such a small place?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was dark and it was hard to see Neneka&#8217;s expression. But, Neneka said clearly in a small voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Be quiet.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka clung tightly to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s plump breasts were pressed against my face, and I had no choice but to close my mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Daiki? Aren&#8217;t you in your room?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sound of the door opening. Then, a sign of Yuzuru-neechan entering the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;? No one here? I thought they were here, but where did they go&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could see that Yuzuru-neechan was right in front of the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I both held our breaths and hid ourselves.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From Neneka&#8217;s chest, which was pressed against my face, I could hear her fast heartbeat, as fast as my heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Yuzuru-chan? Is Neneka-chan okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I heard after Yuzuru-neechan was my mother&#8217;s voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I held our breaths and looked at the situation beyond the closet&#8217;s door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, auntie. That&#8217;s the thing, I can&#8217;t find either Daiki or his sister. I thought they were in Daiki&#8217;s room…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh? Are they in Neneka-chan&#8217;s room then?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Listening carefully in the closet, I heard what sounded like my mother knocking on the door of Neneka&#8217;s room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka-chan? Have you already fallen asleep?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are they not in his sister&#8217;s room, too?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Doesn&#8217;t look like anyone&#8217;s here.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother immediately returned to this room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh, then where did they go?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Maybe they went outside while Yuzuru-chan and I went to the warehouse to look for insecticide spray?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? It&#8217;s not fair, when we worked so hard to exterminate cockroaches!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I wonder if they walked to the convenience store to calm Neneka-chan down.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I wish I could have gone to the convenience store too! Oh, by the way auntie, listen! Something interesting happened at a convenience store near my college the other day…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the room, Yuzuru-neechan and my mother were conversing. The topic of conversation gradually changed and became irrelevant to us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We couldn&#8217;t come out of the closet because my room was where the conversation was held.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I managed to turn my face around so I could move my mouth. Neneka’s chest was still pressed against my cheeks, but I could manage to have a conversation with her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wait, Neneka&#8230; what are we going to do? If someone sees us together in a place like this, there&#8217;s no more excuses&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a very quiet voice, I blamed Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka too, complained to me in a very low voice about her feelings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Because&#8230; because I didn&#8217;t want Daiki to be taken anymore! I want to monopolize you!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Monopolize…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I said earlier that I wanted to hear your honest feelings, but I don&#8217;t want to hand you over to Yuzuru-san. Even if Daiki thinks Yuzuru-san is kind of nice, Daiki is… my boyfriend right now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her small voice was filled with uncontrollably loud emotions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was jealous of Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Sorry…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said so with a voice that sounded like she was about to cry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did she think I would get angry? She shouldn&#8217;t think like that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;She didn&#8217;t want Yuzuru-neechan to take me away, so the two of us were trying to hide in such a small closet&#8230; wasn&#8217;t that cute?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My cheeks were loose, though Neneka wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell because of the darkness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan and my mother were so engrossed in chatting that they didn&#8217;t seem to notice that we were whispering in the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wished they could just change places right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I waited patiently for the two of them to leave the room, Neneka moved slightly on top of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then&#8230; she began to touch my body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Neneka…!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka stroked my body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps because my vision was blocked by the darkness, I became strongly conscious of the feeling of being touched.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka… Hey, what’s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Here, here, and here… you let Yuzuru-san touch you in a sticky… way.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka touched me as she said so.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I see. Neneka was touching the places that Yuzuru-neechan was touching earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t let her touch me, she just touched me on her own…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was tickling me like when Yuzuru-neechan touched me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, it wasn&#8217;t just ticklish. Something was rising up. This feeling could be felt at…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey&#8230; Don&#8217;t touch here and there in this position&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inside the closet, where it was dark and I could hardly see anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Stars began to twinkle in my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Damn it. The battle of worldly desires began within me again&#8230;!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the darkness, my vexation radiated a power as dazzling as the first-class spring star Arcturus.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was trying to blind my reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My reasoning, which had grown accustomed to the darkness, was fainting in agony as its eyes were burned by the strong light. In that gap, I knew that the worldly desires began to move under the cover of darkness. At this rate, between my Arcturus and my Big Dipper, a great curve of light, a great spring curve, would be drawn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka… right now, it’s useless.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Already, slowly, a great curve of spring was about to emerge in my lower abdomen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to do something to make Neneka&#8217;s hand stop, but Neneka didn&#8217;t want to stop her hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yada… it&#8217;s disinfection, so stay still.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Disinfection…!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed that she couldn&#8217;t tolerate Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s sticky touches on me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything Neneka touched was soft and warm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The small space was filled with Neneka&#8217;s body heat and smell, making me dizzy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My rational mind was desperately trying to hold out, but Neneka was dazzling me like Spica, the first star of spring.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Arcturus in the constellation Ursa Major, shining in orange, was the male star… Spica in Virgo, shining in white, was the female star, and together they were called the husband and wife stars. So, my Arcturus and Neneka&#8217;s Spica called to each other…!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The actual glowing Arcturus in the night sky was currently moving towards Spica. And it was said that in a few tens of thousands of years they would be visible side by side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, the approach speed of my Arcturus and Neneka&#8217;s Spica were nothing compared to the actual ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this rate, they were going to combine, not just line up in a dozen of minutes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I guess I&#8217;ll just have to put up with it until Neneka feels better… Somehow, I had to endure it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I meditated hard and tried to keep my mind clear, but there was no way I wouldn&#8217;t feel Neneka in this small space.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I boldly tried to change my position, Neneka let out a sexy exhale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Nn&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh! Sorry!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Oh, my God! Atlas had been summoned to my groin!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was my Atlas, positioned just below the part Neneka was straddling, that pushed Neneka up and made her scream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Atlas was a Greek mythological giant in the mythological constellation of Ursa Major, formed by stars that included Arcturus. He was defeated by Zeus, the almighty God, and was charged with the role of keeping the heavens supported, and escaped from his eternal suffering by being turned to stone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, my Atlas was already ticking like a stone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to distract myself by thinking about various Greek myths I had read long ago, but the petrification of my Atlas wouldn&#8217;t heal. Rather, thinking about Greek mythology had the opposite effect, as it reminded me of all the episodes of the Gods who had been screwing around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Come to think of it, I remembered that Greek mythology comics were the first erotic books in my life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike Atlas, who felt the anguish of continuing to support the heavens, my Atlas was motivated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Far from supporting the heavens, it was filled with the spirit of hitting the heavens.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, I didn&#8217;t need it to be so enthusiastic!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a thud, Neneka bumped her forehead against mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s hair touched my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was so close to Neneka that I could feel her breath on my skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you want to break up with me and go out with Yuzuru-san?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said and squeezed her clothes around her chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Even before the two of us hid in this closet together, Neneka had been trying to ask that. I had to tell Neneka soon… how I really felt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This situation came up right before I answered, and it flew right over my head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I exhaled shortly, calmed myself down, and then said to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I didn&#8217;t tell you earlier… I don&#8217;t want to go out with Yuzuru-neechan. I want to be Neneka&#8217;s boyfriend forever. Neneka is my first girlfriend, but… I think she&#8217;s the best girlfriend I&#8217;ve ever had.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s true. We both lost one parent when we were little, and we&#8217;ve been through a lot, haven&#8217;t we? I was so happy that you could understand that kind of pain in real life. When I talked about it with normal friends, they were more concerned than necessary, which made it hard for me, but with Neneka, it was easy to talk about it. When I am with Neneka, my comfort level is top class.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm, I&#8217;m just like you. I, too, am comfortable with you, Daiki. I&#8217;m sure that’s because we were in the same situation, we naturally knew what we didn&#8217;t want the other person to step into and what we wanted the other person to handle with care.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s why, you know… I think Neneka is the best for me. After living together, I like you more and more. And that’s why I won’t&#8230; go out with Yuzuru-neechan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka took her forehead off mine and looked at my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t see her clearly, but I knew she was trying to get a good look at my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yeah, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could tell even if I couldn&#8217;t see well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was also relieved and smiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, Yuzuru-chan! I have some brandy cake! You&#8217;re over twenty, aren&#8217;t you? Will you eat it with me?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh! I want to eat it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah! Let&#8217;s eat! Daiki and Neneka-chan will be back soon.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the room, I could hear such a conversation between my mother and Yuzuru-neechan. And finally, there was a sign that the two of them were starting to move. While chatting, they went out into the corridor and closed the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sound of the footsteps descended the stairs and headed towards the living room. And the sound of the living room door opening and closing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was harder to hear than usual being in the closet, but they did indeed enter the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The second floor was silent. The only people on the second floor now were Neneka and I, who were hiding in the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Looks like they&#8217;re gone&#8230; Let&#8217;s get out of here. Neneka, can you open the door?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was under Neneka, and I couldn&#8217;t open the closet door on my own. So, I had no choice but to ask Neneka, but she still didn&#8217;t move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka… what happened?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; yeah. Wait a minute. Just one more place&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just when I thought something was approaching, something touched my lips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was Neneka&#8217;s lips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A hot exhale.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;This was a… kiss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I made the slightest movement, our lips slowly parted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I still felt the touch on my lips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Fluffy, tingling and numb sensation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka and I kissed for the first time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I suddenly became terribly embarrassed. I was sure that I looked really weird right now. It was a shame that I couldn&#8217;t see Neneka&#8217;s face, but I was really glad that she didn&#8217;t get to see my stupid face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka said in a small voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know it&#8217;s impossible not to let other people touch you&#8230; but… Rule number 9. Kisses can&#8217;t be done with anyone other than me&#8230;!&#8221;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Y-Yes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was so thrilled that my voice was hoarse as I replied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After hearing my response, Neneka slid the closet door to the side. The light from the lights that had been left on came in, and a cool breeze flowed in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka moved while being careful not to crush me, and escaped from the closet first. Then, she stretched out with her hands up in the open area of the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Nn&#8230;! I knew that it was too small for two people.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka stretched her contracted body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before long, she took a deep breath and turned around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on? What&#8217;s wrong? Get out of there.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka looked at me curiously as I was still sitting in the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was no surprise that she wondered. Even now that Neneka had retreated and I could move freely, I was still sitting in the closet with one knee propped up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it&#8230; I&#8217;m just waiting for Atlas&#8217;s possession of my bad son to dissolve&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Your son is possessed by Atlas, one of the Titans?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Neneka, these words must have been out of the blue. And yet, Neneka was excitedly biting back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What did this mean?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For some reason, Neneka&#8217;s eyes sparkled and she looked at me with a good look.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Are you familiar with Greek mythology, Neneka?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah… I read about it in a book a long time ago. But it&#8217;s okay, Daiki. I know what you&#8217;re talking about. I&#8217;m sorry, Atlas… Please tell him it&#8217;s time to go back to the sky.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said this smilingly, and I broke out in a funny sweat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will tell him…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Seriously, I wished I could be a stone too… I wanted to be a stone so I didn&#8217;t have to feel any pain…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of my addiction to star-related illustrated books as a little boy, I had developed another strange world of annoyance. But, it seemed that Neneka had gotten used to me saying strange words, and she even said to me, &#8220;I know what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had been amazed at Neneka&#8217;s adaptability since the beginning of our parents&#8217; re-marriage, but I didn&#8217;t expect her to adapt even to my weird way of conversing. I was almost in tears because she really understood me so well&#8230; in many ways.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could be a great spring curve or a petrified Atlas… My bad son could really be anything. It was a changeling, wasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my lower abdomen, the petrified Atlas was still breathing to support the heavens, and I felt somehow afraid to come out of the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it had just been me, I would have been able to walk out of the closet without a care in the world. But, Neneka had been in my room the whole time, waiting for me to come out of the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I went outside in such a situation, I would be showing Neneka how my petrified Atlas was supporting the heavenly world. Even if it was my male friends who were around me, I would not like them to see me in this state, especially if the person was Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, my Atlas wasn&#8217;t supported by the heavenly world, but just the cloth of my pants and trousers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I would forgive it if it just petrified me, at this point. So, no more bloating and getting hot like a phone battery that was drained and on the verge of igniting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My cooldown was still going to take a while, but my mother and Yuzuru-neechan didn&#8217;t find out that I was hiding in the closet with Neneka. That was why… my heart was crying, but I decided to call it a good development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A dozen minutes after Neneka came out of the closet, I was finally able to get out of the closet too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are you okay now?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The possession of Atlas was released from my bad son.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing this declaration of victory, Neneka looked relieved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s right. It would be troublesome if I continued to struggle with my worldly desires. I got my first kiss, but I didn&#8217;t think Neneka was ready for anything more than that&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I came out of the closet and stretched like Neneka did earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It felt good to stretch out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Now then, what should we do now? My mother and Yuzuru-neechan think that we might be outside. Should we actually go outside to make sense of this&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be all right if we say that we were on the balcony of my room? I don&#8217;t think they checked inside my room.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was very considerate of Neneka, so she didn&#8217;t go into her room without permission. But, for some reason, she entered my room with impunity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see. Then, I guess we can fool them.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to go with that now. I&#8217;m getting… a little sleepy and I want to go to bed…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Checking the clock on the wall, the time was past 10:30 at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For Neneka, who usually went to bed at eleven o&#8217;clock, it was time for her to get sleepy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;re tired after everything that happened today. It&#8217;s time for you to rest now, Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What about Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah I&#8217;ll… relax a little more and then maybe go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was in the mood to enjoy a little time to myself and then go to bed. As expected, though, I couldn&#8217;t tell Neneka what I was going to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see… Then, I think I&#8217;ll go ahead and rest first.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said while rubbing her eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sleepy-looking Neneka was cute, too. Because when Neneka was sleepy she looked more like a small animal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such a sleepy Neneka approached my bed… and went straight into the bed as if she was being sucked in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; Neneka?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm…? What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What do you mean…? This isn&#8217;t Neneka&#8217;s room, so that&#8217;s not Neneka&#8217;s bed, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know… it&#8217;s your bed, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you know what you&#8217;re doing, why are you trying to sleep in my bed?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; I&#8217;m thinking of sleeping with you tonight.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Why?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps too sleepy, Neneka began to say funny things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute! Why are we sleeping in the same bed! It&#8217;s true that Neneka and I are lovers, but our parents think that we&#8217;re brother and sister-in-law, and that we&#8217;re getting along! What would they think if they saw us in bed together…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, we’ll just make a reasonable excuse and we&#8217;ll be fine…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps because she was sleepy, Neneka&#8217;s reply was inappropriate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I thought the rule was that you could only stay in my room until twelve o’clock.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is there a reason you want me out of your room so badly?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, whose eyes had been so vacant a moment ago, was now looking at me with a stern stare.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t say anything wrong and I was not trying to do anything wrong. And yet, somehow it got worse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t have any… particular reason…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, today is special.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The word &#8220;special&#8221; made me nervous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Did she really want to be with me because it was our first kiss anniversary&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I have a feeling that Yuzuru-san is going to come visit Daiki at night. I have to keep a close watch on Daiki today to make sure he doesn&#8217;t make a one-night mistake.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s insistence on justice. The sweet and sour reason I imagined was easily shattered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was scratching my head a little awkwardly, Neneka said confidently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s Yuzuru-san. She’ll definitely come.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don’t think so…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, what would you do if Yuzuru-san really came to visit you at night? Even if you were hugged in your underwear, would you be able to kick your son out of the room without letting him walk on his own?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Let your son go on his own&#8230; Isn&#8217;t Neneka&#8217;s word choice gradually becoming more and more my own? Well, that aside&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It hit me where it hurt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn&#8217;t like I was making my bad son hot regardless of who it was. I would like to think that my bad son&#8217;s passion was because it was Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… But this was a physiological phenomenon that had nothing to do with one&#8217;s own will. Anyone could make a change, as long as the conditions were right. If it was that easy to control, I would think about the timing more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to be in a battle every now and then, like the hero of a comic book who tried to subdue an evil dragon that was rampaging around regardless of its will and tried to break the seal. What kind of chunibyo play was this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ll sleep with Daiki and when Yuzuru-san comes, I&#8217;ll kick her out! I&#8217;ll deal with her resolutely as your younger sister, so leave it to me!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After saying that, Neneka let out a small yawn.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to bed until something comes up… Daiki, you&#8217;re going to relax a bit more and then go to bed, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good night, Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, good night…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On my bed, Neneka began to sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the meantime, there was an opened up space for me to sleep, but if I was to roll over there, I would be huddled up with Neneka. I was sure I would be in agony, remembering the day when I hugged Neneka in her… swimsuit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, that was why I couldn&#8217;t relax when Neneka was in the room…!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not wanting to let the cries of my heart go out to Neneka, I silently let out a long sigh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How long had it been since I turned off the lights, made up my mind, and rolled over onto the bed with Neneka?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, I felt the door open, and I, who had been a light sleeper, immediately woke up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one who opened the door without saying anything and came inside was Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My heart was pounding as I saw what Neneka had said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took the liberty of pretending I had just noticed and called out to Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;? Yuzuru-neechan&#8230;? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki… you&#8217;re up? Hey, when did you come back to your room?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was on the balcony of Neneka&#8217;s room to calm her down after Yuzuru-neechan went to exterminate the cockroaches. Then, Neneka said she felt sleepy, so we parted… And Yuzuru-neechan was happily chatting with my mom in the living room, so I thought it would be bad to interrupt you both, so I went back to my room.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I sat up on my bed, I told her the excuse I had prepared to answer if she asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, Yuzuru-neechan said, &#8220;Hmm?&#8221; and came right up to the bed where I was sitting. Even though the lights were off in the room, I could make out Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s expression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan looked… suspicious of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a dubious excuse. But, well, I&#8217;ll leave it at that. Instead, I&#8217;d like to ask you one question…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;How do you really feel about your sister? Don&#8217;t you like her?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wh-Why do you keep asking… that?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because… I like Daiki. If you like other girls, then I have no choice but to become more attractive than them to make you like me, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan grabbed my hand and pulled it to her own chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, she said as she embraced my hand carefully on her chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t I…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The warmth of Yuzuru-neechan could be felt in my hand pulled up to her chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the dimly-lit room, Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s face wasn&#8217;t clearly visible. But, I could hear the sadness in her voice… from the way she hugged my hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;It was just as Neneka said… She was serious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan… I…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had to refuse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as I was thinking this, the lump of the futon behind me rose up with a whimper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Dangerous… I almost overslept. I knew you were here! Yuzuru-san!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka suddenly appeared from the mass of the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This surprised even Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Why are you sleeping with Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s to protect Onii-chan!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Protect? What are you trying to protect him from!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s from the second cousin of Onii-chan who crawled at night!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Would you please stop talking about people like they&#8217;re criminals?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san, why is it that you have such a great name, but you don&#8217;t give it away at all?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Why can&#8217;t you be more modest?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan and Neneka started fighting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Oh, I see. This was what was commonly known as the &#8220;Don&#8217;t fight for me…!&#8221; situation!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Should I say &#8220;Don&#8217;t fight for me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, no, no, no. I couldn&#8217;t say such an embarrassing thing!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, numbly, Yuzuru-neechan went to the door and turned on the room lights with a crack. The room became brighter, and Yuzuru-neechan sneaking into the room, and Neneka, who was arguing with Yuzuru-neechan from the bed, became clearly visible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And my face, bewildered by the situation, was now clearly visible to the both of them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan turned on the light and looked at me and Neneka with her arms folded in the center of the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still suspicious that… you guys aren&#8217;t actually dating?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan had a stern look on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, I want you to be honest with me. I can tell by looking at you two… that you&#8217;re not just brother and sister-in-law. I want to hear your true feelings from your mouths. Otherwise, I can&#8217;t… give up on Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan’s words made my heart ache.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe she was tricking us…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, if Yuzuru-neechan was really aware of us&#8230; Wouldn&#8217;t it be painful for her if we didn&#8217;t tell her the truth?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t fool Yuzuru-neechan’s eyes anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to prepare myself. But at that moment, Neneka said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki and I are classmates. We were on the same committee in second grade, so I lied to our parents that we had never met before, but the truth is that we had been acquainted. I knew that he lost his father when he was little, and I told him that my mother had passed away too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was still trying to hide our relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I respect him. I like him. So, I&#8217;m happy to be able to live with him, even if it’s only as his sister.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;In other words, do you mean that you have an unrequited love for Daiki? And you&#8217;re saying that you like him, but he doesn&#8217;t like you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s voice was very calm.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, Yuzuru-neechan didn&#8217;t miss the contradiction in Neneka&#8217;s words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If that’s true, why did you lie to your parents that you had never met before?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan asked Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was silent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think your parents realized it, but you guys have only been living together for a month and you&#8217;ve settled-in way too well. If my classmate of the opposite sex suddenly decided to move in with me, even I, who&#8217;s said to have a rough and proper personality, would get nervous.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neither I nor Neneka could say anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That&#8217;s it. We were too laid back, unnaturally. Luckily, our parents didn&#8217;t feel uncomfortable with that, so we got carried away and acted like brother and sister who were on good terms, but&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking at us who didn&#8217;t say anything, Yuzuru-neechan continued.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If I could stay calm, what kind of person would it have to be? Someone I would be happy to live with. It would also be difficult if we didn&#8217;t like each other. It&#8217;s hard to live calmly with someone you don&#8217;t know and how they feel about you. In other words, even if Neneka likes Daiki, if she didn&#8217;t know that Daiki liked her, she wouldn&#8217;t be living so calmly. You already know that your feelings won&#8217;t change, so you can be natural, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan, who saw us for the first time today, had the best view of us. And she was able to guess and understand everything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a complete defeat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We couldn&#8217;t fool Yuzuru-neechan about our relationship anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gave up and told Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. We have mutual feelings for each other. I also like Neneka&#8230; We just started dating before our parents remarried.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said to me worriedly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is it ok with you, Daiki&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; it can&#8217;t be helped. Yuzuru-neechan is already aware of it. From here on out, I&#8217;m just going to have to ask Yuzuru-neechan to somehow keep this between us.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan knew about our true relationship. However, just because Yuzuru-neechan found out about it, didn’t mean there would be any problems with our cohabitation. All that was left was to stop Yuzuru-neechan from telling our parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Yuzuru-neechan grinned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Between you and me…? If I tell your parents about this, your cohabitation will end immediately.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s why I want you to keep this a secret. I&#8217;m begging you, Yuzuru-neechan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Oh, Daiki, you forgot that I&#8217;m after you, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? I thought you were going to give up on me when you found out Neneka and I were dating!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Because if your parents found out you two were dating and had to live in different places, your relationship would be a little different than it had been, wouldn&#8217;t it? Doesn&#8217;t that mean I would have a chance to take Daiki away from Neneka-chan? What should I do?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan smiled wryly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Certainly it would be more convenient for Yuzuru-neechan if our cohabitation was dissolved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I thought that if she knew about the relationship between Neneka and I, she would give up on me. But, I guess that it was a bad move…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I pursed my lips in contemplation of my next move, Neneka said to Yuzuru-neechan from the side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s what you want to do… Yuzuru-san, you can do it. You can tell our parents. But, we won&#8217;t split up even if we stop living together. I don&#8217;t intend to let Yuzuru-san take Daiki away from me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I looked at Neneka in surprise.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s eyes were unwavering. Eyes that were prepared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No matter what you do, nothing will change between Daiki and I. Rather, the Romeo and Juliet effect will make us even more lovey-dovey!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a serious face, Neneka&#8217;s mouth let out cute words that I couldn&#8217;t tell if she was serious or not, and I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Romeo and Juliet effect, getting more and more lovey-dovey with each other…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey Daiki! Why are you laughing when people were talking seriously?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, I just thought that Neneka was interesting…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that I&#8217;m as good as Daiki, but I actually admire your sense of speech.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh!? No, I think it&#8217;s better not to admire that!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While saying that, Neneka puffed out her cheeks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I apologized to Neneka, saying, &#8220;Sorry, sorry,&#8221; but still couldn&#8217;t stop laughing for a while.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Ah, I get it now. I know you two are in love.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, Yuzuru-neechan said with a sigh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, she smiled softly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I guess that means there&#8217;s no room for me to take advantage of your relationship right now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fine. I&#8217;ll keep it a secret from your parents that you two are dating. I promise.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was surprised. Judging from Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s reaction earlier, I didn&#8217;t think she would accept my request so quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are you sure? Really?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be able to say anything to your parents after hearing Neneka-chan&#8217;s line just now. If I tell you two off and get them to end your cohabitation, it&#8217;s like I have to do it to win Daiki&#8217;s heart, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan walked up to me slowly, and smiled calmly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don’t want to go out of my way to win against Neneka-chan in such a cowardly way.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; That&#8217;s very much like Yuzuru-neechan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it obvious? And I know that you like me a lot.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… undeniable.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was the Yuzuru-neechan I had known since I was a little kid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was strong, hated crookedness, and was kind to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the same as my love for Neneka, but I definitely liked Yuzuru-neechan too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But… I have one thing to say.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After saying that, Yuzuru-neechan pointed her finger at us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you get into trouble, or if you make a mistake that reveal your relationship to your parents, then that&#8217;s a different story! The moment you two are pulled apart, I&#8217;m going to make a fait-accompli case with Daiki, so be prepared!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was shocked by the sound of the word fait-accompli. I was confused thinking about what Yuzuru-neechan would do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka squeezed my dismayed hand and said to Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand. I will take good care of it so that it doesn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was calm and collected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I couldn&#8217;t let that line go unheard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wait, it&#8217;s always Neneka who puts me on the edge of my seat, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure, I&#8217;m doing it right. So you should be looking at me more properly than I&#8217;m looking at you, Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Even if you say that with a sharp face! I&#8217;m worried that Neneka won&#8217;t be able to restrain herself properly!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was unintentionally tsk-tsking at Neneka, Yuzuru-neechan laughed in amazement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You guys are really close! I&#8217;m so jealous. How long have you been together already?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; we&#8217;ve been dating for a little over three months.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I answered about the length of our relationship, Yuzuru-neechan&#8217;s eyes were fixed on me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? You started dating in the third year? Even though you&#8217;re taking exams?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t start dating with the intention of having lots of fun together, but rather to study together and encourage each other!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;? Aren&#8217;t you underestimating the entrance exam? It&#8217;s not as warm as the high school entrance exam. The time you spend thinking about the person you love and the time you spend looking at SNS were futile. Don&#8217;t you know that it&#8217;s the same as wasting your time?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say things that would gouge the hearts of high school students who were in the midst of youth&#8230; Even so, I wanted to make memories with Neneka in my remaining little high school life.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see. Well, let&#8217;s see if your choice will turn out to be a good one or a bad one. Either, you will be tense before the exam and break up, or one of you will fail the exam and things will get awkward and you will break up… Either way, rest assured that I will be there to keep Daiki company and comfort him once he is free.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;How can I be reassured after such an ominous prediction?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Haha, you are so fun to tease.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan smiled happily as she headed for the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll go back to my own room, so please go back to your own room, too. If you sleep in the same futon, Daiki will cry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After hearing Neneka&#8217;s reply, Yuzuru-neechan left the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Finally, today&#8217;s battle between Neneka and Yuzuru-neechan had been settled, hadn&#8217;t it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one who won me was Neneka&#8230; Well, I wasn&#8217;t going to choose anyone but Neneka from the beginning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I never thought that we would have to reveal ourselves to someone like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I felt glad that I was able to tell Yuzuru-neechan the truth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was very grateful that Yuzuru-neechan had understood and I felt fulfilled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was satisfied on my own, Neneka pulled the hem of my clothes and tilted her head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? What? Neneka?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Will you cry if we sleep in the same futon?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t Yuzuru-san say it at the end? Do you hate sleeping with me so much that you would cry?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s… different. There&#8217;s nothing I don&#8217;t like so much that I would cry. I&#8217;m happy, it&#8217;s just that…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Yuzuru-neechan. You dropped a troublesome bomb at the last minute…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was hard for me to say… because if I slept with Neneka, I would have to spend the whole night underground talking to my bad son, and we would cry over each other&#8217;s difficult circumstances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Could it be that you&#8217;re going to be in agony?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was not expecting to hear the word &#8220;agony&#8221; coming out of Neneka, but my heart was pounding with this new development.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s cheeks were flushed red and she turned away with a downcast look on her face. Then, she opened her thin lips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Actually, me too&#8230; There are times when I get frustrated.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;…!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a shocking statement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My body temperature raised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka was in agony…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could it be that the Goddess at Neneka&#8217;s deepest spring beckoned me to play in the water with her?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was also an ordinary high school girl. It was natural that she had one of the three major human desires, the desire to make love.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, I wasn&#8217;t the only one who held back when Neneka and I encountered each other in the bath, when we huddled together in bed, and when we kissed in the closet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the shower head in my groin was about to go out of control, when my foolish son was wailing in a crispy way, when my petrified Atlas was summoned to my dangerous zone, even Neneka was fighting against something inside herself?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I wonder if Neneka also wanted to make out with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;When does Neneka become frustrated?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to ask this, even though I thought it might be a mean question. I wanted to ask her how she honestly felt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka refused to make eye contact and restlessly played with her long hair with her fingertips.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yada… that kind of thing&#8230; do you want to know?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I want to hear…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s embarrassing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka took my pillow that was nearby and hugged it tightly. The lower half of her face was hidden by the pillow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;When I&#8217;m clinging to Daiki&#8230; I&#8217;m in agony.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just like me. I too was in agony when I clinged to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It makes me want to stick even more to Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Me too. It made me want to stick to Neneka more and shorten the physical distance more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would like to aim for zero distance if possible.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You know, I want to hug you tightly and be wrapped in Daiki’s scent, and be… happy.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said while squeezing my pillow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know I&#8217;m greedy… for wanting to stick more and more to you even though we&#8217;re already together so much.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka showed her embarrassed face and smiled &#8220;Ehehe.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cuteness rank was ultra rare class. I was overwhelmed with emotions that such a cute girl was my girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right now, I was just listening to where Neneka&#8217;s frustrated feelings would end up. She wouldn&#8217;t be aiming for the same goal as me if it ended with &#8220;gyuuuuu&#8221; and &#8220;happiness.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… That was strange. I thought we were heading towards the same goal until halfway through. But for some reason, the end point no longer seemed the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feeling a little uneasy, I urged Neneka to continue the story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Then, what?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, and do you want to go further than that&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh no… I&#8217;m happy enough with that for now, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sweet smile like a marigold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The pure smile of Neneka purified all the troubles in me at once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;The three greatest desires? Of course they were &#8220;appetite,&#8221; &#8220;desire to sleep,&#8221; and &#8220;desire to take care of Neneka,&#8221; right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A cool, blue, refreshing breeze blew in my heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everything that made me up, all of me, had succumbed to the purity of Neneka&#8217;s heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to protect this innocent and pure smile of Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would fight for that as many times as I had to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The power that welled up from within me and tried to take control of my body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter what hardships awaited me, I wouldn&#8217;t lose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a handsome smile on my face, I gently stroked Neneka&#8217;s hair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You need to get some sleep now. If you don&#8217;t get some real sleep soon, it&#8217;s going to be hard for you to go to school tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m going back to my room.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka stood up from the bed after saying that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The moment she stood up, I smelled a soft, sweet scent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;A sweet smell. I liked this smell of Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was distracted by the scent of Neneka, she approached me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just a slight touch on the lips&#8230; a kiss.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet, I felt a sweet, numbing electric current run through my entire body from the point of touch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good night… Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a slam, Neneka closed the door and left the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I didn&#8217;t move. Even after I was alone in my room, even when I heard Neneka enter the next room, I didn&#8217;t move. No, I couldn&#8217;t move.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Because the electric current just now breathed life into my cells, giving vitality to my core.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The holy sword Excalibur, towered above my center line</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Where was the hero who would pull it out, I cried.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, it was a moment of purification.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The worldly desires of a high school boy who didn&#8217;t know when to stop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My lonely struggle had probably only just begun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next day. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I went to the entrance to see Yuzuru-neechan off, my mother, Neneka&#8217;s father, and Neneka were already at the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan, are you leaving already?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a bullet train ticket. I have a ticket for the Shinkansen, so I don&#8217;t want to be held up. So, please be patient.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No. Would you say that before you had even made a preliminary move to stall?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-neechan… Mmm, are you going home…? &#8220;Daiki’s words made me feel sad and made me feel happy that he wanted to hold me back.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Did I say it in such an emotional way?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was relieved to see that Yuzuru-neechan was doing well as usual, despite what had just happened last night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are you sure you don&#8217;t want me to take you to the station?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was concerned about Yuzuru-neechan. But, Yuzuru-neechan waved her hand sideways and said with a laugh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine! I used to live here, so I won&#8217;t get lost on my way to the station, and my luggage isn&#8217;t too heavy, so I will be fine!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, she suddenly checked her watch and exclaimed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah! I have to go soon! Well then, everyone, take care! I&#8217;ll come again, so please look forward to it!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yuzuru-neechan opened the door, turned around and stared at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, she wasn&#8217;t looking at me. She was looking at Neneka next to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I looked next to me and saw that Neneka was also looking straight at Yuzuru-neechan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Have a safe trip.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Yuzuru-neechan smiled meaningfully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thanks. Little sister, be careful not to be too lovey-dovey just because you&#8217;re siblings, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was startled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was she saying in front of our parents!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I consciously took slow breaths so as not to be aware of my inner turmoil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Yuzuru-neechan looked at me this time and winked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Next time I come to visit, will you sleep with me, Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Laughing at my strange voice, Yuzuru-neechan left the house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, it feels like the storm has passed…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Relieved that Yuzuru-neechan had left, Neneka and I were on our way to the station to go to school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who was walking next to me, let out a small yawn. Most of the night she was swayed by Yuzuru-neechan, so she must not have slept well. Even I was about to yawn if I let my guard down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yuzuru-san… looks like she kept her promise.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll be fine, because Yuzuru-neechan wouldn&#8217;t break a promise once made and wouldn&#8217;t easily contradict what she said. I believe in Yuzuru-neechan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I believe in Yuzuru-san too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first time I told anyone that we were dating. Moreover, to a person who knew that we lived together as siblings-in-law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily, it worked out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was okay this time, but if someone found out again, there was no guarantee that they would keep their word. This time, the other party was Yuzuru-neechan, so we could rest easy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We have to be more careful from now on so that our relationship won’t be exposed. Otherwise, the fact that Yuzuru-san went through the trouble of not telling our parents would have been meaningless.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8230; if we are found out, we might be separated immediately&#8230; From now on, it might be necessary to follow the rules thoroughly and add more strict rules.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; but&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the middle of a serious conversation, Neneka smiled mischievously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;As long as we are not found out, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She tilted her head and smiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a brilliant smile that seemed to sparkle and dance around her, but I stopped in my tracks, confused by the… words she said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… Neneka? What did you just say?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That’s right, so that we don’t get found out, we need rules, but the main goal is not to get found out, so if we don&#8217;t get found out, then it&#8217;s all okay.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, no, no, wait, wait. Why are you so eager to break the rules right away?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not saying I will break any rules, okay? But… wouldn&#8217;t it be more fun to do what we want to do while being careful not to get caught than to spend all our time holding back so that we don&#8217;t get caught?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I see. What Neneka said was correct.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It&#8217;s hard to be patient all the time, and above all else, the repercussions could lead to dangerous behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather, if we were prepared to take risks and were committed to the pursuit of fun, our secret would be kept tight with just the right amount of tension…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; So, if I let Neneka attack at the last minute as she pleases, there won&#8217;t be anyone able to stop her in case of an emergency?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fufu.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka laughed happily at my words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dangerous, dangerous. I was about to be completely seduced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m having trouble with my sister who wants to get off on the wrong foot…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. I can do all of that because I believe that Onii-chan will stop me if I almost cross the line.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka stretched her index finger quickly towards the sky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The wind blew and Neneka&#8217;s hair swayed lightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Rule number 10! Onii-chan, will do his best to prevent his sister from going out of control!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not a rule anymore!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Haha.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka laughed out loud. And I, too, was invited to laugh by the sight of Neneka&#8217;s laughter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sorry. Actually, I already felt the same way as Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Living with Neneka, being careful not to let it be known that I was dating Neneka, and secretly telling each other how we felt about each other, was a life that I enjoyed…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, I couldn&#8217;t just laugh and say that my days were fun.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka always attacked me at the very edge of my imagination.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure that she would come to my room tonight with the face of a prankster sister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And&#8230; today we continue to use our position as brother and sister-in-law to secretly deepen our bond as a couple…</p>
