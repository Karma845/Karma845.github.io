<h3>Epilogue &#8211; Neneka 3</h3>

<p>He had lost his father when he was very young, and I thought that our circumstances were similar and that we could understand each other&#8217;s feelings better than anyone else. Because I had lost my mother in the past, I was sure that I could understand his heart to a certain extent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, it meant a lot to me to have met him. I guess it was a little too romantic to say that I met him… when I was meant to meet him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, the third turning point came when my father remarried.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when my boyfriend became my… Onii-chan&#8230; just two months after we started dating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From living with my father to living with four people at once. Moreover, there was my boyfriend in the room next door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, I should have bought cuter loungewear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if the air freshener in my room smelled okay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I should have been more excited about the body cream, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The trouble was, I couldn&#8217;t relax even when I was at home. I never knew when or where we might bump into each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it wasn&#8217;t my boyfriend living with me, I wouldn&#8217;t have bothered to prepare a wet towel before going to bed and wipe my face as soon as I woke up in the morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t want him to see my face when I woke up before I went to the… washroom to wash my face. And I didn&#8217;t want him to think even for a second that I had a dirty face!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Six in the morning. It was time for Daiki to wake up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had already washed my face and brushed my teeth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered whether I should change into my uniform first, but since I was wearing my favorite loungewear that my mother-in-law gave me, today I decided to go straight to the room next door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I slowly opened the door to his room, I could hear Daiki sleeping.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to the sunlight shining through the window, the room was dimly lit even with the curtains closed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I gently stepped into the room, I was wrapped in a slightly chilly air.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The air conditioner was left on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki was lying in bed, curled up in a blanket. He looked a little cold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I couldn&#8217;t help it anymore.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes, Daiki was a careless person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He looked solid, but he easily lost track of the most important things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, that was what made him so cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Someone said it before. When… girls fell in true love, they didn&#8217;t look at their boyfriend and think that they were cool, they thought that they were cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also noticed this when I started dating Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every time I got to see him in a slightly bad way, I thought of Daiki as cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I read in a book that boys didn&#8217;t like to be told they were cute, so I refrained from mentioning it. But, I always shouted in my mind, &#8220;Daiki is cute.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Gently and softly, I approached Daiki and crouched down by the bed and put my face close to his ear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, I whispered softly and tenderly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good morning. Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki frowned and turned over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not only did he not get up, he rolled over with his back to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Couldn&#8217;t wake up in one try?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was going to give him a wake-up call with my sweet sister voice, but I failed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed that my gentle call didn&#8217;t pull him back from the world of sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;In that case… there&#8217;s no other way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mugyuu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh!? What are you doing!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hugged Daiki vigorously as I curled up on top of him, covered with a blanket.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… No, I think he woke up in pain from my weight. Yeah, I didn&#8217;t care either way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Beep, beep, beep. My sister clock is letting you know that it&#8217;s time to wake up, Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I was on top of Daiki, I told him by imitating a mechanical voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He had to get up, but he couldn&#8217;t because I was on top of him. It was so cute how he fluttered around in the blanket, making me want to hug him even tighter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka…! What if our parents find you in my room this early in the morning and misunderstand something!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, it&#8217;s all right. I just came to wake up my sleepyhead Onii-chan. I&#8217;m a good sister, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I proudly said that, &#8220;Fufu,&#8221; Daiki laughed like he was troubled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really… Neneka is really good at pretending to be my little sister.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt sorry. I knew, I was being troublesome because I kept doing things that were going to make our parents find us out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, I… liked Daiki, who looked troubled like that, but in the end he forgave me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I liked it so much that I wanted to… see that face again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt sorry, I&#8230; was trying.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I apologized in my heart, but I couldn’t say it out loud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew I was a little weird for wanting to embarrass him even though I liked him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I can pretend to be your sister so well because you are so much like an Onii-chan that I naturally become like a little sister.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Am I that much like a big brother? It makes me feel uneasy&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki looked anxious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to say anything bad, but what happened?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got anxious too and asked Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What are you worried about?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230; umm&#8230; Neneka will get used to my Onii-chan look, and eventually she would say things like &#8220;I can only see Daiki as my Onii-chan after all,&#8221; and our relationship will end. O-Or something…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle when I heard what Daiki considered to be a point of concern.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? Even if I call you &#8220;Onii-chan,&#8221; I will always think of you as my favorite boyfriend.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I expressed my feelings, Daiki&#8217;s face turned red with embarrassment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a muffled little voice, he said, &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&nbsp;So cute. Daiki who worried like that was so cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Oh my God, I couldn&#8217;t stop loving him more ever since we had been living together!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to kiss him, just on the cheek&#8230; just a little bit…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki&#8230; umm&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Can I&#8230; kiss you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to ask him that, but I was embarrassed and the words didn&#8217;t come out easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki was looking at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, I was sure he would notice that I was thinking about embarrassing things because of my red face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If people knew that I wanted to kiss Daiki this early in the morning, they would probably think that I… was a naughty girl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, no.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was something that I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Chuuu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I kissed&#8230; Daiki&#8217;s cheek.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki kept blinking his eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It sounded much, much better than I expected. I was practicing making a chu-chu sound… I guess he noticed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka… umm.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Totto-totto-totto-totto…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whose heartbeat was this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, no, it was footsteps!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before the door opened with a bang, I withdrew from Daiki and moved away from the bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki! How long are you going to sleep&#8230;! Is that&#8230; Neneka-chan? Did you come to wake him up by any chance?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one who suddenly entered the room was, as expected, my mother-in-law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother-in-law walked into Daiki&#8217;s room without knocking, so it was really bad for my heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! As a little sister, I can&#8217;t overlook Onii-chan being late!! Look! Onii-chan! Your mother is here, so it&#8217;s about time you give up and wake up!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh… yeah…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki got up with an unnatural yawn. He was talking normally with me just a moment ago, but I guess he was faking the mood of having just woken up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These parts were cute, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You guys really get along really well. It seems like you were really brother and sister from the beginning. Then, you two come downstairs while I prepare breakfast.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mother-in-law smiled as she looked at us and left the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After checking for signs of my mother-in-law going down the stairs, I saw Daiki getting up from the bed and stand face-to-face with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, almost at the same time, we bursted out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Safe!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We both laughed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki laughed happily, which made me happy and I laughed more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I might pretend to be your sister again and play a prank on you, my boyfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And today, we continue to use our position as brother and sister-in-law to secretly strengthen our bond as a couple…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
