<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>No, that wasn&#8217;t all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We actually started dating before our parents remarried and we were lovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, our parents still didn&#8217;t know that we were in a relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One may ask why not tell them?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When the topic of… what we would do if we were lovers came up, our parents&#8217; response were.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not opposed to… dating, but living together might be a bit of a bad idea.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes… they&#8217;re both still minors, especially when they&#8217;re in school, and they can&#8217;t afford to make any mistakes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words, if our relationship is discovered, our parents would have to separate in the first year of their second marriage. Neneka and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to live together. So, a development that no one would be happy about, would be waiting for us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, while ostensibly playing the role of a close brother and sister-in-law, Neneka and I were secretly enjoying lover&#8217;s time in secret.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It&#8217;s all right. The point was, we had to not make any mistakes that would worry our parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While we were at it, we would have a healthy relationship that we wouldn&#8217;t be embarrassed to show anywhere. Then, when we would become college students, we could report to them that we had actually started dating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When we would become college students, both Neneka and I would probably leave home and live on our own, and we might have a chance to have an adult relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So for now, I wouldn&#8217;t give in to my troubles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;The fight I couldn&#8217;t lose was here…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, Neneka, you&#8217;re eating ice cream even though it&#8217;s not dinner time.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I was so hot after taking a bath. I&#8217;ll be fine, I won&#8217;t leave any leftovers for dinner!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saturday evening.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I got out of the bath and went to the living room to wipe my hair, I found Neneka sitting cozily and athletically on the living room sofa, eating white ice cream on a stick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now in mid-July, the temperature was over 30 degrees Celsius everyday, and air conditioning was a must indoors. I knew that it was especially hot after a bath, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell our parents because I&#8217;ll eat it before they get home, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was cute as she put her index finger to her lips and made a &#8220;Shhh&#8221; pose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents were both out shopping for dinner right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When my mother blurted out, &#8220;It&#8217;s so hot, I don&#8217;t feel like cooking&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t we go get take-out sushi? My father-in-law suggested while smiling. &#8220;Then let&#8217;s go buy some!&#8221; And off they went.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Taking advantage of the fact that our parents were away, Neneka was in full relaxation mode.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was using the armrest of the sofa as a pillow and was lying down on her back. The ice cream was still in her mouth and she was&#8230; skillful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Still, even though she was indoors, her camisole and pants were a bit too revealing, weren&#8217;t they? The shoulder straps of her bra were visible along with the shoulder straps of her camisole.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was a good son who actively did household chores to support my working parents, and I even did the laundry. So, just by looking at those shoulder straps, I could imagine the design of the bra she was wearing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I was a very rational person, so my nose didn&#8217;t turn up at the mere sight of Neneka&#8217;s bra straps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We had set some rules to hide our relationship from our parents and to hide that we were living together from our school friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule 1: We may be together when we leave the house, but when we get to the station, we must go separately. Neneka and I would ride in different train cars.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule 2: Even if we returned home together from school and went to the closest station, we would take different train cars after that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule 3: However, if my sister was in a pinch, Onii-chan was allowed to rush over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule 4: Call me &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; in places where our parents might hear us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule 5: I couldn&#8217;t go to Neneka&#8217;s room at night and Neneka wouldn&#8217;t come to my room every night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule 6: Neneka could only stay in my room until twelve o&#8217;clock at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rule 7: Prohibited any behavior that might reveal that we were lovers in front of our parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… And well, this was how it was decided up to rule number 10, but in rule 8, it was decided that Neneka&#8217;s underwear was to be ignored through in a spectacular manner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We lived together as brother and sister-in-law. Even though we were brother and sister-in-law, I would never dare to look at my sister with an evil eye.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents trusted that we had a moderate sibling relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka trusted me too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our peaceful cohabitation wouldn&#8217;t be possible if I looked at Neneka licking her tongue like a beast here…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I told myself that I would be able to…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;I&#8217;m kind of happy&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka muttered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with you all of a sudden? Oh, you mean you&#8217;re happy because you&#8217;re eating ice cream?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not! I&#8217;m talking about how happy I am to live with you, Daiki!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka looked at me as she took a bite of her ice cream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If we were just dating normally, we wouldn&#8217;t be lounging in the same room at this… time on a Saturday, would we? I&#8217;m just happy to be able to live with my boyfriend just by acting like we&#8217;re siblings-in-law in front of our parents.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; that&#8217;s for sure.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was right. If we weren&#8217;t siblings-in-law, how many years would it have been before I could see Neneka relaxing in her camisole after her bath, eating ice cream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s all thanks to our good siblings&#8217; pretense! I&#8217;ll be counting on you from now on, won&#8217;t I? Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh, yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My face heated up when she unexpectedly called me &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; sweetly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If the ASMR of Neneka whispering &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; was distributed to the world, the number of views would exceed a million in the blink of an eye. There was no doubt about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was just very good at pretending to be my younger sister. Seeing Neneka sweetly calling me &#8220;Onii-chan,&#8221; there was no chance that our parents would find out that we were dating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You guys are really close. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;ve been brother and sister since the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was what was being said, so there was no need to worry yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you want to eat too, Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wasn&#8217;t looking at it with the intention of eating it, but I guess I looked like I wanted it&#8230; Neneka offered me the ice cream that she was about to eat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The part of the ice cream that was in Neneka’s mouth was melting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Can I eat it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gulped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s fine. Oh, but don&#8217;t eat it all in one bite, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, I won&#8217;t do that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A little nervous, I gently approached Neneka, who was lying on the sofa, and tried to take a bite of the ice cream that was being offered to me&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… But Neneka moved the ice cream with a flick and laughed, &#8220;Ehehe.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Naughty girl. She told me that I could eat the ice cream, but she moved it at the last minute so that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to eat it. Besides, she was moving the ice cream around as if she wanted me to catch it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re that mean, I might accidentally eat the whole thing in one bite!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I catched Neneka&#8217;s wrist holding the ice cream and secured it so that the ice cream wouldn&#8217;t be able to escape.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s eyes widened as I approached the ice cream with my mouth wide open, &#8220;Ahh.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; no such&#8230; no&#8230;! Hyah!!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The tip of the ice cream fell off in a blur due to playing with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, the destination of the fall was Neneka&#8217;s breast. The ice cream fell below her collarbone and flowed into her cleavage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her chest area soaked in white ice cream stirred up naughty imaginations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Cold&#8230; the ice cream fell off because of you!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;What&#8217;s that? Was that my fault?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Puffing out her cheeks, Neneka raised herself up and sat down on the sofa. Then, she scooped up the ice cream on her own chest with her fingers and licked it off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, that ice cream, I wanted to lick it too&#8230; I was an idiot. Don&#8217;t even think that, it would be absolutely delicious… Our parents would be coming back home soon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go… and get changed?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; my camisole got dirty too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;And then.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We got the sushi!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents&#8217; voices came from the front door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a panic, Neneka shoved the remaining ice cream into my mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hurry up and get changed!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka ran out of the living room and ran upstairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the sound of her footsteps, &#8220;What happened?&#8221; and my mother and father-in-law came into the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Neneka-chan went upstairs in a panic, I wonder what&#8217;s going on&#8230;? &nbsp;Oh my God, this girl is…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re hungry now that we&#8217;ve taken our time with the shopping. We spent so much time shopping that you got hungry, didn&#8217;t you? Come on, let&#8217;s all have dinner soon.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Haha&#8230; yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I, who had been chastised by Neneka for pushing her ice cream on me, was also guilty of eating ice cream before dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though it was Neneka who ate most of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ice cream was good though…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, I&#8217;ll give you salmon roe and sea urchin, but I want eggs and salmon.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Shall I give you a negitoro roll too?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; I think I&#8217;m going to be full now, so I guess I&#8217;m fine. Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who thanked me cutely, was now wearing short-sleeved pajamas. She had changed from her camisole stained with ice cream and appeared to have destroyed the evidence of her own ice cream consumption.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sushi our parents bought was take-out from a rather nice conveyor belt sushi restaurant in the city.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four servings of an assortment of ten colorful pieces of sushi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But apparently, there were some sushi in there that Neneka didn&#8217;t like, so she and I were trading sushi.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One might think that if we were going to a conveyor belt sushi restaurant, why not just eat at the restaurant, but both of our parents didn&#8217;t like to eat out. Basically, they were people who preferred to take-out whatever they could take-out and eat it at home in a relaxed atmosphere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents who had been on a lovey-dovey road since their re-marriage were in the midst of enjoying their sweet time to the fullest. They wanted to eat, drink and go straight into their own world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The reason they didn&#8217;t ask for delivery and went to the store to buy the food was probably because they just wanted to make time for the two of them, so don&#8217;t think any more deeply about how much more convenient it would have been to have it be delivered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s with you, Neneka&#8230; you still don&#8217;t know how good sea urchin and salmon roe taste? You&#8217;re still a child.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s father laughed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother spoke apologetically to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Neneka-chan. From now on, I&#8217;ll make one without sea urchin and salmon roe for you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; for being so selfish&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I haven&#8217;t figured out all the things you like and don&#8217;t like yet. Please tell me more about you from now on.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; thank you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, smiling shyly, looked happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I, too, felt happiness at the sight of our family of four around the dinner table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka lost her mother in an accident when she was three years old and I lost my father when I was five years old due to illness, so we had few memories of our parents together at the dinner table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was here now was something we had longed for many times since childhood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, when we thought about the happiness of having a leisurely dinner with our&#8230; family, we could stand seeing our parents, &#8220;Ahh,&#8221; and feed each other sushi right in front of us…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Sana-san, you have a grain of rice on your cheek.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I didn&#8217;t like it. I could put up with it… Yeah. It&#8217;s okay. I was getting used to this lovey-dovey theater.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was eating the salmon roe gunkanmaki that Neneka gave me while trying to calm myself down, my my mother looked at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, you and your friends will be on summer vacation soon.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As she said, summer vacation would start in three days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Up until last year I would have said, &#8220;It&#8217;s summer! I&#8217;m going to stay home and laze around!&#8221; But this year however, that wouldn&#8217;t be the case.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I was a student taking entrance exam, I would have to study hard during summer vacation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also had plans to attend a summer course at a cram school. And, of course, Neneka too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… By the way, Neneka and I would participate in different cram school’s summer course.&nbsp; It seemed that Neneka was invited to a cram school that her school friends usually attended.&nbsp; I was also invited by Neneka to attend summer class at the same cram school, but I turned it down and applied for a cram school that seemed easy to attend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to keep our parents from finding out that we were dating, we kept it a secret at school. I was afraid that if we attended summer classes at the same cram school, I would have to meet Neneka&#8217;s friends, and I was afraid that something might come out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There would be a competency test at school after summer break, and I wanted to concentrate on my studies without thinking about Neneka. The entrance exam was getting closer and closer and I wanted to take the competency exam as seriously as the real entrance exam.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We are actually thinking of going on a honeymoon in August. It will be just you and Neneka-chan then, is that okay?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sudden topic made my eyes dart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Huh? What? Honeymoon?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Can you make an appointment now&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka asked a little worriedly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That&#8217;s right. During the Obon season, it would be crowded everywhere, and in some places, accommodations would be fully booked. If it was a sudden idea, the timing would be tough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Neneka&#8217;s father gave a thumbs-up with a fresh smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry! What a surprise! I entered a give-away and won tickets for a trip to Hokkaido! The date and time were specified, so I could only go at the right time.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh, amazing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I would like to take Neneka and Daiki-kun with us. But you have your studies and&#8230; we just got remarried, so I would like us to go alone this time, is that okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s good. Right, Onii-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah. Yes, we can do it. We can take care of the house together, and you can travel in peace.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I pretended to accept the story without hesitation, but my heart was racing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Just Neneka and I for a night!</p>
