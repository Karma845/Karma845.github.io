<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s not the first time you&#8217;ve been away from home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t done it recently, so I&#8217;m telling you this just in case. Also, don&#8217;t be rude to Neneka-chan just because it&#8217;s just the two of you, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I said I won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you do anything to hurt Neneka-chan, I&#8217;ll be responsible for making your thing dysfunctional and unusable, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt a chill in my lower abdomen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother&#8217;s eyes were serious. The eyes of an assassin who was completely aiming at his target.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I wasn&#8217;t Neneka&#8217;s lover, I would never come within a meter of Neneka, and I wouldn&#8217;t touch her, not even a finger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Also, don&#8217;t skip your classes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes&#8230; Mom be careful, too. Be careful not to be left behind. Also, don&#8217;t get lost without father-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh no, I&#8217;ll fine. Don&#8217;t worry about that.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t get too excited and fall down.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Enough! Okay, I&#8217;m off!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Right before they left for the trip, my mother nailed me when she was alone with me, but when I nailed her back, she quickly withdrew.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to be mean.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that if she traveled with Neneka&#8217;s father, my mother would get so excited that she would lose sight of her surroundings, so I was just advising her out of the kindness of my heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be off then.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Be careful.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Dad, bring me a souvenir!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I saw our parents off as they walked out the front door with a carry-on bag.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, there were just Neneka and I in the house until tomorrow night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Finally, it&#8217;s just the two of us now, isn&#8217;t it, Neneka?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; now we can have all the lover&#8217;s time we want anytime we want, Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I glanced at Neneka and saw that she was laughing mischievously, saying, &#8220;Hmm.&#8221; She seemed to be in a good mood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For a few days after going to the pool, she seemed to be troubled about something and wasn&#8217;t in good spirits. However, from the beginning of the summer course, I felt that she became happier, as if she had blown something out of the water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this point in time, when it was just the two of us, I was relieved that Neneka seemed to be doing well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll cook dinner tonight, so you can go relax after your summer class.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the mood to cook dinner alone today, so I would rather have you do that for me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hmm? This was a face that looked like she was up to something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe she was trying to please me by keeping it a secret from me until it was completed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Didn&#8217;t we look like a newlywed couple&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, while our parents were on their honeymoon, we were going to play newlyweds!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, after summer class is over, I&#8217;ll take a detour and come back afterwards. What time should I be back&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I hope you&#8217;ll be back around&#8230; 5 p.m. or so.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered what kind of meal she would make for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was excited and would be able to get through the summer course in a happy mood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fufu, we&#8217;re like newlyweds.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Uh, yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s work hard today in summer class.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Chu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka kissed me on the cheek.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, smiling shyly in an &#8220;Ehehe&#8221; manner, was to say the least, the cutest and the most adorable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Huh? I would be all alone with this cute Neneka until tomorrow night, right? Would I be okay? Was I sure I would be okay?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Summer memories were supposed to have been made at the pool on the first day of summer vacation, but apparently we were about to enter bonus lover&#8217;s time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->
< style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></>
<!-- /wp:spacer -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my hand was a cake roll that I had bought to eat with Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a little embarrassing to go into a cake shop alone to buy a roll cake, but I was able to do my best when I thought that it was to make Neneka happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;If I get married Neneka, I would probably end up buying her a souvenir everyday before I got home&#8230; And then she would say, &#8220;You buy too much everyday! This kind of thing is good on special occasions. It&#8217;s enough for me if you come home safely everyday,&#8221; she would say angrily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A picture of Neneka greeting me in her apron unfolded in my brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it good or bad that my face naturally grinned?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now it&#8217;s time for the me, in the real world, to go back home where Neneka was waiting for me&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I opened the front door and went inside, and Neneka came out of the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back&#8230; Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Facing Neneka, who smiled shyly, I paused in my shoe-removal pose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cause was Neneka&#8230; She was&#8230; strange.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First on her head, there was a nurse&#8217;s hat with cat ears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Cat ear nurse. Cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Would normally be the thing to say, but in this case, such simple impressions weren&#8217;t the end of the story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I also looked at Neneka&#8217;s neck and below.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was wearing a pink apron. And under the apron was a swimsuit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Almost like a naked apron. From the front, it looked like she wasn&#8217;t wearing anything underneath, and for a moment I was surprised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The glimpses of her breasts and the base of her thighs tempted me to look at them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In other words, Neneka&#8217;s current equipment was a cat ear nurse swimsuit apron. She had increased her attack power by multiplying attributes and attributes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would like to take the time to ask her where she had learnt these naughty tricks&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8212; &#8220;Who taught you how to seduce me like this?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8212; &#8220;Oh&#8230; it&#8217;s&#8230; a secret&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8212; &#8220;Oh, well? Neneka is a cat now, isn&#8217;t she? So, she should end her sentences with nyan&#8230; right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8212; &#8220;Hah, I&#8217;m embarrassed nyan&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Come on, say it. Who taught you these naughty tricks? If you won&#8217;t tell me, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to ask Neneka&#8217;s body?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8212; &#8220;Nya&#8230; Oh-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no.&#8221;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… No. Too dangerous, return to the real world, now. Back to the real world.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah. That was close. Something was about to start in my brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Humans were reeds that think, so we couldn&#8217;t help but think. We were free to think with our minds.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was important to know when to show it and when not to, and that choice could make or break one&#8217;s life.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was Neneka&#8217;s lover and brother-in-law. Even if I had lustful imaginations in my mind, I would never lose my gentlemanly façade.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Pure heart. The pure heart&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka&#8230; Umm, what&#8217;s with your outfit?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka spun around on the spot, as if to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad you asked.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What&#8217;s this? For a moment it looked like something was on her back&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Today, I wanted to do something that was just like a girlfriend, so I tried my best. Dinner will be ready soon, so please take a bath first and wait in the living room.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you&#8230; Well, I bought some roll cakes, so let&#8217;s eat them together for dessert.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m so glad! I actually didn&#8217;t know what to do about dessert and was wondering what I could make. I&#8217;ll put this in the fridge.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I almost lost my head when I saw the little devil&#8217;s wings on both sides of the clasp of Neneka&#8217;s swimsuit… as she received the roll cakes and turned on her heel to go back to the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Was she going to put even a small devil in there!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just before passing through the living room door, Neneka turned around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah! I wanted to ask you, Daiki, do you like&#8230; knee-high socks?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Knee-high&#8230;? I like it&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay! I&#8217;ll put them on then!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka disappeared into the living room smiling. Probably heading for the kitchen in the back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Wait a minute, Neneka. Was she going to wear even knee-high socks in her current state?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If she wore knee-high socks, the naked element of the naked apron would be diminished. However, if knee-high socks were worn, an absolute area would be created between the apron and knee-high socks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a very difficult line to know where the goodness was…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Before we talked about that&#8230; she was taking in too many attributes!!! She was already causing a traffic jam of attributes!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I understood. I knew how Neneka thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure that Neneka wanted to do something girly for me, so she looked up on the internet or something about how to dress to please boys.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That&#8217;s as far as it went.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The problem was that she took all the elements she learned there that boys liked and put them all together and wore them all at once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be honest, I was quite happy to know that Neneka thought very hard about it in her own way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I had the chance to ask Neneka to do something for me someday, I would have liked to see Neneka with cat ears, Neneka as a little devil, and even a naked apron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Though I didn&#8217;t think all those dreams would come true at once.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It&#8217;s versatile and&#8230; exciting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I felt that the traffic jam of attributes halved the pounding effect of each inidual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That was a bit of a shame.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, but the state in which the attraction of the attributes clashed with each other, halving the pounding effect, was a good thing for me, who had to get through this situation in a gentlemanly way, right? With my mind perplexed by the traffic jam of attributes, I would end this evening&#8217;s dinner in a healthy atmosphere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After washing my hands, showering and changing my clothes while calming my mind, I entered the living room and settled down at the dining room table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luncheon mats were already laid out on the tables, and chopsticks and cups were provided. Usually we ate next to each other, but today our parents weren&#8217;t here, so our positions were facing each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The kitchen smelled good and I could hear the pleasant sounds of Neneka cooking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I would like to help, but she told me to wait, and I wondered if I should be mature enough to wait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I fidgeted in my chair, Neneka brought me some barley tea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Neneka&#8217;s equipment included more, knee-high socks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;The pasta will be boiled soon, so just wait a little longer.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Neneka bent forward to pour me a cup of barley tea, I could see Neneka&#8217;s marshmallow breasts through the gap in her apron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My face heated up as I remembered the soft feel of those breasts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; What was for dinner?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I asked Neneka, mending a face that said that I wasn&#8217;t thinking of anything unnecessary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Neneka&#8217;s special cold pasta! I used to make it for my dad in summer because he would be so happy. Look forward to it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nekomimi nurse swimsuit apron little devil knee-high Neneka disappeared into the kitchen again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I drank the barley tea Neneka poured for me and exhaled strongly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, I thought that the attribute traffic jam would cut the effect in half, but there was enough stimulus to drive me to the brink of death.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let&#8217;s calm down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let&#8217;s shake off those miscellaneous thoughts and destroy the troubles before Neneka completed the dish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that in mind, I started to doze off with the fatigue of the day&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure what to say. She wants to do something that&#8217;s just like a girlfriend, but you don&#8217;t want to enjoy it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Huh, Neneka?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next thing I knew, I was summoned to the world of annoyance in my brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, this must be a dream. It must be a dream.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because in front of me was Neneka dressed as a little devil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was wearing an incendiary black outfit and moved her little devil&#8217;s wings on her back. With a black arrow-like tail as well, she was a perfect little devil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; I&#8217;m not Neneka! I&#8217;m Neneka, the little devil, the representative of the troubles in your brain. The truth is, Daiki likes dresses like this, doesn&#8217;t he? That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m dressed like this.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bothersome representative of my brain spoke to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it because this was my ideal Neneka?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;It wasn&#8217;t good. Even if it was just a dream, it was better for me not to see Neneka like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to run away, but the little devil Neneka, who was chasing me, hugged me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey&#8230;? Do you know what it feels like when a woman wears a naked apron?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;That&#8217;s absurd.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;The message is that the real main dish is her, even if she pretends to be cooking a delicious dish!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How&#8217;s that possible&#8230;? There&#8217;s no way that Neneka would ask me that so blatantly. She was a pure girl who got happy just by being hugged.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, do you know why she&#8217;s wearing cat ears? It&#8217;s a message to touch her more&#8230; She wants you to pet her, all over&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little devil Neneka seduced me with her troubled expression.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;The skinship she&#8217;s had isn&#8217;t enough, so she&#8217;s trying to be a cat and spoil you! Can&#8217;t you give her something cute&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;We&#8217;ve been skinny-dipping for a while now, but it&#8217;s not enough&#8230;?</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hugging isn&#8217;t enough, so she wants to take your relationship a step further tonight without your parents being home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If that was true&#8230; I should live up to Neneka&#8217;s expectations, right&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;… Wait, wait, wait. It&#8217;s no use worrying about that. There&#8217;s no way that Neneka was wearing cat ears while thinking of climbing up the ladder of adulthood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka might have found out that guys liked cat ears, but she probably just thought, &#8220;That&#8217;s right. Cat ears are so cute, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; That was about all she would have thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So you don&#8217;t want to do anything?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Yeah. I don&#8217;t want to do anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t act like a gentleman, it&#8217;s useless. I know what you really want to do. You really want cat ear nurse Neneka to scratch your ears, don&#8217;t you? You want to pretend to be spoiled and rub up against her thighs and look at her boobs from below, right? She&#8217;s going to take off just the bottom of her swimsuit with the apron on, and then you&#8217;re going to&#8230; the shy Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Hey-hey-hey-hey! Stop it! I don&#8217;t think so! I&#8217;m not thinking about that!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Be honest! I&#8217;m not your enemy. I&#8217;m your ally. I was born from the troubles in your brain, so it&#8217;s useless to deny it!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh my God. What&#8217;s going on with my bother control system!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps the little devil Neneka was born as a result of my inability to suppress my desires, which materialized in my brain. The little devil Neneka tried to make me aware of my desires, which I myself tried to pretend not to notice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I let something like this live in my heart, was I going to lose to my&#8230; vexations and step out of the way of a gentleman one day&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Look&#8230; you look so hungry!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lust on the face of Neneka, the little devil disrupted the order in my brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You don’t want to eat only dinner, right? You want to eat Neneka who was dressed up with an innocent face and ready to deceive men, don&#8217;t you? She didn&#8217;t think that she could dress like that and not have anything happen to her, right? Why don&#8217;t you teach her how to really please a man with her hands?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bothersome people who were watching the little devil Neneka and I from a distance were buzzing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little devil Neneka chuckled and walked away from me to one of the bothersome ones.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little devil Neneka stroked the cheek of the vexation with her finger. With just that, the vexation cried out, &#8220;Little devil Neneka-sama,&#8221; and began to lick little devil Neneka&#8217;s feet.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little devil Neneka didn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She breathed into the ears of the troublesome people at hand, and in an instant, they were boned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One by one, the afflicted began to worship the little devil Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This person was dangerous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It could manipulate my afflictions and turn me into a beast that moved according to its desires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The panicked reasoners went to defeat the little devil Neneka, but one by one, they were transformed into troubles by the kisses of the little devil Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No one could stop the little devil Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My brain&#8217;s power structure began to tilt towards vexation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to hug cat ear nurse swimsuit apron knee-high Neneka. I wanted to stroke her all over and make her raise her sweet voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to put up with anything, you&#8217;re tempted&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Don&#8217;t&#8230; be stupid! Morita Daiki isn&#8217;t a man who could be&#8230; tempted like that!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was about to shake off my troubles with my spirit.. when I heard a clang and a sound that seemed like something was hitting me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s voice, &#8220;Hot,&#8221; woke me up, and all my troubles fizzled out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instantly pulled back from my dream to reality, I reflexively headed for the kitchen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Neneka!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hot water was splashed around a pot on the stove.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka clasped her hands in front of her chest, her face contorted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I startled you. The pasta was boiling and when I tried to move the pot, my hat almost fell into the pot&#8230; and I panicked and almost dropped the pot&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Did it get you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Just a little&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s cool it right off.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took Neneka&#8217;s hand and cooled it with running water from the tap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It appeared to be reddish in some places. I hoped that it wouldn&#8217;t leave a mark&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is there anything else?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. The rest is around the apron, so it&#8217;s okay&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was horrified to see Neneka&#8217;s outfit again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If a pot of boiling water had been dropped on the floor, she would have been in serious trouble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I should have stopped Neneka from cooking in such a revealing outfit. It was easy to get burned when hot water or oil was splashed .</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Totally&#8230; I was the worst.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn&#8217;t the time to be thinking about how cute Neneka looked while cooking in her swimsuit apron.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I should have told her that it was dangerous and that she should get dressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Does it hurt?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s just a little redness, and it will go away soon.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good. Fortunately, Neneka&#8217;s burns seemed to be minor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull up the pasta.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; But today I&#8217;m&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But it still tingles a little, doesn&#8217;t it? Take it easy.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;A&#8230; rigato&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka looked depressed, and her hands were still cold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Beside her, I pulled the pasta out of the hot water, rinsed it in cold water, and then drained it thoroughly after it was put in ice water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do I just mix it with the ingredients in the bowl?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; and olive oil&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the bowl contained cut-up mini-tomatoes and other ingredients, and the olive oil was measured out, it was easy to mix them with the pasta.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to do the serving?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Neneka?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t do girlfriendly things properly&#8230; again. I wonder if I&#8217;m not cut out to be a girlfriend&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I looked at Neneka&#8217;s profile, her eyes were moist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t do girlfriendly things, again.&#8221; … What was she talking about? She was talking like she couldn&#8217;t do girlfriendly-like things before&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And why was she so obsessed with &#8220;girlfriendly-ness?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Neneka is my girlfriend, so I don&#8217;t think that you need to go out of your way to try to make you look like a girlfriend&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I patted her head to comfort her, Neneka became more and more shaken. I wondered if it was&#8230; counterproductive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go change first? I&#8217;ll take care of the serving and clean up.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka didn&#8217;t say anything. She looked like she was about to cry and just hanged her head in dejection.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was going on&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is there anything you want me to do?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I asked this with the sole intention of cheering up Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka finally opened her mouth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do anything&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If it will make Neneka feel better, I&#8217;ll do everything possible to help you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Well, Onii-chan&#8230; I&#8217;m going to take a bath before dinner, so help me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s shoulders slumped and she looked at me with watery eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough… I&#8217;m just a little sister. I&#8217;ve stopped trying to be like a girlfriend today&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Help me get dressed&#8230; and feed me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, what happened all of a sudden?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka is your younger sister. If Onii-chan doesn&#8217;t help me, I can&#8217;t do anything&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After being so concerned about girlfriendly-ness just a few minutes ago, Neneka&#8217;s sister mode suddenly went into full throttle.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who was heartbroken by the accident, wanted me to spoil her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll do anything for me, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That&#8217;s&#8230; I said I would try to do as much as possible, but was this as far as it was possible to go with my efforts?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, is already a high school student, so even if you are my younger sister I can&#8217;t do that, so please take a bath by yourself.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then Neneka will stay here for a long time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka sat gymnastically in the corner of the kitchen and pouted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I let it go, I really thought that she was going to stay here.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter how much it was summer, if she stayed in an air-conditioned house in her swimsuit apron, she was going to catch a cold&#8230; and if I didn&#8217;t want that to happen, I would just have to do what she wanted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you regret asking your Onii-chan to help you take a bath?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8212; Yeah&#8230; she was sure about wanting to do this!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ticking of the clock sounded awfully loud.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Every time the needle moved forward, I felt like I was being rushed to make a decision quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since I didn&#8217;t move, Neneka didn&#8217;t move either. If I wouldn&#8217;t move, I was sure that Neneka wouldn&#8217;t move either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both parties remained silent, and time passed unnecessarily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was supposed to be right before dinner time, but it wasn&#8217;t quite dinner time, but my stomach was about to growl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was getting hungry. There was nothing I could do. I guess I should go into&#8230; Onii-chan mode and get through this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was a little desperate, but I didn&#8217;t know if I would be embarrassed and cry later.. I’m Neneka&#8217;s Onii-chan. I’m Neneka&#8217;s Onii-chan. I&#8217;m Neneka&#8217;s Onii-chan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I chanted three times in my mind and exhaled with a huff.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All right. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I understand&#8230; I don&#8217;t want Neneka to stay put, so I&#8217;ll do as Neneka says. What should I do first?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hold me and take me to the bath.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wait.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew that she was in sister mode, but how old was her set age? Five years old?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who craved to be held, waited for me with her arms outstretched, not getting up from the floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew that her pampering level was exploding, but had she forgotten what she was wearing right now? If I hold Neneka in her swimsuit apron, I would be touching her bare skin all over the place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hold me, Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka looked at me up and down and asked me to do something for her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;What did she want from me&#8230; while wearing a cat ear nurse&#8217;s hat and a swimsuit apron, asking me to hug her so adorably?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My alarm went off. But I had to be in Onii-chan mode now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ok, calm down&#8230;!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That’s right. Let&#8217;s just think of Neneka as being five years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was my younger sister of five years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She loved her Onii-chan and wanted to be pampered. She wanted me to hold her, bathe with her, and help her get dressed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But nothing was wrong. Because Neneka was only five years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For his little sweet sister, Onii-chan could do anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay. Yes, I&#8217;ll hold you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I picked up Neneka in a heap. Then, my vision was blocked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I tried to hold her in my arms with the image of holding up a five years old child, I couldn&#8217;t see in front of me. The only thing blocking my front was Neneka&#8217;s lower chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soft. It was pitch black, but I could see happiness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s eyes suddenly became higher and she clung to my head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My sister, whose proportions were unbelievable for a five years old child, pressed her body against mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… No, she wasn&#8217;t five years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The smoothness and elasticity of Neneka&#8217;s thighs, which I had been touching, were definitely those of a fresh high school girl.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m going to the bathroom&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hiya&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I shifted Neneka&#8217;s body a bit and managed to see where I was going. Let&#8217;s go to the bath like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I arrived at the bathroom&#8217;s dressing room and put Neneka down, Neneka looked a little red.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was she ashamed of after coming up with the idea herself?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, please undress me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to do that yourself&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka&#8217;s hand, which had been splashed with hot water earlier, hurt just a little too much to take it off.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see… Then Onii-chan will undress you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was my younger sister. My five years old sister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I told myself so, and quickly removed Neneka&#8217;s apron. Then, I went behind Neneka and took off her swimsuit as well. I also took off her white knee-high socks, leaving Neneka naked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>No matter how many times I saw it, I still thought that Neneka was beautiful.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s skin was white and smooth, and her body had beautiful, feminine curves. I turned my face away myself, almost staring down to her buttocks, and refrained myself from viewing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was free to look at her as I pleased, but for my own mental health, it was important not to look at her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Now then, take a bath.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you going to wash me? Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She didn&#8217;t turn around completely, but looked over her shoulders at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her flowing eyes were sexy and heat welled up from the center of my body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Do I do the washing too?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Because Neneka is your little sister, she can&#8217;t do anything on her own.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wasn&#8217;t there something wrong with being a younger sister who couldn&#8217;t do anything by herself?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All over the world, there were younger sisters who stood on their own splendidly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then seeing me wondering what I should say to her, Neneka&#8217;s eyes began to well up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, would you like me to wash myself? When I move my hand, it hurts just a little bit where I got burned earlier&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had a weakness for these eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Neneka&#8217;s wistful eyes stared into mine, I felt like granting her whatever she wished for.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The unconditional love in me made me want to give up&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh God&#8230; I get it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She must not catch a cold by taking off everything and then arguing this and that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I was going to get cocked in the end, just get cocked already.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was a sweet brother and I couldn&#8217;t resist my sweet sister&#8217;s selfishness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took off my clothes, but only my upper body, and lightly pushed the naked Neneka off her back and moved to the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My sister was five years old, my sister was five years old, my sister was five years old&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I casted a spell within my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In front of me, sitting in a bath chair, was a five years old Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay, I&#8217;ll wash your hair first.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Please.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took the shampoo, lathered it up, and washed Neneka&#8217;s hair.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was my first time washing someone&#8217;s hair. I was confused as to how to wash hair that was much longer than my own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t complain if I don&#8217;t wash it properly.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With great difficulty, I shampooed and rinsed her off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is there anything I&#8217;m missing?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I called out to her, imitating a hairdresser, Neneka replied happily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, next take care of the rinse and treat, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew that it wouldn&#8217;t end with a shampoo.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My five years old sister was a precocious, girlie girl. She was as particular about her hair as a high school girl was about her hair, which was a problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Now, is that enough for the hair?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it… finally her&#8230; body?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s back was wet from the hot water that flowed through her hair when I washed it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yup. Let&#8217;s wash her up before I thought about anything else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I put some soap on a body towel and made a firmer lather. I washed Neneka&#8217;s beautiful skin mindlessly and carefully so as not to damage it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Why use a body towel when washing with bare hands is the gentlest way to clean her skin?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I should have been working mindlessly, but there was someone speaking to my spirit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, the little devil that I met in a dream when I was slumbering while waiting for dinner, reappeared in my brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Dear little devil Neneka! Little devil Neneka-sama!&#8221; and the vexations in me started to make noise with excitement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Would you please get out of my way? Bare hands to wash a person&#8217;s body is weird.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I replied in my mind to my own vexation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed that through my many battles against severe vexations that had come to me since I moved in with Neneka, I had finally become able to communicate with my vexations. Perhaps I would be enlightened when I would defeat it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you really want to wash her that way?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damn… couldn&#8217;t argue with that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little devil Neneka was the incarnation of the desires that existed in me. She knew more about my desires than I did… This guy was a powerful enemy. But it wasn&#8217;t as if I could act on everything that I wanted to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was human beings who developed their brains, harbored insatiable desires, and at the same time had the heart to discipline their desires.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whatever desires I had, save them if they weren&#8217;t the right action for the occasion. I wanted to always be a person with that kind of rationality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Even though my head thought so, the troubles inside me had been buzzing since the appearance of the little devil Neneka, and my mind was restless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As an older brother, I was trying to compose an image of washing the body of a five years old Neneka, but I couldn&#8217;t concentrate.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little devil Neneka giggled as she lovingly caressed the gathered troubles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you just push her down? She didn&#8217;t think that you wouldn’t do anything to her after she took off her clothes and invited you to take a bath with her. Neneka is inviting you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The very whisper of the devil. Did the devil dwell in my own heart?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka was just in sister mode due to the frustration of not being able to do what she would have liked to do as a girlfriend. I just responded as an older brother. Nothing more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I nonchalantly washed Neneka&#8217;s arms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh my God, you&#8217;re so serious! It might be nice to be serious and a gentleman, but if Neneka was trying her best to develop a relationship with Daiki while your parents were away, could you… ignore her?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was shocked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No way, no way, no way, but if Neneka was really trying to develop a relationship with me and was in the midst of seduction… could I let that slide with my brother&#8217;s response?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To let it slide was as much a sin as to trample on Neneka&#8217;s courage and feelings…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The bothersome people agreed with the little devil Neneka, saying, &#8220;Yes, yes, yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mind started to wobble.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In front of me was a defenseless Neneka who was undressed and having her body washed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the shy and pure Neneka went to such lengths, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if she had other intentions. Maybe she was just hiding her embarrassment when she said that she was in sister mode, and she still really wanted to do something girlfriendly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8212; I see… I knew it. That&#8217;s right… Neneka wouldn&#8217;t invite me to take a bath with no intention of doing so either…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If that was the case, I would better start by washing Neneka with my bare hands, right?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t listen to that little devil! Neneka doesn&#8217;t want that!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What appeared with a pop in my brain was a small, adorable Neneka dressed in an angelic outfit. She was surrounded by a shimmering light, and the troubles that touched her were purified and transformed into reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The angel Neneka smiled at the reasoners who were petrified and muttering, &#8220;What in the world am I… doing here?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing that smile, some of the vexations turned into reason again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The angel Neneka purified my mental world of troubles…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You… Angel Neneka!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir! I won&#8217;t let you have your way anymore!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In my brain, Neneka, the angel and Neneka, the little devil began to spark up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a surprise, a friend of reason was born in my brain.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was thankful for this development because when the little devil Neneka was born in my brain, I was worried that I would eventually give in to temptation and do something to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure that the angel Neneka would save me from the little devil Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And it should be possible to transform all of my vexations into reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki. Ignore the little devil Neneka, and wash Neneka!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Oh, I&#8217;ll take care of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My head cleared up and I no longer thought anything of seeing a naked Neneka. Come on, let&#8217;s wash my lovely little sister quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I washed Neneka from her neck to her collarbone, washed her back, and then from her back to her waist.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good. Now the next step was the front of her… body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then.. my hands stopped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Wait. Was it okay to wash Neneka&#8217;s breasts?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter how much I tried to fool myself, the Neneka in front of me was not five years old, but a high school student. Her body was fresh with two rich rounded hills rising above her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I washed her, I would touch them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What are you waiting for? Wash them quickly! If you stay in the bathroom too long and catch a cold, you&#8217;ll be in big trouble!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I stopped my hands, I got a reprimand from the angel Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hmm… I guess I&#8217;ll just have to not think…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just give it a quick wash before I felt anything. Quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I regained my grip on the body towel and plunged into Neneka&#8217;s marshmallow bust zone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just stroked it lightly to wash it, but I could feel the fluffy feeling and started to sweat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Mmm&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurriedly took my hands away from Neneka when she let out a breath that caught on my nose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry, did that hurt?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Uh, no! It doesn&#8217;t hurt. I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that I was more forceful and painful than I thought I was, but apparently I wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I regained my composure and entered the marshmallow bust zone again, Neneka let out another &#8220;Mmm…&#8221; breath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hey, really, it was all right, right? I was okay with this, right? I wasn&#8217;t making a mistake, was I?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Look, don&#8217;t worry about how soft her breasts are, just focus on getting them clean!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Wait, angel Neneka. I&#8217;m definitely not thinking about the softness of Neneka&#8217;s breasts. Please stop making misleading remarks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Whatever it is, wash it! Especially in the underbust area, where dirt tends to accumulate, so wash it well!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait. Don&#8217;t try to get me to wash the parts that were hard to wash!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But if you don&#8217;t wash it, Neneka&#8217;s skin might get into trouble! In summer, she is especially prone to sweat rash!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Damn… if Neneka gets a sweat rash because I didn&#8217;t wash her properly today, that would be a big problem.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had to wash it. For the sake of Neneka, I would wash her underbust well!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Mmm… n… n&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Angel Neneka, angel Neneka. I think that Neneka is breathing strangely glamorously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a little ticklish. Don&#8217;t worry about it, wash it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The angel Neneka told me not to worry about it and to wash it, but Neneka&#8217;s breath was so colorful that I thought that the troublesome people were rustling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The angel Neneka was supposed to be there to calm my vexations, but was this what she was supposed to do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ticklish places are sexual zones.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here was Neneka, the little devil, who blurted out miscellaneous stuff that stimulated virginity.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Dear little devil Neneka! So you are saying that Neneka is feeling it right now?&#8221; And the troubles swarmed around Neneka, the little devil.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, Neneka is feeling it right now! Daiki, touch her more. She doesn&#8217;t need a body towel… Hands, she wants your hands&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Shut up! Little devil Neneka! It&#8217;s a disgrace to wash with hands! Neneka is in sister mode now! You must not break Onii-chan mode! You must not betray Neneka&#8217;s trust!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The little devil Neneka and the angel Neneka were fighting in my brain. Both of them weren&#8217;t giving an inch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was hoping that the angel Neneka would appear and make it easier for me to control my brain and stay calm, but instead I felt that it had increased the noise in my brain…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I think that it’s enough for the… breasts…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I had been distracted by the world in my brain, I had only been washing Neneka&#8217;s breasts all this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka also inadvertently broke out of sister mode and called me by name and… I wondered if she thought that I was a pervert who was enjoying her breasts under the guise of washing them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was kind of dreadfully tired. But it wasn&#8217;t all over yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I quickly washed Neneka&#8217;s legs and rinsed off the lather. All that remained was for Neneka to soak in the bathtub.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go change my clothes while Neneka soaks in the bathtub.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, okay…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had nothing to do while Neneka was soaking in the bathtub. So I went to my room and started changing my wet clothes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Alone in my room, I became a little calmer and the image of the little devil Neneka and the angel Neneka fighting in my brain disappeared. I was totally overwhelmed by my imagination and delusion…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ahhh, I&#8217;m so tired…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I managed to get through this I didn&#8217;t think that I would be so tired if I just washed other people&#8217;s bodies. The reason I was tired was because the person I washed was Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Mental fatigue was greater than physical fatigue.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I wondered how Neneka felt when she let me wash her body…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if Neneka had noticed that I was in agony while washing her, going back and forth between vexation and rationality.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Part of me felt like she didn&#8217;t notice, but part of me also felt like what if she did? … Neneka wasn&#8217;t five years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps it was because I was tired, but I felt bewildered about Neneka&#8217;s harsh mission of making an adolescent boy wash her body.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But no. It wasn&#8217;t cool to take this frustration out on her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I should have refused from the beginning instead of complaining. One doesn&#8217;t accept a job and then complain about it afterwards.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Deep breaths for a change. I moved my extremities wide and stretched, then headed downstairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I returned to the bathroom&#8217;s changing room, Neneka called out to me from the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Can I get out now, Onii-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spread a bath towel and waited for Neneka to come out of the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Neneka was horrified when she opened the door and came out, her white skin slightly tinted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did she have enough trust in me to let me see her like this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or could she do it because she didn&#8217;t know what kind of fight was going on in my brain…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The heat that came out of the bathroom rehashed the feelings that I had tried to forget earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, can I change my clothes?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was a bad sister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Real sisters didn&#8217;t say &#8220;Can I change my clothes?&#8221; with such a sexy face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I quickly went behind Neneka and wrapped her in a bath towel to wipe her off, I was tempted to just hug her… and I did.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, Onii-chan…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Before I could even think about whether this was a bad idea, my arms were holding Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through the bath towel, I felt Neneka&#8217;s soft body and the heat that seemed to ooze out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The scent of the soap filled my lungs. I felt a shudder in my throat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wasn&#8217;t a vampire or anything, just a human, but I had the urge to bite her gently and kiss her hard.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I kissed her hard and strong, would I make a mark on her white neck?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I put my lips on her neck and exhaled, Neneka jerked and shivered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Sorry. I think I got a little dizzy…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What? Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I leaned my forehead on Neneka&#8217;s shoulder, and she panicked when she thought that I was sick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You sit there! I&#8217;ll change by myself! Oh, you can go ahead and cool off in the living room!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; so I guess I&#8217;ll go to the living room first.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right. I&#8217;m sorry I made you work so hard. I&#8217;m going to go change my clothes and dry my hair.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;All right, see you&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took her word for it and decided to leave the washroom first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I walked out into the hallway and headed straight for the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I opened the door, the air cooled by the air conditioner gently welcomed me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It was dangerous&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t make it to the couch and crouched on the floor as soon as I closed the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was close. It was the most dangerous thing I had ever done since I started living with her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I almost&#8230; attacked Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all, it was absurd to think that Neneka was five years old.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was the one who undressed her and washed her in the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was no way that I could put up with it beautifully if I tried to put up with a lot of things at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I… really liked Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I loved her, I was also willing to hold back to death to avoid crossing the line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But because I loved her, I couldn&#8217;t just sit back and do nothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Haaaaaaaaahhhh, what am I doing&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt a little sorry for myself for not strongly objecting to Neneka, who had begun spoiling me in sister mode, since a few minutes earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;About ten minutes later, Neneka changed her clothes, dried her hair, and came into the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, it was time for dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At first, Neneka and I had our luncheon mats facing each other, but now they were placed side by side as usual. Neneka&#8217;s seat was to my left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Neneka was sitting with her belly button facing me, offering me a piece of pasta wrapped around a fork.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki, ahh&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ahh…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Mmm, is it good?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fwiw, I&#8217;m very excited about it…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. Good for you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was now receiving an &#8220;Ahh&#8221; from Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I saw Neneka move next to me, I thought she was going to &#8220;Ahh&#8221; me in sister mode, but I was wrong.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, Neneka was worried about me getting dizzy in the washroom and was concerned about my physical condition.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;The dizziness is gone now, and I can feed myself, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But&#8230; I&#8217;ve caused you a lot of trouble today, and I&#8217;ve been selfish about you giving me a bath, so I would like to apologize&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka shushed. I wondered if she had reflected on her actions while she was changing her clothes and drying her hair alone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I was happy to have Neneka &#8220;Ahh&#8221; me, but I was a little ticklish and shy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had regained my composure and wished that I could eat it by myself, but since I didn&#8217;t want Neneka to mess around again, I decided to let her &#8220;Ahh&#8221; me quietly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But at least once&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, ahh!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s face turned bright red when I &#8220;Ahh’ed&#8221; her&#8230; Her reaction was cute.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; you scared me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I wanted to feed Neneka in sister mode, and I wanted to try it just once.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little embarrassing to have someone say &#8220;Ahh&#8221; to you, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Can I do it more for you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No! I prefer to give Daiki &#8220;Ahh.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really? No more sister mode?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah… Daiki got sick, so I&#8217;m done for the day. I can&#8217;t let you keep spoiling me, I have to be firm too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really, don&#8217;t worry. I was hungry and that might have been the reason I got dizzy while standing up. I ate the delicious dinner Neneka made for me, so I&#8217;m fine now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. But&#8230; we&#8217;ll sleep together today.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sleep with Neneka? Why?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Was this already coming to cross the line, completely?</p>

<p>&#8220;By sleeping together, do you mean sleeping in the same bed?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about what if Daiki&#8217;s health suddenly gets bad again&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the expression on Neneka&#8217;s face, I sensed that she was really worried about me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah, even though Neneka didn&#8217;t have any ulterior motives, I was sorry that my ulterior motives reacted one by one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you want to sleep with me tonight?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh my God, what was that cuteness? I thought that I could eat three bowls of rice just from this line.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was an idiot. I knew that it was a thorny road ahead, but I couldn&#8217;t resist the temptation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I still hadn&#8217;t learned my lesson, even though I had just regretted trying to wash her in the bath earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had an easy imagination that it could work as long as we were clothed and didn&#8217;t stick too closely to each other&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I loved her, I wanted to be with her as much as possible, even if I had to put up with… something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The feeling of being in love was really tricky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This feeling itself was like an instinct, which couldn&#8217;t be controlled by reason.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… I get it…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes well, when I&#8217;ve finished putting everything away, I&#8217;ll take my pillow and come to your room!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka smiled at me as I agreed to sleep with her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The only thing there would be was the feeling of being happy to be with her at night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I was so disappointed. I wished that I could be as pure as Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was so sad that I had gotten dirty.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, a famous poet&#8217;s song came to my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;If it was me, it wouldn&#8217;t be a light snowfall that fell today, it would be a bother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That night. Neneka and I slept on my bed, hand in hand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sleeping together in the same bed was something that we could only do on nights that our parents weren’t home. I thought that I had experienced something really good today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I tried sleeping with the innocent Neneka, she would fall asleep comfortably while I would stay awake and wouldn&#8217;t be able to sleep at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to tell myself that I could have predicted this situation in advance, but I had to say that one never knew if things would turn out as expected until he tried.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;But I seriously couldn&#8217;t sleep&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had summer classes, I wandered around until I got home, and I was tired from all the happenings after I got home&#8230; I thought that I would be able to sleep surprisingly well even with Neneka next to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had no choice but to gently remove my hand from Neneka&#8217;s grip and lay down on the bed to read a reference book, relying on the faint light of the room lights.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I always got sleepy when I tried to study. So I thought that studying would help me sleep, &#8220;I must be a genius,&#8221; was what I thought… but it was funny. I didn&#8217;t get sleepy at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka&#8217;s sleeping breath coming from next to me. The sweet scent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if I tried not to care about it, it bothered me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At times like this, I probably thought about going to sleep, and then it made me get even more sleepless.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;If I couldn&#8217;t sleep, it was a good thing. I could study.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I continued to roll up my reference book until the date changed, Neneka moved uneasily next to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki? Can&#8217;t&#8230; sleep?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to wake you up. I was just trying to study a little and then go to bed.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; Great job, Daiki. Good, good.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was giving me a good head massage with her mellow eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; You&#8217;re great, Daiki. You&#8217;re always strong, you&#8217;re great&#8230; Because you&#8217;re always strong, that&#8217;s why I always end up wanting to be spoiled by you&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that she was very complimentary, but she seemed a little sad at the end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Why are you apologizing?&#8221; I was about to ask, but Neneka slipped closer and I was at a loss for words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was soft, warm, like a big cat&#8230; and cute&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I let my head go, Neneka rubbed her face against me like a real cat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki, I love you&#8230; and I want you to always be with me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as she said that, I heard, &#8220;zzzzz,&#8221; regular sleeping breaths.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It looked like she fell asleep&#8230; Maybe she was sleepwalking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I wondered if she liked me enough to say &#8220;I love you&#8221; even when she was sleepwalking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I turned off the room lights and closed my eyes as I hugged Neneka who was rubbing up against me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; I love you too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The sleepiness that finally came was slowly stopping my thought switch.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I didn&#8217;t have the strength to think about anything else, I could only feel the comfort of holding Neneka in my arms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I wished that I could always be satisfied with just hugging her like this&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I envied Neneka who could say &#8220;I&#8217;m so happy&#8221; just by hugging me and being wrapped in my scent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to learn from Neneka&#8217;s humility when she said that she was &#8220;greedy&#8221; for wanting to get more and more attached to me even though we were together so much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was the only one who was always greedy and fumbled around on my own.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I had to be firm so that I wouldn&#8217;t make Neneka sad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We would act as close siblings for now and pretend that we started dating when we were college students and live on our own. If we were trustworthy while we were living together, our parents would probably be more accepting of our relationship, even if we said we started dating when we were in college.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So everyone could peacefully accept happiness. Everything should go smoothly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now it&#8217;s just a matter of&#8230; me putting up with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just had to be patient now in order to be with Neneka for a long time to come.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good night, Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I whispered, and Neneka giggled happily in her sleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I, too, fell asleep.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next morning, when I woke up to the sunlight streaming through the cracks in the curtains, Neneka was still asleep, clinging to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I patted her head, thinking about how cute she was, and Neneka rubbed up against me even more.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sticking to me, Neneka moved around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt my emergency light go on with a creaking vibration.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, that&#8217;s not good. Neneka, in the morning, I was experiencing some male hardening phenomenon. If she was that squirmy&#8230;!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;? Is there something in the futon&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka woke up due to a strange feeling and explored the futon with a sleepy face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurriedly pulled back my hips to prevent Neneka&#8217;s hand from reaching my volcano. However, Neneka seemed to be curious about the secret inside the futon, and proceeded to search further into the futon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, Neneka&#8217;s hand reached the unexplored region.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One sheet of cloth separated us, and beyond that was my volcano, hot and furious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That&#8217;s what… Neneka had been holding mercilessly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hah-ah-ah-ah-ah.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a surprise!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>An unspoken cry erupted from my mouth at the unexpected contact from the innocent adventurer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, that&#8217;s umm, my volcano, the one that you shouldn&#8217;t be holding so tightly&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If she was careless, it would erupt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki&#8217;s volcano?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka tilted her head, huffed about three seconds later, and took her hand off my volcano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry! There was something hard in the futon and I thought my or your phone got mixed up in it&#8230;! I can&#8217;t believe your son has turned into a volcano, did I do something to you while I was asleep?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka panicked with a gasp.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She was worried that she had unknowingly done something to stimulate my son.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it was possible that my son could be transformed just by getting into bed with Neneka, but this time it wasn&#8217;t because of her&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Neneka didn&#8217;t do anything. It&#8217;s just that men are creatures that get volcanic activity in the morning and their volcano get active, so&#8230; don&#8217;t worry about it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, I understand&#8230; Sorry, I held it too tight.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I held my breath and clenched my teeth as Neneka gently eased my volcano into place, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;… That concern was… &nbsp;useless…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… Young lady, you looked like you got it, but you had no idea about the ecology of the male volcano. I was sure that it hurt when you squeezed him hard, so you wanted to give him a good squeeze to ease the pain, but what you were doing was wrong. This was something that even the volcano&#8217;s owner&#8217;s manual said not to do unless one was ready to do it, with a warning mark.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to distract myself, but the tone of my mind&#8217;s voice went haywire.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; Shall I get breakfast ready for you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, thanks&#8230; I&#8217;d like toast&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You can wait in the living room first while I make the toast.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A red-faced Neneka left the room with a patter of footsteps.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I breathed out a sigh of relief when Neneka was no longer in the room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents were scheduled to return around 9:00 p.m. Until then, we would still be alone in this house.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While eating toast for breakfast, Neneka and I were having an awkward conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I have another summer class today, but I think that I&#8217;ll clean the house when I get home. I want to clean the living room before our parents come home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll go shopping for ingredients for tonight&#8217;s dinner. Our parents will be home late, and they&#8217;ll probably buy their own food, so it&#8217;ll just be for the two of us, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll send a message to my dad later telling him that we&#8217;ll take care of our own food.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay, thank you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; about dinner, just something easy to eat, okay? Or we could buy some prepared food.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see. Then&#8230; if there&#8217;s some kind of delicious-looking dish at the supermarket I&#8217;ll go with that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Somehow I was embarrassed to have this conversation, maybe it was because of my volcano.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or was it because the scene of spending the night in the same bed and eating together the next morning resembled the picture of a man and a woman who had spent the night together? I was a little embarrassed to look at Neneka&#8217;s face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed to be the same for Neneka, and we were conversing with each other while we were shifting our gazes slightly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, how&#8217;s your summer course going?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good thing that I was able to learn the parts of the course that I wasn&#8217;t good at&#8230; How about you, Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&#8230; good too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; I feel a lot of pressure because my cram school teacher says loudly every time how many days we have left until the exam, but I hope that I&#8217;ll be able to do my best there and get closer to passing the exam&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Both Neneka and I were aiming for the same college. I was aiming for the sociology department, and Neneka was aiming for the literature department. We happened to be attracted to the same university even though our departments were different. Last year, while working as members of the library committee, we often talked about the university we both wanted to go to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Back then, I fantasized, &#8220;When I&#8217;ll become a college student, I&#8217;ll get to know Neneka even better and we might even live together&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before that however, we had to move in together, so I guess one really never knew what life had in store for him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You know&#8230; it&#8217;s the day our parents are coming home&#8230; and I would appreciate it if you would clean up in normal clothes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes! Of course! I won&#8217;t do housework looking like that anymore!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a bright red face, Neneka nodded repeatedly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; sorry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s fine! I was the one who startled you yesterday!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was fidgeting, perhaps embarrassed by the memory of yesterday&#8217;s events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed that I didn&#8217;t have to say anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Forgive me if I almost imagined&#8230; if Neneka decided she wanted to do something girlfriendly today and cleaned up in an amazing outfit again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the way home from summer school. I stopped by a local supermarket and rummaged through the food section.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was strongly attracted to the menchikatsu.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The menchikatsu at this supermarket was delicious and the meat was well seasoned. The menchikatsu was also delicious when made into a menchikatsu-don, just like making katsudon (pork cutlet on rice). We had never made it since I started living with Neneka, and I thought that I should let her try it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We had onions and eggs at home, so as long as I bought some menchikatsu, it would be easy to make. Then, I could buy a cup of ice cream for dessert.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I paid the cashier and headed home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How long was the time limit for a cup of ice cream that wasn&#8217;t in an insulated bag under the August sun? Curious, I walked faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I chose ice cream for desert with the simple idea that it was hot, but it might have been a bad choice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it melted into mush by the time I got home, I could dip a piece of bread in the melted ice cream and then bake that bread to make French toast.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thinking about this and that, I hurried home, unlocked the door and went inside.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No reply. I couldn&#8217;t even find Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; first I need to evacuate the ice cream to the freezer.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was wondering where Neneka was and what she was doing, but putting the ice cream in the freezer was the first thing that I had to do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cup of ice cream that I took out of the bag was sweating, and the container was softer than it had been in the store, but it was still cold. So I decided to re-freeze it as it was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I went to the washroom to wash my hands, I found the door to the&#8230; bathroom open and found Neneka inside. She was in the bathtub, which had been drained of water, and she was scrubbing the surface of the wall.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka worked hard at everything, and she also worked hard at cleaning. This was the kind of thing that made me glad that I fell in love with her all over again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good job, thanks for cleaning the bathroom.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I called out to her, Neneka turned around and smiled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, Daiki! Welcome back.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instantly, my attention was drawn to Neneka&#8217;s clothes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top was a uniform short-sleeved shirt and the bottom was plain shorts. It was an unfamiliar combination, but it wasn&#8217;t really strange at all. Compared to yesterday&#8217;s cosplay, which was jam-packed with attributes, it clearly fit within the range of normal clothing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What I was interested in was the chest area of her… shirt. It looked like water had been splashed on it while she was cleaning the bathtub, and a little underwear was showing through the wet and stuck shirt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was this the wet shirt, as rumored? The shirt was soaked with water, and the underwear and bare skin, which shouldn&#8217;t be visible, had become permeable.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was really sensual&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It was so nice to clean the bathtub because it was so hot, so I just went all out and cleaned every nook and cranny.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who was sweating freshly, surely didn&#8217;t realize that her underwear was transparent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was where I wasn&#8217;t supposed to react.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, let&#8217;s just think it was light blue today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s soooo clean. I bet our parents will be happy to see how clean the bathtub is when they get home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ehehe, I guess so.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, Neneka did her best. I&#8217;m going to prepare dinner, so you can go ahead and take a bath first. I know that it&#8217;s hot, but don&#8217;t stay like that and catch a cold.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After washing my hands and gargled, I left the washroom, and behind me I heard Neneka&#8217;s strange voice shouting, &#8220;Nyan!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t know what happened for her to make such a sound, but perhaps she realized that her underwear was transparent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that Neneka lived alone with her father for a long time, and when she was home alone, she didn&#8217;t worry about the details of her life. Cleaning the bath while soaking wet was a normal occurrence, and there would have been no inconvenience if her underwear was transparent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure that Neneka&#8217;s sense of crisis would improve as she would accumulate these small mistakes, so I was just going to pretend that I didn&#8217;t see anything this time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… I had also been inconvenienced by my habit of going to the bathroom naked and returning to my room naked, so we both needed to meditate on each other&#8217;s inattentiveness to each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I finished preparing the menchikatsu-don and was watching TV in the living room to pass the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka hadn&#8217;t yet come to the living room. Was she still taking a bath?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I started to yawn from waiting, Neneka finally came to the living room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, please wait for the bath&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She looked somewhat awkward. She seemed to be worried that I might have noticed that her underwear was transparent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I cheerfully called out to her, pretending not to notice anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going in next. You can eat first if you&#8217;re hungry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;This looks delicious! Is this katsudon?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s menchikatsu-don. I bought the menchikatsu at the supermarket.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wow, I&#8217;m looking forward to eating it! I&#8217;ll wait until you come out.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll be out as soon as I can.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was this? It was the conversation of a couple living together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I grinned to myself as I headed to the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew that a few of my classmates had girlfriends, but I was sure that there weren&#8217;t many couples who had conversations like ours. We were still in high school, and taking turns in the bath wasn&#8217;t a situation that we would normally experience.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;But that was only until tonight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When our parents would come back home, we would spend more time as brother and sister-in-law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lover&#8217;s time would have to be hidden from our parents so that they wouldn&#8217;t find out that we were in a relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I showered, I recalled the events of this time and felt a little sad.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We went to summer school, we did our own housework, and we were busy in our own way.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We did a lot of things that we couldn&#8217;t do when our parents were around.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A sense of accomplishment, immorality, and euphoria were all mixed up in my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The truth was, I found myself still wanting to spend time alone with Neneka&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After leaving the bath and getting dressed, I returned to the living room, where Neneka shifted her gaze from the TV to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that I kept you waiting. Shall we have dinner?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We ate dinner across from each other and served ice cream for dessert. Then Neneka shouted, &#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t eaten the cake rolls you bought for us yesterday!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I opened the fridge earlier when I was getting the eggs, but I never remembered!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The cake rolls that I had bought yesterday with the intention of eating them with Neneka had completely flown into oblivion in the midst of the Tabata.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t even notice it when I opened the fridge, and it would have expired if Neneka hadn&#8217;t reminded me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It has an expiration date, so why don&#8217;t we have cake rolls instead of ice cream?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was about to collect it, Neneka squeezed the ice cream cup to keep it in her hand, and then she started to begrudgingly cut it out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is it&#8230; wrong to eat both of them together? As a reward for both of us working hard and surviving our parents&#8217; absence&#8230; right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Haha. Okay, let&#8217;s do that.&#8221;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I agreed with a laugh, Neneka&#8217;s face lit up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The roll cakes were quickly placed on a plate and served with ice cream, making it look like a dish served at a café. As I scooped up the ice cream with my fork and put it on a piece of roll cake and chewed on it, Neneka smiled happily and said, &#8220;Mmm.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Delicious! Happiness&#8230; ah, but it&#8217;s almost the end of our time alone together.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka also seemed a bit sad that our time alone together would soon be over.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I wonder&#8230; when we&#8217;ll get another chance like this. Well, there are plenty of times for the two of us to go out together.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, but we&#8217;ve never been alone together for this long.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do while we&#8217;re at it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I asked her, Neneka blinked her eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I-I see&#8230; I wonder what would be good&#8230; It&#8217;s something that I want to do while I&#8217;m alone with Daiki, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From yesterday until now, I thought that we had done a lot of lover-like things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was shown Neneka&#8217;s racy cosplay outfit and was treated to Neneka&#8217;s home-cooked meal. I took a bath with Neneka, slept in bed with her, and enjoyed quite a wealth of lovers&#8217; events.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As for me, I was pretty happy with it, but I wasn&#8217;t so sure about Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was a time when she was depressed that she couldn&#8217;t do what she wanted to do, and if there was something that she wanted to do now, I wanted to do it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I hope there&#8217;s nothing special about it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Uh-huh. Then&#8230; can I ask you a question?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah? What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was it that she wanted to ask me?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Waiting for the question to come, Neneka said, &#8220;Daiki is&#8230;&#8221; and then her words stopped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She mumbled, and appeared to be at a loss to say anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it really that hard to ask? Neneka seemed strangely nervous, so I was getting a little nervous too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm, yeah&#8230; that, you know&#8230; Daiki is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exhaling and inhaling, she inhaled again, and Neneka uttered the rest of the story.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you think that you&#8217;re lucky to have me as your girlfriend…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I thought about what she wanted to ask, that was what it was.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was expecting to be asked something much more important, but I felt like I was missing the point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking it. Of course, I&#8217;m thinking it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I answered lightly and then questioned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Why did Neneka want to ask this again?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I began to feel uneasy when I thought about the significance of bothering to ask such a question because Neneka seemed terribly worried when she asked me this question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that Neneka was worried about whether people would be, &#8220;happy with her,&#8221; so she went out of her way to ask me that…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Huh? Did I look like I wasn&#8217;t happy that Neneka is my girlfriend?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh no! That&#8217;s not what I meant! I&#8217;m sorry for asking such a strange question. It&#8217;s okay now. Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230; Umm, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka hurriedly denied my question, but didn&#8217;t say why she asked me such a question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Really, was that all she wanted to ask about?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was very caught up. I didn&#8217;t know what it was, but it was bothering me in my chest.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Perhaps I was making Neneka uneasy? Was I not taking good care of her?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered what caused Neneka&#8217;s uneasiness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it when she was cooking dinner last night?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, maybe it was this insecurity that made Neneka want to do something girlfriendly in the first place. If she had just wanted to do something girlfriend, she wouldn&#8217;t have been so depressed just because things didn&#8217;t go well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it was that, then&#8230; the cause of the problem was before our parents&#8217; trip?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that I was doing well as a couple with Neneka, but was I just being selfish?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh no. I was suddenly getting anxious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We were both silent, and the air was awkward.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Picon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly it was the sound of a message being received on my phone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I picked up my phone and opened the message, the sender was my mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s my mom.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the message?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; She said that the weather near the airport was so bad that the scheduled flight didn&#8217;t fly.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Is everything okay&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It says that&#8230; it looks fine for now. She said that they were able to catch a later flight. But it&#8217;s going to be close to midnight when they would arrive home, so she said to lock up and go to bed and not to wait for them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see… Well, I guess it&#8217;s time to put away the dishes.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We finished what we were talking about earlier, and we took our finished dishes to the kitchen.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While we were washing the dishes side by side, Neneka didn&#8217;t want to continue our conversation, so I decided not to say anything either.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as the chores were done, we went back to our respective rooms.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I said, &#8220;Good night,&#8221; but it was still too early to go to bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could study or just relax. Of course, it was also possible to chat with Neneka&#8230; but since Neneka seemed to want to be alone, I decided to be quiet and stay in my room too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;What in the world was Neneka so anxious about?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that Neneka looked happy during our parents&#8217; trip. But why did she sometimes look sad?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka was troubled by something. She denied it, but did she feel like I didn&#8217;t care about her, and was wondering if I was happy that she was my girlfriend?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was really trying to take care of her&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So it wasn&#8217;t good enough.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, it was also difficult to say that I was able to take good care of Neneka. If Neneka didn&#8217;t feel that she was really cherished, it was only self-satisfaction to think that I was taking good care of her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t&#8230; understand. I wondered if I wasn&#8217;t taking care of Neneka properly&#8230;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that I had time to study, but when I opened my reference book and notebook, I realized that my motivation was empty. I couldn&#8217;t get my pen going at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was idly looking at my phone and two hours had passed so quickly that I gave up studying and decided to go to bed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After turning off the lights and rolled over in bed, I often looked at my phone again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A story about a couple&#8217;s lover&#8217;s quarrel and a statement examining the differences between men and women&#8230; I looked at SNS and felt vague, as if I understood something, and then I realized that another two hours or so had passed&#8230; I heard my parents come home, unlocking the front door with a clatter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>
<p>The next morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first thing that my mother asked me when she returned from the trip was, &#8220;Did you have any trouble during our trip?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Nothing special,&#8221; I replied blankly. &#8220;I just had a normal life as usual,&#8221; I replied blankly, to which my mother simply said, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear that,&#8221; and then started talking about how much fun she had on her honeymoon with Neneka&#8217;s father.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother didn&#8217;t know what we were doing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother was neither an Esper nor a mind-reading demon, so it was no surprise that she didn&#8217;t notice anything, but still I exhaled in relief that she didn&#8217;t get any lucky breaks.</p>
