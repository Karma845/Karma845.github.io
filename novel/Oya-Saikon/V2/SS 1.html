<h3>SS 1: Neneka</h3>

<p>After that, I thought that I was acting like a girlfriend as much as I could so that everyone would see me as a girlfriend, but when the man at the concession stand asked me, &#8220;What do you want, little sister?&#8221; I was broken-hearted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Did I look that much like a younger sister?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I was selfish.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted my parents to think of me as a sibling, but I wanted other people to think of me as a girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was confident in my pretense to be a younger sister, and I was happy when people complimented me for being &#8220;sisterly&#8221; when I was pretending to be a younger sister. However, I didn&#8217;t like it when people treated me like a younger sister when I wasn&#8217;t pretending to be one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that since I couldn&#8217;t do anything lover-like with Daiki at home, I wanted to do something lover-like with all my might when we would go to the pool, but… the result was a disaster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I think that because of me, Daiki didn&#8217;t enjoy the pool and I felt so sorry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to be more like him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to be the kind of girlfriend that Daiki would be proud of and wouldn&#8217;t be embarrassed to show anywhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today, Daiki and I would be separated because we had a summer course at our respective cram schools.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I missed being with him, but I needed some time alone to sort out my feelings, so that helped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As siblings-in-law, we lived together, and not a day went by that we didn&#8217;t see each other. Even if it felt a little awkward to see each other, we had to act well so as not to worry our parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was the first disadvantage of living together that I felt and that I couldn&#8217;t rant and rave, &#8220;Oh God, I hate it!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I was waiting for the start of the summer course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Everyone was passing the time by chatting with people nearby.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Haaaaaaah!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Neneka-chan. Are you that depressed about summer school?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My friend sitting next to me responded to my grand sigh.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her name was Kurata Nao-chan. She was a good friend of mine since junior high school, and she invited me to this cram school&#8217;s summer course.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cool Nao-chan was a very beautiful woman. But perhaps she was too beautiful to be approachable, or perhaps she was very popular, but I never heard of her having a boyfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Not that I&#8217;m depressed about summer classes, but&#8230; I&#8217;m having a little trouble with something.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah. What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As expected of Nao-chan, she was immediately ready to listen to my problems.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But, my concern was about Daiki. It wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t trust Nao-chan, but I promised Daiki that I wouldn&#8217;t tell anyone at school about what happened with us being siblings-in-law, so I couldn&#8217;t honestly discuss everything with her&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah, but I wanted her to listen to me. I wanted to talk to her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was so distressed that I decided to talk to Nao-chan about it as a friend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Actually, I&#8217;m struggling with something a friend of mine asked me about&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, what kind of advice?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;She just started going out with her boyfriend, but she&#8217;s worried that she&#8217;s not doing the things that make her a girlfriend. She asked me for advice, but I don&#8217;t have a boyfriend, so I have no idea&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nao-chan nodded &#8220;Mmm.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I was okay, right? She didn&#8217;t know it was about me, did she?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was nervously waiting for Nao-chan&#8217;s reaction, she began to worry with a serious look on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve never had a boyfriend either&#8230; What is that girl&#8217;s goal? Does she want to get closer to her ideal girlfriend image, or does she want to please her boyfriend more? … Maybe the method changes depending on whether she wants to improve herself?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think she wants to please her boyfriend more! I bet she wants him to think, &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad that she&#8217;s my girlfriend!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;She wants to serve him in her own way. Then, that&#8217;s it. Make her boyfriend&#8217;s dreams come true.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Boyfriend&#8217;s dreams?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What&#8217;s Daiki&#8217;s dream…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No. We lived together and I had no idea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a dream like being a soccer player or a lawyer or anything like that, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Really? Then what kind of dream?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You see, boys have a lot of desires, don&#8217;t they? The desire to have a girl do this or that&#8230; I think that she&#8217;s the one who can fulfill them. If she makes her boyfriend&#8217;s secret dreams come true, he will be overjoyed for sure.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was like, &#8220;Wow&#8230; Nao-sensei. How does Nao-sensei know that?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I wonder if it&#8217;s knowledge that comes naturally when you read a lady&#8217;s comic.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nao-chan smiled coolly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Lady comics were comics for women who were a bit geeky. Maybe I should read and study them too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, Nao-sensei, what kind of dreams do boys have&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230; for example&#8230; naked aprons.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I responded like, &#8220;Naked&#8230; aprons? An apron with an illustration on it that made it look naked?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s an illustration of a very glamorous female body, some people might be pleased, but it&#8217;s not that. It&#8217;s a naked, unclothed apron.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;And underwear?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That depends on the person&#8217;s courage&#8230; I think there were mangas wearing aprons over tops, and there were also mangas wearing an apron over a bathing suit.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I see. So it&#8217;s okay to wear a swimsuit.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was indeed embarrassing to wear an apron on top of nudity, but I thought that I could do it if I wore a swimsuit underneath.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made a note in my notebook &#8220;Naked apron.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Nao-sensei, anything else?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that boys like the nurse&#8217;s outfit, the little devil costume, the cat ears, the Chinese outfit, and so on. Surely it would be great if your favorite girlfriend wore one, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Kind of like a Halloween costume.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s classic cosplay. Also, maid costumes would be nice. I heard that boys were attracted to the knee-high socks and the absolute area&#8230; Ah, what I&#8217;ve said so far is just orthodox stuff. If you know what fetish the person has, you can come up with a more niche story.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fetish? What is a fetish, Nao-sensei!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Chokey-chokey! What are you talking about when you come to summer school, Nao-chan!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was listening intently to Nao-chan&#8217;s story, Kimura Harumi-chan, a friend from the same school, stopped Nao-chan from the side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Harumi-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Good morning. I forgot that the summer course started today, so I came running in a hurry. It&#8217;s really hot&#8230; So, what did you guys talk about while I wasn&#8217;t here?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harumi-chan, who just retired from the tennis club, was a sporty girl with tanned skin.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harumi-chan and I met in high school and became good friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We were in the same class in the third year, we ate lunch together, and we also acted together in events. And Harumi-chan was also invited by Nao-chan to join the summer course here at this cram school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I was just talking about the elements that boys seemed to like.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare infuse the pure and lovely Neneka-chan with your strange knowledge!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka-chan asked me, so it&#8217;s fine. Right, Neneka-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I was just talking to Nao-chan about something my friend had asked me about.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Friend? Who?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harumi-chan asked me a direct question, and I was at a loss for words.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t actually have such a friend. What I was hiding was that the friend was actually me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These two were dear friends and maybe I could be honest with them. I was sure they would be surprised, but they wouldn&#8217;t make it sound bad&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&#8230; no. I couldn&#8217;t tell them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that I didn&#8217;t trust them both, but I was still embarrassed to talk to them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let&#8217;s keep it a secret here&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; she’s a kid from another school.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;A kid from another school? Someone who went to the same middle school?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was struggling to figure out how to fake it, Nao-chan took out her phone and displayed the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter who it is. That girl talked to Neneka-chan about it, so it&#8217;s wild for us to ask her who she&#8217;s talking about&#8230; It&#8217;s almost time for the class to start, isn&#8217;t it? Why don&#8217;t you take your seat too, Harumi-chan?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see you both later.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. See you later!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After waving to Harumi-chan as she headed to her seat, I felt relieved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Nao-chan&#8230; Thanks for the great follow-up. Too cool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Thanks to the mature and cool Nao-chan, I was able to escape Harumi-chan&#8217;s questions.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Soon the tutoring teacher entered the classroom and the students taking the course hurriedly took their seats.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I usually didn&#8217;t attend cram school, so this was my first time studying at a cram school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had a different atmosphere, and I was very excited.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;But I see…&nbsp; A naked apron, a nurse, a small devil, cat ears and knee-highs…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I was receiving the essentials for the college entrance exam, an equation was developing in my mind that would lead to an effective way to please Daiki.</p>
