<h3>SS 2: Neneka</h3>

<p>&#8220;Neneka is the best girlfriend I&#8217;ve ever had! I&#8217;m so glad to have Neneka as my girlfriend!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that he would think that… but&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The results weren&#8217;t good at all.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that Daiki was thrilled when I went to meet him at the door in a costume.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, when I inadvertently caused the boiling water to splash and almost burned myself, Daiki became a firm Onii-chan, worrying about me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And I was an unreliable sister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I was so frustrated by the failure of the &#8220;pounding&#8221; operation, that I did a more childish thing and went into sister mode.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought that I was very selfish, asking him to undress me and wash me in the bathroom.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&#8230; Daiki accepted my selfishness and was kind to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure that he was stunned. I was already a senior in high school, so what kind of foolishness was this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki, who didn&#8217;t say anything, was very mature.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Unlike me, he was an adult.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;And then, there was a grave situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He took off my clothes and washed me in the bath, but&#8230; Daiki had no reaction.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If he was the usual Daiki, his son would be slammed with seven changes, but there were none.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if Daiki&#8217;s son got used to seeing me naked&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t believe that when we were in close contact on a crowded train on the way home from the pool, Daiki’s son was an express train, but when he washed me, he didn&#8217;t transform… Two causes were to be expected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One was that Daiki was in full Onii-chan mode, so he didn&#8217;t react.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other was that he didn&#8217;t respond because I became less attractive as a girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Ah, this was a serious situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I was sure that both of the causes were right.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki could no longer see me as a girlfriend. But as my Onii-chan, he decided to listen to my selfishness. Yes, even his son would ignore me like this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Furthermore, Daiki, whom I forced to take a bath with me, seemed to have gotten sick from being overtired… My stock as a girlfriend was going down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even when I &#8220;Ahh&#8217;ed&#8221; him for dinner, or slept with him and tried to help him if something went wrong, it was unlikely that I would be able to bring back the shares that had fallen. It wasn&#8217;t that easy to recover one&#8217;s stock as a girlfriend, was it?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;So distressed&#8230; I was a bit relieved when I woke up in the morning and saw that Daiki’s son was a volcano. I thought that maybe he was responding to me again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&#8230; it was different.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yes, I had heard that too. Men got volcanic activity in the morning and their volcano erupted, not that there was anything wrong with that. It was a physiological phenomenon.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki&#8217;s son remained unresponsive to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That day, as I was cleaning the bath, I was talking with Daiki in a daze, not realizing that my underwear was showing through my wet shirt. So when I realized it was see-through, I was so surprised that I screamed out&#8230; I wondered why Daiki didn&#8217;t say anything, and my blood ran cold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The transparency wasn&#8217;t intentional. It wasn&#8217;t on purpose&#8230; &#8220;Neneka, it&#8217;s transparent&#8230;!&#8221; He could have said that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Didn&#8217;t he notice? Really?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Or&#8230; didn&#8217;t he care that he could see my underwear?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;And the ultimate conversation was after dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you think that you&#8217;re lucky to have me as your girlfriend&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I summoned up the courage to ask, Daiki simply answered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking it. Of course, I&#8217;m thinking it. Huh? Did I look like I wasn&#8217;t happy that Neneka is my girlfriend?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was impatient when I saw Daiki anxiously asking back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh no! That&#8217;s not what I meant!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I immediately denied it, but Daiki looked anxious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh really, I was such a jerk&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was I worried about on my own?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though Daiki always took good care of me. He didn&#8217;t wish that he hadn&#8217;t made me his girlfriend. I could see from his anxious look that he still saw me as his girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But&#8230; I asked a strange question that seemed to make Daiki lose confidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was the worst. I hurt Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Do you think that you&#8217;re lucky to have me as your girlfriend&#8230;?&#8221; was my stupid question.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just wanted to hear the words &#8220;I think it.&#8221; I just wanted to hear it for my reassurance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure that I was the right person to be with him, I was worried about myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had been worried since summer vacation that I wasn&#8217;t the right girlfriend for such a wonderful person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;This was my selfishness. I wanted to give myself confidence that I was Daiki&#8217;s girlfriend. I happened to be seen as Daiki&#8217;s sister when we were at the pool, but I was doing well as his girlfriend. That was why I wanted to be able to be proud of myself, regardless of what people said about me&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While my parents were on vacation, I wanted to do something girlfriendly to please Daiki and make him feel that I was doing well as a girlfriend. And when that didn&#8217;t work out, I was left alone to fret about it&#8230; I was sure that he didn&#8217;t understand what I meant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was my personal ambiguity, and as a result, I got Daiki involved.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then things got awkward and we ended the conversation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure that the seeds of bewilderment that I had sown were also bewildering him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn&#8217;t ask those strange questions because Daiki was making me nervous.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sorry that I made him feel uneasy on the contrary.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Ah, this kind of thing was really not like me&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The spikes I made stuck into me and hurt.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to be more like a girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to be the kind of girlfriend that Daiki would be proud of.</p>
