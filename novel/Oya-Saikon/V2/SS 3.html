<h3>SS 3: Neneka</h3>

<p>After school. I was being bombarded with questions from both Nao-chan and Harumi-chan.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The place was at the back of the school building where there were few people, but Harumi-chan was asking loudly and it was very embarrassing&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka-chan didn&#8217;t tell you because she thought that Harumi-chan would make a fool of herself if she did.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;…!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harumi-chan was immensely surprised when Nao-chan told her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. We&#8217;ve actually just started dating, and the reason I didn&#8217;t tell you is because I was&#8230; embarrassed. I was planning on telling Nao-chan and Harumi-chan one day.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurried to follow up, but Harumi-chan was shunned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The two of us had talked about many things in our lives, and we had even confided secrets to each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And yet, if I kept it a secret that I had a boyfriend, it would be more than a little shocking. I felt bad too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I didn&#8217;t think that they would find out that I had a boyfriend at a time like that&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My face got a little hot when I remembered the day of the festival, when Daiki came to my rescue with a different hairstyle than usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, you were just thinking about your boyfriend, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What are you talking about, Nao-chan? I&#8217;m not thinking about him!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Really?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nao-chan looked at me, grinned and&#8230; immediately turned serious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nao-chan, whom even I, a girl, thought was beautiful, moved her face closer and asked in a whisper.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;So, was your summer vacation mission a success?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you were talking about Neneka-chan and not your friend, then it was Neneka-chan who was worried about not being able to do what she wanted as a girlfriend, wasn&#8217;t it? Was my advice adopted? How did things go after that?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nao-chan stared at me intently.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I told her about a friend of mine who was worried because she felt like she wasn&#8217;t doing the things that were typical of a girlfriend, Nao-chan suggested that if she wanted to do things that were typical of a girlfriend, she should make her boyfriend&#8217;s dreams come true.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She gave me a lot of advice about how to dress to please boys, and I decided to cook dinner for Daiki in an outfit that incorporated those elements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… But that failed along the way, and in the end I couldn&#8217;t do anything like a girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was embarrassing and hard to talk about, but Nao-chan did her best to give me advice, so I thought that I should talk about it properly when it already got here&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I dressed up and cooked for him as per Nao-chan&#8217;s advice&#8230; But I screwed up and almost got burned while cooking, and then we didn&#8217;t seem like lovers at all. I&#8217;m sorry I wasn&#8217;t good enough&#8230; for your advice.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Did your boyfriend tell you that Neneka-chan wasn&#8217;t like a girlfriend?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t tell me!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then why are you so depressed?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I was struggling with self-confidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was the right girlfriend for Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I pontificated about my problems, Nao-chan and Harumi-chan quietly nodded and listened.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I almost cried because I was so happy that they were kind enough to listen to me, even though I had kept quiet about my boyfriend for so long and they only found out about him today.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I was so anxious, so I asked him, &#8220;Are you glad that I&#8217;m your girlfriend?&#8221;&nbsp; He said, &#8220;Yes, I do.&#8221; But he gave me an insecure look that said, &#8220;Did I look like I didn&#8217;t think so?&#8221; I embarrassed him because I asked a strange question&#8230; I was having a hard time being like a girlfriend no matter what I did&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was the first time I had been able to talk to someone about it, and my emotions were running high.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was crying and talking, Harumi-chan gently patted my back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I thought, &#8220;It&#8217;s nice to be with someone I like, but I had a lot on my mind.&#8221;&#8230; I was alone all this time, and it was painful…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka-chan&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Nao-chan started groaning, &#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She said, &#8220;Hmm&#8230; I see. I see… I guess my advice was misdirected.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; What?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Neneka-chan. Didn&#8217;t I tell you? &#8220;What is your goal?&#8221; Do you want to get closer to an ideal image of a girlfriend, or do you want to please your boyfriend more&#8230;? You said that you wanted to please your boyfriend more, but what you really wanted was to get closer to an ideal image of a girlfriend, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn&#8217;t quite understand what Nao-chan was saying, so I cracked my eyes open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to make Daiki more happy&#8230; didn&#8217;t I?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So let&#8217;s say, for example&#8230; that the most girlfriendly thing you could do was make your own bento. If you want to make your boyfriend happier, then it&#8217;s okay if he&#8217;s happy, right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But for someone who wants to get closer to an ideal image of a girlfriend it isn&#8217;t just okay&#8230; if he&#8217;s happy. Of course it&#8217;s important if he&#8217;s happy, but they also cared if they made a good bento.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before I knew it, Harumi-chan was nodding along with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;These two are different goals, aren&#8217;t they? If your goal is to make your boyfriend happy, it doesn&#8217;t matter if your bento box is messy. It&#8217;s okay if your boyfriend smiles and says &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; No matter how happy your boyfriend is, if you think, &#8220;But I failed to make it half-way through, so I couldn&#8217;t make a proper bento&#8230; I&#8217;m a useless girlfriend.&#8221; Then the goal isn&#8217;t here&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard Neneka-chan&#8217;s story, don&#8217;t you think that it&#8217;s not that your boyfriend wasn&#8217;t happy and you didn&#8217;t achieve your goal&#8230;? It just sounded like Neneka-chan was depressed that she couldn&#8217;t do what she wanted to do. She&#8217;s just worried because she&#8217;s not ideal, not because her boyfriend was disappointed with her, right? If you mix that up, you&#8217;ll never know what you really want.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing Nao-chan&#8217;s story made me think again about my summer vacation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At the beginning of the summer vacation, I was mistaken for Daiki’s sister at the pool and became depressed because I was worried that he wouldn&#8217;t be able to see me as his girlfriend. Daiki said, &#8220;Is it something to worry about?&#8221; But I was worried that I was like his little sister.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When my parents went on a trip, I was determined to do something girlfriendly, but I couldn&#8217;t do what I wanted until the end, and I got depressed. Even though Daiki didn&#8217;t say that I wasn&#8217;t like a girlfriend&#8230; On the contrary, Daiki said, &#8220;&#8230; Neneka is my girlfriend, so I don&#8217;t think that it&#8217;s necessary to think about making you look like a girlfriend, right&#8230;?&#8221; But&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;All of it, I was the only one who cared.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I thought about it calmly, I realized that I was only thinking about myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki was always concerned about me, but I was only worried about myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What am I going to do, Nao-chan&#8230; I&#8217;m the worst&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Kyan!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was about to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a lousy girlfriend,&#8221; when Nao-chan chopped me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The top of my head hurt&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, Neneka-chan has too low self-esteem. No one said you were the worst. You just thought so yourself.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I-Is that so…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is that so&#8230;? No, that&#8217;s right! I don&#8217;t know much about Neneka-chan&#8217;s boyfriend, but from what Neneka-chan told me, I think that he loves Neneka-chan. I think you&#8217;re really loved, but because Neneka-chan always lacks confidence, your boyfriend thinks that he doesn&#8217;t love you enough and gets depressed, right? Imagine how you would feel if you were in the opposite side of this situation?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What if it was the other way around&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I guess it would be like he thought, &#8220;I love her,&#8221; but Daiki was unsure and wondered if it was okay for him to be my boyfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even if he tried his best to tell me, &#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t worry, I love you,&#8221; Daiki would always be worried, saying, &#8220;I can&#8217;t do this as I am.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Wah, I might be depressed because I&#8217;m not sure how to convey my feelings&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes. You would be worried, wouldn&#8217;t you? Or &#8220;I&#8217;m telling you how much I love you, why can&#8217;t you understand?&#8221; You&#8217;re either angry. Well, from what I&#8217;ve heard, I don&#8217;t think Neneka-chan&#8217;s boyfriend is the kind of person who would be upset at such a time.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hey, Nao-chan, how can you analyze relationships so well when you don&#8217;t have a boyfriend?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Harumi-chan asked Nao-chan, to which Nao-chan replied, &#8220;Is it the result of reading and daily observation of people?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But I felt that Nao-chan was the only one who could examine my love life so far just by reading and observing people on a daily basis&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re really great&#8230; Nao-chan,&#8221; I didn&#8217;t even know myself at all. I was getting mixed up about whether I wanted to satisfy him or satisfy myself&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I think to some extent the two goals are intertwined, though, because sometimes you can&#8217;t be satisfied unless he is satisfied, and sometimes your satisfaction leads to his satisfaction. I just think that if the goal of the objective is different from the goal you are aiming for, like Neneka-chan just did, you will never be able to achieve your goal.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Maybe it was just a coincidence that Daiki&#8217;s son didn&#8217;t respond to me, not that he no longer saw me as his girlfriend. Or maybe Daiki was making an effort behind my back not to react. Whatever the case, I felt that I worried too much&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Otherwise… he wouldn&#8217;t have come to my rescue as my boyfriend on the day of the festival, would he&#8230;?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;That day, Daiki&#8230; was so cool&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the day of the summer festival, I went to the yakisoba stall and was surprised.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With his bangs up, Daiki looked more mature than usual&#8230; I was so excited that I couldn&#8217;t even talk to him like I used to.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He followed me, admitted that he was my boyfriend in front of a classmate who said mean things about me, and told the classmate who was flirtatious, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need the contact information of girls other than hers.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He protected me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was just so full of myself that I couldn&#8217;t see what was going on around me, and I was always taken care of by Daiki&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All in all, my self-esteem was too low.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh, I want to apologize for the trouble I caused to you, Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted to say &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry&#8221; and &#8220;I love you&#8221; a lot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let&#8217;s stop worrying about whether I&#8217;m good enough to be his girlfriend. Let&#8217;s take Daiki&#8217;s words in stride.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki was an honest person, so he didn&#8217;t say things that weren&#8217;t on his mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Nao-chan and Harumi-chan, thank you for listening to me. I&#8217;m glad I could talk to you both about him.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I laughed, and Nao-chan and Harumi-chan laughed too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I enjoyed our real-life love talk.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I only listened to Nao-chan&#8217;s story with you&#8230; Haha.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Harumi-chan was there for me, too. Harumi-chan, just being by my side cheers me up.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I know. Harumi-chan is always in good spirits.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;In vain, it was superfluous!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The three of us laughed a lot, and I went home feeling refreshed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… On the way home, I received a message from Daiki saying, &#8220;I have something to talk about in my room at night.&#8221; I was about to reply with high tension.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dangerous, dangerous&#8230; I needed to start by apologizing face to face and making up with each other properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could I have lover&#8217;s time with&#8230; Daiki after that?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once I got my own feelings in order, I suddenly missed Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wanted sweet time with Daiki. I might be a little nervous&#8230; because we haven&#8217;t had much lover&#8217;s time lately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:spacer {"height":"15px"} -->
<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;And then the night came&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki&#8217;s face was more serious than ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; actually&#8230; today, I got back the results of my competency test, and&#8230; it&#8217;s not looking good.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was unexpected and surprising.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, sorry&#8230; I&#8217;m going to have to cut out lover&#8217;s time for a while and let myself concentrate on my studies. Of course, we&#8217;ll get along as brother and sister-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, no lover&#8217;s time is fine&#8230; But how long is a while…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That’s right… two weeks or so.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Two weeks&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;How about a new rule? &#8220;How about a two-week lover&#8217;s time ban&#8230; as a penalty for a significant drop in grades?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Wha, it wasn&#8217;t long&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And two weeks might not be enough time to restore the grades that dropped in the first place.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps Daiki set it at two weeks so that I would not be lonely. In fact&#8230; he might want to take a longer period and concentrate on his studies without thinking about me&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I will study hard in two weeks. I&#8217;ll go over everything I didn&#8217;t do well on the test. Can I ask for your cooperation?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; of course it&#8217;s fine. It&#8217;s a big time.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Okay, that was all I could say&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had only ever thought of myself and caused trouble. I had to properly put Daiki&#8217;s feelings first here&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll get right to studying.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was impatient because Daiki wanted to end the conversation immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;&#8230; Umm, Daiki. You know&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Actually, I also have something I wanted to talk to you about, Daiki&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I tried to cut that off and couldn&#8217;t get the words out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it okay to say now that I was sorry for being so selfish since summer vacation, or that Daiki did nothing wrong and I was just worried on my own?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, talking about my problems would only get in the way of Daiki&#8217;s studies. I wanted to do something lover-like with Daiki after I apologized, but lover&#8217;s time was now forbidden&#8230;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… nah, it&#8217;s nothing. I&#8217;ll study hard for the two weeks you&#8217;re studying hard. Let&#8217;s work hard for each other.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I&#8217;ll hold out for two weeks, too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let him concentrate on his studies and talk to him later.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->
