<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>&#8211;That wasn&#8217;t what it meant.</p>



<p>Neneka and I woke up early and got on the train to visit a huge indoor swimming pool facility a bit far away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now that we&#8217;re here, we don&#8217;t have to worry about anyone we know seeing us, so we can enjoy our lover&#8217;s time to the fullest today!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>At the poolside, Neneka squeezed my arm.</p>



<p>Neneka was wearing a pure white swimsuit decorated with lily-like flowers. She had shown me this swimsuit in my room one day, but why did it shine more than that time?</p>



<p>The white swimsuit gently wrapped around Neneka&#8217;s breasts seemed to emphasize them divinely. I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off Neneka&#8217;s breasts pressed against my own arms&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s indeed embarrassing to be seen that much&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But maybe you&#8217;ve noticed&#8230; The result of my efforts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221; The result of your efforts?&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought that I was being accused of staring at her breasts, but I guess it wasn&#8217;t that.</p>



<p>Neneka grabbed my hand and let me touch her stomach.</p>



<p>&#8220;If it bothers you that much, you can touch it, okay? Look, it&#8217;s tighter than before, isn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;ve been working hard on my strength training to improve my style for summer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;Was it okay if I touched her? Was it okay because it was her?</p>



<p>Neneka&#8217;s hands were guiding me to touch her, and I had no choice but to touch her.</p>



<p>Smooth&#8230; and slippery&#8230;</p>



<p>Oh man, I could touch this all the time&#8230;</p>



<p>At first I was touching Neneka as she guided me, but half-way through, my hands were moving on their own.</p>



<p>She said she was tighter than before, but I didn&#8217;t remember how Neneka&#8217;s stomach looked before.</p>



<p>I thought about it when we bumped into each other in the bathroom, but I think that Neneka had always had a great style, and I didn&#8217;t know how she had turned out compared to how she was before.</p>



<p>However, I might really like this waist line&#8230;</p>



<p>As I was touching her stomach and waist, Neneka suddenly grabbed my hand and stopped me.</p>



<p>Neneka had a red face and her eyes were moist.</p>



<p>&#8220;It tickles&#8230; when you touch me so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>After she stopped me, I remembered that this was a poolside where many other people were around. What was I thinking, enjoying Neneka&#8217;s stomach in a place where other people could see us?</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s change our minds. I had to be firm as Neneka&#8217;s boyfriend.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s… go to one of the pools. There seems to be a flowing pool, a glowing pool and many other ones&#8230; what do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;First of all, let&#8217;s go&#8230; over here!&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka pulled me into a pool that was regularly zapped by artificial waves.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like the ocean.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing to have a pool like this indoors&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Hold my hand tight so you don&#8217;t fall, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I held Neneka&#8217;s hand firmly so that she wouldn&#8217;t lose her balance due to the waves coming in.</p>



<p>I was glad to feel that Neneka was relying on me. My heart burned deep in my chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki&#8230; I would love to go the real ocean with you someday.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we go next year when we are college students?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing Neneka smile happily, I felt happy.</p>



<p>If we successfully become college students, I could go on a date with Neneka next summer. For that&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to start studying seriously for the exam from tomorrow onwards&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And then tomorrow, you&#8217;ll say the same thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, we can&#8217;t. We came to the pool because we promised to study hard for the exam starting tomorrow, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, I know. I&#8217;ll start working real hard tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. But since we came all the way to the pool today, let&#8217;s not talk about studying anymore, shall we? We should enjoy ourselves so that we can concentrate on our studies tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh! Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right. We came all this way, so it would be a loss if we didn&#8217;t enjoy ourselves.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki, how about we try seeing how far we can go against the waves?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Great, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>Holding each other&#8217;s hand tightly, we headed out to face the waves together.</p>



<p>If we were to do this in the real ocean, we might be swept out to sea in an instant by the receding waves, or we might lose our footing and almost drown, but the water in the pool wasn&#8217;t that deep so it was safe.</p>



<p>The momentum of the waves, however, was quite dynamic, and our bodies occasionally staggered and hit each other. Neneka was laughing as she cried out, &#8220;Kyaa,&#8221; but I couldn&#8217;t help but feel nervous in many ways because of the unexpected contact with Neneka&#8217;s soft body.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, watch out!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? Wah!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wah! Sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>Immediately after Neneka shouted, a man wearing a floatation ring was swept by the waves and bumped into me.</p>



<p>I lost my balance and almost fell towards Neneka.</p>



<p>&#8211;Mugyuu.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki, are you all right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow&#8230;</p>



<p>I was pushed and lost my balance, but Neneka held me up.</p>



<p>That kept me from plunging my face into the water, but I did plunge my face into Neneka&#8217;s chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I was so surprised. The person who hit me apologized and went away. The float seemed to be fun too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha&#8230; we should have rented one too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka, who took my face with her chest, was smiling normally.</p>



<p>I guess all she cared about was helping me. Was I the only one who was thrilled&#8230;?</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka, do you want to try a different pool this time?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah! I want to go on the water slide!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, great. Umm, the waterslide is at&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This way! Come on, come on.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka pointed to the waterslide and bounced around as she stepped out of the wave pool. Her breasts were swaying, swaying, swaying, but they wouldn&#8217;t pop out of her bathing suit, would they? Was she okay with that?</p>

<p>Why was it that women were embarrassed when they were seen in their underwear, but became bold as soon as they were in their swimsuits? The area of exposed skin was the same. Was it the effect of the equipment called swimsuit?</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, don&#8217;t get too excited. Don&#8217;t fall down by the pool.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m not that much of a child.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka!!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka was about to fall down just as I was saying that!</p>



<p>In the nick of time, I grabbed her arm and supported her, so it didn&#8217;t look like Neneka did anything suspicious, but&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Be careful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka shrugged her shoulders.</p>



<p>It was good that she was sorry, but it hurt my heart to see her look so dejected.</p>



<p>&#8220;I just don&#8217;t want you to get hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was patting Neneka on the head to cheer her up, a lady I didn&#8217;t know looked at me and chuckled as she passed by.</p>



<p>&#8220;If the little sister is fine, the big brother will be in trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka froze with a look of astonishment.</p>



<p>I was surprised to be talked to out of the blue, but the lady talked to another lady and went into the pool together as if nothing had happened.</p>



<p>Aunts had that kind of thing&#8230; I thought, and looked at Neneka, who was&#8230; still frozen in place.</p>



<p>She looked pale, if not heartless.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Neneka?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wah, did I&#8230; look like a younger sister just now..?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? I don&#8217;t think that happened&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But she said, &#8220;If the little sister is fine, the big brother will be in trouble.&#8221; She meant that we looked like a big brother and a little sister to her, right&#8230;? Or didn&#8217;t I look like a girlfriend&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe it looked that way to that person, but&#8230; you don&#8217;t have to worry about it. Come on, let&#8217;s go to the water slide.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Umm, yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka walked around dejectedly. I wondered where the bouncy, joyful Neneka from earlier had gone. Even though we held hands, her grip on my hand was weak.</p>



<p>However, by the time we climbed to the top of the water slide together&#8230; we were able to talk normally again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s sliding down the slope at a great pace&#8230; Neneka, are you okay with this kind of thing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; I haven&#8217;t ridden it much. But I&#8217;ll probably be fine! What about you, Daiki?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been on a water slide before, but I&#8217;ll probably be fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be exciting.&#8221;</p>



<p>I lightly replied, &#8220;Yeah,&#8221; but my heart was racing, not pounding.</p>



<p>To be honest, I wasn&#8217;t good at screaming.</p>



<p>The cheerful staff member led us to a two-person boat that was being prepared for departure. Neneka was in the front and I was in the back.</p>



<p>It was my first time on a water slide and a two-person boat. As I scurried around anxiously, my eyes met those of a staff member.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re ready to go. You can start anytime… Huh? Are you nervous, brother? Go ahead and relax more!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, thanks for the&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was smiling amiably at the staff member&#8230; Neneka suddenly started the boat without signaling me.</p>



<p>The boat slide out and flowed down the tube with great force.</p>



<p>&#8211;Wait-wait-wait-wait… this was quite&#8230; this was quite… thrilling! A thriller!!!!</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t expect the water slide to be so fast.</p>



<p>&#8211;I&#8217;m sorry I underestimated you!</p>



<p>Apologizing in my mind didn&#8217;t slow down the boat.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t shout because I didn&#8217;t want to appear uncool in front of Neneka.</p>



<p>Neneka wasn&#8217;t yelling at all either.</p>



<p>From my place, I could only see Neneka&#8217;s back, so I had no idea whether she was silent because she was scared, bored, or silently enjoying herself.</p>



<p>&#8211;Zaban.</p>



<p>We both arrived at the end of the slide in silence.</p>



<p>It was finally time to get off the boat, guided by a staff lady.</p>



<p>Not that I was anxiously awaiting their arrival, mind you. And the reason I stumbled a bit when I got off the boat wasn&#8217;t because my legs were shaking and I was weak. I just had a little itch on the bottom of my foot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, that was amazing, Neneka…?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was about to ask her what she thought, but Neneka had a faraway look in her eyes.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t tell me that Neneka was also scared and the water slide almost made her lose her soul.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka? Are you okay? Were you scared?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He called you brother… &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Did someone call me that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The water slide staff member who was up there with us&#8230; I don&#8217;t look like a girlfriend, so you don&#8217;t look like my boyfriend&#8230; Haha&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka smiled without effort. Why did she care about such things?</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that what they call all of their male customers? I think that even Neneka is called &#8220;sister&#8221; by the staff. You see, whether or not you are in a relationship is a sensitive issue, and sometimes you can&#8217;t tell by looks, right? Unless you&#8217;re a very obvious couple, I don&#8217;t think they would call you boyfriend and girlfriend, would they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; I see&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka&#8217;s expression slightly brightened.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure what stuck with her, but I was glad it made sense.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see… Then we&#8217;ll have to make out plainly, so we look like a couple!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Noooo!&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka squeezed my arm so tightly that my arm was in close contact with her cleavage.</p>



<p>I felt the cells in the epidermis of my arm trembling with emotion. I felt that the cells born in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue lamenting, &#8220;I wish I was born in the epidermis too.&#8221; But it was just a feeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, let&#8217;s go to that pool over there this time!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, okay!&#8221;</p>



<p>With my arm pressed against her cleavage, Neneka wasn&#8217;t embarrassed at all, but rather had a brave look on her face like a warrior who was about to go to war.</p>



<p>&#8211;After all, swimsuits made people bold&#8230;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right&#8230; or rather, it was buried&#8230; my arm…</p>



<p>With Neneka sticking close to me, we set off for the next pool.</p>


<br>


<p>Then, an hour later.</p>



<p>I was at the entrance of the huge indoor pool after getting dressed. I was currently waiting for Neneka to finish getting dressed and come out. My original plan was to play more, but we ended up going home quite early.</p>



<p>The reason was simple&#8230; Neneka said, &#8220;I would like to go home now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;I didn&#8217;t know why she lost so much energy&#8230;</p>



<p>While waiting for Neneka, I was thinking about the cause.</p>



<p>After the water slide ride, it should have been fine until we played in the glowing pool.</p>



<p>She held on to my arm and smiled as we moved, and we held each other&#8217;s hand all the way to the glowing pool.</p>



<p>We should have been as flirty as the couples flirting around us.</p>



<p>The&#8230; problem probably happened at the concession stand where we stopped to buy a drink afterwards. The old shopkeeper cheerfully asked her, &#8220;What would you like, little sister?&#8221; Neneka said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going home&#8221; right after the clerk cheerfully asked her.</p>



<p>I had to say &#8220;Excuse me, I&#8217;ll be back&#8221; to the old man who was pouting in the posture of asking for our order, and I had to follow Neneka to make sure that I didn&#8217;t lose sight of her&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8211;Why did she suddenly say she was leaving&#8230;?</p>



<p>I then tried to talk to Neneka, but she just gave me a small smile and said, &#8220;I want to go home now, I&#8217;m a little tired,&#8221; and didn&#8217;t tell me why exactly.</p>



<p>&#8211;Because the old man called her &#8220;sister?&#8221; No, but I wondered if that was shocking enough to make her want to leave&#8230;</p>



<p>Maybe I had done something that Neneka didn&#8217;t like. If that&#8217;s the case&#8230; </p>



<p>I was worried thinking about what to do…</p>



<p>While thinking of reasons for this and that, I waited for Neneka&#8230; Finally, I found Neneka walking towards me. She seemed to be in low spirits.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka&#8230; that’s it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her voice was more curt than usual. Neneka didn&#8217;t even look at me.</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t tell me I was the reason she wanted to leave?</p>



<p>Was she mad at me for unintentionally doing something she didn&#8217;t like?</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, are you mad at me&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad at you. Anyway, let&#8217;s go home soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka looked down, blurted out, and started to walk away.</p>



<p>I hurriedly followed Neneka out of the huge indoor pool facility.</p>



<p>Neneka seemed to really want to go home soon.</p>



<p>I was worried that she didn&#8217;t want to be with me.</p>



<p>&#8211;It might be a good idea to slow down and talk about this somewhere else.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure we can find some place to stop by afterwards. You know, a fresh juice shop that Neneka likes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I think I want to go straight home.&#8221;</p>



<p>She had a look that said, &#8220;I refuse to take a side trip.&#8221; She really had an aura of wanting to go home as soon as possible.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t good. This could be bad.</p>



<p>Could it be that Neneka had exhausted her affection for me&#8230;?</p>



<p>&#8220;You know&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s just go home, okay? Okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka was somewhat desperate and seemed to refuse to even engage in a conversation.</p>



<p>I walked a little behind Neneka, still depressed, and headed for the station without much conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crowded&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s summer vacation&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The train we boarded for home was packed. There seemed to be a big event nearby, and the return time seemed to coincide with those returning from the event.</p>



<p>I asked Neneka to stand in front of the door, so that I could protect her from being crushed by the other passengers. Neneka, in the enclosure of my arms and body, huffed and puffed a little hotly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry&#8230; I&#8217;m so close, it&#8217;s hot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Oh no, you don&#8217;t have to apologize. It&#8217;s hot in the train. I&#8217;m sorry too. I might smell a little sweaty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, not at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>



<p>What I smelled from Neneka was the unique smell of chlorine from the pool. I didn&#8217;t recognize the smell of sweat.</p>



<p>I knew that Neneka was often concerned about the smell of sweat and used sweat wipes and antiperspirant sprays at home.</p>



<p>To be honest, I didn&#8217;t think she needed to be that concerned about the smell of sweat, and if she hid it so well, I was rather curious about what Neneka&#8217;s sweat smelled like&#8230; Was I the only one who was concerned about that?</p>



<p>We finally had a little conversation, but Neneka was still fidgeting.</p>



<p>&#8211;If I had done something wrong, I wanted to apologize properly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry! I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re upset about, but if there&#8217;s something I&#8217;m not doing right, I&#8217;ll fix it, so please talk to me properly! I&#8217;m sorry for not being more perceptive!&#8221;</p>



<p>When I apologized to Neneka, the train&nbsp;began to move.</p>



<p>Neneka&#8217;s eyes fluttered.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230; you know, Daiki&#8230; it&#8217;s not that&#8230; I&#8217;m&#8230; umm&#8230; okay. I&#8217;ll talk to you&#8230; can you lend me your ear for a minute?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ear?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka, with a troubled look on her face, beckoned a little bit.</p>



<p>When I brought my ear closer, Neneka whispered to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad at you, I just&#8230; forgot… I put on my swimsuit from home&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? What?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was too loud and I couldn&#8217;t hear her well over the sound of the train.</p>



<p>I thought she said she forgot something.</p>



<p>&#8220;So I forgot…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? What did you forget?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I forgot my… underwear!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when I saw it. Neneka&#8217;s marshmallow breasts, which were not wrapped in&#8230; anything from the chest of Neneka&#8217;s one-piece dress.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, up and down?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah…&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka wriggled her body.</p>



<p>It seemed true that Neneka was now not clad in the two upper and lower garments that women were supposed to wear.</p>



<p>Wasn&#8217;t it the story of elementary school kids who went to the pool with their swimsuits on from home and forgot to bring underwear to wear on the way home?</p>



<p>The length of Neneka&#8217;s dress was short, and if she wasn&#8217;t careful, people around us might notice that she wasn&#8217;t wearing any underwear.</p>



<p>And why didn&#8217;t she tell me anything until we got on the train!?</p>



<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you just put your clothes on over your swimsuit?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought about that, but my bathing suit was damp, and I thought that it would be embarrassing if I got a funny stain on my clothes&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Thank goodness she wasn&#8217;t mad at&#8230; me. This wasn&#8217;t the right time to be reassured that she wasn&#8217;t mad at me.</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t the time to ask her why she said &#8220;I want to go home, now&#8221; at the pool.</p>



<p>I wouldn&#8217;t have blamed her for saying now that she should have at least waited until her swimsuit was dry and leave while wearing her swimsuit instead of her underwear&#8230; I was sure that Neneka was planning to leave without telling me that she wasn&#8217;t wearing any underwear.</p>



<p>We had already boarded the train, and having come this far, I had no choice but to support Neneka and return home while making sure that the people around us didn&#8217;t find out that she was without the most important body-part wears.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, no.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>While I was thinking, we arrived at the next station and more people boarded the train.</p>



<p>Pushed from behind, Neneka and I were in close contact.</p>



<p>&#8211;Mugyuu.</p>



<p>Between Neneka and I, Neneka&#8217;s marshmallow breasts were crushed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, are you okay? Are you in pain?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, I&#8217;m fine&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Although she said that she was fine, Neneka&#8217;s face was red.</p>



<p>She seemed embarrassed to have her breasts pressed against me.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sorry Neneka, but there&#8217;s nothing I could do about it, right now.</p>



<p>The marshmallow breasts, not encased in a bra, were fluffy. They changed shape as my body and Neneka&#8217;s moved with the swaying of the train.</p>



<p>And perhaps embarrassed to have her breasts pressed against me in a no-bra state, Neneka had an indescribably troubled expression on her face.</p>



<p>&#8211;Oh no. If she did this, my express train was going to start&#8230;!</p>



<p>The hassles were starting to board my express train. It was a rush of bother.</p>



<p>The voice of reason dressed as a station attendant shouting, &#8220;Please don&#8217;t get on the train!&#8221; The inside of my express train, crammed full of people&#8217;s troubles, was not air-conditioned, and the air was hot and humid.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah… nnnggg…&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Neneka jerked and twisted around.</p>



<p>The movement of Neneka&#8217;s body activated my express train.</p>



<p>The bothersome people were still trying to board the train that was about to run out of the desire line right away.</p>



<p>&#8220;The train is being sent back! Please get off!&#8221; and the reason of the station staff yelled at them.</p>



<p>My station platform was crowded. It was a big uncontrollable commotion due to all of the bothersome people who were only thinking about themselves.</p>



<p>At that moment, Neneka put her face close to my ear.</p>



<p>Then she whispered in a glazed voice, &#8220;Daiki…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, that&#8230; that…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? Where&#8217;s the pain?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not that… Daiki&#8217;s&#8230; Daiki&#8217;s express train is hitting…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? Oh, I&#8217;m sorry!&#8221;</p>



<p>I hurriedly stepped away to create some space between Neneka and I.</p>



<p>It was an irresistible force, but my express train, full of bother, was hitting Neneka.</p>



<p>I was truly sorry.</p>



<p>If this wasn&#8217;t Neneka, she would have yelled &#8220;molester&#8221; and the police would have caught me.</p>



<p>&#8211;&#8220;… Did she just say &#8220;Daiki&#8217;s express train?&#8221; Maybe she was wondering what kind of world I was developing right now in the world of bother.</p>



<p>I thought that Neneka was amazing as she gradually deepened her understanding of my world of troubles, but she finally read ahead with no hints.</p>



<p>I was so embarrassed that I was going to cry.</p>



<p>&#8211;&#8220;Mugyuu!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as my heart weakened, I was pushed again from behind.</p>



<p>My body was again close to Neneka, and there wasn&#8217;t a millimeter of space between us again.</p>



<p>What&#8217;s more. My express train was in contact with something moving.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, my hand is…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no. I&#8217;m sorry too. I&#8217;m leaving now&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps my express train was in contact with Neneka&#8217;s hand, which was holding the bag.</p>



<p>We tried to keep our distance, but we were no match for the pressure of a crowded train in the real world.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230; Oh, uh, are you okay? Does it hurt?&#8221;</p>



<p>With a red face, Neneka was in a panic. Even in this state, Neneka was kind enough not to get angry and worried about me. Too kind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it hurts&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Will it hurt&#8230; if I do this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>My express train was wrapped in warmth.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t need to see the situation with my eyes to know. Neneka held the bag with one hand and returned the other hand, seemingly accepting my express train with her palm.</p>



<p>Through the fabric of my pants, I felt the warmth of her hand.</p>



<p>Too kind, not the other way around&#8230;!!!</p>



<p>&#8220;Does it still hurt?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka-san, please. Please don&#8217;t move anymore&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, yeah!&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but be respectful.</p>



<p>Neneka took the master controller.</p>



<p>There was nothing more that I could do.</p>



<p>Whether my express train departed or not was in the hands of Neneka.</p>



<p>With the hands of this lovely goddess, my express train couldn&#8217;t only run through the desire line at explosive speed, but could also ascend directly to the heavens and push forward through the galaxy of love and desire.</p>



<p>But wait, I wasn&#8217;t really prepared for that.</p>



<p>Even astronauts did a lot of prep work before they went into space. If I wanted to go to the galaxy, I had to prepare myself accordingly. Otherwise, I would end up as a star of the galaxy.</p>



<p>My hands were sweating as I wondered whether my express train would depart first or whether our train would arrive at the station first.</p>



<p>&#8220;Get me out of here!&#8221; and the bothers were yelling.</p>



<p>I told you it was a round trip. &#8220;Get off the train!&#8221;</p>



<p>When the sound of the train started to pull off… Neneka and I were standing on the platform of the station closest to our home.</p>



<p>I got off at the station and let out a big sigh.</p>



<p>Thank goodness we&#8217;ve arrived&#8230;</p>



<p>Station platforms were hot, but compared to crowded trains, it was still better as the wind blew through.</p>



<p>The piercing blue sky woke up the troublesome people and they got off the express train they were boarding in a mature manner&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki, do you want to take a break somewhere until you settle down?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka asked me as if she was concerned about me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; I&#8217;m inclined to do that, but I&#8217;m sure Neneka wants to go home quickly, so let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sorry. Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Don&#8217;t forget, Neneka was in a no-underwear state right now.</p>



<p>She was less well equipped than level one villagers. I must bring her back to the safe zone of home as soon as possible.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t have time to wait for all the bothers to get off my express train.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go home quickly. It&#8217;s too much trouble if anyone we know finds out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah…&#8221;</p>



<p>I put a hat on Neneka&#8217;s head so that the direct sunlight wouldn&#8217;t be too hot, and put on a hat myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I made you feel so overwhelmed because I accidentally forgot my underwear&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, don&#8217;t worry so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you always don&#8217;t move for a while when that happens, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s…&#8221;</p>



<p>What should I say…? I guess I had a record of doing this in front of Neneka so it was only natural that she would worry about such things.</p>



<p>I always tried to be a gentleman in front of Neneka, but it was hard for the lower half of my body to read the air…</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m fine. It&#8217;s hot. Let&#8217;s go home quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I patted her head on the top of her hat, Neneka sighed &#8220;Haa&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Huh? Did I just do something wrong?</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; nothing&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>But, it didn&#8217;t look like it was nothing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, are you thirsty? Do you want me to buy you a drink?&#8221;</p>



<p>I headed for a vending machine set up on the side of the road.</p>



<p>We were on a hot train and something weird happened, so Neneka must have been thirsty.</p>



<p>Hydration was important. Especially on such a hot day.</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you want to drink, Neneka?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see&#8230; I would like some barley tea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Copy that. Chillin&#8217; and poppin&#8217;&#8230; Oh my goodness.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka laughed as I handed her a plastic bottle of barley tea that came out of the vending machine with a clunk.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, that&#8217;s a funny call.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m often told by my friends that I talk to myself a lot, but I tend to talk when I&#8217;m doing something. I often say things like, &#8220;YOKORASE!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I like it. That&#8217;s what I like about you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you…&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a little embarrassing, but I thought it was okay if it made Neneka laughed.</p>



<p>As I was about to walk away after watching Neneka take a sip of her barley tea, she tugged on my arm.</p>



<p>&#8220;What? You won&#8217;t buy anything for you, Daiki?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; yeah. We&#8217;re almost home, so I guess I&#8217;ll wait until after we get home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s drink together! You should rehydrate yourself too. It was hot on the train.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka offered a plastic bottle to me.</p>



<p>Needless to say, it was her drink.</p>



<p>Seeing Neneka trying to share with me as a matter of course, I was thinking that we were totally like lovers…</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m like a little sister after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Next to me, who was gratefully enjoying the barley tea, Neneka muttered sadly.</p>



<p>&#8220;… Hmm? It&#8217;s true that Neneka is good at pretending to be my sister, but&#8230; Oh, maybe you want to be my sister-in-law?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m talking about&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are always firm, care a lot, and follow my screw-ups very well, which is great… You are so dependable that I feel like you are my Onii-chan. Compared to that, I&#8217;m…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? Compared to that, you are&#8230; what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nah, it&#8217;s nothing. Daiki… sorry about today. We had to leave the pool earlier than planned, and I was a nuisance on the way home because of my screw-up… I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be fine. I had a good time at the pool, and I got&#8230; in trouble on the way home, so I guess it&#8217;s both our fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we go home&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;… Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka started walking, and I walked alongside her.</p>



<p>A normal couple on a date would probably break up around here and not see each other until the next date.</p>



<p>But, we weren&#8217;t. When we would get home we would be brother and sister-in-law.</p>



<p>Thanks to living together, I was happy to see her everyday during summer vacation.</p>



<p>But because we saw each other everyday, it was difficult to keep our distance.</p>



<p>&#8211;Something seemed to be bothering her, but since she wouldn&#8217;t answer when I asked, I guess that I shouldn&#8217;t pester her any further…</p>



<p>It was important to leave Neneka alone when she wanted to be left alone.</p>



<p>If Neneka looked gloomy for days, I would ask her again at that time.</p>
