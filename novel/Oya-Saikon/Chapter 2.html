<h3>Chapter 2</h3>

<p>Not too close, not too far… We were still walking together, but were also keeping a distance between us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We walked silently without talking.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We walked several hundred meters away before our house was no longer in sight. After that, we turned around the corner and sighed heavily at the same time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I smiled involuntarily without a thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;As I thought, it’s really nerve-racking when we are in front of our mother.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… my mind is just not at ease when we are at home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka also started smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we headed towards the station, we looked back on the events that happened this weekend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Our parents looked really happy didn’t they? Perhaps, seeing us on good terms made them relieved.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Usually, if two classmates were to suddenly live together, the amount of awkwardness flowing in the air would be too much at first…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well, I don’t think cobras and mongooses really cared for each other while keeping their distance&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They were trying to reach a comfortable distance from each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cobra and mongoose were natural enemies. They did not try and get into a comfortable distance while engaging each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s been two months since Neneka and I started dating, there are times when we actually start communicating with one another naturally. On the contrary, I’m glad that they didn’t grow suspicious of us because of that.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well… I think that our parents are having fun being in their own world right now…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That’s true as well…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I had to see our parents doting over each other so much yesterday that we never wanted to see it again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother had work today so thankfully we didn’t have to see them flirt in front of us for that long. However, seeing our parents’ eyes turn into a heart-shape when they were near each other kind of made us wonder what they were thinking…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we had seen our parents being lovey-dovey for each other from birth, it would have probably been a completely different story altogether. However, minding the fact that we had lost one of our parents in our childhood and then seeing this happen. The gap created was terribly daunting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Ah… Yes, yes. We could completely understand that they had been devoting themselves to raise us for all these years, and we also understood how happy they were to be able to finally live their life with someone they truly liked, and we wouldn’t bother them regarding that. BUT… have some restraint damnit!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was what it made us say in reaction, a sweet sight that made us want to vomit in the inside whenever that happened in front of us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though they were not kissing in front of us, but watching them expressing their love for each other constantly kind of made us cringe.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Somehow, if we saw that and reacted, we had a feeling that we lost… in a different sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My parents were trying to squeeze out every bit of happiness for each other and almost everyday.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So much so that even if their children were unnaturally close to each other, they wouldn’t even be suspicious of their relationship.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, aren’t you also &#8220;Torii&#8221; now, Daiki? Should I call you Torii-kun at school?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka leaned her head and asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, that’s right. Neneka, I forgot to tell you. On the family registration, I am Torii Daiki, but I had my mother talk with the school so that I could still go by &#8220;Morita.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh? Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it would be kind of embarrassing if my family name changed all of a sudden. Even my mom is keeping hers at work. Although I didn’t hear the complete details of my mom’s re-marriage, I did talk to her about this issue, and I thought that it was good enough. Well, it’s also that, I don’t want to be treated as Neneka’s brother at school.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Me too! I also don’t want anyone to treat me as Daiki’s little sister besides our family. I’m also glad that our thoughts were alike. I guess if we keep quiet about it at school, we won’t have to worry about people finding out.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Besides that fact that we now had common surnames, there was only one Torii present in our grade. What&#8217;s more was that, we were perceived by others as someone quite close with one another.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I suddenly happened to call myself &#8220;Torii-kun,&#8221; our classmates would probably become suspicious of a possible special relationship between Neneka and I immediately.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;The teachers will know, but I don’t think the students will get the message unless I tell them myself. So I want to ask you, do you want to tell the people around you that we’ve become siblings, Neneka?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh? No way!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was an immediate answer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was still surprised that she answered without hesitation, Neneka followed up fidgeting.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, just to clarify. I’m not exactly embarrassed to address Daiki as &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; okay? It’s just that I don’t want to be made fun of! I’m sure you know that there are people who make a big fuss just because they have two classmates living with each other in the same house, right? &#8220;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, umm… Come to think of it. It’s true.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Some people did have wild imaginations, and we would definitely be troubled if we were asked questions that would delve into our privacy. It would definitely make school life uneasy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, how about we bury down any info in school that said we recently became siblings, okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm. Let’s do it that way.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We would keep the fact that were now siblings a secret at school. When that was decided, a question suddenly came up and I asked Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That’s right, just a question, but did you tell anyone that we were dating?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Had Neneka told anyone since we started dating? It wasn&#8217;t like we shouldn’t tell anyone about it or anything so…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;U-Umm… I haven’t told anyone yet. My friends don’t usually talk about love or things like that… so it was kind of hard for me to say it anyways. How about you Daiki?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Actually, in my case, since I&#8217;m an examinee, I only got friends who would criticize me for having enough free time to get into a relationship… All in all, I didn’t tell anyone either.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;As expected… I’m likely to be to be told the same.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Whether we had examinations or not, people should be free to go out with each other whenever they wanted. Though, since we didn’t like to stand out in our class, we didn’t want to become a part of the latest gossip around the school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Right, let’s hide the fact that we’re a couple at school. It could be dangerous if our classmates found out since rumors like those could easily reach our parents. Well, even if we somehow keep our parents from knowing, then our classmates would make a fuss about us living together under the same roof as siblings-in-law, which may even go out of control.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I said that, Neneka smiled bitterly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That would definitely cause a scene. It would be hard trying to study for the entrance exams if that happened…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The fact that we were dating must be kept a secret from both our parents and even our friends at school.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to all of that, our classmates must never find out that I became Neneka’s brother-in-law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With that our conversation came to an end.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I was worried whether Neneka was really okay with this conclusion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Girls loved talking about love. Maybe Neneka also wanted to excitedly talk about love with her friends.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? What’s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka tilted her head, noticing that I was in deep thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, that… Neneka, I wondered if it&#8217;s really okay with you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Won’t you feel lonely? You won’t be able to tell anyone that we’re dating.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka denied, &#8220;U-Umm,&#8221; as she looked up at the sky. Then she continued with a bright tone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I might indeed feel a little lonely, but… I think it’s also exciting to go out with you while trying not to get caught!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You are positive…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s important to live positively!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, exactly as you said.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We were quite carefree.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Most of our classmates knew that we were on good terms without knowing that we were actually dating. So, we didn’t have to force ourselves in any way to hide that we were actually dating.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If we professed ourselves to be lovers at school, there was a risk that the rumors would reach the ears of our parents.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, if we didn’t reveal our relationship to anyone at school, we could continue with our gentle and secret relationship longer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, it’s going to be bad if we walk together to and from school, won’t it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, Neneka said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well… if we go to and from school together, people will eventually figure out that we live under the same roof.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, so let’s make some rules!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? Rules?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, it’s rules to be able to keep dating while living as siblings-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka pointed to the sky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Rule 1! If we leave the house together, we separate the moment we arrive at the train station! I’ll ride a different train car than you, Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I see. Understood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I nodded and continued to listen to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, what about on our way home from school? We’ve been studying together until school ended and walked to the station afterwards. We won’t be walking back to the station together anymore?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm… True… Then for rule 2, if we walk home together from school to the nearest station, we’ll take different train cars after that… But if we by chance bump into each other on our way home from the station, then we can go home together again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;By chance, huh.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Such a good controlled coincidence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But, doesn’t that mean we’ll be travelling in different parts of the train.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I muttered that, Neneka looked at my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What happened? Any objections?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm, if we are in different train cars, I won’t be able to protect Neneka if you are attacked by a molester…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh!? I-It’s okay! I’ve never been molested before! If anything happens, I’ll send a message to you asking for help as soon as possible…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm! Rule 3! If your little sister is in trouble, it’s okay for Onii-chan to help on the double!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, I will be helping you as a brother-in-law in the end, huh. I understand.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I think it would be better for us to reveal that we’re siblings-in-law rather than a couple if one of our secrets had to be exposed… Well, I don’t think that would actually happen. Thank you for being concerned about me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking at Neneka’s soft expression on her face made me a little red and shy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I came to live in the same house as her, I was able to see various aspects of Neneka. Thus, I started to think that Neneka was indeed cute in a more than usual sense.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If someone were to do something evil to Neneka, I wouldn&#8217;t forgive them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be it as a brother-in-law or even a boyfriend, I would always continue to protect Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I swore this to my heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>School was over without any delays, and it was now evening. There was no committee job today and we were not enrolled in any club activities either. We began to follow the rules we decided on this morning and headed to the station together, and then separated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I arrived at the nearest train station to my house by myself and went to the supermarket in the neighborhood to shop.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I was at school today, I exchanged messages with Neneka and got a grocery list that she needed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The neighbors would eventually know that we were siblings-in-law. But if I was discovered buying food with a girl in the same high school uniform, I didn’t know what the people around us would think.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I didn’t like to standout too much, I proposed to Neneka that I could do the shopping alone. I was more accustomed to shopping here because I had lived here for a longer time. Moreover, I couldn’t let Neneka carry all the heavy groceries by herself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Instead, I asked Neneka if she could return home first and do the house cleaning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;I’m home.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Welcome back…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I arrived, Neneka came to the front door to pick up the shopping bags.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Isn’t it heavy? Is it okay?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m all fine, but well,&nbsp;I was surprised by how many things I had to buy for four people since I had provided for only two people before this.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, I’m sorry… I didn’t know how much Daiki would eat, so I asked you to buy quite a bit more than what was needed. Maybe because I thought you would eat more than my dad.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;O-Oh! That’s really helpful! Because I want to eat a lot of dishes made by Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Can you help me, with the prep?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I stood in the kitchen and started preparing the ingredients for dinner along with Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s main dish was meat-stuffed peppers. I was cutting cabbages into thin strips while Neneka was next to me preparing the meat and stuffing them into the peppers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki, you’re good at using knives.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Perhaps because my mom taught me? Well, I’m not actually interested in cooking. I thought having canned food would be good enough for me whenever my mom would return home late. However, my mom lectured me on &#8220;being able to make food by yourself&#8221; and taught me the fundamentals…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m all self-taught so I am envious of Daiki. My dad’s cooking sense is utterly devastating, because of that I’ve had this sense of mission that I had to do something about it, and worked hard to accomplish it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I guess then Neneka has a talent for cooking right. The stew that you made yesterday was very delicious.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I brought up the taste of the stew I ate yesterday, Neneka laughed softly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… Thank you…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, after baking those meat-stuffed peppers, Neneka made a delicious looking egg drop soup quickly, and dinner was ready.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was almost nineteen o’clock. It was about time for my mother and Neneka’s father to come back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was preparing the table for dinner, I heard someone talking in front of the door.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, I guess they are back?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka reacted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However immediately, she looked dismayed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Arre? Doesn’t it feel like they’re in a fight?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No way, was my mother and Neneka’s father fighting?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the entrance to the living room, the voice of a man and a woman arguing with each other permeated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One was definitely Neneka’s father. However, it seemed that the female voice was not that of my mother…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that time, the living room door opened vigorously, and the person who was with Neneka’s father made an appearance.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;I have no objection to your re-marriage! However, what does it mean to have a man and a woman in their teens living under the same roof!! What would you do if something were to happen to Neneka!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>There was an old woman in a kimono who came into the living room while yelling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As soon as she came in, her eyes met mine and she glared right at me with a sharp gaze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Are you that person!? The boy who now lives with Neneka and is trying to ogle at her maiden body?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although I had just vowed to protect Neneka from evil perverts this morning, I never thought that I would be labelled as an evil pervert myself. Rather, what did I even do to be blamed like this?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I solidified out of sheer confusion, Neneka’s father tried to talk to that mysterious woman.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Mom, calm down! Daiki-kun is not that type of child!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And Neneka chimed in for support.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Grandmother! Onii-chan is my brother-in-law.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Apparently, the woman who suddenly appeared, seemed to be Neneka’s grandmother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s father apologized to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m sorry about this Daiki-kun… When my mom heard the news that I was going to remarry, and Neneka was going to live with one of her classmates, she immediately bought tickets and flew here from Okinawa. She loves Neneka dearly and is often worried about her.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, the woman opened her eyes and yelled at Neneka’s father.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m not worried! I came here just because you’re a loose man! All high school boys are beasts in clothes! Do you even know what that means!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Beasts… As expected of my mom, it’s rude you know?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ryosuke, you also had such a time in your life, didn’t you!? Did you forget about yourself too?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Heh!? What are you even talking about!? There was no such time ever in my life!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s father desperately tried to deny those claims. His urgency regarding this matter was on the contrary a little suspicious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I’m against Neneka living with him! If you don’t listen to me then I’ll take Neneka to my house!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The harsh voice of Neneka’s grandmother echoed all over the living room. Even Neneka was stupefied by this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Because she was against Neneka and I living together, she wanted to take Neneka to her house!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly I was recognized as an enemy by her grandmother, who loved her grandchild dearly. I was sweating coldly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After approximately one hour went by after Neneka’s grandmother rushed in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>We were eating dinner for the time being… Of course, with grandmother-in-law, with us.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;On days like these, why did my mother get home late… What was I supposed to do now?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s grandmother was praising Neneka’s dishes and seemed to have regained her good mood too.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka is such a culinary genius… You will surely become a good wife. This shredded cabbage looks especially professional.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That shredded cabbage… is something that Onii-chan did for me, though…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing Neneka’s words, the smile disappeared from her grandmother&#8217;s face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Humph! In that case, it’s better to eat weeds growing in this area!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A strong back-hand slap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing that incredible change in attitude I had a small smile break out onto my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Neneka wasn’t laughing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Grandmother! Don’t say such mean words! Onii-chan helped me with all he got!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Finally, the anger of Neneka exploded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This retort in turn made her grandmother shocked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m just worried about you, Neneka. There&#8217;s no man who can shred cabbage so well! I’m certain that he has even shredded the hearts of a thousand women and sliced them into stripes!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I haven’t done that though!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t have any reason to join in the conversation between Neneka and her grandmother, but I just couldn’t overlook whatever she just said about me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Also, I never heard about any relation between finely shredded cabbage and the shredder of a thousand human hearts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka! I won’t say anything bad so, let’s go home together with your grandmother! It’s dangerous to be here!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don’t want to. If that happens, I will also have to transfer to another high school right!? It’s absolutely impossible to transfer to another school in the third year of high school! Besides, Onii-chan will definitely not do anything to me!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You just started living together the other day, as if you could see what would happen next! Even if he’s wearing a mask of a gentleman right now, in due time, he will definitely reveal his true colors! It will be too late after you get eaten up!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan would never do something that terrible! Right, Onii-chan!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka asked me and I gave her a quick reply.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes! I swear, I would never!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Haven’t you perhaps already peeped during Neneka’s bath!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I didn’t!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be fine it was not a lie per se.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>… If anything, I was the one who was peeped at.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, because of this grandmother, I remembered the incident that took place on the first day of our cohabitation, and my face got a little hot.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, grandmother-in-law immediately said without missing a beat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Did you imagine? Neneka’s naked body.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Your face is getting redder. Did you imagine something shameful?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I haven’t!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;What the… this grandmother… She couldn’t be underestimated.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I just remembered about what happened that time, but it shouldn’t have appeared on my face, and yet, she was somehow able to guess what I had in my mind?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I sealed my lips tightly to tighten up my imaginations.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This grandmother did not miss any of my stirred expressions. If I wasn&#8217;t careful, she would likely see through my heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fufu… you’re just a two years old newborn baby. It’s useless to be a gentleman only on the top. You smell heavily of a beast about to attack!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law laughed provocatively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I got unintentionally stuffy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then as a response, Neneka’s father also complained to his mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, no, no, there’s a limit to being prejudiced! Also, don’t say anything rude to Daiki-kun from here on out.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m worried about Neneka! What would you do if my precious Neneka got harmed because of this!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Please stop doubting Daiki-kun! Daiki-kun is also an important part of my family!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing my father-in-law say those words made my heart shake a bit.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Family&#8230; I liked the ring of that word.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even Neneka’s father must have been worried about having her adolescent daughter and an adolescent boy live together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Neneka’s father decided to believe in me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was sure my mother had told him a lot about me. He must have judged that I was a person credible of his trust from various little bit of information. Without that trust, he wouldn’t have had his daughter Neneka live with me without saying a word to her about me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, Neneka’s father wasn’t the only one who believed in me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, my mother must have also believed in me. Even if I lived together with a girl my age, I wouldn’t do anything that would be described as me losing my way…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;For my parents who had so much trust in me, I couldn’t let grandmother-in-law say whatever she liked anymore. I had to prove her that I was safe for Neneka and have her allow Neneka to live with me!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, how would you know that I’m safe for her to stay around?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law&#8217;s hawk-like eyes looked at me with a piercing gaze.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, I also looked at her without backing off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We have just become a family. My mom and Neneka’s father look very happy together. I want to support the happiness of my parents. With that in mind, I have been trying my best to get along with Neneka until now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law watched me speak without batting an eye-lid.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt my throat going sour in thirst.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If Neneka is separated because of me, Neneka’s father and my mom would surely feel lonely! I don’t want my parents to feel that way! I want the four of us to live as a happy family! Then… what will make you allow Neneka and I to live together?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law didn’t say anything. She didn’t say a thing, but she stared at me. Neneka and her father were holding their breaths while watching over what grandmother-in-law would say. The dining table was wrapped in silence for a while.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In that quiet room, grandmother-in-law slowly drank her green tea.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then she wiped off her mouth with a handkerchief then, she looked at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then, let me see that iron-like reasoning that&#8217;s running in your nerves. If I find no possibility of Neneka getting harmed, I will take my leave without a word.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then&#8230; how should I show it?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was confident that I could act reasonably in front of Neneka, but what should I do to show her this iron-like reasoning of mine?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It would have been nice if I could just open the door between my chest and showed my iron-colored reason, saying, &#8220;This is my iron-like reason!&#8221; However it wasn&#8217;t that simple.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was still confused, grandmother-in-law snorted and stood from her seat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Take me to your room!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When she said that, I also stood up. Next to me, Neneka was looking at me anxiously.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Grandmother, can I come along with you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps unable to have any more patience, Neneka stood up while asking her grandmother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, grandmother-in-law didn’t give her permission that easily.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, wait here with your father because it’s dangerous&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I don’t like it! I’m going too! If you say Onii-chan is such a dangerous person then, show me the proof!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I trust Onii-chan, so I want my grandmother to also know that Onii-chan is a kind and upright person!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing Neneka’s serious eyes, her grandmother also seemed to get a bit flustered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She nodded reluctantly and allowed Neneka to accompany her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay, I understand… then come along with me.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This way, Neneka, her grandmother and I went to my room.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And after a while, along with Neneka and her grandmother, we arrived in front of my room on the second floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;This is my room.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing my words, grandmother-in-law entered my room and she began to gaze at every corner of my room ever so carefully.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;There doesn’t seem to be anything suspicious from what I can see upfront…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, that was a given.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing grandmother-in-law muttering these things, I retorted in my heart.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Till now I had been living alone with my mother, and she had absolutely zero delicacy when it came to being mindful about me. While cleaning the room, if she by chance found any of my treasures, exciting manga or magazines, she would have the most inhuman response by just arranging them on my study desk.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought it would have been nice to pretend not to notice even if she did notice it. But, why bother to specifically arrange them neatly in numerical order?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could actually imagine my mother looking inside and think, &#8220;So this is my son’s hobby and preferences huh… Humu-Humu,&#8221; thinking that, I got so embarrassed that my heart breathed its last.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In order to not let this form of torture happen again, I made sure to thoroughly camouflage the storage location so as not to repeat any of the mistakes I made in the past.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Taking that aside, how are you going to test my iron-like reasoning?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I said that, grandmother-in-law took something out of her bag and slammed it in front of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m going to test your reason with this.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law came up with a magazine in which a gravure idol on the cover was wearing a bathing suit while posing suggestively.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If you really have an iron-like reasoning, you shouldn’t be able to think anything perverted even if you see this… shouldn’t you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law held a poker face while she waited for me to react to the magazine. Still, I remained calm and collected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Moreover, under these circumstances, I didn’t think any reasonable man would be aroused even if they were shown a gravure idol magazine in such an impromptu interrogation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seems that I would be questioned if my line of sight was shifted a little. I strolled around the pages of the magazine and thought…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I wondered if she really thought she could test my iron-like reasoning with this…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First of all, did she take the trouble to buy this for me…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>That gravure idol posing on the cover… Was it a coincidence that she looked similar to Neneka? Or did this grandmother purposefully choose this idol since it resembled Neneka the most?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I almost laughed when I imagined this grandmother choosing an adult magazine desperately at the corner of a convenience store.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Dangerous, dangerous… If I showed her a grin now, she would definitely misinterpret the situation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I kept a poker face and tried to kill any hint of laughter that I might had.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Hmm. It seems you have enough mental willpower to remain unfazed by this level of a trick.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Naturally.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as I said that, grandmother-in-law wrinkled her nose unfavorably.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Was it my win then?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;With this, does it prove that I am a safe existence for Neneka?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With a severe look on my face, I asked this question to Neneka’s grandmother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was doubtful that these tests would actually prove that anyone would be a rational person to begin with. Anyways, since this person had put me through this test, it should be fine as long as I could convince her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, grandmother-in-law was far from being convinced.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Not yet… This is just the beginning. The real test will start from here on out.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law approached Neneka and stood behind her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was she planning to do?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The stress in both Neneka and I rose.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And while Neneka and I watched. Grandmother-in-law…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Well, how about this?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly, grandmother-in-law rolled up Neneka’s uniform skirt…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because of her bold action, now Neneka’s underwear was exposed in front of my eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now even if her skirt came down and hid her panties’ existence, the image of Neneka’s underwear was firmly burnt into my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Pink…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was bad, really bad. I shouldn’t get flustered now…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter what I saw, I mustn’t get flustered now. One by one, I needed to erase these emotions that were appearing.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, my poker face was already gone.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It wasn&#8217;t because I saw Neneka’s underwear. It was instead because, my mixed stirred-up emotions caused by the actions taken by this grandmother’s unexpected and bold behavior.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Who, in their right state of mind, would ever think that their own grandmother would roll their precious granddaughter’s skirt in such a place? No one, right? Or so I thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even Neneka wouldn’t have thought about that. Naturally, Neneka was even more stirred-up than me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;G-G-G-Gran-n-n-nd-mother! Wha-wha-what-what are you even thinking doing this!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s face was bright red.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps she was too embarrassed, but it looked as if she was about to cry, her eyes were holding back her tears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this old lady didn’t even bother to check on Neneka at all. She was more concerned about whether my face cracked and whether I was a pervert or not.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oya-Oya? It seems that you got a little flustered there. Don’t tell me that you got lustful seeing my granddaughter&#8217;s panties now, did you?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While looking at me, grandmother-in-law smiled triumphantly showing her own victory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next to her, Neneka was still trying to hold back her tears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I saw such a state of Neneka in front of me, I heard something snap inside me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Now you understand, don’t you? Your own shallowness. Then, I will be taking Neneka home with me…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Just wait there for a second.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My voice was colder and lower than usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I tolerated being one-sidedly attacked until now, being hopeful… that we could understand each other if I showed and proved my sincerity, you know? But apparently, even after all and everything of that, it was still beyond your comprehension, wasn’t it…!?&#8221;</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Wha-What is it now? After looking inside Neneka’s skirt, somehow your appearance changed drastically… So, you were a beast after all!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Beast, beast… You sound like a broken toy… LEARN TO NOTICE THE CONSEQUENCS OF YOUR OWN ACTIONS!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My anger exploded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These emotions I was able to suppress and control till now had finally reached their boiling point.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My feelings erupted out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I only reacted the way I did because of YOU, you old lady! Out of nowhere, you suddenly decide to embarrass Neneka to the point of tears! I understand that you want to see if I’m trustworthy, but to use your own granddaughter to pull such a cheap trick. You should be ashamed of yourself. You purposefully skirted YOUR OWN GRANDDAUGHTER, someone you said was important to you, and in front of a guy whom you were yet to trust as if it wasn’t a big deal! DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU DID!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing me so serious, grandmother-in-law perhaps got shocked to her core.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She probably never expected that I would have gotten so angry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No, rather, even I didn’t know that I would get so angry…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Saying whatever I wanted to, and then taking a long deep breath, I looked at grandmother-in-law all over again. She was stunned to the ground.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was getting worried about grandmother-in-law who just stood there, speechless and with her mouth hanging half-open. I was starting to panic a little.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Oh God. Perhaps, I might have said a bit too much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feeling regretful, I called out to her in a fearful voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm… I’m sorry for suddenly raising my voice out so loudly… Maybe I said a bit too much… Are you okay…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I didn’t see my grandparents that often, so I didn’t know how to treat and talk with elderly people.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And since I didn’t know why, I became worried thinking about what would happen if due to my negligence, her heart was strained and thus felt sick.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And, at that time… grandmother-in-law muttered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;A… nii?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… It has only been three days since you became brother and sister, but to think that your brotherly instinct had already sprouted…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? Huh!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn’t understand the meaning behind those words muttered by grandmother-in-law dumbfoundedly, so I tilted my head to one side.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then she, who had been dazed for a while, bowed down towards me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m sorry…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;The way you got angry at me was exactly the way an elder brother would have done while trying to protect his little sister.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Someone like that… No, you said your name was Daiki, right? There&#8217;s no way Daiki-kun would hurt Neneka in any way…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law took out a handkerchief and wiped off her eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That was marvelously done, Daiki-kun. For me to doubt someone with such strong rationality and pride, characterizing an elder brother such as you, I feel pathetic. If it’s Daiki-kun, I know it’ll be fine. I will believe in you, Daiki-kun.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the first time, I received a kind look from grandmother-in-law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Her gentle smiling face looked just like Neneka’s.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Th-Thank you very much!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My face remained half-smirked where a part was relieved to learn that I had finally been understood, while the other part, had mixed feelings remembering that I had to resort to lash out at her to make her understand.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, unlike me, Neneka seemed genuinely happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Grandmother, thank you for understanding!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who had been holding back her tears until just now, smiled, and the shock of having her skirt flipped seemed to have already been blown away.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, I guess all’s well that ends well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I would be able to live in peace with Neneka since her grandmother no longer saw me as a threat…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was thinking about this&#8230; grandmother-in-law suddenly said something scary while still smiling.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But we never know how Daiki-kun will change over time… Daiki-kun, if you dare do anything to my precious granddaughter then be prepared to lose your important thing.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My lower abdomen cringed in panic.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law was indeed smiling, but her falcon-like sharp eyes were keeping my bad son in complete check.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Why were they all trying to steal my most important thing away from me!? First my mother, now grandmother-in-law. Whatever happened, they would just start aiming for my manhood.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this rate, let alone trying to lay my hands on Neneka, if they even found out that Neneka and I were dating, I couldn’t think of all the hell that might happen to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I had to carefully hide the fact that Neneka and I were dating so that no one ever found out…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was relieved that I was approved to live with Neneka, but I just couldn’t stay relaxed and unconcerned yet.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The next morning.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our family saw grandmother-in-law off as she returned home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s father said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Mom, have a safe trip home… I’m sorry I can’t properly send you off because of work.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s fine. It’s not a big deal to begin with,&#8221; she curtly replied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Neneka, I’m glad I got to see your face. Next time, come visit grandmother’s house too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s grandmother did look really kind… although only when she looked at Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka answered back with a gentle smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Someday we’ll all go on a trip to your house together!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And grandmother-in-law bowed to my mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Sana-san, please take care of Ryosuke and Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother came home late from work yesterday, but she seemed to have been talking to grandmother-in-law ever since she came back.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Grandmother-in-law had a very friendly atmosphere as she said goodbye at the entrance…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed like the woman who cried calling me a &#8220;beast&#8221; yesterday was just a lie.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The grandmother-in-law, who was like a demon at that time, seemed to be a different person.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay, I’ll get going.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When grandmother-in-law was just about to leave through the front door with a smile, she suddenly turned and looked back at me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki-kun too, I will ask you to be very careful ok?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Nope, she was the same grandmother-in-law as that time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It felt like the aura of a demon was still floating behind her and she could pierce me any moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>She still had a smile on her face so, how could she be so skilled…?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes… I understand.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I said that with my most serious face, grandmother-in-law nodded in satisfaction and left.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the figure of grandmother-in-law disappeared from sight, Neneka and her father walked inside while talking about grandmother-in-law.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At that time, I secretly asked my mother.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Was this the first time you and Neneka’s grandmother met each other?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Hearing this question, my mother twisted her neck a little.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I guess this was the first time I’ve actually met her face-to-face… She was a resident of Okinawa, so I couldn’t go and see her unless I took time off from work.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Didn’t you talk about me to her?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I did mention her about you, although it seems that she couldn’t hear me well due to poor connection. She eventually found out about you for the first time when Ryosuke-san called her on the move-in day. I believe that was why she flew all the way here in a rush.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Please tell her properly… because of that, I was treated really badly.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I looked at my mother with scornful eyes but, she simply laughed and said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Isn’t that fine. Because of that now you’ve been properly acknowledged. Also, if you don’t prepare for school now, you’ll be late.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh, that’s right!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hurried to the washroom to brush my teeth.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I passed by, the washroom door was open and Neneka stood there gargling water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry…!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s okay! I just finished brushing my teeth.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka smiled while wiping her mouth with a towel.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then I guess I can brush my teeth now as well.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Four toothbrushes were lined up by the sink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Until recently, there were only me and my mother’s toothbrushes here and, it felt somehow strange.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And to top it off, one of them was my girlfriend’s toothbrush…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gently took my toothbrush and wet it with water.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, suddenly Neneka raised her voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So, Daiki is on the side that wets his toothbrush before using it too, huh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hmm? Yeah somewhat… I just wash it before using it.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, so that’s why&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I heard that it’s wrong to wet your toothbrush before brushing your teeth, but I tend to get it wet unconsciously, so I’m relieved that Daiki and I are on the same page together.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Huh? Eh? Wait, so we shouldn’t wet our toothbrush wet first!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;A wet toothbrush makes it easier to foam up while brushing so it seems to take less time. That’s why you’re supposed to put toothpaste on the brush without wetting it. At least, that’s the information I seemed to receive one day while watching TV. Ever since then, whenever I wet my toothbrush, my dad would nag me continuously, telling me it was wrong…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Oh so that’s how it is. Well, in my case, I guess I&#8217;m fine with how I&#8217;m doing it now… Well, in short I just need to brush till it’s clean right?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah! Yeah! That’s exactly right!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While I started brushing my teeth, Neneka leaned against the wall and nodded.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ever since we started living together this Saturday, every time I get to know Daiki better, I start feeling glad that I fell in love with such a guy…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s words made my heart beat faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But suddenly I became uneasy and closed the bathroom door</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… If you ask me, I think it’s bad.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, I see… I’m really sorry. There’s also the matter of my grandmother, and it seems like, if we’re found to be dating each other we might get in big trouble.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After brushing my teeth, I rinsed my mouth and washed my face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka gave me a towel from the side, so I wiped my face with it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You’re welcome, Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;When we’re at home, I have no choice but to be your elder brother. I guess I will have to get used to being called that.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That’s right. In order to be with you, I will pretend to be your little sister, so even Onii-chan has to do his best too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka timidly touched my hand, as her thin white fingers intertwined mine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;But when we’re alone, I will always be your girlfriend…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka looked up at me shyly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Staring at her big eyes, my throat gurgled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Of course, I know… Even if I’m pretending to be your elder brother, in my heart, I will always be Neneka’s boyfriend…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Umm…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even after Neneka nodded, she didn’t take her eyes off me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Don’t tell me, was this a chance…!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I tightly grasped her hand with our fingers still intertwined, Neneka also responded back with the same.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time it had to be the one.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Luckily, my mouth was in perfect condition. There was nothing to fear.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I brought my face closer, Neneka closed her eyes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could do this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This time, it was definitely a could-do-it moment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Me and Neneka’s first time…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Gacha.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Suddenly there was a feeling that the door would open.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka and I moved away from each other at the speed like two magnets with the same polarity that came too close would.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The one who opened the door was Neneka’s father.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Arre? So both of you were here together…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes! The timing of brushing our teeth crossed at the same time!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Barely safe!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My heart was pounding &#8220;dub-dub&#8221; as I continued talking with Neneka’s father with a smile.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki-kun, I’m sorry about my mom yesterday… It must have been really tough…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It seemed that Neneka’s father was worried about me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, no, it’s all fine! I’m glad everything came to a perfect conclusion, so I’m fine!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While replying, I wiped the strange sweat that appeared on my forehead.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though we understood that it would be a ton of trouble if we were found out, what were we even trying to do just now? To try to kiss each other in the washroom when we never knew when my mother or Neneka’s father might come in…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka half-hid her reddened face with a towel and hurriedly left the bathroom, saying…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I have to change into my uniform quickly…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I have to change clothes soon. Father-in-law, I will be excusing myself first then.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Hahaha. Whenever I hear Daiki-kun call me father-in-law, it feels like Neneka turned into a bride.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I took a good look at Neneka’s father as he said something unprecedented, it looked a little like he was starting to his hold tears in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I couldn’t believe this… Was he perhaps getting lonely imagining the time when Neneka would go away from him to her bride-groom?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s father gently wiped his lower eye petal with his index finger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah… I’m sorry, it was just all of a sudden. Even though being Daiki-kun’s father-in-law doesn’t mean that.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That’s right! It doesn’t mean anything like that!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. I know, I know. That’s why please call me that way without holding back.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes. I got it!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Oya-Oya. Even though Neneka’s father said that he totally believed in me yesterday. I felt like he would be agitated if he was to find out that I was Neneka’s boyfriend all along…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gave up the washroom to Neneka’s father and thought so while running up the stairs to the second floor.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Let’s make more rules so that no one finds out we’re dating!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On the way from my house to the station, I made a proposal to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then, Neneka smiled softly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Last time, we decided up to rule 3, but now we will make new continuations, right? I thought I was the only one who was getting excited about making rules for our relationship. Still, it kind of makes me happy to see Daiki also eager to make rules too.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;It’s bad if our relationship is found out, and all the things that made us feel tense and some sort of crisis just keep on happening… Thus, I thought it was important to make rules and to follow them properly together.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. That’s right. So… what are we going to decide about the rules now?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We have to decide the part where we act as fellow siblings, and also the extent to which we could act as lovers. For example, in a place that could be easily heard from the surroundings, Neneka is not allowed to call me by my name. We&#8217;re only allowed to call ourselves by our names when we are alone, just the two of us at home or when we’re in our rooms.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay then. Rule number 4! I will call you &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; whenever the place was likely somewhere which could be heard by our parents!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Why was Neneka’s tone while calling me &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; that cute?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there was a championship where I got to have a sister, she would definitely acquire a win there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ah, that’s right. I wanted to ask you that… can I come to Daiki’s room every night?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh!? Every night!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I mean, when our parents are back home, we can only enjoy lover’s time in each other’s room, right? Since we live together now, I kind of want us to enjoy lover’s time every single day… Of course, we can have that in my room if needed.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Her expression saying &#8220;lover’s time&#8221; was so cute.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But well, if we locked ourselves up in a room everyday, I felt like our parents would grow suspicious.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Feeling uneasy about it, I told Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;If we do it every night, I think we would likely be seen as doing something suspicious, so let’s make it a day in two where you could come to my room, keeping a breathing space between the two visits. Also additionally, I won’t go to Neneka’s room at night. If I had to go to your room… I would make sure to do it during the afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Why won’t you come at night?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;That’s… even if it’s my little sister’s room, I thought it wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea to go there after night had befallen…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>To be honest, I had more of a personal reason behind it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If, at night, I did go into Neneka’s room, I was afraid of the possibility that I might not be able to sleep later on.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, while at home, already smelled good. I was sure Neneka’s room would smell charming as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In a lovely smell, I would be alone with Neneka in her loungewear in her room… If that were to happen, my conscience inside me would start fighting each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My reason against my instinct</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Between calm and passion, I was sure I would have a hard time keeping my reason and instinct at bay.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay. Then, rule number 5! I won’t go to Daiki’s room every night. If I bring my study tools along and accidentally get caught in your room, I wonder if I could use an excuse like being taught by Daiki or something?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka being still unaware of my personal complexities, proceeded with the discussion.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I think that’s all good! Also, the time till you could stay in my room at night… let us make it till twelve o’clock midnight.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Okay. Rule number 6! I could stay in Daiki’s room till twelve o’clock at night. But well, since I get sleepy after eleven o’clock, I might end up going back to my room before anyways. If I fell asleep in Daiki’s room. Daiki might get into trouble after all.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Imagining Neneka sleeping in my room suddenly made my heart start pounding faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;And the most important rule number 7! Acts that seem to expose us as fellow lovers are prohibited in front of our parents! Let’s be careful.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Let’s be careful.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was a rule made so that our parents wouldn’t find out that we were lovers in hiding.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, this rule would cause Neneka to develop a particular type of feeling towards me later on, which was something yet unknown to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<br>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Later that night.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After work, our parents got drunk and happily mingled with each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>They were staring at each other while whispering to just enter each other’s ears so that we couldn’t hear them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was nice to have a peaceful dining space filled with happy auras. But seeing my parents flirting their hearts out without minding me in front of them instead made me highly annoyed</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Let’s quickly eat and scarp into my room as soon as possible…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Watching my parents flirt didn’t do me any good.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It made me feel like watching a scene from a romantic drama but unable to empathize with it even for a bit. Since they were newlyweds, my parents were the only main characters present there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was strange that the children were supposed to likely stay in a moderate relationship compared to their parents, who provocatively indulged in love affairs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Hmm? Neneka?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka, who was sitting right next to me secretly went on to touch my inner thighs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then she started to stroke it with her fingers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It tickled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>All of a sudden, without any notice, she started playing such a prank. Which, in turn got me feeling a little impatient.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I asked Neneka in a low voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then Neneka pouted her mouth and whispered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m starting to envy them…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From the blind spot of our parents, Neneka started constantly stroking my thighs under the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Could it be that she was inspired by our parents’ lovey-dovey attitude and now also wanted to flirt with me?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, no, no.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Calm down, Neneka!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Parents aside, we couldn’t flirt openly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Intending to say no, I took Neneka’s hand and removed it from my thighs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But Neneka’s hand soon returned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I removed it again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;But, it would just return back yet again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I looked at Neneka, intending to say, &#8220;Hey!&#8221; Neneka smiled as if she was enjoying a delicious meal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>How come she was having so much fun? If our parents found out, it would definitely be a huge fuss…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I moved Neneka’s hand time and again, but no matter how many times I did, it returned.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I gave up and started putting my food in my mouth, maintaining a poker face so that our parents wouldn’t find out that Neneka was messing with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then suddenly, Neneka said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Onii-chan, the rice fell on your thighs.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I checked my thighs. There were no grains of rice there.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And there was just Neneka’s left-hand. Her fingers moved smoothly, writing something.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Lo-ve?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could see letters written under a trajectory by her finger.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I glanced back at her, Neneka had a pretty smile on her face. My heart suddenly started beating a lot faster.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Even if she did such a cute thing, I couldn’t react in any way right now, okay?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While feeling a little dejected, I returned to eat my meal.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For them not to be suspicious of Neneka’s mischief, I had no choice but to remain calm and collected.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I was about to ignore this whole happening, Neneka started poking my thighs as her fingers began writing something again.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Da-i-ki?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though I was trying my best to keep our parents from finding out, Neneka urged me to reply right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Our parents were absorbed in their own love talks.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if they would get suspicious if I moved a little?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I made up my mind and reached out to Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I love you as well… Should I write that down in return?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Keeping my eyes on my food to avoid letting our parents find out, I secretly reached out to Neneka under the table.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And then… my finger stroked Neneka’s thighs, trying to write the letter &#8220;I.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Hya-nh!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When Neneka suddenly let out a scream and trembled.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother and Neneka’s father also reacted to this and turned their attention to Neneka immediately, whose face was blushing red.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka’s father asked.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What’s wrong? Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Eh, no? No, nothing! Nothing at all, just, I guess an insect just bit me… on my hand, I think!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While Neneka waved her hand sideways, I gently put back my hand on my thighs after it got treated as an insect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Damn close…!!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was wearing knee-length pants, but Neneka was wearing shorts.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I must have carelessly&nbsp; touched the part where there was no cloth… Unknowingly, stroked Neneka’s bare thighs directly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Perhaps, the way I touched her tickled her and she unintentionally let out a loud voice.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fufu. Neneka-chan’s voice was as cute as a kitten.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Ehehe… is that so?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My mother laughed.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka also laughed it off while deceiving them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Yes. I also thought that she had a cute voice too…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If it was just the two of us, seeing Neneka’s bright red face might have even made me feel pleasant.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, having made her raise her voice in front of our parents made me feel guilty to the point of feeling like, what the heck was I even doing?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Even though we discussed between ourselves that we would not act as lovers in a place where our parents were around… It was way too early to break the rules just after making them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Neneka couldn’t keep her promise, and I, got easily swayed by Neneka.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I remembered the feeling of my fingertips which touched Neneka’s thighs. I clenched my fists.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;It was so smooth…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I thought I was reflecting… or trying to reflect on what I did. However, there was also a part me which wasn’t able to reflect properly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It didn’t seem like I was in a position to blame Neneka too much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If I was going to touch her anyway, I wanted to feel her more properly, or I should just ask her to let me connect her with my boyfriend’s privilege next time. Such indecent thoughts started to overflow into me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;If she gave me a lap pillow… or something like that, it might just feel terrific…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And when I was lost in such thoughts, Neneka’s grandmother’s face came to my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was glad that this happened after she went back. I really thought that from the bottom of my heart.</p>
