<h3>Short Story &#8211; Neneka 2</h3>

<p>I really wanted to take a bath again, but I was still getting used to my new home, so I didn&#8217;t feel comfortable taking baths multiple times.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had no choice but to wipe my sweat off with a towel, then wipe my body with the sweat wipes I used at school, and then change into the clothes I wore for dinner.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The loungewear I got from Daiki&#8217;s mother was damp because I had put it on earlier when I was soaked with sweat.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wash it tomorrow and wear it again.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hugged my beautiful floral loungewear tightly, then carefully folded it and placed it beside my pillow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Well… my response today was perfect, and I&#8217;m sure that Daiki had given me the benefit of the doubt.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After getting under my futon, I decided to reflect on the incident earlier.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tonight too, a change in status occurred in Daiki&#8217;s son.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki looked very flustered, but this time I got dressed right away, so it should have been fine.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;As expected, when he asked me to end the summer, I asked him again because I didn&#8217;t know what he was talking about. That&#8230; was Daiki&#8217;s fault for using unique expressions as usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Even so, I had been sweating a lot&#8230; What should I do&#8230; Maybe Daiki thought I was sweaty&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought anything of it earlier, but the smell of my own sweat-soaked body on the futon bothered me. If he thought I smelled bad the moment I got out of the futon, I would be sad and unable to do anything about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Without a second thought, I smelled the loungewear I had just taken off.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was probably because it had just been bought but it had a distinctive smell, like when it was still in the store. And mixed in with that smell was the smell of my own sweat. Maybe the smell was best described as a loungewear that had just been bought, or maybe because it was the rainy season, which made sweat easier to smell, but it was a very subtle… smell, at least not a bad smell.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I jiggled around on my bed for a while, then huffed and puffed and let out a long breath to calm down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; it&#8217;s not necessary to ask a pervert on the internet&#8230; Daiki said, &#8220;My foolish son is in an early summer mood, and it&#8217;s having a lot of fun and getting carried away.&#8221; His son got carried away, so even if it smelled a little like sweat, it wasn&#8217;t an unpleasant smell, right&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Remembering Daiki&#8217;s words, I finally convinced myself.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It&#8217;s okay. Daiki wasn&#8217;t the kind of person who would say he hated me just because I sweated a little.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Moreover, here I noticed a terrible message from Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Let&#8217;s recall again what Daiki said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He said this…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Sorry. My foolish son is in the mood for an early summer, and it got carried away again…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What was noteworthy was the &#8220;My foolish son is in the mood for an early summer mood&#8221; part.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The &#8220;summer&#8221; here meant that Daiki and I would make love to the end. Therefore, it meant that his son was ready to make love, but he said that it was &#8220;a little early.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;In other words, Daiki was telling me that we, as high school students, were not ready for that kind of thing… I was sure he meant that day would come, but for now we should hold back!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After all, Daiki was thinking about our future, my body, and many other things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What a sweet boyfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki&#8217;s kindness made me happy and my heart ached.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Daiki&#8217;s message&#8230; I received it properly. From now on, something might happen to his son again, but he would leave it alone, so I didn&#8217;t have to worry.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Sometimes Daiki said some strange things, but I had gotten a little used to it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I felt as if this was a sign that I had come to understand Daiki better, and I was very happy.</p>
