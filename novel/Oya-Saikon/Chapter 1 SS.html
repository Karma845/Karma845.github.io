<h3>Short Story &#8211; Neneka 1</h3>

<p>&#8220;Daiki… looked at my body… What did he think…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Daiki just apologized for seeing me naked apart from that, he said nothing else.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He didn’t say it was beautiful… nor even that he was disappointed… he didn’t say anything.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, it wouldn’t have mattered what he would have said anyways, I would have died of embarrassment regardless. If he was disappointed&#8230; I didn’t think I would be able to recover from the shock. However, I didn’t know what Daiki thought of me, and that worried me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;What if he thought I was a bit chubby around my stomach… I should have exercised my waist properly!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had already decided to lose weight several times this year, but whenever I started to exercise, I typically gave up roughly three days in.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was not the kind of person who got discouraged easily though, but for some reason, I just couldn’t continue to exercise. Was my body not equipped for exercising?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It&#8217;s okay even if I had a little flab around the corner, it was just like going to the pool with my friends… Somehow, I started criticizing my conscience which pampered me until now…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Keeping that aside, Daiki was saying some weird things wasn’t he…? &#8220;My shower switch handle is about to turn up,&#8221; or &#8220;my foolish son is rising up in power,&#8221; and so on… What did he want to convey?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if he became too dizzy from staying in the bath for too long, but maybe there were other meanings as well related to this.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I should have asked him more about what he was trying to say…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If there was anything else he wanted to convey, I would start to feel a bit sorry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, Daiki was probably resting in his room right now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Trying to hear him out now would probably not be a proper thing to do. He must have been tired from taking a hot bath for this long. I wanted him to rest properly.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I read online for answers, my body got hotter and sweat started to come out.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Daiki’s shower switch handle was… &#8220;That thing!?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So at the time, when I pushed myself onto Daiki’s back, the condition of his foolish son, in otherwords, &#8220;that&#8221; changed!? But I was sure Daiki was just trying his best to be vague so that he didn’t surprise me too much.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>My head got hot as I started feeling dizzy. I became embarrassed remembering that I did something so bold.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But when I thought that Daiki’s heart went doki-doki because of me, it made me happy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was also glad at the kindness that showed that Daiki cared for me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>At this age, I couldn’t pretend I didn’t know any such things. Because it was strange if I didn’t.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you were a girl, that kind of knowledge became important in order to protect yourself in the future. I didn’t have a mother, but my grandmother often taught me about it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered what Daiki thought of me… Even though I should know such things, I was still unable to understand what he was trying to say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;Even after becoming a high school student, his words still didn’t get across me, I hope he didn’t feel gross over that… did he?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;No, I didn’t try to to pretend I didn’t know, I just couldn’t understand what he wanted to say because Daiki’s way of saying it was so peculiar after all…!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although no one was listening to me, I desperately tried making excuses.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took several deep breaths in an attempt to calm down.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It should be fine. When I brought the ice pack, Daiki was as usual as ever. I was sure Daiki wasn’t creeped out by it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If not… He wouldn’t try to kiss me like that.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I touched my own lips which were about to be met by Daiki’s lips at that time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>What would have happened if our lips did meet each other as it was about to?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Would Daiki’s son’s condition change yet again?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I loved Daiki. I thought Daiki loved me as well, and if Daiki wanted to do that, I…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;But we were still high school students, and just because we were dating, it was still too early to have such an adult-like relationship! I was sure of it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Yeah, that’s right! We shouldn’t do that so easily until we could take responsibility and raise our baby ourselves!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I shooked my head in order to get rid of my wicked feelings.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;Maybe Daiki had to put up with it because he knew that, and he didn’t say it clearly. So, I should also do the same…! I had to take a resolute attitude myself!!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was happy that I fell in love with Daiki.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>He was kind and had a compassionate side, he was the best boyfriend ever.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I knew with Daiki as my first boyfriend, I would definitely find happiness.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was thinking of going to bed, but my heart was pounding so hard that I couldn’t even get a wink. I wrapped myself up in the futon and squeezed its edge tightly with my legs.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It had been only two months since I had started dating Daiki, but the more I knew about him, the more I fell for him.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I also wanted Daiki to like me more and more…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;About my weight… should I exercise my abdominal muscles a little?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Anyway, as I was not feeling sleepy, I should try moving a little and get sleepy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I put aside the bed cover and started doing abs exercises on top of the futon.</p>
