<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Until now, when my male friends around me would say to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hah&#8230; it’s so bothersome to be concerned about how many months my girlfriend has been with me. That’s not important, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>And while I saw them sighing, I gave them an appropriate phrase, &#8220;Yeah, right,&#8221; in return.</p>



<p>&#8211;No, no. It can’t be unimportant you damn fool!!</p>



<p>In my mind, I retorted at the statement made by my past self.</p>



<p>As expected, I didn’t want to celebrate every month, and Neneka also didn’t seem to be that particular about our anniversary. However, it was fun to laugh at each other in a casual conversation, while saying , &#8220;It’s almost two months since we’ve been together…&#8221; The longer we spent time together, the closer our feelings towards each other got.</p>



<p>However, I questioned myself for being too cheap and sensitive regarding that.</p>



<p>Since I felt that we had very little amount of time to be together, I had a feeling of wanting to squeeze even the tiniest moments of happiness from it.</p>



<p>It had been two months since we had started dating, but we were yet to go on a date outside of school. Even at school, we just studied together and pretended to be on a date. We had only held hands while walking back to the station from school, and nothing had happened between us beyond that.</p>



<p>The guilt of starting a relationship with each other after we became exam-takers along with the nervousness of being in a relationship for the first time, the ambience that was created between us, made it difficult for both of us to voice about wanting to go on a date outside the school premises.</p>



<p>Once summer was over, we would need to get into a full-on exam mode. So, the only time we could spend together in ample amounts, would only be for the next two months or so.</p>



<p>I thought that it would be nice to just have some time to spend together… but truthfully, I would really like to be brave around her and to ask her on a proper date… I was afraid but we won’t even have the time to really talk about going on a date anymore.</p>



<p>While staring at the calendar, I started to worry about a good time to ask her out on a date.</p>



<p>It was kind of annoying to have some kind of test or mock test every now and then in the month.</p>



<p>&#8211;If I knew that we both had similar feelings towards each other, I would have confessed to her in our second year itself…</p>



<p>Thinking that I might have done quite a blunder, I headed towards my father’s Buddhist altar.</p>



<p>I rang the bell twice, and then put my hands together in a prayer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, dad. I’ll be off now.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I finished my morning routine and got up, my mother came over.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki. Can we have a little talk, is that okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? It’s okay, but… it’s almost about time to go to school, so please do keep it short.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? You go to school too early these days, don’t you? Why are you going to school so early?&#8221;</p>



<p>I wanted to go to school early. Neneka also came to school early. And I looked forward to study with her in the classroom before the other students arrived.</p>



<p>… Somehow, we kept it a secret that we were dating from the large populace. When it came to rumors, there were people who made unnecessary remarks like, &#8220;To start dating just after becoming test-takers, you surely got too much time up your sleeves, don’t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>If we were to be seen together for some moments, there would be no problem as such. Everyone knew the fact that we were in the same committee and that we were reasonably quite close to each other.</p>



<p>When I was in my second year, I was often asked, &#8220;Why don’t you go out with her?&#8221; At that time, I really didn’t think that I could start dating her for real, but…</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m just studying hard. It’s because I can concentrate better at school.&#8221;</p>



<p>Naturally, I was going to keep it a secret even from my mother that I now had a girlfriend.</p>



<p>Ara-Ara&#8230; it seems that you could afford wasting time, didn’t you? Your mother did tell you to quit your part-time job when you became a third year, but that was basically to make sure that your time did not get cut-out short for the exam studies though it was definitely not a pretext for you to get a girlfriend and enjoy your time flirting around with her, you know? … And so?</p>



<p>What kind of child is she?</p>



<p>Is she cute?</p>



<p>Have you got any pictures of her?</p>



<p>Bring her home next time&#8230; Of course she would say something like that.</p>



<p>I had the confidence to say that 90% of the mothers would say something like that.</p>



<p>That was why I couldn’t tell my mother. It was also to protect my peaceful daily life.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what is it? What’s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I asked, my mother said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Actually… I’d like to remarry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh? So, you found someone? Good for you. Why don’t you proceed with remarrying then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m happy to have a girlfriend these days too&#8230;&#8221; I thought, and replied suitably and half-heartedly.</p>



<p>I was not sure if my mother noticed that half-hearted reply of mine, but she looked disapprovingly at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Normally, don’t children get taken aback by this? Is it okay for you not wanting to object to this matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Objection…? Why do I need to object or stop my mother from remarrying? Or did you want me to stop you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it’s not like that, but… it just feels a little too light-hearted from your part, don’t you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I frankly don’t think my mother would make a wrong decision in choosing the person she will get remarried with, and if you get remarried, we’ll have more leeway in our living expenses, and so, you’ll be okay with working less and taking it easy and getting some rest too, right? It’s all good outcomes that await, I wouldn’t be that immature to object to such a decision.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? Thank you for your understanding. So, you know, I’d like them to move in with us here if possible. The other person lives in an apartment at present, and we also have separated arrangements with spare rooms too…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm, understood, you can go ahead with your talks.&#8221;</p>



<p>I answered as I put on my shoes in front of the entrance door.</p>



<p>If I left the house at this hour. Neneka was likely to arrive at school before me. I usually got there earlier than her, so I might make her worry. Let’s send her a message when I get on the train…</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, I think we should have a face-to-face meeting once before they actually decide to move in together… Since it’ll be important for me as well as for you too, Daiki.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, sure. Well, if they do move in here, we’ll be able to see each other every single day, so don’t worry about it and bring them here whenever they feel it to be a good time. Ah, is it perhaps, I’ll have to change my last name when you get remarried?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, that too! That was also part of the important things! I am thinking about going along with making &#8220;Morita&#8221; as my nickname at my work-place, but what are your thoughts about this Daiki…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I’d like that, too. It’s too much of a hassle to explain the reason for changing my last name in the third year of high school, I wonder if I could also make it my nickname as well? Could you please ask my homeroom teacher at school if something could be done regarding this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. Since you’re going along with the selfish wish of your mother. I’ll also do my best and ask the teacher to let it be done.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I’ll leave it to you! I’m off to school then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey! We still have some very important things to discuss about…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can do the rest as per your liking. Apart from changing our surnames, is there really something that is going to affect me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Obviously it’s going to matt… Ah okay, then… I get it! I’ll do whatever I seem fit from now on then!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though I approved of her re-marriage. My mother seemed kind of grumpy for some reason.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, I’m off.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, sure, take care.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother saw me off while I left for school. I walked quickly towards the station.</p>



<p>I wanted to go to school and see Neneka as soon as possible.</p>



<p>… However, I wondered if I had listened to my mother’s story way too perfunctorily?</p>



<p>As soon as I got on the train, I suddenly remembered my mother’s face just before leaving her. My mind got flooded with the image of her face… becoming cramped up in the process in my mental imageries.</p>



<p>Thinking that I might have done something terrible, my heart became a bit cloudy.</p>



<p>But… it was not that I didn’t listen to her properly because I wanted to think about and meet up with my girlfriend. I thought, it would be better if my mother was to get remarried to a suitable person.</p>



<p>For a long time, she raised me all by herself with her womanly hands. Even though I had started working part-time after I entered high school, I was fully aware of the amount of burden I had put on her up till now.</p>



<p>On starting the third year of high school, my mother stopped me from working part-time. She said she didn’t want me to work too hard because of our family’s condition, and in turn, for that very reason, failed to clear the entrance examination.</p>



<p>However, if I quit my part-time job, our family income would decrease. She wanted to work more to compensate for my lack, but on the other hand, I was worried that she might tamper her health and get sick because of overworking.</p>



<p>If she was to remarry, life would become a lot easier. The reason for my mother to force herself alone into work, would cease to exist. I felt grateful about it.</p>



<p>I had readied my heart on welcoming any man who was ready to remarry my mother.</p>



<p>Judging by my mother’s personality, she would not choose someone whom I would oppose her to remarry. Since he was the person, my mother chose after my father, I believed he would be as serious and gentle as my father.</p>



<p>It was a little embarrassing, but I might as well call him &#8220;father-in-law&#8221; one day.</p>



<p>I was no longer at the age to make a fuss like, &#8220;My father is the only one who is pure as heaven while no one else is!&#8221; I believed that even my father would have wanted his surviving family members to live happily.</p>



<p>That was the very reason I neglected those &#8220;important matters&#8221; that my mother wanted to discuss with me, half-heartedly.</p>



<p>To be honest, one of the reasons I passed through without hearing her out was because it was embarrassing to hear my mother talking about the person she liked.</p>



<p>That reason was not cool, so I would keep it locked deep inside my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I guess it will be better to ask her next time when she’s calmer…&#8221;</p>



<p>I shelved the matter of my mother’s re-marriage in the back of my mind, thinking I would ask her about it next time I had the chance.</p>



<p>As a student, I had a lot of things to think about. About the classes which I had to attend, about the next test that was scheduled, about committee work along with my new girlfriend. Also, adolescence was a period of time riddled, full of worries.</p>



<p>Yes, and after that, as days passed, I became busier.</p>



<p>And so, I left my shelved things… shelved on the back shelves of my mind and forgot about them.</p>


<br>


<p>It was one of such holiday in mid-June.</p>



<p>All of a sudden a vehicle of a moving company arrived in front of my house and built a mountain-pile of cardboard boxes in front of the entrance. Witnessing the scene, I assumed the reason before my mother could tell me about it.</p>



<p>Finally that day had arrived when my mother’s re-marriage partner would move in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyhow, these are too many cardboard boxes indeed&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Before the arrival of my new family, the cardboard boxes arrived at our place. As I gazed at them intently, a murmur escaped my mouth.</p>



<p>I had not heard much about her second-marriage partner, but I did hear that he used to live in an apartment. That was why I had imagined by myself until now that only a few cardboard boxes would arrive here.</p>



<p>The correct answer was, close to two dozen large cardboard boxes had arrived.</p>



<p>I wondered if I packed all my clothes and other personal belongings, would it also astonishingly reach this number.</p>



<p>While I was trying to guess what was in that pile of cardboard boxes, my mother, dressed more spiritedly than usual, came out and stood beside me. Witnessing her wearing that long, flouncy skirt inside the house was perhaps because it was the day of our new family member&#8217;s arrival.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems that they will be arriving anytime soon. Are you mentally prepared?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No worries about it. I’ll be sure to greet them in a friendly manner.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not worried about that part though&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though my mother laughed saying that, she did look a little bit nervous.</p>



<p>&#8211;If I were to live together with the person I adored from today, I guess even I would get nervous…</p>



<p>The face of Neneka floated in my mind.</p>



<p>&#8211;I would tell Neneka about my mother’s re-marriage once I got settled with a new lifestyle…&nbsp; If our relationship survived for a long period in the future, there may come a day when I would have to introduce Neneka to my mother and my new father…</p>



<p>While I was busy thinking about such stuff, the doorbell rang.</p>



<p>My mother called out to the front door and opened it.</p>



<p>It was finally time.</p>



<p>Through the widening gap from the opening of the door, I saw a figure of a mature man in his primes smiling serenely.</p>



<p>&#8211;Heh, so this man will be my new father… he did look very kind… He seemed quite kind and…</p>



<p>But the door still opened.</p>



<p>As it proceeded to open gradually… and by the time the door was completely open, I had somehow forgotten how to breathe altogether.</p>



<p>A familiar hair, lengthy enough to go to till the waist.</p>



<p>A familiar figure, stood up in front of me.</p>



<p>And a face I was definitely familiar with.</p>



<p>Be it the eyes, the nose, the mouth, and all… all resembled the image of my girlfriend whom I was imagining moments ago, the one I loved and adored greatly.</p>



<p>&#8211;Neneka!?</p>



<p>Right at the end of my sight, Neneka had also frozen up on seeing me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki. This is Torii Ryosuke-san, your mother’s second marital partner. While this is his daughter, Neneka-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother briskly introduced me to my new father and Neneka.</p>



<p>And then pointed towards me.</p>



<p>&#8220;And this is my son, Daiki. Look here! Daiki! Your greetings!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, no, wait a minute! I didn’t hear about any kids on the other side too though!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I stopped my mother in between and complained to her in a whisper.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why the heck didn’t you tell me about this important thing right at first!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Important thing right at first…? When I was about to say that, wasn’t it you who didn’t want to listen, didn’t you, Daiki? Come on now, just say hello to them quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p>What the heck. So, the important thing my mother was trying to tell me about her re-marriage partner, was that they also had had a child of their own?</p>



<p>It was such an important thing to talk about, but I just let my mother’s part of the story slide away without even hearing it.</p>



<p>And so, she got upset and gave up on communicating this important part of the information to me.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I forgot to ask her about it later.</p>



<p>&#8220;That’s what happens when you don’t try to listen to people properly.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother said so with a nonchalant smiling look on her face.</p>



<p>From the look on her face, it seemed that she had already decided to get back at me by not telling me that her re-marital partner had a child from his first marriage.</p>



<p>&#8211;Still, the one at fault was me right!</p>



<p>I was sorry about that!</p>



<p>If I had listened to my mother carefully, I would have known in advance that her re-marital partner had a child from his first marriage and eventually realize that the child was my girlfriend.</p>



<p>The fault here was completely mine. Here, I had no choice but to accept the reality without making any more fuss…</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh… umm, I’m Daiki… it’s nice to meet you.&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought the greeting was as thin and empty as a greeting exchanged on the first day of high school.</p>



<p>&#8211;Come to think about it, did Neneka know about this re-marriage story beforehand?</p>



<p>I glanced towards Neneka to check on her present status.</p>



<p>We saw each other at school every day and also chatted there every day. However, I had never heard from Neneka’s mouth about her parent’s re-marriage even once.</p>



<p>I didn’t know that the re-marriage partner was about to bring Neneka with him, and I had planned to tell that to Neneka once I had settled down with my daily life for good. So, I did not tell her anything about my mother’s re-marriage plans.</p>



<p>Then how did it go on Neneka’s side? If Neneka had known about what was going to happen, would she have come up to talk about this topic at hand one day too…?</p>



<p>I observed Neneka’s facial expression to find out what was going on in her mind.</p>



<p>Neneka had a good-natured smile plastered on her, but her eyes were completely baffled.</p>



<p>… From the looks of it, it seemed that even Neneka didn’t care to properly learn the details of her father’s re-marriage in any way either…</p>



<p>I chuckled, imagining her inwardly panicking about it like &#8220;What to do! What to do!&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, next Neneka’s father introduced her to us.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is my daughter, Neneka. Daiki-kun and Neneka attend the same high school, but have you ever been in the same class before?&#8221;</p>



<p>No, we didn’t. But we were on the same club committee… or so when I was about to answer that… I became a little worried.</p>



<p>&#8211;Rather in fact, we were dating each other…</p>



<p>Should I say all this or should I not?</p>



<p>When I was in that dilemma, my sixth sense whispered to me.</p>



<p>No, rather wait. If suddenly so much information came out, and hearing all of this altogether, I never knew how Neneka’s father would react to all that. </p>



<p>He had such a gentle smile and demeanor, but what would happen if he happened to really adore his daughter very much?</p>



<p>If he was the type to say &#8220;I don’t approve of any boyfriends,&#8221; he might change when he finds out that I was her boyfriend. Then, there was even a possibility that my mother’s re-marriage would be abruptly broken off by him.</p>



<p>I supposed it would be better to wait and see how Neneka reacted to the situation…</p>



<p>When I stared at Neneka intently, she also reciprocated by staring at me intently.</p>



<p>When I somehow nodded my head, Neneka also nodded hers.</p>



<p>I had absolutely no idea what was conveyed, but I was sure something must have been conveyed, nevertheless.</p>



<p>And then Neneka answered her father’s question, before I could do that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope, we didn’t. Our high school has a lot of students and matching that, a lot of classes as well, so even after reaching third year of high school, there were a lot of students I’ve never even talked to yet…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;Eh?</p>



<p>A sound like that almost escaped out from me, but I managed to swallow it down, not letting it escape. I never thought that Neneka would pretend this to be a &#8220;first-meeting&#8221; by any chance.</p>



<p>Despite my upset mental status, the first exchange between the two families proceeded peacefully.</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard that Daiki-kun was born in March while Neneka was born in May, so I suppose that would make Neneka the younger sibling-in-law.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Neneka’s father asked this, my mother said this as if to add on to what he said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Being schoolmates, I think it might be a little bit difficult to call each other elder brother or younger sister. I think it would be good if they could just keep a comfortable sense of distance between each other without worrying too much about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Understood, so that was how it was. Since my mother and Neneka’s father were getting remarried to each other, so from today on, Neneka and I would become elder brother-in-law and younger sister-in-law right?</p>



<p>&#8211;Hmm…</p>



<p>My girlfriend was now my sister-in-law?</p>



<p>Even though she was my girlfriend, was she also going to become my sister-in-law?</p>



<p>If that was so… What was going to happen then…?</p>



<p>The words &#8220;girlfriend&#8221; and &#8220;sister-in-law&#8221; somehow could not connect well together in my mind. I forgot that I was in the middle of greeting Neneka and her father and I stood there in a blur.</p>



<p>And then, I felt a tug on my right sleeve.</p>



<p>When I came back to myself, I saw the girl who had been with me more than anyone else for the past two months, was staring at me and smiling embarrassingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m looking forward to staying with you from now on… Onii-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;O-nii-chan?</p>



<p>She was terribly cute when she said this, but there was no time to think how cute she was…</p>



<p>The fact that Neneka decided to call me &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; meant that she was going to treat me like an older brother. So, it basically sounded like a message telling me… &#8220;Let’s keep the fact that we’re dating to ourselves hidden.&#8221;</p>



<p>Was she really sure about taking that stance here?</p>



<p>There were so many questions I wanted to ask her, but Neneka was nonchalantly going into the house while talking with my mother.</p>



<p>Up until moments ago, even Neneka had this expression showing surprise on how she also just knew about us becoming siblings… then what was with this speed of adaptation.</p>



<p>&#8211;Weren’t we both in a relationship?</p>



<p>While staring towards the back of Neneka I asked this in my mind.</p>



<p>Of course, there was no reply whatsoever.</p>



<p>Just when I had started to question that we were going out with each other, greeting time at the entrance ended.</p>



<p>And so, my mother with Neneka’s father, and me with Neneka… the life of us four living together began.&#8221;</p>


<br>


<p>After that, I helped Neneka carry her cardboard boxes and her belongings to her room on the second floor.</p>



<p>I thought it was a lot of luggage for a single man living alone, but now that I knew it was Neneka and Neneka’s father’s luggage together, I had an impression that it was rather less. There was only eight cardboard boxes to be brought to Neneka’s room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka, is this all of your luggage?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. The place I used to live at was a small apartment, so I didn’t have too much space for my stuff, and so, I only got the… bare minimum necessities that I would need.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, so that&#8217;s why…&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka’s room was the one next to mine.</p>



<p>I always had the thought that it was just an empty-room, but it seemed that my mother had cleaned it up before I had the knowledge of it. There was even a bed and a desk that I had no recollection of. It might have been when I was off to school, she might have been preparing this room all by herself.</p>



<p>&#8211;If this was going to be Neneka’s room, I wondered if Neneka’s father would be having the same room as my mother… Since, apart from that, there was only a small storage room like a rest-room.</p>



<p>When I was about to wonder how my parents would spend their time in their room for a minute, I immediately stopped. This periphery was something that shouldn’t be imagined too much about.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should I help you with the unpacking as well?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I had finished carrying the cardboard boxes, I called out to Neneka.</p>



<p>And then Neneka laughed a little awkwardly.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s okay! Since I got various clothes in here as well, I will go slowly, unpacking as I organize them appropriately.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I see… sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those clothes Neneka talked about, there might be these that she didn’t want or that might be inappropriate for men to see… I wanted to curse my lack of delicacy that I had asked her about it without thinking it through.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well… changing the subject, can we discuss how we are going to go about this in the future…?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was fearfully trying to bring up the important part of the story.</p>



<p>How did she feel about the fact that she and her boyfriend were now living together as siblings-in-law? Also, was she willing to confide in our parents about our relationship?</p>



<p>There were so many things I wanted to ask and talk about.</p>



<p>The reason why Neneka didn’t talk to me earlier was probably because we were in front of our parents. So, perhaps she thought that once we would be alone, we would be able to have a conversation about this like we usually did.</p>



<p>However… Neneka, while laughing wryly, was slowly peeling off the duct tape off the cardboard boxes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sorry, Onii-chan… if I don’t sort out my clothes right now, I won’t have any clothes to wear for tonight…&#8221;</p>



<p>She didn’t even look at my side.</p>



<p>Implicitly, I felt a tingle in my chest, as if she was saying, &#8220;I don’t want to talk about it, and I want you to get out of my room as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh… sorry. Well, see you later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah later.&#8221;</p>



<p>As a conversation between us siblings-in-law, this would be passable.</p>



<p>But as a man and a woman who had been dating for two months already, this was quite distant.</p>



<p>&#8211;We were dating, weren’t we…?</p>



<p>This anxiety was stuck in my head for a while now.</p>



<p>If only Neneka followed up by laughing that, &#8220;You are surprised right… but to be able to live with you, Daiki, might actually be lucky don’t you think?&#8221; I wouldn’t have felt this gloominess starting inside me.</p>



<p>I left Neneka’s room and stared at the closed door.</p>



<p>From today, my girlfriend would live in the room next door. However, she seemed to be trying to hide the fact that we were lovers… or even pretended that it didn’t exist anymore.</p>



<p>&#8220;What am I supposed to do…?&#8221;</p>



<p>I tried to have a conversation with her, but she refused. It seemed as if she was trying to maintain a distance between us.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe I’m… going to get dumped…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki. What are you mumbling in front of Neneka-chan’s room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh!? M-Mom!&#8221;</p>



<p>When I came to my senses, I found my mother standing in front of me, with her eyes gazing right at mine.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I-I-It’s nothing! It’s nothing at all!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? Well that’s fine as it is, but… since Neneka-chan is going to be living with us from today, be careful with your words and deeds, okay? Don’t do anything crazy, okay? For if I get to hear any such case…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you get to hear any such case, then what will you do…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ll take responsibility and make sure the Morita bloodline is cut off in your generation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What exactly are you going to do about it!?&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, I felt a chill in my lower abdomen.</p>



<p>My mother’s profession was a nurse. If it was about a way to stop me from having a descendant, I was afraid that she might have got a lot of ideas.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you have nothing better to do, why don’t you take a bath? We are a family of four from today, so we have to take turns.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother’s voice sounded somewhat amused when she said, &#8220;a family of four.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay… I’ll go ahead and take a bath.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don’t take a long bath, there’s someone next.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>I reluctantly replied and went back to my room.</p>



<p>&#8211;I have no choice, let’s leave Neneka behind for the time being.</p>



<p>I finished getting ready in my room, grabbed my phone, and headed to the toilet, which doubled as a changing room.</p>



<p>I slammed the door of the changing room, took the earphones that I always kept in the cupboard, put my phone in the waterproof case, and headed for the bathroom.</p>



<p>Listening to music while taking a bath was my recent pleasure.</p>



<p>While listening to trendy J-Pop music, I soaked myself into the bathtub in a good mood.</p>



<p>If I remembered correctly, this song was supposed to become the theme song of an anime, I even remembered my friend showing me the opening movie of the anime. Maybe next time I’ll watch the anime too.</p>



<p>I felt healed being soaked in the hot water while listening to music on my phone. When I closed my eyes, I felt as if I was in another space altogether.</p>



<p>&#8211;It was so comfortable that I could almost unconsciously forget that I lived in the real-world due to this.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right… I was starting to feel like the fact that Neneka was living in the same house as mine was all just a dream altogether.</p>



<p>&#8211;I was sure that when I would leave the bathtub, it would be the usual… where I was living with my mother alone in this house.</p>



<p>And just when I was so calm and about to escape reality, the music changed into a calm ballad.</p>



<p>The overall volume of the song lowered. The prelude began with piano tones like raindrops.</p>



<p>&#8211;Ah. My latest favorite, here it comes!</p>



<p>It was at that time when I was entranced by this song, suddenly&#8230; I heard a loud clatter mixed with the soothing music.</p>



<p>Responding to that familiar sound, I quickly opened my eyes and looked at the entrance door of the bathroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>It was so sudden, that there was no voice.</p>



<p>Even though I was soaked in a tub of hot water, I froze, unable to even blink.</p>



<p>To my surprise, the bath door opened&#8230; and a naked Neneka was standing there.</p>



<p>The first thing I saw was her soft, fluffy breasts. I thought about how I didn’t understand the meaning of the… real thing, and I hurriedly shifted my gaze.</p>



<p>But, at the end of that shifted gaze, I saw a slender leg. I thought it was a bad idea, so I moved my gaze again and saw Neneka’s face frozen in place with wide-opened eyes.</p>



<p>Neneka stood there, just like a sculpture.</p>



<p>She must have tied up her long hair in order to take a bath, But her hair, even though tied, frayed-out from places, flowing down to her neck, which in turn made it kind of sexy.</p>



<p>&#8211;Wait! Which place is even safe to look at!!</p>



<p>At about the same time, when I hurriedly turned my back to Neneka, she also hurriedly closed the door.</p>



<p>Behind me, the door slammed shut with a rattling sound yet again.</p>



<p>&#8211;W-Why was Neneka coming in, when I was taking a bath!?</p>



<p>From the very first day of living together, an outrageous incident unfolded… and immediately afterwards, we understood the cruciality of the thought of living together.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Why? Why are you here Daiki?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka asked me across the door that separated the bathroom from the changing room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rather than that, why are you coming in while I’m taking a bath though!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I asked her right away.</p>



<p>The reason for this situation was definitely because Neneka came in earlier.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don’t tell me that you came in knowing I was here…?&#8221;</p>



<p>I imagined a scene where she said, &#8220;Let me wash your back.&#8221; I was shocked to learn for the first time that Neneka was such a bold girl.</p>



<p>However, soon later, words of denial flew from Neneka’s side.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I wouldn’t do that! I came here thinking that you were already out of the bath though! It’s already been an hour since I heard from your mother that you went to take one, and there was no sound of water too!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? It’s already been that long! I’m sorry. I’ve been soaking in the hot water while listening to music through my earphones…&#8221;</p>



<p>I checked the clock on my phone and sure enough, an hour had passed. It seemed that while I was occupied in thinking, I seemed to have completely lost track of time.</p>



<p>Furthermore, Neneka added.</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn’t even leave a change of clothes here!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A change of clothes? Ah! I forgot to bring it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean by &#8220;forgot to bring it!?&#8221; Were you planning on going back to your room naked!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That’s actually what it has been! I’ve always had this habit of coming out of the bathroom buck naked and then returning to my room being naked…! Today as well, I did it again by accident.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huhhhhh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka then lamented from behind the door saying &#8220;If you do that, there is no way I would have noticed that Daiki was still taking a bath…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;I screwed up…</p>



<p>From the very first day my new family moved in and started living with me, I had screwed up.</p>



<p>In the first place, I should have completely sealed the habit of moving around naked when there was a girl who was now in the house.</p>



<p>Usual habits were really scary and doing this unconsciously was terrifying.</p>



<p>Because up until now, I had been living alone with my mother, who usually came home late. No one was bothered with me for hanging around naked… rather, let’s not word out this excuse.</p>



<p>There were cold sweats forming on my forehead even though I should have been warm after taking a bath.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sorry… I’ll make sure I never do that again…&#8221;</p>



<p>I apologized but there was no reply. Had I offended her?</p>



<p>As I was checking out the condition of Neneka for a while, she moved behind the frosted glass of the door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey… earlier, you saw me… didn’t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Why now? Even though there was no point in asking, since what I saw earlier was definitely Neneka without even a piece of cloth on her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes… I saw…&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no point of hiding here. I felt this was much better than trying to deceive her in an awkward manner.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was obvious right… you did see it after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt like I knew what type of face Neneka was making right now even without seeing her. I was sure she was trying to endure the shame caused by that by squeezing her eyes shut, tightly.</p>



<p>What was even the right thing to say to her in this situation?</p>



<p>If I were to say something like, &#8220;It was beautiful…&#8221; I would die of embarrassment and in reaction to my snappy dialogue I was afraid I would make Neneka feel even more embarrassed than she was now.</p>



<p>That said, &#8220;Don’t make a fuss about it, it’s not like you will lose something or the other.&#8221;</p>



<p>If I said that… I would definitely offend her.</p>



<p>If I said something like that. While looking at me with cold eyes she would say, &#8220;What?&#8221; was the only future I could see happening.</p>



<p>Rather, I thought it would be safer to not mention anything about what I had seen earlier.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka… are you all right…?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I approached her speaking nervously, at that very moment, Neneka abruptly said &#8220;Shh!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Quiet! Someone might be around the corner!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I listened carefully, I heard a kon-kon-kon sound struck from behind the glass door. This was the sound of banging on the bathroom door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka-chan. Have you already taken a bath?&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard my mother’s voice and I involuntarily sank nose-deep into the hot water.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah… I was just about to go in…!&#8221;</p>



<p>When Neneka answered, my mother asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you bring your shampoo and conditioner?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I forgot… May I borrow it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, then you can use whatever you like. Also, do you think you know how to use the shower?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! Looks like it will be no problem!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so, then take your time ok…&#8221;</p>



<p>As my mother’s footsteps moved away, I could hear Neneka sighing behind the door.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was dangerously close…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope, it isn’t anything dangerous and close! What are we going to do about this situation… Arre!? There seems to be someone still in here in the bath! Wouldn’t it be better if I had screamed like that now…!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah!! Now I see!! Wa-aa, what should I do…!? And suddenly I had this impulse to hide the fact that Daiki was in the bath…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though it was such a great opportunity…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That is… I was afraid that if she found out that you were still in the bath, she would think of me as a bad younger sister-in-law who tried to sneak into the bath when her elder brother was already in there…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you had just realized it moments ago, something could have been done about it probably… Now, my mom already thinks it’s Neneka who is in the bath at this time. What am I supposed to do about the fact that I was in the bath in the first place…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, but, but… even Daiki, when your mother and I were talking, you could have just made a fuss saying, &#8220;Hmm? Is someone there?&#8221; couldn’t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah!! There was that option as well!!&#8221;</p>



<p>But it was already too late. We were unable to make a calm decision at that time, we were now put into a predicament by our own hands.</p>



<p>&#8220;For the time being, start the shower! It would be really dangerous if they find us talking by any chance, thus, let’s camouflage our voices with the sound of the water!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh! Ok, understood!&#8221;</p>



<p>I got up and reached for the shower.</p>



<p>Thinking that it would be a waste to leave it running out of the sink, I decided to turn on the hot water and let it run into the bathtub. The sound of running hot water hitting the tub reverberated into the bathroom.</p>



<p>Now, even if anyone passed by the halfway, they wouldn’t be able to hear the conversation going on inside, unless they tried to listen very well.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want to… have a go? I’m… ok though.&#8221;</p>



<p>However this made it difficult to even hear the voice of Neneka. &#8220;Eh? What? What did you mean to say.&#8221;</p>



<p>I got out of the bathtub and crouched in front of the bathroom door.</p>



<p>Then, behind the frosted glass, I saw Neneka’s shadow move as if to crouch down.</p>



<p>Across the frosted glass door, just beyond it, was a naked Neneka.</p>



<p>When suddenly remembering the naked body of Neneka I saw earlier, I felt a warm current circling around my body.</p>



<p>&#8211;Calm down, me!</p>



<p>This was definitely not the time to hit my own water switch damnit!</p>



<p>Realizing that the hot water named worldly desires was about to flow in the bathtub. I shooked my head in a hurry.</p>



<p>I must not remember Neneka naked now. If I did that, in no time my own bath water would boil over the limit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki… what are you going to do now?&#8221;</p>



<p>From the other side of the door, Neneka’s anxious voice came about.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… I guess… I want to get out of here as well so I am thinking about something already…&#8221;</p>



<p>Because of the long bath I had earlier, and the hot water shower left running, the bathroom was a sauna, I was worried that I was going to get myself sick if I didn’t do something now.</p>



<p>I began to think of a solution to this situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;How about Neneka pretends to have taken a bath, changes into her clothes, and leaves first? Wouldn’t it be better if we set it up so that I hadn’t actually taken a bath yet, and we could pretend that I took a bath after Neneka took hers?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That’s impossible! Absolutely impossible! I got really sweaty because of the work with moving out, so I definitely want to take a bath! Moreover, they’ll easily find out that I did not take a bath because of the smell!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then there is no other choice than to somehow move Neneka to the bathroom as I move to the changing room, huh…&#8221;</p>



<p>There was one door connecting the bathroom to the changing room. The passage was so narrow that even with the door fully opened, two people could barely pass each other. In order to make this move successful, first of all, it was impossible for us not to see each other.</p>



<p>&#8211;I could withstand being seen, But I would better not look at Neneka any more than I already did… No, that&#8217;s not all. For my own sake, it would be better if I don’t see Neneka naked anymore.</p>



<p>Thinking that, I made the following suggestion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, let’s first have you put on your clothes… and after that, I’ll leave the changing room up front!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, wait! Daiki, you came here completely naked, didn’t you? You’re thinking about going out of the changing room completely naked, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What if, in that case, your mother accidentally sees you in the process…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sees me in the process…?&#8221;</p>



<p>A simulation began in my brain.</p>



<p>I escaped from the changing room naked. And after that, my mother and the naked me ran against each other. My mother, on encountering this naked me froze up for a moment, and then she exclaimed loudly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh!? Don’t tell me did you perhaps just take a bath!? If I am correct, isn’t Neneka-chan taking a bath right now!? Don’t tell me you both were in there together…!?&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother in my brain simulation went into a panic mode as she called out loudly for Neneka’s father. And then, on arriving, Neneka’s father would see me naked…</p>



<p>&#8220;… That&#8217;s not a good idea.&#8221;</p>



<p>The me inside that brain simulation safely reached a bad end&#8230; game over as I was forced into reality where I was presently in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right? Even you thought it would be bad, didn’t you. Are you certain that you could make it to your room without being found out… Are you confident that you would absolutely be fine?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, absolutely not.&#8221;</p>



<p>My mother, on her days off from work was going around the house so much that it even made me wonder what was making her so busy to keep on wandering around the house.</p>



<p>She seemed to have a lot of things to do on her days off because she couldn’t get around to do much housework during the week.</p>



<p>Today was the day new family members arrived, so she was even more excited than usual, I couldn’t guarantee that I wouldn’t run into her while making my way back to my room.</p>



<p>I guess the best solution would be to have Neneka finish her bath and leave the bathroom first.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahh, let’s just wash me in the washing machine already…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wah!&#8221;</p>



<p>I involuntarily let out a weird sound as Neneka suddenly started saying something strange.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki! This is not the time to be laughing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sorry, I’m sorry, it’s just that, I thought that it was Neneka after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? What do you mean by that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since you came to my house, you have been acting like you are not the Neneka I know even though you are Neneka. I became really worried when you pretended to meet me for the first time in front of my mom and your father and even called me &#8220;Onii-chan&#8221; and stuff.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka also didn’t know that her father and my mom were getting remarried right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… I didn’t want to oppose his re-marriage from the beginning, moreover I had just started dating Daiki, so I was completely full just thinking about myself…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was the same with me…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I cannot call you Daiki anymore. From today, it must be Onii-cha&#8211;&#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, wait a moment there, isn’t it alright calling me by my name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m your sister-in-law after all. Since Daiki is my elder brother-in-law it has to be Onii-chan, don’t you agree as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly Neneka’s voice became hard and cold. Even though we had been dating as if we were quite close, meeting at school just a while ago, I felt as if the distance between us had suddenly increased.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s talk about it later. Right now, we need to deal with this situation first.&#8221;</p>



<p>My heart felt rattled up. But, as Neneka said, we couldn’t stay here forever.</p>



<p>I proposed the best solution I just came up with, a minute ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, let’s do it this way. First, while I’m in the bathroom facing the wall, Neneka gets into the bathtub. Once Neneka is in the bathtub, I will evacuate to the changing room and wait. When Neneka finishes bathing, you stay in the bathtub, while I move into the bathroom and keep facing the wall. Then, Neneka will go to the changing room and change her clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh. And so, after I leave the bathroom, I can just keep our parents stranded in the living room or something!&#8221; Then you don&#8217;t need to worry about our parents seeing you return to your room completely naked.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This plan is perfect. Isn’t it…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;… Umm. But, even so, it’s not that we can miss seeing each other completely…&#8221;</p>



<p>I said, hearing the worries from Neneka.</p>



<p>&#8220;… Since we’re dating, isn’t that good enough? We’ve been dating for two months already and haven’t kissed yet, but we aren’t strangers enough wanting to hide everything. If we continue to date, we might have opportunities to show each other our everything… On the other hand, if you refuse to show me anything at all over here, it will definitely hurt me a little.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then I heard Neneka’s weak voice from the other side of the door.</p>



<p>&#8220;But… we’ve become brother and sister, even if we are just siblings-in-law… &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… that’s a surprise, but it doesn’t change our relationship does it? Don’t tell me, Neneka, do you wish to break up with me now that we’re siblings-in-law?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I asked, Neneka was silent.</p>



<p>Then, somewhat later, came the reply.</p>



<p>&#8220;I… don’t want to break up. But I think we will have to break up.&#8221;</p>



<p>At those words spoken by Neneka, my heart started behaving strangely.</p>



<p>Being shaken up, I saw my mouth going dry as my hands shooked a little.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? But why?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because siblings can’t get married to each other, and in order for me to eventually marry Daiki, and if I still want to, I’ll have to break up my dad’s re-marriage after all…! At long last, when I can see my dad has a chance to be happy again, I can’t let him leave it just because of this selfish desire of mine…!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka…&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn’t make out the expression Neneka was making from the other side of the room. But I could hear from her voice that she was about to cry.</p>



<p>Maybe the reason she pretended to meet me for the first time and tried to avoid talking to me when she was unpacking was because she was thinking that we had to break up?</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. You can’t fall in love with a brother and sister. It’s a violation of the law…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… but… siblings-in-law can usually fall in love and even get married, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Silence…</p>



<p>Neneka’s rebut ceased.</p>



<p>Then, after a while, Neneka said in a dubious voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;… Just now… What did you say?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing Neneka’s dubious question, I suddenly realized.</p>



<p>Could it be that Neneka did not know that siblings-in-law had the freedom to love each other?</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if we become… siblings-in-law, Neneka and I could still get married, right? Since we are not blood-related.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We can get married!? Wah!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly the door of the bathroom opened vigorously, and I was pushed back into the changing room along with that momentum.</p>



<p>When I turned around and looked, I saw Neneka looking at me through the open doorway with a sweet smile lingering on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought… I thought that I could only live being Daiki’s sister from now on… So… I can still remain as Daiki’s girlfriend right…&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka hugged the bath towel tightly in front of her body and smiled. Part of her body was still hidden by the bath towel, but her present status remained the same, completely naked.</p>



<p>My finally suppressed worldly desires, got its switch flipped on yet again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm, I can see you…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka disappeared behind the door in a panic.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m really sorry…! Even though I told you that it was embarrassing to be seen, and here I did something stupid myself…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s okay…&#8221;</p>



<p>I saw it again.</p>



<p>For the second time, the completely naked Neneka was clearly etched in my memory. This was something I couldn’t forget even if I wanted to…</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you get relieved knowing that it’s okay for us to remain lovers?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I returned back to the subject, trying not to think about Neneka’s naked body. I heard Neneka say.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want… to remain as Daiki’s girlfriend. From now on too, even after we become siblings-in-law because I am still Daiki’s girlfriend after all right!&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka’s happy voice could be heard through the door.</p>



<p>I was also relieved that I didn’t have to part ways with Neneka too.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m also glad&#8230; because I had never even thought about breaking up with Neneka.&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps because I also got relieved my voice sounded almost like turning inside out when speaking. My mind seemed to be unable to think clearly, even my vision seemed to get a little distorted.</p>



<p>I didn’t know what this feeling of a blur in the back of my head was… Perhaps, I guess I was in a really bad situation right now?</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay? Your voice sounds a bit hoarse?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sorry. I feel like I’m going to get all flustered…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I don’t get out of here soon, I might seriously collapse in the bathroom…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s go with the plan quickly shall we!&#8221;</p>



<p>If I collapsed in the bathroom, it was really going to be game over for real. There would be an ambulance fiasco and our family’s first day together would become a total mess.</p>



<p>We didn’t have much time left. There was no more time to wonder if we should or should not go through with the plan.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then… let’s start it then.&#8221;</p>



<p>I murmured with determination, and Neneka immediately followed on.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… Let’s do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I’ll go towards the wall.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I faced the wall of the bathroom and got close enough to almost touch the tip of my nose.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka, it’s good now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm…!&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard the door open with a click and felt Neneka enter the bathroom. I waited patiently, and then Neneka called out to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m in the bathtub now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Copy that.&#8221;</p>



<p>I gently moved along the wall so as not to see the tub, I opened the door, and escaped into the changing room.</p>



<p>Phew…</p>



<p>The chill in the air was pleasant, it was easier to breathe than in the bathroom.</p>



<p>This alone was enough to bring me back to life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you alright there, Daiki?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka’s voice came from behind the door. She must have left the bathtub and came in front of the door of the bathroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m good now. Don’t worry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… take it easy, ok?&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard the sound of Neneka using hot water.</p>



<p>I almost started imagining that she was washing and scrubbing her face with a towel from the bathroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>I approached the door as Neneka spoke.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki’s mother is such a sweet person…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm. After I asked Daiki to leave so I could unpack, Daiki’s mother came over to help me unpack. When I told her &#8220;Thank you for lending me such a big room&#8221; do you know what her response was?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She said, &#8220;I don’t believe I’m renting you anything or so, this room now already belongs to you, Neneka-chan, so don’t hesitate in using it however you want…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. That truly sounds just like my mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought she was nice and kind. I was so happy when I realized that this was the person my dad had fallen in love with.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And then you know…&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought, because she is such a wonderful mother, Daiki also became such a kind-hearted and wonderful person… and then, I came to like Daiki even more and more.&#8221;</p>

<p>To that straight feeling directly put forth in words by Neneka, my face became hot.</p>



<p>Being embarrassed, I pressed my mouth with the towel I held at hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you…&#8221;</p>



<p>My voice was muffled because I was still holding my mouth with a towel.</p>



<p>I wondered if she heard me.</p>



<p>But Neneka responded from the other side of the door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm, me as well. Thank you. I’m so happy to be a part of your family… I’m looking forward to living with you from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm. Me too.&#8221;</p>



<p>That’s right. From today on, we were a family. We had many complex circumstances, but we were now a family.</p>



<p>We were no longer just a single-mother household nor a single-father household. But rather lived with both of our proper parents.</p>



<p>Moreover, I had a sibling as well… I would hardly ever have to spend time alone waiting for my parents to come home.</p>



<p>I heard the sound of running hot water jabbing from the bathroom, and after a while, a voice called out to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m done with my bath now!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh! All right!&#8221;</p>



<p>All that was left to be done was for me to enter the bathroom without looking at Neneka, and for Neneka to walk behind me, out of the bathroom.</p>



<p>I quietly opened the door and moved alongside the wall. I made sure that the wall was the only thing in my sight. I was extremely careful not to let Neneka see the front side of my body as well. As I approached the wall a short distance away from the door, I called out to Neneka.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s okay to come out now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>The sound of water reverberated as Neneka rose from the bathtub.</p>



<p>I felt Neneka moving behind me, but I didn’t hear the door close.</p>



<p>Had she not left the bathroom yet?</p>



<p>I couldn’t turn around to check, so I waited patiently for Neneka’s voice.</p>



<p>Then suddenly, something traced my back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fu-ah!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah oops… sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly Neneka’s voice appeared from right behind me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Eh? Neneka, are you behind me right now!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… I thought that your back looked so attractive, and I couldn’t help but touch it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, is that s-so? I haven’t done anything in particular though…&#8221;</p>



<p>I got flustered getting praised all of a sudden.</p>



<p>Despite all of that, Neneka continued to touch and pat my back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn’t you tell me that after you entered high school, you had a part-time job that you had been working hard on. Maybe that’s how you workout?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I see… I was helping out with my neighbor’s store. That old man made me carry all these boxes of liquor. They were pretty heavy, so that probably contributed to my muscle training?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… you look so sturdy and cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt something warm touching my back.</p>



<p>It was Neneka. Neneka was clinging onto my back.</p>



<p>I became so nervous that I couldn’t speak. I subconsciously held my breath.</p>



<p>I felt Neneka’s soft and smooth skin all over my back. It was completely different from mine, soft and squishy.</p>



<p>&#8220;In our parents’ minds, we are siblings-in-law, but I am Daiki’s girlfriend, okay? So, one day we’ll tell them… about us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka said this while still hugging me from the back.</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you, Daiki.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those words of love spoken by a completely naked Neneka… That triggered my shower handle to turn upwards.</p>



<p>&#8220;… Ugh.&#8221;</p>



<p>I moaned involuntarily and leaned forward.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? What’s wrong, Daiki? Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Sensing my unusual condition, Neneka called out to me in a concerned tone.</p>



<p>However, I was just preoccupied and struggled to hold down my handle from switching on.</p>



<p>Wait. For the love of God, could my handle switch wait? What was I going to do if it completely went up?</p>



<p>If my handle switch turned up, hot water would start flowing out of the hose, and then this hot water would splash out of the shower head.</p>



<p>In other words, this shower switch handle was the command center of the shower device. If this handle was allowed to do what it wanted, my worldly desires would start moving all at once.</p>



<p>Once it would start moving, it won’t stop! If this got out of hand, it would no longer be manageable!</p>



<p>And after these worldly desires flew out the hose, there was no way to stop it from going out of the shower head.</p>



<p>&#8211;I won&#8217;t let you my handle switch. I am not going to let this hose get any hotter, nor am I going to allow the shower head to be freed!</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Daiki! Are you feeling sick? It&#8217;s because you were in the bathtub for all that time, right? Do you feel dizzy? No way, heat stroke?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka anxiously pulled my arm. I suddenly felt something soft touching my arm.</p>



<p>&#8211;Ne—Neneka’s chest!?</p>



<p>I was in a pinch.</p>



<p>My will was all mixed up. If the water came out, so would that hot water.</p>



<p>In other words, no matter how calm I tried to be. I couldn’t stop my lust from taking control anyway…</p>



<p>I could no longer be picky about my means!</p>



<p>I prepared myself and told the situation to Neneka.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry!! My shower switch handle is about to turn up, so please go on ahead!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki’s shower switch handle? Just what are you talking about!? Are you really okay!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Not only was that too indirect, but I made her worry even more.</p>



<p>The only way to talk about a man’s peculiar pinch was perhaps to be as straight-forward as possible.</p>



<p>That was right, how about &#8220;my son,&#8221; and a foolish son at that.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you see my foolish son is… rising into power…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your foolish son… rising into… power?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather, even I was doubtful about my own word choice…</p>



<p>I couldn’t tell what was going on &#8220;as it was&#8221; and decided to use a proverb of a foolish son at that…</p>



<p>But well, you see, I wondered if any of my buddies could express themselves completely to their girlfriend in this situation, especially since it had only been two months into the relationship.</p>



<p>… No matter what anyone said, it was absolutely impossible for me.</p>



<p>Without turning around, I started to examine Neneka’s condition.</p>



<p>I saw Neneka mumbling and thinking &#8220;foolish son rising into power… foolish son rising into power…&#8221;</p>



<p>And then let out a small groan.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… Congratulations?&#8221;</p>



<p>As expected, all of this went over her head. Well, surely it would be a happy occasion if this foolish son could at last rise into power.</p>



<p>&#8220;… I’m really sorry, Daiki. Even though I don’t really understand what Daiki is saying, I’m sure you are just tired and feeling dizzy. I’ll get dressed right away so you can go to your room! Wait just a moment!&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka started leaving in a hurry, and soon after, I heard the door close.</p>



<p>Even if my message flew over her head, Neneka left the bathroom… that was all that mattered. All’s well that ends well.</p>



<p>I slowly moved to the side and switched the temperature control handle of the actual shower and turned on the water. Then I took a vigorously cold shower to clear my head.</p>



<p>My heated body cooled down at once.</p>



<p>It may sound harsh, but I didn’t intend to praise my son for trying to make a name for itself in a place like this at such a time.</p>



<p>Rather… don’t give an atmosphere as if saying, &#8220;But dad, I worked hard to get your approval…&#8221; This damn son of mine.</p>



<p>&#8211;Honestly… What the hell was I seriously thinking about?</p>



<p>I guess getting too involved in trying to fight my worldly desires, I got myself in a funny tension.</p>



<p>The hot water switch of my desires or even my shower handle was also in itself a mystery to me.</p>



<p>And in the end, perhaps the conscience that I was trying to involve or rather involving Neneka in that mysterious worldview or hell.</p>



<p>&#8211;A-Ah, I showed her something disgusting…</p>



<p>For the past two months, my relationship with Neneka had been calm and laid back. We hadn’t even kissed yet, just shyly holding each other’s hands while feeling embarrassed.</p>



<p>But today, perhaps was the start of a sudden development.</p>



<p>We started living together even before we told our parents that we were dating. I suddenly saw Neneka naked, and I also showed her something I didn’t really want her to see.</p>



<p>I wondered what was going to happen from here on out if this was the first day of us living together.</p>



<p>&#8211;If I could wash my troubles away in the shower, I wouldn’t have any trouble at all…</p>



<p>Even if it was once gone, I could envision it coming back again.</p>



<p>The fountain of troubles for high school boys was bigger than the largest dam in Japan. It was unreasonable to ask them to live with a girl they liked and told them to keep a lid on it…</p>



<p>&#8211;But I didn’t really want to impose my own desires on Neneka, I should value Neneka’s own feelings above all else!</p>



<p>ME!</p>



<p>I told myself that strongly as I was drenched in cold water.</p>



<p>Even if I had something I wanted to do. I would never emphasize my own feelings over the feelings of the girl I loved and make her cry. There was a timing to everything, and there must be a suitable time for the relationship between Neneka and I to move forward. And when that time eventually befalls, I would definitely receive a revelation saying, &#8220;Now is the time!&#8221; Maybe.</p>



<p>And as I was putting forth the idea of winning in my waterfall purification state of mind. I heard Neneka’s voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki. I’ve changed my clothes, so I’m heading out, ok?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… got it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I listened and waited for the bathroom door to open and close. After confirming the sound, I shut off the shower.</p>



<p>It was a long bath.</p>



<p>I went into the changing room after Neneka had left, took a fresh towel and wiped myself down.</p>



<p>My body felt dull because I had suddenly cooled down after being hot for so long. I was as tired as I was during the summer vacation in junior high school when I played around in the public swimming pool with my friends.</p>



<p>&#8220;All right, all that’s left is to go back to my room safely and put on my clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was sure Neneka was holding our parents in their tracks.</p>



<p>All I had to do was calm down and head to my room.</p>



<p>Wrapping the towel around my waist, I slipped quietly out of the bathroom.</p>



<p>&#8211;When I thought about it, perhaps when I switched places with Neneka in the bathroom earlier, shouldn’t it have been fine for the both of us to wrap the towels around our bodies…?</p>



<p>Once the atmosphere settled down, I noticed that there was another safer way.</p>



<p>Maybe I subconsciously thought that I shouldn’t bring in a bath towel in the bathroom, but since it was my own home bath and not a hot spring or public bath-house. We could have done exactly that without any worries.</p>



<p>Being too desperate, I couldn’t be calm, no matter what thought I was in.</p>



<p>&#8211;No, no, if I started thinking about it, I would just get even more depressed. Rather, I worked well and hard in an unexpected emergency situation such as that. Let’s call it good and move on…</p>



<p>I dragged my exhausted body as I walked towards my room.</p>



<p>And about thirty minutes after I escaped from the bath, I put on my clothes and was in my room lying on my bed on my back.</p>



<p>Exhausted from being in the bath for so long and from all those stimulations. Even though I took a last dip in the cold water, I still had some leftover feelings of being burned up.</p>



<p>I continuously felt dull, sleepy and groggy, then there was a knock at my room door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Onii-chan… Is it okay if I come in…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yeah…&#8221;</p>



<p>When I answered, Neneka came into the room.</p>



<p>I rolled over my bed and turned my face towards Neneka.</p>



<p>She was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt and above-the-knee shorts. My heart skipped a beat when I saw Neneka wearing a girly patterned pajama that seemed to be a top and bottom set.</p>



<p>&#8211;I’ve only been dating her for two months, but it was okay for me to see her like this!</p>



<p>Every cell in my body was squirming in agony, saying, &#8220;Oh no, I can’t do it, my girlfriend is just too cute.&#8221; I was shaking on a cellular level at the sight of something so precious.</p>



<p>Neneka not knowing I was in such a state, approached the bed and held out a towel towards me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you might have gotten a little hot water poisoning, so I brought you some coolant.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you…&#8221;</p>



<p>The cold towel felt nice and cool when pressed against my face.</p>



<p>Neneka’s kindness made me so happy that my face naturally broke into a grin.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do you look so happy, Onii-chan?&#8221; She got down near my bedside and placed her chin ever so slightly on my bed. Her face was close.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not sure why, but whenever I hear you call me &#8220;Onii-chan,&#8221; I get really embarrassed.&#8221;</p>



<p>I said and Neneka groaned, &#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I’ve thought about it a lot and I think I’ll continue to treat Daiki like an older brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What!? Why? Are you planning on never &#8220;coming out&#8221; clean in front of our parents about our relationship!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, because first of all, even if we do &#8220;come out&#8221; clean I don’t think there is any merit for us in any way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There will be no merit for us?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I figured if they knew we were dating, we wouldn’t be able to spend time in the house together as lovers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wouldn’t it be better if they knew we were dating so we could be together in the house with impunity?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I think it’s counterproductive. Don’t you think they would tell us to keep our relationship moderate and restrict. Like… not to go to each other’s rooms. Also, if our grades were to drop, they would blame us for dating…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is Neneka’s father likely to say something like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm, I suppose he would say that. When I was watching a drama with him once where a teenage boy and girl were living together, he would constantly complain about how could their parents allow such a thing to happen. I don’t think we would live separately since they just got remarried, but don’t you think that they would set some rules.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Besides, there are some advantages for not &#8220;coming&nbsp; out&#8221; on them that we’re dating.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Our parents have just remarried. I think they are worried about whether or not the whole family will be able to live together well. In such a situation, how do you think they would feel if Onii-chan and I lived together as brother and sister on good terms?&#8221;</p>



<p>The children did not even know each other existed until they remarried. If these children were to get along without showing any discontent…</p>



<p>&#8220;Wouldn’t that make them happy…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes! That’s what I mean!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing my answer, Neneka said excitedly.</p>



<p>&#8220;If a couple from class were to shut themselves in a room together, people would get suspicious and wonder what they were doing, right? But if a brother and sister were to do the exact same thing, wouldn’t they think that they were trying to deepen their relationship… and people wouldn’t want to disturb them, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn’t know if everything would go according to what Neneka was imagining, but I did understand that the sibling stance would make it harder for our parents be on their guard.</p>



<p>&#8220;Neneka, have you been thinking about that ever since you got out of the bath?&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka giggled confidently &#8220;fufu…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because it’s important… We have to make a proper plan and proceed with it. It’s so exciting isn’t it&#8230; like a game, going out with each other behind our parents’ back.&#8221;</p>



<p>I unknowingly laughed when I heard Neneka having such positive thoughts.</p>



<p>There were many things I liked about Neneka, but first, I loved her constant positive outlook.</p>



<p>Also, I liked the fact the she thought hard about everything. Sometimes she even worried about unnecessary things, but I admired her imagination to be able to envision various patterns.</p>



<p>I loved Neneka, including the fact that she sometimes acted like a goofball.</p>



<p>I was glad that she was my girlfriend and… I was glad that my new sibling-in-law was her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let’s keep it a secret and quietly spend more time together in the future. It’s not often you get a chance to live with the person you love, and don’t you feel lucky? I thought it would be difficult to spend time together outside of school since we have exams to take, but… now we don’t have to worry about that anymore too right…&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka laughed &#8220;ehehe.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her mischievous smile made my heart pound.</p>



<p>&#8211;I thought Neneka was a serious honor student type, so I didn’t expect her to have the qualities of a prankster.</p>



<p>Seeing this unexpected side of her made me pleasantly uneasy.</p>



<p>I got up and sat on top of my bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even so, I was caught off guard as I didn’t know that my dad’s marriage partner had a child. If I had known that I was going to live with Daiki then I would have bought prettier sleepwear.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Neneka said that, she started playing with the upper hem of her sleepwear with her fingers. This caused the hem of the sleepwear to roll up, giving me a glimpse of Neneka’s unguarded cleavage.</p>



<p>I quickly looked away, trying not look there.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m sure that my dad didn’t talk about the existence of a child of his marriage partner because he thought that I wouldn’t listen to him seriously. It’s not that I wasn’t interested in the re-marriage, it’s just that I thought that if it was the person that my dad chose, then there was no doubt about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>I laughed when I heard it.</p>



<p>Neneka’s lips pouted in frustration.</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard a bit about that in the bath earlier too, but since you’re so just like me in just about everything, I couldn’t help but laugh.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Ah, is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, but if we did know that, we wouldn’t have had the miracle of not knowing until the day we moved in together, that the child of my parent’s re-marriage partner was someone I was presently dating.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wah… you are right…&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka, while still fiddling with the hem of her sleepwear, lowered her eyebrows and laughed.</p>



<p>I wondered if it bothered her that much. She looked so cute.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think this sleepwear is also very, very cute too…&#8221;</p>



<p>When I said that, Neneka looked happy and responded, &#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, when I save up my allowance, I’ll definitely buy a new set! Hey, what kind of sleepwear do you like?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? I-I don’t know anything about girls’ clothes though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh… does nothing come to your mind? Even though I wanted to buy something which would make Daiki say &#8220;You’re the cutest in the world,&#8221; if I get no hints, how am I going to choose…&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka leaned forward with her hands on the bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want me to wear something cute? Or something mature?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…? I think it should be fine with whatever you like and feel comfortable in…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, think about it seriously…! Do you want something with a skirt? Or something like what I am wearing right now?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I tried to back away from Neneka, she climbed onto the bed following me.</p>



<p>And now, both Neneka and I were on my bed.</p>



<p>The distance between our faces had shrunk to just about twenty centimeters.</p>



<p>Her beautiful eyes were fixed on me. My gaze unintentionally drew towards Neneka’s coral-colored lips.</p>



<p>&#8211;Was this perhaps… a chance?</p>



<p>I fearfully touched Neneka’s cheek.</p>



<p>Neneka lowered her gaze and kept her eyes down a little, but she didn’t seem to dislike it.</p>



<p>Through my palms, I could feel Neneka’s body temperature rise.</p>



<p>I held my breath and closed the distance between Neneka and I.</p>



<p>Ten centimeters to go… five centimeters more to go…</p>



<p>&#8211;&#8220;Daiki? Hey Daiki!&#8221;</p>



<p>Clank.</p>



<p>Suddenly I heard my mother’s voice. The sound of her trying to open the door.</p>



<p>At that moment, before we could think of anything else, we immediately focused on creating a distance from each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;Daiki…! As you know, tomorrow I gave to go to work. Can you please make dinner for Ryosuke-san and Neneka-chan, to&#8230; Oh? Neneka-chan’s here too.&#8221;</p>



<p>A mother who entered her son’s room at the age of the peak of adolescence without knocking.</p>



<p>The enemy of all the adolescent boys entered the room with an unsuspecting look on her face and smiled when she spotted Neneka.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, YES! Onii-chan looked a little feverish, so I brought him some cool press!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka quickly took out the cool press hiding beneath the towel on the bed and held it up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh my… Neneka-chan, you are so kind… As I thought girls are totally different after all!! They are all considerate! On the other hand, Daiki is… Even though he is around the same age as you, he still had to develop that sense…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mom, you have no room to speak to me about consideration! How many times do I have to tell you not to open the door to my room all of a sudden!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes? Were you trying to do something you weren’t supposed to be seen doing?&#8221;</p>



<p>Being looked at with a prying eye from my mother, a sweat suddenly broke out on my forehead.</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m not saying that! I get startled when the door suddenly opens! Anyone would be in a hurry to look at who came in!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Scared aren’t you… You and Neneka-chan might have to stay home alone so you should act a little firmer. If you’re surprised by just a door suddenly opening up, you won’t be able to do anything when a sudden trouble arises in front of you, now can you?&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, my mother tried to hide her own lack of delicacy up on the shelf.</p>



<p>As I was trembling with anger, Neneka gave me a rescue boot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm… so mother-in-law has to go to work tomorrow, right? Do you mind if I prepare dinner for tomorrow?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? Neneka-chan will? Is that okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! I used to cook when I lived with my dad, so I’m used to it. I can’t guarantee the taste because it’s self-made… If possible, I would like Onii-chan and my new mother to try it as well and give pointers on how I could make it better.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing Neneka’s words, my mother responded, &#8220;Maa…!&#8221; and held her hands in front of her mouth.</p>



<p>My mother’s eyes looked moist and sparkling.</p>



<p>That was because she had to live with someone insensitive for so many years. If she came across a &#8220;model daughter&#8221; such as Neneka, she would probably cry seeing the gap in our personalities. No, I think Neneka would be better described as a &#8220;model wife.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8211;No matter what others might say, I could only think of Neneka to be an example of a &#8220;good wife&#8221; in the future…</p>



<p>I didn’t know if it was because she grew up in a single-father household or if it was her natural disposition. But if one were to describe Neneka in one word &#8220;cozy&#8221; would be a word which would perfectly describe her.</p>



<p>Even a male friend of mine said that, &#8220;I don’t really want to see her as my girlfriend, but I think that if I were to marry someone, it would be someone like Torii-san.&#8221; Well I almost made an enemy out of this friend for what he said in the first half, but I completely agreed with what he said later on.</p>



<p>My mother, who was totally eased by Neneka’s lovely response, walked out of the room in a good mood, while waving her hands.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, good night.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good night.&#8221;</p>



<p>When the door closed, I was once again alone with Neneka. But we stayed still, holding our breaths, until we didn’t hear my mother’s footsteps anymore.</p>



<p>&#8220;She’s gone I guess…&#8221;</p>



<p>We let out a big sigh and relaxed our shoulders.</p>



<p>Being so used to living in this house, I knew that my mother went to the living room.</p>



<p>As I laid on my back on the bed, Neneka giggled.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was so nervous.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… I thought my heart was going to stop…&#8221;</p>



<p>Then I remembered the things we were doing earlier…</p>



<p>But Neneka headed for the door as if nothing had happened. I followed her with my eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I think it’s time for me to head back to my room.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, umm… you must be tired after all the moving today, rest well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Neneka placed her hand on the doorknob, but suddenly turned around.</p>



<p>&#8220;In front our parents, I am Onii-chan’s sister… But when we are alone, I am Daiki’s girlfriend, ok?&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing her say that shyly was unbearably cute.</p>



<p>As I watched Neneka disappear behind the door, my soul remained on the verge of slipping away.</p>



<p>&#8211;I wondered if I would really be okay living with such a cute girlfriend?</p>



<p>But if I was asked &#8220;Why would you think that?&#8221; It would be hard to answer.</p>



<p>While asking myself these questions, I wished that no one would ask me the &#8220;Why&#8221; part in the future.</p>
