<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p>Even though I was sure she had not done any therapy or coloring on her hair, still when compared to this wild-like hair of mine, her hair was totally different. Her thin hair gave a brownish hue and looked beautiful swaying slightly, in that evening sunlight.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Presently, there weren’t any students who came to borrow books nor was there anyone studying in the library, where we were currently sitting. The librarian was also for some reason or another out of her seat. It was just me and her, being members of the library committee.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;It was true that in the library, with just the two of us in there, I was being confessed to by Torii-san about her feelings towards me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well to be honest I had some instincts suggesting to me that she would say something like this, one day. While there were also some of my feelings, fantasizing and hoping if she would say something like this to me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This was why I had been practicing simulations in my brain repeatedly, regarding my reply to her when it would be the time. Although, the actual Torii-san in front of me, slightly surpassed the cuteness of the Torii-san who confessed her feelings repeatedly to me, in my head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>On receiving a heavy shock which was beyond my calculations, I replied.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I never knew that you were thinking… about wanting to have a relationship with me.&#8221; While probably having this poker face, I thought.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m sorry… suddenly saying that aloud must have put you in a bind, right.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torii-san laughed it off with an apologetic-sad look on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Seeing the expression on her face, I hurriedly returned to my senses and said.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;I’m fine! I was a little surprised, but umm&#8230; I’m totally fine!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;No, no, no, what the heck was okay!? Because of not replying properly and staying stunned for some time, Torii-san now had this apologetic-sad face you know!?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Follow her up more properly! ME!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Rather, I must reply as soon as possible!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The words that came out of my mouth were so insignificant that I couldn’t help but grumble at myself in my mind.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Reply!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was determined to do so, but nothing came to my mind. The more I rushed to say something in return, the less I knew what to say.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The answer to the confession, which I had prepared in advance, had been gloriously deleted from my memory.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The power of… Torii-san’s confession was tremendous to that extent.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since a few moments ago, even my heart was in an abnormal state. It was beating like those drums of a folk music where the folk people would dance in joy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;You know, when I thought… that I might be able to be with you, Morita-kun, if I joined the library committee, I became its member once again this year. When we were in second year and got paired together for library duty, I fell in love with Morita-kun…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I was still dumbfounded and couldn’t reply. Torii-san began to speak while staring at the library counter in front of her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;And so, I decided that if Morita-kun also became a member of the library committee this year… &nbsp;I would confess my feelings to him.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torii-san’s cheeks were dyed red. Her slender fingers were constantly, repeatedly brushing her hair around her face over the back of her ears.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just by looking at her, I could feel the tension in Torii-san’s body as if she was just about to burst.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;We’re already in our third year of high school, and we are students preparing to take exams, so this isn&#8217;t the time to think about any feelings such as love. But since it’s our last year… and, it might be the last year I spend my time together in the same school as Morita-kun… so I was hoping we could make some memories together, even in the limited time we have together&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Those big, round eyes looked at me in a blink.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Then the bottom of those eyebrows lowered down. She looked anxious and uneasy.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;So if you’d like to… go out with me?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I must answer her quickly.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As long as my feelings were conveyed, that was all that mattered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I took several deep breaths. Then, answered.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yes… if you’re okay with me, please take care of me…&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;…!&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Even me… from that very second year I’ve come to like Torii-san… so, I am also… happy.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torii-san’s anxiety disappeared from her face and she lit up.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I was also relieved that I could finally say these important lines very well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had never seen Torii-san so happy before, as she did when now smiling in front of me cutely.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torii-san, who always had a calm and gentle personality, was not the type of girl who would stand out at our school. However, she could naturally be conversed with by both girls and boys. A girl who soothed you just by her presence.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>No matter who talked to her, she always responded kindly, and I never saw her talking behind someone’s back. Rather, I saw her plenty of times calmly rebuking her friends who were talking badly about others behind their backs, which was why slowly many boys started to have a favorable opinion of her.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first time I talked to Torii-san was last year. When we were both in different classes but were enrolled in the same library committee. It was around the time when we happened to get paired up completely by chance and were on library duty on the very same days.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Since the construction of the municipal library in front of the station the number of students using the school library had seemingly decreased, and so, the library committee members had very little to do. Therefore, Torii-san and I instinctively started chatting to pass the time and became friends as we talked and talked about with each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torii-san had lost her mother in an accident when she was three years old, and was living with her father ever since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I had also lost my father when I was five due to severe illness and thus, lived with my mother ever since.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, we had one thing in common, we had both lost one of our parents when we were still young. I think it didn’t take us long to hit it off due to the similarities in our circumstances.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I immediately fell in love with Torii-san.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>And as I started to have a crush on her, I had been trying my everything to pull her attention towards me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I read all the novels Torii-san said she liked and also acquired the mascot of her favorite character from the arcade, and said, &#8220;I don’t want it, so I’ll give it to you, &#8221; while repeating over and over again in my mind, I love you, I have my eyes only for you.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Somehow I felt that I fell in love with Torii-san before she fell in love with me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But even then, the reason that it took me so long to put my confession, &#8220;I love you, Torii-san&#8221; into words was surely because I was too embarrassed to say them in front of her…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It was really, really pitiful of me.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Fufu… ah it feels so wonderful… I’m so, so very happy now.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Torii-san became so overwhelmed by her emotions that she looked as if she was about to cry despite having a smile on her face.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Looking at that, I felt my inner feelings for Torii-san starting to gush up all of a sudden.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;From now on, please take care of me… Torii-san.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Yeah…! Umm I would be happier if you called me by my first name…?&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;Then… Neneka.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8220;… Yeah, I’ll also be in your care. Daiki.&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The moment I was called by my very name from Torii-no-from Neneka, my chest started to feel fluffy and itchy…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So, this was how good and happy it felt to be called by your own name by your crush.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The distance between us shortened, and we became aware that we were now special to each other.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From today onwards, we were lovers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Of course, since we were both test-takers, we might not be able to go on dates with each other all the time.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But how about studying together? If we studied while encouraging each other, we were sure to pass. And then, once in a while, we could go out and roam to relax. Also, we could go to the places which would help in our studies as well. Like going to museums or art galleries which were good places to learn about history. Aquariums and zoos might be good for studying… biology as well.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After the committee meeting was finally over, we headed towards the station together while talking about such things.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The usual way home was somehow completely different than usual.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The girl on my left, my school crush, was now my girlfriend. By this very thing alone, even the scent of the air seemed to smell different now.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;&#8220;I’ve got a girlfriend, now, dad&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I spoke to my heart while facing the dim-lit sky.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I wondered if my father was watching me right now, from somewhere.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>&#8211;I hope he is laughing at me while watching me on cloud nine, getting my very first girlfriend.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Probably it was also because today was the best day of my life so far.</p>
