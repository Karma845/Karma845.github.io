<h2 class="has-text-align-center1">Chapter 21 &#8211; A Dtrangely Blended Saint</h2>
<p class="calibre4">　After all, no one knew the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Just because Viscount Given was too suspicious, there was no evidence that he had sent a monster.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But they couldn’t stay passive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Baron Clausel extended the period of stay of the knights dispatched to each village by about half a year and ordered them to protect us until spring.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Among them, the village of Ren, who had direct contact with the monster, was decided to be stationed indefinitely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　These messages arrived after November, and another month has already passed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　&mdash;- Things were busily exchanged, and the season quickly turned to winter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Far from the morning frost, the cultivated soil area is covered with pure white snow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Due to the presence of Ren, they were able to prepare abundantly for this winter. Not only firewood but also food is bought in a reasonable amount.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　All were the result of Ren going hunting on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Besides, I still have a lot of assets related to the thief wolfen, so I think we will be able to live a comfortable life for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ren. It was a good hunt today.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I thought it would be hard to move in winter, but when I got used to it, it didn’t seem like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">　Ren looked up at the afternoon sun and said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　A dozen little boars piled up next to the bridge, showed that today’s hunting was going well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I feel that my handling of swords has improved recently)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The reason is simple: I was fighting without relying on the natural magic (small) of the wooden magic sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ever since the knights were stationed, hunting has always been with them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Therefore, the improvement of my sword’s arm is the result of fighting while hiding the summon magic sword skill.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I feel like I don’t have to hide it, but I’ve hidden it so far)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　If you come this far</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Besides, the skill level is also being obtained properly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Instead of the wooden magic sword or the iron magic sword, he summoned the thief’s magic sword and equipped it at his fingertips, so there is nothing wrong with it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　At present, I’m not in trouble because I’m hiding it, so I intended to stay like this for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ren. Please leave the transportation of the little boars to us.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I always say, I’ll carry it too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren said so and carried four little boars on both shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　It’s always a mysterious sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　If a boy like Ren carries it so easily, the adult knights are likely to lose their self-confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But it wasn’t due to the fact that Ren subdued Thiefwolfen alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it better for Ren to leave the village?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The knight suddenly said this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What, why so suddenly?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You will definitely be a great success. Maybe you could be a knight who is well known in the Imperial City.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right,&nbsp; I can’t say it too loudly, but from our point of view, I think that Ren-dono is more like a reincarnation of the Seven Heroes than the heir apparent of the seven great barons.. “</p>
<p class="calibre4">　It was embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I’m happy to be praised, but it’s embarrassing to be praised by two adults.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have no intention of leaving this village, because I’m the successor to the Ashton family.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　It’s not the first time he’s been praised like this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　When praised, Ren always says he is the successor to the Ashton family and says he has no intention of leaving the village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm … really regrettable …”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop it. Any more will bother Ren.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh … that’s right.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The three of us go back to the mansion while talking. It was a heavy step to walk on the field road, which was much harder to walk on than before it snowed, and it made me feel like I was training.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Only the sound of squeaking, squeaking, and stepping on the snow can be heard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The snow that fell gently seemed to envelop the entire village in a tranquility not found in summer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　◇　◇　◇　◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The mansion is very old as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The roof was making a creaky sound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　…… The weight of the snow is about to break it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Is it possible to overcome this winter?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Concerned, Ren sighs and remembers making money from the thief wolfen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I t should be able to repair the roof dozens of times.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　When I think about it, I realize that there are other uses besides medicinal herbs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m home”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren opened the door to the dirt floor leading to the kitchen and called out to Mireille, who was always waiting inside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　However, that is not the case today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Instead, Lithia, who sat in a chair by the table, resting her cheeks on her hands, said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, welcome back. If it’s your mum, she’s at Grandma Rigg’s.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Perhaps because her response was so natural, the returning Ren adapted without pointing it out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see, no wonder she wasn’t here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why don’t you take a bath first? I brought a magic tool from the mansion, so I think it’s useful in various ways.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m curious about that. I’ll take your word for it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren walked straight through the dirt floor, past Lithia, and out of the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　When he went to the dressing room with a familiar step, the situation was certainly different.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow … it’s a hair dryer, this”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Looking at the magic tool placed in front of the mirror, which is not very transparent, I recall the memories of my previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　From the fact that I had wiped my hair with a towel and dried it in front of the fireplace until today, it feels like a sudden modernization.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Excited Ren quickly takes off his clothes and steps into the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, there are magic tools inside.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I didn’t have a shower until today, but now I have one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I wondered where the hot water was drawn from, and when I looked at it, it was connected to a huge crystal ball about the size of a human head at the bottom of the shower attached to the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Apparently, water is also produced by the power of magic tools.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　According to the common sense that Ren knows, magic tools basically operate on magic stones.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Therefore, hot water and water are also generated from that power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　It was really convenient not to have to draw water from the river, let alone a well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… How much will it cost?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Even if he said a shower easily, he felt that it was incomparably expensive compared to his previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　However,&nbsp; he had no intention of asking Lithia about the price. Because he was too scared to hear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm … it feels good … it’s the best …”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Will I be able to live a better life if I go to Clausel? No, don’t think about strange things. All you have to do is make money in this village and make this mansion easier to live in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　In the face of the power of civilization for the first time in a long time, Ren is proud to have endured the temptation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I laughed softly when I saw myself in the mirror in the bathroom where no one was there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　As he did so, a question suddenly arose.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　He utters a sullen voice and folds his arms while bathing in the warm water of the shower pouring down from above.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………… Hmm !?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　And I noticed a feeling of strangeness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　It’s a mystery why I didn’t notice until now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But even Ren has an excuse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I couldn’t imagine the saint, who was unexpected and who I thought couldn’t come so soon, would come so quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I’m aware that I was out of sorts but …!)</p>

<p class="calibre4">　It seems that he was off guard because he was on his way home from hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren makes excuses in his heart, not to anyone, and taps his cheeks to tighten his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Action was quick after this, and Ren hurried out of the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Wet hair was roughly wiped with a towel, then he changed into clothes and rushed through the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The destination was the kitchen where Lithia was for some reason.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why !?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　He opened the door in a hurry and uttered an unreserved voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Then, when she saw Ren who appeared in a noisy manner,</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why did you scream so suddenly! My ears hurt!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Lithia lifts her eyebrows and says.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　She then held her ears down and twisted her lips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So why are you here !?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s because I came!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you come, of course you’ll be there, but that’s not what I’m asking …! I’m saying! Why is the young lady who should be in Clausel in this village!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　It’s also a problem that I’ve been accepting too much naturally until now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But more than that, the fact that Lithia was here was more shocking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　…… Lithia, who was once surprised by Ren’s voice, gradually regains her composure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　This time, she looked at him again and smiled daintily, somewhat triumphantly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s only one reason I’m here. You’re not coming to Clausel, so I came instead.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren was stunned that she hadn’t given up yet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I heard that the lady is busy …”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fufu, Be relieved. I’ve done it all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“―――― What? Did you say all?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I came to this village with all the study and work done by the beginning of winter.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　After all, there are no defects.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　She has a wonderful ability to act.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“… How did you make an excuse for the Baron?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In the case of Viscount Given, I said that the Clausel family should also move aggressively. The daughter of the lord … If I, a saint, would come, they might refrain from making any careless movements. He can’t refuse that, right? “</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Baron Clausel, Lithia’s father, would have had to nod to such a reasonable proposal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren soon realized it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　After all, this girl is not just a girl who wants to hone her sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Lithia Clausel is a hard worker and a smart woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(No way to meet again so soon)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　―――― The only problem for Ren was that she was too active.</p>
