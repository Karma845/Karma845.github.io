<h2 class="has-text-align-center1">Chapter 34: Reunion</h2>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;1&#8211;</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4">After nearly two weeks on the run, we meet a familiar face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking at the words alone, one could be forgiven for thinking that they should be happy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, Ren and Licia were extremely wary.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Coming all this way to meet Viscount Given’s knights, combined with the original circumstances, should have seemed premeditated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Therefore, Ren prepared himself to draw his sword and protect Licia at any time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We were asked by Baron Clausel to assist him in his search for the two of you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“….. us?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We have to get out of here first. We’ll take you to a safe place.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">……That’s unreasonable, no matter how much you look at it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But we’re completely surrounded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s impossible to dismiss the possibility that there are knights lurking in front of, behind, to the left and right, and even everywhere in the forest, although we cannot see them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that they’re not going to let us go peacefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Fight or flee?)&nbsp;</p>

<p class="calibre4">The latter is by far the better option, but I have a thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I would like to have proof that Viscount Givens had my village attacked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t want to waste my encounter here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;- Ren.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia’s voice reaches Ren alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he saw her turn around and look at him, he knew she was thinking the same thing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If we’ve come this far, shall we go as far as we can?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“….. Of course. Ren might be in danger too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s too late for that. I’m prepared for all of this. I’m sure there will be an uproar no matter what I say.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia smiled as she looked at Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Will you leave it to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She said in a dignified voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, as you wish.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren replied calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knights surrounding them began to frown as they did this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were beginning to be slightly alarmed by the whispering of the two.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You right there.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mm, Me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The one who replied was the knight who interacted with Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. I‘ll decide whether or not to have you take me to a safe place based on your answer.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia then fished through the luggage hanging on the side of the horse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She took out the magical device in the shape of a necklace from her luggage and showed it to the knight with her arm outstretched.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Look. You recognize it, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……. No… I don’t</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you raised your eyebrows for a moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know. What on earth is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course we don’t care that much about what he says.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s only to obtain information, step by step.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is a magic tool that I took from the bandit who kidnapped me and him.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmmm……… you don’t seem to be bothered much about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s no such thing. I would very much like to keep it as evidence.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No. I’ll have the Merchant’s Guild look into it later.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;-?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knights of Viscount Givens were stunned at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, who was listening to the conversation behind Licia, was actually puzzled, but listened silently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think I can handle it since I got to know the head of the guild when I went to the imperial capital before.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, what are you going to do with it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to ask him to look into the merchant who sold this magic tool, or the previous owner of it, or whatever information he can get.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… It’s impossible. How many magic tools do you think there are in the Leomel Empire?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know. But this is definitely an expensive item. Unlike most of the magic tools in circulation, there must be someone who has a clue.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is a bluff.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Licia’s words were too convincing to be dismissed as idle talk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The small agitation among the knights began to grow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If that’s known, it’ll become clear whether this is a magic tool that the bandit obtained on his own or was given to him by someone else. If it’s the latter, the person who gave it to him will be questioned at the tribunal, regardless of the circumstances.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nah&mdash;“</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Because it’s as if the person who gave it out tried to undermine us. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tension ran high.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren and Licia hid their nervousness under their seemingly spare faces, but the knights finally lost their composure and looked to their left and right to look at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Can you really confirm it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t. Viscount Givens is not a fool, and he must be very careful. But If a great noble would come to our aid…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But don’t worry. If they have any doubts at all….. see.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as they spoke in whispers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If so, it must be an even more important item. Please entrust us with the magic tool.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight in contrast said in a strong tone.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How foolish. We’re under no obligation to entrust it to you. This is my family’s territory to begin with. What happened in his village is also under our jurisdiction.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s enough. I don’t want to be protected by a knight with no sense of reason, so I’ll stop talking about it. Come on, Ren, let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hearing her words with a sigh, Ren pulled the reins.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knights were lost in thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ll need guards!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, we don’t. We’re almost close to the town, and I don’t trust anyone but him to escort me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ku…… but …….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were still trying to resist, but finally they made up their minds.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, but you two are coming with us!”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;2&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">The horses start to move.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So as not to let Ren and Licia escape.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ren. I’ll take responsibility. So let the horse run and if they try to force you to stop, pull out your sword &mdash;-!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, leave it to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren also kicked the horse in the side and rode it vigorously.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he tried to pass right by the knight who was in front of him, the knight drew his sword and flashed a sideways cleave toward Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, the knight’s sword was intercepted by the iron sword, and the blade broke as if gouged.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At this time, the knight received a cut on the back of his hand from Ren’s returning sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You ……!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight still reached out his hand, and this time Licia reached out her hand as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dazzling flash of light emanating from her hand caused a pure white burn on the knight’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you, silly knight.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The moment the horses pass each other.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Licia is in a good mood and smiles prettily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thanks to your help, I’m now able to drag Viscount Givens to the judgment seat on another matter.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You ……! After them! Don’t let them escape!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight roared.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if he had already revealed the relationship between the owner of the magic tool and Viscount Givens.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(They lost when they believed in the possibility.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t believe Licia’s insinuation about the merchants’ guild.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment, the magic tool, which was supposed to be used only for bluffing, became significant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The thought that it might be, made it necessary to capture Ren and Licia at any cost.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was also probably because he lacked composure in the face of Licia’s dignified appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The way she spoke made me think that the words she was saying might be the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t kill them! But catch them at all costs!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pursuers were desperate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They feared the possibility of their lord losing, in addition to the displeasure that would result from letting them go.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sweat broke out on their foreheads as they thought that they must catch the two no matter what it took.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, due to the obstruction by the wooden magic sword, they couldn’t close the distance as much as they wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it…. you guys, go after them! I’ll rush to Clausel and report to the Viscount!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The one who was acquainted with Ren deviated from the path on the way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The other party is also desperate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Was Lady Licia planning to do this all along?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren smirks as he sees that the other party is in dire straits.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now we have a solid confirmation of the relationship between Viscount Givens and the demon beast master. It’s enough if we can explain the situation and prove Viscount Givens is also flawed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since we couldn’t get any evidence to hunt down Viscount Givens, we used the situation so far to create another flaw.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, it was this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What were you going to do if we didn’t meet with those guys?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I was sure we would meet them, because the demon beast master had let us go. It’s only natural that they would be looking for us in a tight corner.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have a feeling that’s what happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The distance between them and their pursuers opened up in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The shouting was proportionately less, but the two couldn’t calm down yet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no time to catch their breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, who had been aiming for Clausel, sometimes passing his pursuers and avoiding the new knights lurking ahead, suddenly looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Is it night already?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">He felt fatigue in his grip on the reins and immediately noticed that his whole body felt sluggish.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps it was because he had been on the run for hours and his body and mind were growing tired.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The horse, too, was heavy-limbed with fatigue. Even so, if it were to stop, they would soon be surrounded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We were only able to manage because we took advantage of even the slightest break from time to time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Just hang in there with me a little longer, will you?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I gently stroke the horse’s mane, and it neighs briefly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The horse used to be pulling the beast master’s carriage, but perhaps a sense of camaraderie was born before I knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“….. if push comes to shove, you can leave me behind.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why are you saying stupid things?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean, stupid?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a stupid idea from one end to the other. Stop being weird and think of a way out of here!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It lacked honorific, but so what?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s voice lacks the usual composure and is frantic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because of the strong tone of her voice, which was somewhat irresistible, he listened to what Licia said honestly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s straight as it is! Run without stopping!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes! There’s nowhere else to run!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After that, they drove the horse hard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The horse they were riding had been out of breath for a long time, but its legs were still strong and vigorous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t this horse too amazing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Maybe, but I think he has the blood of a monster in him!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I see, no wonder!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I drove the horse as hard as I could.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Another hour passed, and then another.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Finally, at &mdash;- last.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Licia! Is that the hill you were talking about?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">We passed through the forest and came in sight of a broad hill.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sky is cloudless, and the visibility is much better than in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes! If we keep going over the hills, we will soon reach the place where people live!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the first time in a long time that Licia’s voice was filled with joy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren also relaxed his cheeks a little when he heard Licia’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Thank goodness ……)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The horse is doing well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No wonder Viscount Givens’ knights couldn’t catch up with them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hopefully, they would be able to keep up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Ren wished that, he raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(How did you get here&mdash;- you!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">He saw him at the end of the hillside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He was sitting on a large rock there, looking at them with a cheeky smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren and Licia felt nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no way to avoid him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They had to be ready to fight now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I knew you’d come through here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The beast master’s voice drowned out the sound of the flowers and grass swaying in the distance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As he spoke, he stood up on a large rock and spread his arms out like wings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The hem of the robe he was wearing swept over, revealing the intricate patterns on both of his arms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When Ren saw this, he secretly furrowed his brow.</p>
