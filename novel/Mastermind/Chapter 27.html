<h2 class="has-text-align-center1">Chapter 27: The Raid</h2>
<p class="calibre4">The next day, after breakfast.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, who had finished preparing for the hunt, stood in the yard, waiting for Roy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But as soon as he stepped in, Roy told him to take off his equipment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want you to take today off from hunting and go into the village to carry lumber.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Carrying lumber? What’s going on?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fortunately, Weiss-san and the others are going to help us with a lot of things. They are going to help us with the little boars that have increased ridiculously and do some carpentry work while they’re at it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, so that’s what this is about.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So I’m going to the vaults with Weiss-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren tilted his head at the word vault.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know if I told you, but there’s a shed near the bridge where we store wood. Ever since I told you before that I was going to fix up the mansion, I’ve been working on it little by little.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Roy and Weiss would visit the shed and check on the forest, while handing over the wood to the knights for transport.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that it is a flow of handing it over and carrying it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the village, Ren would assist them.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to give instructions at the storehouse and then I’m going into the forest with Weiss-san and some other knights.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss comes in just as he finishes checking these things.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mireille came out of the house after him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Roy-dono. let’s get right to it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I just talked to Ren about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Mireille came out of the house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to Grandma Rigg’s house. I need to have some medicine made for the young lady, so I won’t be back until afternoon.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, Mireille-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mireille saw Weiss bowing his head and hurriedly said “Don’t worry about it!“</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It is the duty of a knight’s family to take care of the lady. Leave this kind of work to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">With these words, she walked ahead of the others down the field path.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soon after, Ren and the others followed her out of the garden and joined the knights who were already waiting outside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, my fellow knights.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knights straightened their backs in response to Weiss’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We must return the favor and kindness shown to us. Get into position and display the physical strength you have developed over the years.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knights responded heroically.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone began to move briskly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Some followed Roy and Weiss as they walked and some started walking toward the carpentry area.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(…… It’s cloudy today.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just before he himself began to move, Ren looked up at the sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He asked the Lord God to keep the rain from pouring down from the cloudy sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">************************************************</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sure enough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Within two hours of everyone moving, the sky deteriorated rapidly and the rain began to fall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Within seconds, the fog began to roll in and the visibility was terrible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They couldn’t even see a little bit further.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ren-dono! I think we should take a break!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I understand….! The weather is getting worse.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren who replied to the knight was going back and forth between the material yard set up between the field and the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The repairing area is not limited to the mansion, but there are also some old houses, so it was more convenient to set up a relay point.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(The rain is getting heavier and heavier.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The rain was increasing and the ground was getting muddy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Let’s take a break at the house until the weather calms down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(What’s that ……?) Ren raised his eyebrows as he made this decision.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(What’s this ……?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s nose suddenly twitched.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(What’s that smell?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The smell of the soil being wet from the rain, mixed with a nose-stabbing odor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the smell of burning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In this village, there are villagers who burn fields several times a year.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a thick burnt smell, similar to when they did it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight walking right beside me also noticed the smell and raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(It’s coming from over there.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The smell came from the direction where the mansion was located.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s foot noticed this and unconsciously pushed his body forward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s this smell&mdash;-Re, Ren-dono!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight shouted and at the same time, he ran after Ren, who was running at a fast pace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two of them looked in the direction of the Ashton family mansion and saw a bright red glow at the end of the thick fog.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As they took one step closer, and then another, the true nature of the light was revealed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a fire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a flame, radiating a deep red light.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why… Why is the mansion……?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was natural to wonder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But he didn’t think about the answer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first thing that came to mind was the people who remained in the mansion. Most importantly not the knights, but &mdash;- Licia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Please wait! Ren-dono!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren ran without listening to the knight’s calls.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The distance of more than ten minutes to the mansion, he ran through in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hah …… hah …… hah ……!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As he approached the mansion, a new aroma wafted through the air that stung his nose.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mixed in with the fog and rain, there was also a slight smell of blood in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Something strange is happening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The crimson flames are raging despite the rain. It was visible and hidden behind a thick fog, and asserted its presence like the sun.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Faster…..!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">An old fence comes into view beyond the thick fog.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Further on, he could see the fallen knights in the garden.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he approached to ask how they were, he found that every single one of them had died and there was a terrible scar at the base of their necks, as if they had been bitten to death.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s hand touched the body and felt the warmth that still remained in the knight’s body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not much time had passed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Taking advantage of the fog and rain to drown out the sound too….! Who could have done this in just a moment ……?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren saw this and, fighting back the nausea that came over him, turned his attention toward the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The memorable mansion was engulfed in a raging fire and looking at the doorway, it looked like a dragon spitting flames.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He still didn’t stop and valiantly kicked through the door to get inside. He also summoned his iron magic sword and clenched it in preparation for battle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At this point, Ren wondered whether to wait for the pursuing knight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If someone had set fire to the house and attacked the knights…… that someone might still be inside the house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s definitely better to wait for the knights than to go alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;-But what would happen to Licia while he waited?　</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps the knights will arrive in less than a few minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But what if Licia falls to the deadly blade while waiting for that time? Thinking of that, he couldn’t stop, even though he was terrified.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Gasping for breath, Ren slapped his cheek and stomped into the mansion.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why is this …… happening?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The inside of the house was bright red and dazzling with flames.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The heat wave that surged through the air caused a burning pain on his skin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, Ren stepped into the raging fire and ran up toward the half-destroyed staircase.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the edge of his vision, he saw the figure of a knight who had turned into a lying, mute mass.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the face of what was clearly an unusual event, he bravely went to his room, not letting his fear get the better of him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then he arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, fighting the pain of his burns, roughly opened the door to his room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ojou-sama!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He shouted loudly toward the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the same time, he notices a man and two monsters by the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He also noticed that only the man was surrounded by a glowing blue veil, and that he wasn’t on fire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;- are you Ren Ashton?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man standing beside Lithia who was sleeping, asked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man’s gray robes made it impossible to make out anything other than the cold sound of his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren saw the white wooden staff in the man’s hand and involuntarily stiffened.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Is he the one responsible?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Anger, sadness, confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, who had been tormented by a multitude of emotions, calmly asked the man what was going on. Before answering the man’s question, he looked at the monsters following him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Those are……)</p>

<p class="calibre4">&mdash;- Maneater.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It looks like a huge black lizard, but its face has no eyes or nose, only a large mouth with sharp fangs peeking out. Its winged body, reminiscent of a bat, is about the same size as an adult.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren recalls his knowledge of the Maneater.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nervously, he swallowed his fresh spit noisily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is this your doing, Demon beast master?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“One would be a fool not to know. They’re Maneaters, aren’t they? I can’t think of any monster that would use power to create flames and a veil to protect their master from their own flames.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man let out a chuckle at Ren’s words and left the bed to approach him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, on the other hand, held up his iron magic sword, repeatedly taking a step back as the man took a step closer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Surely, the Maneaters here are monsters I summoned.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…………”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t realize that you knew that they’re part of the power of a demon beast master. I’m surprised.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren was secretly relieved that he hadn’t made a mistake, although it was all knowledge he had learned from the legends of the seven heroes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Think about it. What should I do?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Maneater is a monster that can be summoned with the skill of a demon beast master. Its power is generally equivalent to D rank if it were to be replaced by a normal monster.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It goes without saying that this is not a situation where he can easily fight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(No, my father and Weiss-sama should be here soon.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">What I need to do is buy time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I must somehow prolong this stalemate.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And as Ren is raising his vigilance&mdash;-</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh……?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The mansion shook violently.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The old mansion was being attacked by a raging fire from the inside, leading to the collapse of the mansion, which was not defeated by the pouring rain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The shaking rocked the ceiling of Ren’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, the ceiling above Licia’s bed began to collapse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This&mdash;-!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren saw this and summoned his wooden magic sword, creating tree roots and ivy to stop the collapse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Maneaters saw this and opened their big mouths to spit flames.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The roots and ivy were instantly transformed into charcoal. But on the other hand, the collapse of the ceiling was unstoppable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So Ren had no choice but to run.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Damn it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren swung the wooden sword again and again with all the strength in his muscles, and the wind pressure he generated dispelled the flames.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He didn’t stop running, and when he reached the bed, he cut through the falling ceiling to protect Lithia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;- instead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Go to sleep for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The man’s cold voice rings out and a fresh, mint-like scent reaches Ren’s nostrils.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once he smelled the scent, he felt his strength drain from his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">His eyelids grew heavy and he can’t seem to resist the urge to fall down on his own and his body easily collapses beside Lithia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What …… is ……?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s incense. It could put a small dragon to sleep for days.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren hears her voice and reaches out to protect Lithia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A moment after he embraced her slender body, Ren let go of his consciousness.</p>
