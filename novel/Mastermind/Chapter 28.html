<h2 class="has-text-align-center1">Chapter 28:In a Strange Place</h2>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;1&#8211;</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4">All my senses were dull.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was as if I wasn’t myself and the sights I was seeing were shifting independently of my will.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before he knew it, Ren was watching his own back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Like a shadow following, he followed at regular intervals.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-The village was on fire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unlike the current Ren, the Ren carrying only two little boarrs was walking dumbfounded along the field road.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knights walking next to him were speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mother….?』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, Ren threw away the little boars and started to run.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knights who started running as well ran shoulder to shoulder, and the group rushed to the Ashton family mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">……..The house was on fire when they arrived at the destination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren saw this and almost fell to his knees in weakness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, he approached the mansion with his body trembling.</p>

<p class="calibre4">My mother must be in that house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unable to think of anything else, he wished only to hear his mother’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But he was stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight pinned him down and he was deprived of his freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You can’t! 』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let go of me! My mother is &mdash;-!』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No… If you jump into that fire, you will be …… too! 』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren still continued to resist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But he was weak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The figure I saw was so weak that I could not believe it was me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I made a promise to my father at the end of his life that I would protect her……. 』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, there it was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Retreat! Quickly! 』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">A girl’s voice came from behind, mingled with the sound of hoofbeats.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When the two Rens turned to look at the voice, a dazzling light enveloped the entire area.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;- Soon after, a new scene unfolded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This time again, he could see himself from behind. A self that wasn’t him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the evening sky.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren was on a plain at the edge of the village, standing in front of a number of burlap sacks lined up between his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Dear Ren, it’s Grandma Rigg……..”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know……. I was already prepared for this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren answered without turning to the knight, his shoulders shaking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight bowed his head behind him and walked away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Weiss, his armor stained with soot, appears in his place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;- boy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss took the stunned Ren in his arms and gave him a powerful hug.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss soon has tears streaming down his cheeks. After a few moments of this, he apologizes again and again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. If only we had arrived earlier.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s okay……. It’s all because I was weak.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But …….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No…… it’s the same with my father. The night he died, I should have gathered up my courage and gone to pick rondo grass. Then he wouldn’t have died and I might have been able to handle today’s banditry.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Not so! It’s our fault!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Some of the knights lost a hand or a leg fighting for us. It was thanks to them that we were able to defeat Thief Wolfen, whom my father had driven back.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">So it’s not their fault, Ren says.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And they helped my mother. And Weiss-sama wiped out the bandits, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… No, I let one of them get away. I’m sorry. If only I had gotten there a little earlier.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Stop it. If I let you keep apologizing, I’ll get in trouble with my father.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And besides,” Ren continued.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The one you mentioned now is the young lady… right? I’m just seeing her for the first time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, yes. The young lady was so traumatized by the winter of the Thief Wolfen that she came with me to this village on behalf of my master…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The saint is amazing, isn’t she? She can dispel the flames of the mansion.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………Oh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m so grateful to her for saving my mother’s life. I can’t resent Weiss and the others for that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After he finished, Ren sat there helplessly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He hugged his knees and fell face down in front of the human-sized burlap sacks that lined the plain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A few moments of silence passed, and Ren stopped to think.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What am I going to do from today?</p>
<p class="calibre4">We can’t live in this village anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Most of the houses have been burned down and there is very little food left.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The uncertainty of the future slowly began to occupy his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to sit next to you……. ”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then came the voice of a girl &mdash;-, Licia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren looked up and saw her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia with bandages covering her fingertips, grazes on her cheeks and other parts of her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I treated your mother’s body and the other villagers as best I could…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia did everything in her power to rescue the villagers, despite her wounds, without regard to her own status.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you… that was…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But we need to treat her better. I don’t think she’ll wake up. So I will escort everyone who survived to my town and other villages.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia looks at Ren’s face as she finishes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia then uttered that the bandits were probably from the Heroic Faction or the Imperialist Faction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Clausel family was involved in a factional war. Those who were working to expand their faction would have attacked the village in a forceful and brutal manner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, nothing was forseen. There was no element of forewarning, in this case.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss and his men’s arrival was just a coincidence and without that coincidence, Ren would have lost his mother as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, Licia and Weiss were saying that it was all their fault.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia, in particular, was willing to do whatever it took to make amends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… honestly, I don’t know what to do. I can’t afford to hold a grudge against you. I’m too busy with my mother, who is seriously ill, and the villagers.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia said nothing, but nodded with a somber look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But my father told me that we’re knights in the service of the Clausel family, and we protect this village with our lives. So it’s not reasonable to hold a grudge…… and I can’t think of anything else to do…..”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tears spilled out of Ren’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He’d been able to put up with it all this time, but now, his strength failed him.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia gently embraced him.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;2&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">Was it a dream?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren opens his eyes and thinks half-asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Could that be Ren and the lady in the …… game ……?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt as if I had been shown an event in a world line I didn’t know, and this expectation unexpectedly flashed through my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I don’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Assuming that it really was a story that was never told in the game, why did I suddenly see it?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Moreover, by the looks of it, I feel uncomfortable with the flow of Ren killing Saint Licia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If the events of that world line were true, it wouldn’t be hard to understand if Ren’s murderous act was motivated by his hatred for the Clausel family and his desire for revenge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But that wasn’t the case.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t rule out the possibility that Ren in another world line would cool down after that and decide to take revenge on the Clausel family, but from the looks of it, I don’t think that line is very likely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After all, I couldn’t find the answer even if I thought about it. ……</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I worked hard to understand the current situation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(This scent…)</p>

<p class="calibre4">The first thing he perceived was a musty smell mixed with the scent of trees.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Next, he felt an unpleasant shaking throughout his body and soon the sound of creaking wood reached his ears and he also heard the sound of something being stepped on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It had been too dark to see clearly, but when I squinted and looked around, I realized that I was lying in a space reminiscent of an old hut.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Where am I?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could tell from the light coming through the walls that it was daytime, but I couldn’t make out anything else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But when I heard the sound of labored breathing coming from next door, I turned my head to look.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is when I realized that my hands and feet were bound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And when I saw the person who was at the end of my sight, I finally understood everything.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ojou……!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t remember anything since I was put to sleep by the Demon beast master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, we must be in the process of being taken somewhere since then.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh …… huh …… huh …….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Young lady, it’s me! Ren Ashton!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh……a……”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia doesn’t answer when I speak to her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She could only let out a pained exhale at one point and let the large beads of sweat on her forehead trickle down her cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m surprised you’re awake.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, a voice came from outside this space.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the voice of the beast master I had heard in the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You slept well, didn’t you? Four days of sleep should be enough.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Four days……?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">If he slept that long, they must have come a long way from the village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ren Ashton. If you stay quiet, you’ll be safe. Don’t think about anything else, just bear with it for a few more days.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What about the young lady &mdash;- what’s going to happen to the girl?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Fufu, you’re clever, aren’t you? You think I don’t know who Licia Clausel is, and you’re reiterating it to avoid revealing her true identity.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s brow furrowed at the fact that he knew what he was thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Answer me. Is the young lady safe?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not that he was reopening the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only thing is that he couldn’t ignore the fact that the beast master might have done something to Licia, so he asked again, this time in a stronger tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course. fuhaha, but can you trust me to answer that she’s safe?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……. that is.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But don’t worry. I don’t lie.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Demon beast master said with a smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just that I didn’t plan for her to be ill in the first place. If I can get medicine along the way, I’ll administer it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia’s illness is not life-threatening on its own, but complications could lead to death.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss had mentioned this before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia’s condition was worse than when she was at the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was probably due to this poor environment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(We must have been put in a carriage.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was only natural for her condition to deteriorate in an environment that smelled of mold and allowed little sunlight to penetrate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition to administering the medication as soon as possible, we need to make it easier for Licia to rest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I had taken care of the two of you by giving you potions until today. You should be thankful for that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now……I’m short of things to say…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… huh ……a…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Next to Ren, who is on the verge of rage, Licia continues to let out a pained breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For her sake, I can’t keep this quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I wouldn’t trust their word if they could get the drugs.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had no intention of trusting the man who attacked the mansion and took the lives of the knights.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, I had to escape.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia would be in danger if we didn’t escape from the demon beast master and somehow get the medicine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Ren had never left his village before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And if they had been on a horse-drawn wagon for the past four days, he didn’t know what would happen even if he could escape from their assailant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since he didn’t know the area, he might die in the open somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But even so…</p>
<p class="calibre4">(There is no way I would abandon her.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seemed that if I kept quiet, I would be assured of my own safety, but I wasn’t ready to accept that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even if Licia lost her life in the future, and it was confirmed that the same future as the legend of the seven heroes wouldn’t come, I was sure that I would regret if I abandoned her here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I don’t have my magic sword.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was still summoned, so it seems the Demon beast user hid it somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it doesn’t matter to Ren. The magic sword just needs to be re-summoned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. Keep quiet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t talk to me. Your voice makes me sick.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">”Ha-ha-ha! I’m sorry about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren didn’t want to run away right now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The best way to do this is to escape when the demon beast user was asleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I don’t increase the probability of success as much as possible, I don’t know what will happen to the lives of not only me but also Licia, who’s not considered to be very important, in the event of failure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I feel like an idiot for planning to flee at night in a place I don’t know the lay of the land.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it seemed better that way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought about yelling out somewhere crowded, but that wouldn’t necessarily get anyone to help me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After all, the only person I could trust was myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">********************************************</p>
<p class="calibre4">It has been a while since the light stopped shining through the gaps in the timber.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Is it night already?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">After waking up and realizing that the first night had come, Ren suddenly noticed that the carriage had stopped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By the way, what if I yell out and call for help?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would only end in vain. Only I can hear the sound from inside. I’ve got that kind of magic equipment set up.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s convenient. Ren sighed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……a…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">From next door, he could hear the sound of Licia’s labored breathing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pain seemed to be getting worse than during the day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This shouldn’t be the worst possible outcome.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Speed up the carriage.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s night already. Sleep today and we’ll search the village again tomorrow.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The carriage shook as the beast master stood up after saying this mercilessly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He had been sitting in the coachman’s place, but when he stood up, he went to the side of the carriage, unlocked it, and opened the door.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, who was at the end of it, was thrown food by the beast master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was dry meat, bread and water in a leather bag.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Feed them to your precious lady.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as he finished saying this, the door was quickly closed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren crawled inside the carriage and emptied the leather canteen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With it in his mouth, he brought it to Licia’s mouth and dripped some water and she began to drink a little.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a while, Ren dripped the water onto a piece of dry bread and let it soak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Immediately apologizing, he put the softened bread between his lips and gently placed it on Licia’s lips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It looked a little hard to eat, but Licia chewed a few bites while being snarled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(She won’t even stand it for a few more days like this.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia, and even Ren, would lose strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If they were going to escape, they had to move before that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(It has to be tonight. I can’t afford to wait and see what happens.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Once I’d made up my mind, I felt strangely calm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps because I was prepared for this to be the only way, I was surprisingly calm and didn’t let fear take control of my body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;- Soon, I began to faintly hear the sleeping breaths of the beast master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the same way, I can even hear the Maneater’s breathing from outside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I have no choice but to do it.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I must not think of defeating the beast master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The goal is to escape, to get away from this place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There’s no other way but to do so, since there is a D-rank equivalent Maneater.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My lady, will you entrust your life to me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I said to Licia in a whisper, and I felt the edges of her lips part a little.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing this, Ren takes a deep breath&mdash;-.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before he knew it, his heart was beating loudly and repeatedly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Knowing that he was nervous without realizing it, ‘don’t weaken now!’ He told himself strongly to boost his confidence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Let’s go, Ren &mdash;-!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">He said the words less loudly than the sound of leaves rubbing against each other, and re-summoned the iron magic sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a thud, it fell onto the wagon and he rubbed the chains that bound his arm against it. It was a metal chain, but the iron sword cut through it without any difficulty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren broke the chains binding his legs, and then the chains binding Licia.</p>
