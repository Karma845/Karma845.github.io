<h2 class="has-text-align-center1">Chapter 29: The Beginning of the Escape</h2>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;1&#8211;</strong></p>
<p class="calibre4">He knew by the sound that the carriage had a key.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren carried Licia up and tightened his grip on the iron magic sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">His body was heavy as he lifted his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, it was fortuitous that he was able to move his body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In fact, he had been in a coma for four days, so it was only natural that he Shouldn’t move at all.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(As I recall, there was something about potions.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s a different concept from my previous life, an item that plays a part in fantasy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the game era, in addition to restoring physical strength, it helps to get rid of abnormalities.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition to this, I may also be affected by my physical ability UP (small). ……</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Whatever it is, it helped.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren cleaves the iron sword horizontally without making a sound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, in a single vertical flash, he cut the carriage lock in two.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the carriage door cracked and Ren removed it while holding it down so as not to make a sound.</p>

<p class="calibre4">(…… It’s all right. He’s not awake.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">He leaned outside and found the beast master sitting in the governor’s seat, but fortunately, he was asleep with his arms crossed without waking up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Relieved, he looked around and found himself in a forest in total darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He had no idea where he was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Ren, who had made up his mind to run away, took a step forward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He was determined to escape and took a step forward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Grrrghh』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was at that moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A voice came from a towering tree nearby.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren looked up in that direction and saw the two maneaters using a thick branch as a bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The maneaters were glaring at him, their eyes glowing crimson as they writhed about in an eerie manner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;-How did you escape?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Beast master woke up and got out of the carriage, approaching Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The maneaters also raised their body and spread their wings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The sword was supposed to be by my side, why is it in your hand?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… It’s my sword, so what does it matter?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, it’s certainly not my sword. But don’t do it. If you stay quiet, you’ll be safe and you’ll see your parents again.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But I don’t know what will happen to the young lady.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Such beautiful loyalty, It dazzles me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The beast master said with a sneer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“This is your last warning. If you don’t return to the wagon yourself, know that it’ll be a painful journey.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He intimidates Ren with his ruthless voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two maneaters are already floating behind him. If the beastmaster doesn’t receive&nbsp; the answers he seeks, the two maneaters will wield their power over him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia’s voice reaches Ren’s ears as he watches for an opening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… alone…… run away…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When did she wake up?</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, if I’m going to run away, we’re going to do it together.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">These words were the signal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The beast master in front of them snapped his fingers and gave the order to the maneaters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two monsters flapped their wings and approached Ren from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of “Geeee!” was the cry that filled the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, clutching his iron sword, took a deep breath and pushed himself forward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Heh! You’re young and naïve! Did you think you could win with a sword when you’re up against a beast master!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I wonder!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Ren steps forward, the maneaters close in on him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first thing it did was to stretch out his neck to bite Licia that Ren was carrying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s heart still rages at the sound of painful breathing coming from his back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the midst of all this, Ren abruptly changed the direction of his body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He went behind the wagon and avoided the maneaters who were closing in behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He swung up his sword without slowing his momentum and smashed the carriage from behind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ahead of him, he saw the face of the beast master behind a gap in the wood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren threw the iron magic sword at his face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The beast master tried to avoid it by twisting his body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The iron sword scratched his neck slightly and the necklace that was decorating his neck danced in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmph…… you’re a fool to throw your weapon&mdash; What!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The iron magic sword disappeared without a trace shortly after passing right next to the beast master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Instead, the wooden magic sword in Ren’s hand caused the earth to rise, and brought out roots of a tree that extended and restrained the beast master’s feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren saw this and jumped from the back of the carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In doing so, he saw the dagger Weiss had given him and retrieved it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He also grabbed the necklace that flew from the beast master’s neck.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The necklace had a broken chain and the pendant was shattered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Don’t try to defeat that guy! Don’t be greedy!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe I can beat him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not easy to say, take a life, but if he could take the life of the beast master, the maneaters could disappear at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But now that his strength was depleted, there was no certainty that he would be able to defeat him, and he couldn’t make up his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re doing great! But that’s enough!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The beast master picked up a white wooden staff.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the tip of the staff, a ball of light in a variety of colors begins to wriggle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……Make it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know what he’s trying to do with the staff, but it’s disturbing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A moment after he takes the staff, Ren summons the thief’s magic sword himself and waves his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha- my staff…..!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The staff disappeared from the astonished beast master’s hand and instead it was in Ren’s hand. Luckily, he was able to take it from the beast master.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">But there was no relief.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One of the maneaters was coming right at Ren, and the remaining one was right in front of the beast master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Graaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren ducked once in mid-air and hit the maneater with the staff he had taken from its master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He also hit the coachman’s seat in rapid succession.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The impact shattered the part holding the horse in place and the cane also shattered due to Ren’s physical strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The horse, startled by this, rushed forward and Ren reached out his hand to force the horse to ride.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Without a staff….that power is …… after him!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hearing the voice of the beast man, the maneaters flapped both wings more strongly than ever.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At this time, Ren, who had never ridden a horse before, was struggling to get on the horse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren had returned the thief’s magic sword and instead used the wooden magic sword he had summoned to create vines to bind himself and Licia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Making sure their bodies were never separated, they rode through the thickly overgrown forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Demon beast master! I know your weakness!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Weakness……?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You know it yourself! That’s why you’re in such a hurry!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The beast master let out an exasperated voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Monsters that dwell in the forest! Listen to my voice!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After the distant echo of the beast master’s voice, the sound of movement could be heard everywhere in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Numerous Monsters passed over Ren’s head and right beside him as he rode his horse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were beasts that reminded him of little boars, or monsters that looked like giant beetles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Gigi gigi! 』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">The high-pitched voices of the maneaters pierced my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, as ten or twenty seconds passed, the Maneaters began to lose momentum, and by the time a few minutes had passed, the distance between them and the Maneaters was almost too great.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The same was true for the monsters nestled in the forest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……Are we safe now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After another dozen minutes of riding, Ren was confident that they were safe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I guess distance is still his weakness.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">This was the true meaning of the words he had told the demon beast master just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Besides summoning the maneater, the user can only command monsters that are weaker than himself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, all of these orders had the aspect of being less effective when they were away from the beast user himself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Here’s the problem.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m happy that I was able to use the knowledge I gained from the legends of the seven heroes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I can’t let my guard down, because I have another major goal waiting: to escape the strange forest and find a human settlement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, just when I thought I had reached the end of my quest, I felt a sudden surge of exhaustion.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll get the medicine for you, ojou-sama, I promise.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I told Licia in my usual tone of voice, she uttered in a faint voice, “I’m …… sorry.”</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;2&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">Weiss’s famous horse looks like an ordinary horse at first glance, but in fact, it is faster and more enduring than other horses because it has the blood of a monster mixed in it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He used this as an advantage to search all around Ren’s village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, he couldn’t find Ren and Licia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So he ordered his knights to join him on the way, while he himself rode to report to Baron Clausel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He returned to Baron Clausel’s mansion on the morning of the fifth day after Ren’s escape from the beast master.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, it was the morning of the ninth day after Ren and Licia were taken away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I will take all the punishment in place of the dead escort knight. But I ask for a reprieve until the young lady is saved.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Returning to Baron Clausel’s residence, he reported to Baron Clausel’s office what had happened in the village ruled by the Ashtons, and the fact that both Licia and Ren had been taken away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why did you leave Licia’s side?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… because of an error in judgment.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s why I’m asking you! Why did the Knight Commander leave Licia’s side?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel was so close to Weiss that he grabbed him by the chest and raised his voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soon, he had a look of surprise.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you hiding something from me?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss’s eyes swam.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s about Licia. She cursed her own failure when she fell ill, didn’t she? To repay her debt to the Ashton family, she asked you to help her defeat the monsters that had increased out of the blue, didn’t she?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss was silent, saying nothing, but his silence was as good as an answer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… sorry about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s still my fault. I have the most ability, I should rather have sent my own men to hunt, and stayed behind as a guard.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It wasn’t a mistake, it is righteous loyalty. How could I punish you in response to Licia’s strong wish?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss, who was overcome with remorse, couldn’t say anything in response to the sorrowful tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel’s hand was clutching his chest, and he walked slowly to the window.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Outside the window, a heavy rain was falling, which seemed to indicate the state of mind of the two men.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We can’t sit still any longer.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel said in a strong tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll contact the Imperial City! Not only the nobles of my faction, but also the Emperor must be informed of what has happened!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he received the report in his office, he was furious and shook his fist.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But there was no proof.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel was convinced that Viscount Givens had committed the crime, as before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But there wasn’t enough evidence to judge him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We must be very careful not to make false reports. It would be a good thing if we could get reinforcements to search for Licia. By the way, Weiss, how are the Ashtons doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“They are being evacuated to a safe village with the villagers, accompanied by knights other than myself.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Good. Then we’ll move quickly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">First of all, we need to contact the capital.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, we also need to contact the nearby neutralist nobles.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Whatever we have to do, we needed reinforcements.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If we make a bad move, the other factions will eat us alive. We must move carefully.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ha!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">We’re going to be busy from now on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel, his mind tightened, was about to pick up his pen, when a moment later.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My Lord!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The usually calm butler came to his office without knocking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A visitor from the Imperial Capital has arrived……! Please hurry to the hall!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel was startled by the butler’s ghastly appearance, but thought it was no time to be surprised to hear that he had a guest from the imperial capital.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Who had come all the way here and for what purpose?</p>
<p class="calibre4">With doubts in his mind, he left his office and walked on the thick crimson carpet to the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He was surprised to see the manner of dressing of the people.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Baron Clausel, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah…… you are …….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were civil servants in gray robes, belonging to the legal affairs bureau.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We are here by order of His Excellency the Minister of Justice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">One of them steps forward and reaches into his pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He unfolds a rolled parchment and presents it to Baron Clausel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In accordance with the great imperial law, Baron Clausel, you will stand before the tribunal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh &mdash;- why me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Baron Clausel, you’re suspected of gross misgovernance. As you’re aware, the nobility entrusted by the Emperor with his lands have several obligations.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss muttered the following to the civil official who spoke without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Viscount Givens, I never thought he’d involve the imperial capital as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Following Weiss’s hateful muttering, Baron Clausel says.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m well aware of that! We nobles have a duty to protect the people of our lands and the wealth of our lands! But which of these have I violated?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In addition to the continued damage to several villages, Baron Clausel’s failure to take prompt action has spread the monster’s damage to the neighboring Viscount Givens’ territory. The Minister of Justice has received a report from Viscount Givens and has decided on this trial.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel had a counterargument.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the very least, it was all beyond the scope of the disturbances that could occur in his domain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But when he tried to open his mouth, the civil servant from the legal department interrupted him, saying, “At the tribunal.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m told that Viscount Givens will arrive the morning after tomorrow, so the first arguments will be made here in Clausel on that day. The day after that, the verdict will be handed down&mdash;-“</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you are dissatisfied with the verdict, the next round of judgments will be held in the Imperial City. If you are still dissatisfied with the verdict, you will go to the Great Temple of the Imperial Capital for a trial before the gods.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s correct.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everything happened too fast.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Things were unfolding at an overwhelming speed, including the attack on Ren’s village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No doubt, this was a trend that had been set in motion for some time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel and Weiss realized this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’ll leave you now.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The civil servant from the legal department bowed his head for the last time, said he would stay at an inn in town, and left the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If I am found guilty by the judges, the Clausel family will lose their titles.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But my lord! All territories suffer damage from monsters! No lord should be held responsible for something as trivial as this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. That’s why Viscount Givens claimed that the damage had spread to his territory.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a fabrication, as we all know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the first place, Baron Clausel dispatched knights to villages whenever possible and did his utmost best to protect his subjects.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was it all pressure from Viscount Givens, or perhaps the heroes? The conflict between the heroes and the royalists must have become even more intense.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Baron Clausel kept his eyes down and began to ponder what the best course of action was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t even know why the two were taken away.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Viscount Given was obsessed with Ren, but if wanted to take a hostage, Licia should have been enough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For example, it should be no problem to threaten the Clausel family and try to bring them into the faction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Considering the heinous acts that had been committed against the village, the possibility that they would kill Licia in the event of an emergency couldn’t be dismissed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it’s difficult to ask whether Ren is worth it as a hostage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He’s no different from any other boy with a bright future ahead of him…….</p>
