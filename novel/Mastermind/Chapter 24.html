<h2 class="has-text-align-center1">Chapter 24 &#8211; A Second Invitation</h2>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;1&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">　Soon, the eighth winter since Ren’s birth was over.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Compared to previous years, Ren’s village did not have to worry about food or firewood consumption, and all the villagers were able to have an adequate winter shelter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　&mdash;- Then spring came, and Ren celebrated his eighth birthday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　On that day, Len was celebrated by everyone in the morning at the mansion where he was born and raised. ……</p>
<p class="calibre4">　At the same time, far away in Clausel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The lord, Baron Clausel, was marveling in his office in his mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way! Such a great nobleman would ……”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Baron Clausel looked at the letter that had just arrived and exclaimed in amazement.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The knight who carried the letter also looked incredulous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You are sure of this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course, sir. The parts of …… Thief Wolfen are the raw material of a precious medicine, so perhaps the sender wants that medicine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah, aah,…… as I recall, there hasn’t been a market for thief wolfen in recent times.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do we do, sir?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We can’t ignore it. Contact them as soon as &mdash;- No wait, this could be an opportunity…..”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Baron Clausel suddenly had an idea.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　He went to his desk to tell the sender of the letter about his idea.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　As soon as he picked up his pen, he heard the words,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Father.”　</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Baron Clausel’s hand stops as Licia visits his office.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　When he invites Licia in, she says, “I have come to greet you on my departure.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Licia. You know that&mdash;-“</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I know, this is part of my work. I will continue to patrol the territory and serve the Clausel family as I have in the past.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do that. Your presence with Ren Ashton is only a reward for fulfilling your duties as a member of the Clausel family. Keep this in mind. And of course, do not forget to thank Ren Ashton.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. In honour of my late mother 、、、、、.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……, yes. If you work hard like that, I’m sure your thoughts will reach her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　After this exchange, Licia leaves the office with a dignified curtesy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　She left the mansion and stepped under Weiss, who had come ahead of her and was waiting for her at the gate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Have you finished greeting the Master?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Done. &mdash;- Now, I must do my best this time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’ve grown even more over the winter my lady. I’m sure you’ll be able to show off your swordsmanship against the boy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ara, you didn’t say I would win, did you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia giggled and Weiss was at a loss for a reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Weiss had thoroughly trained Licia over the past winter. Of course, since she has fulfilled her duties as a baroness in addition to her studies, she has grown not only with the sword but also as a person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But even so, he could not say, “you will win”</p>
<p class="calibre4">(The boy must have grown up a lot too.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren is a strong, hard-working boy, both physically and mentally.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Even though it’s only against G-rated little boars, he still lives in an environment that can kill him if he’s not careful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Unlike Licia, his days are filled with tension.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The tension and the high level of education that Licia receives on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Both are rare experiences definitely, but as for the current gap in ability, it may still be the result of Ren’s background and hard work …….　</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Excuse me, young lady……”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m kidding. Don’t worry about it. We’re going to see what will happen when we meet, and it would be boring if we knew the result now”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia, who said this in a dignified rather than discouraging manner, crossed Weiss.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　She then approached the female knight who was riding with her and quickly mounted her horse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let’s go. It’s a long &mdash;- way to that village.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">……Suddenly, something unusual happened to Licia’s vision.</p>


<p class="calibre4">My vision was shaky and my physical senses were dulled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　For a brief moment, I felt as if my entire body had been drained of strength, and even whether the air outside was hot or cold was ambiguous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But these sensations disappeared easily.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Miss. Is something wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The female knight’s voice came from behind Licia.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　She still felt a little uncomfortable, but after a short pause, she responded.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;“It’s nothing, ……. I think I was just a little nervous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry. We have been watching your efforts day in and day out. I’m sure you’ll do well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……thank you.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　When I replied, my vision was still shaking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　However, it had calmed down by the time Weiss gave the signal to depart a few dozen seconds later.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Therefore, Licia assumed it was her imagination and turned her attention to the journey to the village where Ren lived.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　　◇　◇　◇　◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The day after Licia left the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Roy had finally returned to hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(After all, the medicine in this world is different from the previous one.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I could tell by the way Roy is smiling as before as he walks next to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　He had no doubt suffered from a deep internal wound, but he was back in fighting shape in less than a year, which was a source of great amazement to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　He had no surgery of any kind, especially since he had been relying on medicinal herbs and the like.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　In the evening, walking shoulder to shoulder along the farm road on the way back from the forest, Ren could not stop thinking about this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hm?　What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m just thinking that you’re really feeling better already.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course I am! I’ve had so many rondo herbs and remedies used on me, if not would have rather taken longer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">　”But still,” Roy says with a sigh.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　From his rather thoughtful tone, Ren guessed what the topic was going to be.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s obviously something wrong with the forest these days. There are too many more little boars than there used to be. 、、、、”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“‘I’ve been thinking that too since the winter. The other day, the knights said they felt uncomfortable as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Of course they would……In fact, little boars are in breeding season from spring to summer. So, unlike usual, they’re all excited and often appear in public, but even so, there are just too many of them.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We can hunt a lot more, so our income is higher, but I can’t say I’m happy about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Roy nodded at Ren’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We’ll just have to continue hunting while carefully watching the situation.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Roy’s refreshing profile is smitten with a grin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren nodded his head in agreement with Roy’s words, and looked up at the sky, which was tinted in red.</p>
<p class="calibre4">（The setting of the sun is getting later and later.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;It’s a sign that winter has turned into spring and summer is approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And to the ears of Ren who was enjoying the changing season、</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;-!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;-.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　From a distance, he heard men arguing with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　When he looked next to him, he saw Roy nodding in recognition as well, and the two of them threw the little boars they were carrying onto the field path and ran off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The direction from which the voices came was the Ashtons’ mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　They reached it in less than a few minutes, and there, in addition to the knights of the Clausel family, were the knights they had seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Needless to say ……, they were knights in the service of Viscount Givens.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;2&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">‘What’s all the racket!　What’s the matter?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, sir! In fact, these people have been waiting for you!　They have a letter for…! Huh, hey!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Then a knight of Viscount Givens leaned forward and interrupted him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The knight was the same knight who had previously asked Ren, whom he had met in the forest, to show him the way to the mansion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Roy accepted the letter as a courtesy and looked at it, wondering what to do with it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll check inside the mansion,” he said. “But what business brings you to this village?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘”An invitation to the Ashtons, of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Again, Ren let out a sigh as he hid his face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Again, Roy mends his smile to keep it from becoming bitter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The Viscount still thinks highly of your abilities, And the same goes for your son.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ren?　Oh, we’ve talked about this before, haven’t we?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Y”es. That’s why I’ve come to you with a new story.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… new story?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">（I have a bad feeling about this.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　In such a case, the new story is basically not a good story for the person in question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Even though it may seem like an exceptional response from the outside, if it’s something the person doesn’t want, it can sometimes only be a nuisance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren muttered to himself in his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Viscount has offered to help Ren Ashton enroll in the prestigious Imperial Academy of Military Science’s 、、、、、、、、、、 special class 、、、、、.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren’s hunch was right on target, and it hit him hard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">( Gi…… give me a break ……)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Unlike Ren, who was disgusted, Roy was surprised with a wide mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Naturally, the knights of the Clausel family were surprised, too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Representing their surprise, Roy asked Viscount Given’s knight as if he were stuttering.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What &mdash;-?　Even general admission is extremely difficult, there’s no way that our Ren could get into the special class. ……”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The Imperial Cadet Academy’s special class is certainly exceptional. In addition to the heirs of the seven great barons and generals, only a handful of talents who have been trained in the imperial capital from an early age are allowed to enter.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren was annoyed by the knight’s confident and enthusiastic tone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The Imperial Military Academy is the main setting in the legend of the Seven Heroes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Furthermore, the special class is also the class to which the</p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;protagonists will belong.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　In other words, it’s no exaggeration to say that if you enroll in the school, it will be close to the same future as in the game.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Now that he could not avoid meeting Licia, he had to avoid entering the Imperial Cadet Academy at all costs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“However, the Viscount had served as assistant to the Minister of Justice at the Imperial Castle. He said he could send a letter of recommendation to the academy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Perhaps he was going to talk to one of the heroic aristocrats among them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren, who could easily imagine this, was not at all pleased, and on the contrary, he was beginning to get fed up internally.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not &mdash;- impossible, but it must be difficult to recommend our Ren.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, that may be true, but the Viscount sees potential in Ren Ashton.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Potential ……?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Roy’s reaction was probably what he expected.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The knight of the Viscount Givens said happily,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A nobleman who is friends with the Viscount has told him that the Ashtons may have some of the blood of Lauren the Hero running through them, even if it is thin. ……”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is &mdash;- is that true!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It would be foolish to dismiss it out of hand. Considering he is a legitimate son born at about the same time as the children of the seven great barons we can’t not find hope in a boy who has done such a rare feat.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be!　We’ve been in this village for a long time. ……”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But no one knows the truth. It may be that the Ashtons were born from a further branch of a side line long ago. But rest assured. Even if he is not, Len Ashton is still a brave boy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Ren thought as he listened to the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　After all, Viscount Givens wants to use him as a flower to add to the factional warfare.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I don’t know if he really thinks that the Ashton family has the blood of a hero in it. That’s exactly what the knight of Viscount Givens said, but it could be different.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(If I’m even more active, they’ll lift me up, and if I do something bad, they’ll say I lied about being a hero…)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I can only assume that I will be treated as a convenient frame. That’s why even Roy is hesitating.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But what matters here is the momentum of the heroic faction, not the truth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(……What should we do? Should I tell them about the village where the hero is?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">　And what if I tell them?</p>
<p class="calibre4">　If I’m asked if they would believe me,…… I honestly thought that if I were in their shoes, I wouldn’t believe me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　A boy who has never been out of his village would say, “There is a descendant of a brave man in that village!”　</p>
<p class="calibre4">　I’m sure they wouldn’t even look into it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　On the contrary, they would doubt his sanity. That is a normal reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, what’s your response?　Let’s skip the details at this point. If you graduate from that institute, it is as good as guaranteed that you will receive an important position at the same time, right?　The Ashtons should only have to consider this fact.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes…… I know that,…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That would make things a lot easier. It’s not a bad deal for you as his father.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But Roy kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Seeing this, Viscount Givens’ knight turned his attention to Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Boy, wouldn’t you like to develop your talents in the imperial capital?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But when asked this, the reply was obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;- No.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I knew you would say so. If so, then by all means come to the Viscount.　Wait, what did you say?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The knight of Viscount Givens was surprised with his his eyes widened as he asked&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have no intention of leaving this village.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wha, Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I am sorry. I feel content to spend my days hunting in the forest and protecting the village…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t you want to be a nobleman?　You could be a baronet upon graduation!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry to repeat this, but it is too much for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, the knight of Viscount Givens faltered. He looked as if he had been on the offensive so far, but he was speechless now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But then he looked at Roy and said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…….What do you think of?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　If Roy nodded his head, it would be fine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　But Roy, like Ren, answers in a simple voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I am sorry. I am honored that Viscount Givens has contacted us twice like this, but I would like to decline once again. I’m proud to have served the Clausel family for generations. Besides, I myself have no intention of leaving the village.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You don’t want your son to be a nobleman!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d like to do that, I also want him to go to the Imperial capital to learn what I can’t teach him in this village if possible. But the most important thing is Ren’s own will.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The boy is clever. He may be reserved!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, that’s not it.I’m sure Ren is a caring child, but he won’t say anything he doesn’t think.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　The knight of Viscount Givens was almost enraged that his invitation had been rejected so outrightly. His face was slightly reddish and his fists were shaking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　However, he did not say anything more unreasonable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　He was acting disgruntled, but still maintained a shred of civility.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…..I’m sorry, Lord Ashton.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　With that, he bowed his head to Roy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　He then quickly went to the other knights waiting nearby and mounted his horse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘”Oh, hey!&nbsp; Please hold on while I write back!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No matter. I’ll let the Viscount know your reply directly&mdash;-.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Then they drove off without waiting for Roy’s reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Roy scratched his head and muttered,&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh,…… I wanted to write a letter myself so I wouldn’t be rude. It would be troublesome if they made up something I didn’t tell them, without my knowledge.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘Isn’t it all right?　I’m sure it won’t make much difference when we’ve refused two invitations .”</p>
<p class="calibre4">　Roy heard Ren’s words and nodded with a shrug, “I guess so.”</p>
