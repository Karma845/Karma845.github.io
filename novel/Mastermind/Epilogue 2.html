<h3>Epilogue 2: A Boy Named Rey Ashton</h3>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;1&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">A week and a few days passed, before Roy and Mireille came to Clausel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When they saw Ren again, they hugged him tightly and for a while shed tears of joy at their reunion.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They stayed at Lessard’s residence for a few days.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thanks to this, Ren was able to hear about the situation in the village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">First, as he had heard from Lessard, there were no casualties among the villagers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, he couldn’t be honestly happy because of the number of knights who had been killed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition, several houses were destroyed by Little Boars and other monsters, and many villagers, like the Ashtons, lost their homes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, thanks to the full cooperation of the Clausel family, reconstruction went smoothly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Roy and Mireille also seem to be devoting their days to the reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why they both also mentioned that they must return to the village soon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would be a problem if there was no one to lead the village in the midst of reconstruction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren knew this, but he still felt lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;- In the meantime, I brought some of the stuff that was left unburned, so if anything is missing, send me a letter.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The day they were leaving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, Ren still couldn’t stand up well, so he saw them off from his bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you. But did you bring any luggage?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Various things. I’ve brought the things that were left unburned in your room and other things that were safe. I also bought a few changes of clothes and stuff. I put it all in a wooden box over there, so you can take a look at it when you get better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The wooden box, Roy said, was in a corner of the room Ren was resting in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I also got a blank book from Grandma Rigg.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A blank book?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You want to see it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Since it’s here, I might as well see it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I nodded my head in agreement, even though there was no point in looking at a blank book.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, Roy opened the wooden box and brought out a book. It had a leather cover all in jet black, and inside was a blank book, just as he had said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He places it on the desk next to the bed where Ren lay.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s a leftover from the book that Grandma Rigg used to write down the recipes for her medicine and she was wondering if you’d like to use it as a diary.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Heh….. might be a good idea. I’ve got a lot of free time on my hands, so it’s perfect.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, I’m thinking that an autobiography might be a good idea, too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren was puzzled when he heard the word “autobiography”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In this world, autobiographies of the seven heroes seem to be very popular, and that thought flashed through Ren’s mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I haven’t lived a life that would allow me to write an autobiography.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hahaha! From my point of view, you’re a great hero, too!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia, Lessard and Weiss also praise Ren a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m embarrassed.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m proud of you. You are the pride of Mireille and I.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two of them patted Ren’s head many times.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But the family time would soon come to an end.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Today is the day they return to the village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If they didn’t leave before nightfall, their plans would be disrupted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“ &mdash;- Mireille.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry to leave you, but I have to go.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Their faces showed a slight sadness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“….. Dad, mom. Thank you so much for coming, even though it was hard.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s face was also sad, but they both smiled brightly when they heard his words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t be silly. It’s for our son’s sake, of course.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Your dad is right. And since the baron provided horses and escorts for the trip here and back, we had no trouble at all getting here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll be back as soon as my body heals!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two laughed once more when Ren told them that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s all well and good, but now that you’re here, you might as well explore Clausel and spread the word of your findings.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">They hugged him one last time and left the mansion with a few tears in their eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I’m so glad you two are okay.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren forced himself to stand up and looked out the window until the horse carrying them was out of sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, he lay down on his bed, overcome by the pain and exhaustion that rushed in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He remained in the same position, looking sideways at the desk and at the black-covered book.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“….. autobiography, huh.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he uttered those words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“May I come in?』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was a knock at the door, followed by Licia’s voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He answered and she immediately stepped in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did you have a good conversation with your parents?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I did. Thank you so much for your help on this occasion. I heard that you even provided horses and an escort for my parents.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry about it. My dad and I owe you a debt of gratitude that we can’t repay.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia said so, but she also apologized and thanked Ren’s parents.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Naturally, they panicked and stopped her, but Licia still kept her head down, which bothered them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I guess she couldn’t help it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thanks to Ren, the entire Clausel family had been saved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“And how are you feeling today?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think I’m feeling much better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m glad you’re feeling better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then they were both silent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia sat on the bed where Ren was resting, her back to him and her hair swaying in the wind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(That magic sword……)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I have often thought about this since I heard that Licia has a magic stone in her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That magic sword was powerful. Too powerful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That may be why Ren Ashton in the game, who somehow learned of its existence, killed Licia and absorbed the magic stone in order to obtain that magic sword.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There were other uncontrollable circumstances.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first time I saw the game, I was in the middle of a conversation with a friend of mine who was a fan of the game.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a scene from the game The Legend of the Seven Heroes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Re&mdash; Ren! What have you done?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…………”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The scene is one in which the protagonist is stunned as he looks out over the podium of the Imperial Academy of Military Arts’ grand auditorium.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ahead of him, to which the protagonist rushes, Ren Ashton stands holding the body of Licia Clausel, who is bleeding from the chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The scene reveals her death through her general weakness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s just as you’ve seen. I killed her.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren Ashton’s cold voice reaches the protagonist’s ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He couldn’t see the expression on his face because of the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Didn’t he disappear somewhere with the body soon after that?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Ren was secretly thinking about this, Licia suddenly found the black book on the desk.</p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;2&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s with this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A medicine woman from the village gave it to me as a gift of sympathy. The inside is blank, so my dad thought it would make a good autobiography.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think an autobiography is good too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia turns to Ren and smiles daintily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, what about the title?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh, do I need that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Obviously, otherwise it’s just like a diary.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Do you have any good idea? I’m not a very good writer, so I’m very confused.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Kuh, You have to come up with these things on your own!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She has a point.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But whether or not I can come up with an idea is another matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then I think I’ll make it a diary, not an autobiography.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Right. But there are people who give titles to their diaries, so why not give yours a title, too?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I have certainly heard such talk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the way, this situation seems as if it has been confirmed that he will title his diary.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing Licia enjoying herself next to him, Ren stopped being stubborn.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Let’s call it half diary, half autobiography for now.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">That made me feel less embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, the title of the book would be…….</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Title ……title …….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should put your name in it often.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m too embarrassed to do that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then it must be something to do with the way you live your life. I once read a book called “My path to Become a Sword King”, Dedicated to the sacred sword technique.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A way of life?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Aside from that, Ren’s goal was to live peacefully in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, life doesn’t work out that way, Ren has learned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;-That’s it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">This was a spur of the moment thought.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia looked at him and he exchanged glances with her and laughed at how he had come up with such a strange title.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia noticed that Ren had decided on the title.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Did you decide?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I did. It’s a strange title, even for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">……It has already been eight years since Ren was born into this world.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nowadays, Ren can confidently say that he’s Ren Ashton, an individual who is different from the legend of the Seven Heroes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Naturally, Licia, who is by his side, is equally a different individual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(And…)</p>
<p class="calibre4">One more thing. With the determination that I have learned at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Should it be called the fate of this world ? I don’t like to call it a scenario, so let’s call it fate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That has already changed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By Ren Ashton, an irregular presence in this place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(That’s why)</p>
<p class="calibre4">The encounter with Jerukku, a development not in the story, and the fact that the daughter Marquis Ignat survives are equally irregular.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, the last boss of Legend of the Seven Heroes I is as good as gone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even Jerukku, the boss who fights in the middle of I, is dead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This means that things have already changed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The word “mastermind” floated through Ren’s mind as he thought about all of this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I’ve changed so many fates, for better or worse, I may have to face something new again.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t know when that will be, but it felt like it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why the determination that Ren held is relevant here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Even if there’s the same mastermind, I can be the mastermind to protect myself and those around me. As a new individual, to counter the legitimate historical narrative.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, we must not forget that the legend of the Seven Heroes is a commandment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Respect this world and commandeer it at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Furthermore, this was the only title I could think of that could encompass my idea of how I should be in the same sentence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(&mdash;- “Reincarnated as the mastermind behind the story,” or something like that.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Ren didn’t want to utter the words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was enough if only he knew what the title meant.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">So he decided to misrepresent it to Licia and said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I’ll think about it more after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren said with a light smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia looked at him and was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s that?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lit by the late afternoon sun, she smiled in her elegant profile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And the warm breeze that came unexpectedly stroked Ren’s bangs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two of them, who had overcome one difficulty, looked somewhat more mature than before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">*******************************************************</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;- One day, in the dean’s office of the prestigious Imperial Academy of Military Science.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the window where the gentle spring breeze was attracted, a single woman stood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The outstanding appearance, which even looks somewhat fantastic, is slightly more mature than the students walking around outside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">White porcelain skin. A doll-like face. Her body is covered by a white shirt, and her sex appeal is not obnoxious, but she has not forgotten her neatness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her golden hair is flowing in the spring breeze, and she hums a tune in a good mood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Excuse me, Dean.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, there was a knock at the door and a woman stepped in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman at the window turned her purple crystal amethyst eyes on her and she gasped at her beauty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“There’s one problem with the schedule.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, what’s that? I think I’ve been doing a pretty good job lately.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The blonde woman, the dean, as she was called, left the window.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She approached the woman who visited the room and accepted the papers she was holding in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Wow, is this really true?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I’m sure.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…&nbsp; then I guess I’ll have to prepare an alternative location.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What should I do?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dean was lost.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even the way she folds her arms and raises her pitiful voice is picturesque.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, after a few minutes, she spoke.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I think I’ve come up with a great place.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She then approaches a wall of bookshelves.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She quickly pulls out a book, and a nearby book crumbles to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Pardon me! Please Help me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her visitor lets out a light sigh, but still doesn’t refuse her request and puts the book back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, what were you looking for?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“A map! Look, don’t you think this might be just the place for an alternate location?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The Baldor Mountain? The strength of the monsters there is about E-rank, so it’s not a problem, but there’s a past history of monsters being activated there due to the flow of magical power that lies underground.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to explore the area too!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman nodded at these words&mdash;- then.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Also, the book that fell to the floor was the last one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she finished putting it back on the bookshelf, the woman coughed and said.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I will consult with the board of directors and the nobles.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Thank you!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The dean, who remained alone, went to her desk.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She would need a document with her signature on it anyway.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had no choice but to grab a pen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Uh… is this okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She glides the pen nimbly and signs the end of the line.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;- Chronois Highland.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her race is a mixture of human and elf blood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The world’s best magician, and the dean here at the Imperial Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the game “Legend of the Seven Heroes II,” she is one who, like Saint Licia, was killed by Ren Ashton.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Chronois looked up at the azure sky outside the window and muttered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……I wish there was someone somewhere in this world who could make my boredom go away.”</p>
