<h2 class="has-text-align-center1">Chapter 18 &#8211; It Was a Night that Seemed to Have Come to an End, But Hadn’t At All</h2>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;1&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">After that, Ren left the room to do some work that Mireille had asked him to do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A little while later, we all had dinner together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Originally, Lithia should have eaten and we should have done so afterwards. But Lithia, instead of caring, let everyone sit in the same room and sometimes turned her hunter-like gaze on Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(If I’m not careful, I’m going to get kidnapped.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren finished his meal ahead of the others and left the dining table, saying something plausible like, “I’m going to check on the horses”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I’ve never taken care of a horse before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I gave it some hay and it ate happily, which made me feel happy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What to do?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren muttered, looking up at the night sky as he left the replacement shed, since there was no stable&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was once again thinking of Lithia’s underwear that I had stolen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, there’s nothing I can do about it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fact is, it’s practically impossible to return it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Earlier, I was so caught up in ethics that I couldn’t respond calmly, but now I had no choice but to get rid of it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">…… No choice. Let’s go burn it now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I deeply regret that I used the thief’s magic sword so thoughtlessly and I’ve made up my mind that I’ll never do such a thing again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I hope she’ll forgive me just this once.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was making this decision, Lithia’s voice suddenly reached my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“So, you were here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia was waiting outside the hut.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren realizes that she’s in a white dress and that made his cheeks flush.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&nbsp;“Is this the so called after-meal exercise?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“As expected. Since you know, it’ll make things faster.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Won’t it be hard if you sweat by this time of the night?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t mind. I have to take a bath even before going to bed to get a good night’s sleep.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia with a carefree smile on her face was fantastic in the moonlight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, when she threw her sword at me as she did in the day time, I wanted to avert my gaze from that dainty smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think it would be better not to do it because Weiss-sama will get mad!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Too bad. I’ve already asked Weiss for permission, so it’s not a problem. And your parents as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Eh&mdash;-?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">That knight commander, he was talked into it!</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia has a way with words. She also convinced her father, Baron Clausel, that she was a talented woman and he let her come all the way to such a remote village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As for my parents, there was nothing they could do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When you’re asked to do something by the daughter of a Baron, you have no choice but to accept.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I must have made the wrong choice too…… I shouldn’t have gone outside…..)</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Ren was brilliant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Hey, why don’t I just not take the sword?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">That way, the fight would never take place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was relieved when I thought that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you don’t take the sword, you’ll stay longer than planned.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘I won’t forgive you’ she meant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the answer was obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Actually&mdash;-I was in the mood for some exercise.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mysteriously, I’m a little annoyed ……Why are you rejecting me so much?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I would never say that.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia shook her eyebrows when she saw Ren, who answered with a dry smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But when she saw Ren holding the sword in his hand, she seemed to have lowered her spirits a little.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay? If I win, you’ll tell me why. Also, you’ll go to clausel with me, so be prepared.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“By the way, what happens if I win?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Asked back, Lithia narrows her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then &mdash;- I’ll come back to this village!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The light vanishes from Ren’s eyes as he realizes that he’ll lose no matter which way it goes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In my surprise, my one-handed grip on the sword became weak.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia, on the other hand, was still roused and pressed on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first time I saw her, I thought she’d made a perfect move, but now the sword she swung down was easily blocked.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How could you defend against it! It wasn’t so weak!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, even if you put it that way.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first time, even if it was only one time there was a rivalry, the second time, which is now, he’s even more efficient than the first time in parrying her attacks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(It doesn’t matter if she can’t beat me!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m well aware that she is a person of rare ambition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only obstacle for me is that she is a genuine competitive person.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But given my ability, if I lose on purpose, I’ll surely be found out. And it’s inevitable that she will be offended.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If that happened, I’ll probably be kidnapped this time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why do you want to beat me so badly?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I told you, I hate to lose! And as the “white saint,” I don’t want to lose to a boy my own age!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two crossed swords many times and continued their conversation in the midst of it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t understand what being the “White Saint” has to do with this!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My “White Saint” is a skill that is blessed with aptitude for swords and physical abilities! I can also use sacred magic, but to lose to you is very, very frustrating!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">In other words, it’s a skill that combines swordsmanship, physical ability, and sacred magic into one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Sacred magic is especially powerful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It combines the strength of white magic, which has the power to heal wounds, with the strength of holy magic, which has the power to counteract the undead, curse, and detoxify. Other abilities unique to sacred magic, as well as the ability to use buffs on oneself and one’s party members, tended to make the event battles in which Lithia participated much less difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll be serious from here on! I’m going to beat you for sure!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia’s movement changed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was enveloped in a dazzling light for a moment, then her speed increased even more. The sword that was crossed with mine gave the impression of a different person’s physical strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(is it Sacred magic……!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s the blessing of the main god Elfen, and since it’s different from physical ability UP, the effects overlap.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Probably, Lithia’s physical ability UP is (small) like Ren’s. This is because she’s still young, and as she grows up, it should change to (medium) and then (large).</p>
<p class="calibre4">(She’s indeed very strong when she gets like this.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren’s complexion changed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You should have used it a while ago!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I know! But if I use it without Weiss’s permission, he‘ll get angry!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Which means &mdash;-)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Conversely, she got his permission.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(She has a sweet tongue for a young lady!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m a little miffed at the fact that the discussion was being made without my knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren furrowed his brow and said, “If that’s the case.” He put some strength into the hand that held the sword. Lithia was surprised to find he was becoming slightly more dominant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And &mdash;-</p>
<p class="calibre4">“………… Impossible.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The final fight ended a moment later.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia found herself facing Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before she could even get her sword into a defensive stance, Ren’s sword was pressed against her neck.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I win.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">He said, staring at Lithia, so close that she could almost feel his breath and count each of his eyelashes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……….. I haven’t lost yet.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Is she nervous or embarrassed?</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Well, I hate to lose as well……)</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the end, I put down my sword and moved away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This time, she didn’t seem to be able to pursue further and she was still surprised at the fact that she had been driven to defeat by the moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then the sound of applause echoed through the room.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;2&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’ve improved, boy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss stepped forward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Behind him, several of his subordinate knights were in tow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The young man was able to defeat the young lady who was using sacred magic.“</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… It’s nothing like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh… You seem dissatisfied.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I will not say that’s not the case.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it was natural for me to be dissatisfied when I found out that they had been given permission to be present without my knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“We were surprised, too!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have worked in the imperial capital for some time, and I have never seen a boy as strong as Ren-dono!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mm! He‘ll become a symbol of the Clausel family and other factions in the future!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After the knights’ astonishment and praise.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I have told you, Ren-dono is truly strong.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The knight stationed in the village recently said happily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss repeated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, boy. As these men have said, you’re strong. I wanted the young lady to understand that strength better.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After all, the Ashtons are a family that serves the Clausel family.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When told that it was for that young lady, Ren had nothing to reply with.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Now, my lady, you understand the strength of this boy to the core of your bones.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…………”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re very strong my lady. But the boy became stronger under less favorable circumstances compared to you. With more effort, the young miss may be able to catch up to him.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Not that she will catch up with him, but she will easily overtake him.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you understand, you should work harder than ever after you return to the residence.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes….. I know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia looks at Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry to have come on such short notice, but it’s been a great experience.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah….. it’s been a great experience for me too.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Come to &mdash;- Clausel and we’ll do it every day, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Unfortunately, that’s a different story.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia’s cheeks crinkled as she looked at Ren, who still didn’t relent. Then she turned her back on him and went back to the house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As she had said before the duel, she’ll now take a hot bath and rest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m really sorry. Please forgive me. I’ll certainly let the master know that the Ashton family has taken good care of us.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t do anything much.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm… is that so?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss shook his head and spoke to his men.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think it was a good stimulus for the young lady.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, it seemed boring to train against us.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Boy, it’s just as these men said. &mdash;-I would have stayed a few more days if I could and I would have liked you to stay with the young lady……”</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I’d like to refrain from doing so.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But we have to leave tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The departure was earlier than he had imagined.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren was surprised and pleased at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re busy, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um. Though the young lady convinced the master to allow her to come to this village. She has other work to do apart from talking to the Ashtons about the reward. She has to go around the surrounding villages and suppress the unrest caused by the recent disturbances.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the duty of the Lord’s family.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Lithia had a purpose to meet with Ren, but in return, she offered Baron Clausel a rewarding job in exchange.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Really, she’s a good, honest girl with admirable roots.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">It had been a day of unexpected defeat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Let me thank you again tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Weiss bowed in a butler-like manner and left Ren’s place with his men&mdash;- but returned with Lithia, who should have left earlier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, can I come to your room with Weiss later?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren asked, surprised at the abruptness of the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’d like to ask you what kind of training you usually do. Weiss-san is also curious, so I was wondering if you would stay up late with me for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren said, “Sure,” without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I have that stuff in my room, but I just have to take care of it before she gets there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Having already made up his mind about it, Ren answered without hesitation and went back inside the mansion with a relaxed attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On his way back to his room, he parted from Lithia and Weiss, and after they were out of sight, he rushed into his room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren takes the wooden box in his hand, opens the lid and looks at the fireplace, which is still lit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without hesitation and without letting his guard down, he moved to burn the contents of the crate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ren, you’re back, right? I’m coming in.』\</p>
<p class="calibre4">Shortly thereafter, Roy’s voice reaches me from outside the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Roy was still unable to move from his bed, but with the help of a third party, he was able to move around the mansion in a simple wheelchair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that’s how he has moved this time as well and the unexpected voice took Ren’s breath away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But the determination in Ren’s heart was unwavering.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He could no longer linger.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Instantly determined, Ren swung his arms wide &mdash;-</p>
<p class="calibre4">(This whole crate ……!)</p>
<p class="calibre4">He threw the wooden box into the fireplace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The box was thrown vigorously into the flames with a dry crackling sound of wood splitting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The crate was instantly engulfed in flames and buried in wood chips and ashes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren saw this and was convinced of victory. When he responded to Roy a few seconds later, he had a winning smile on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I heard you’re going to talk to Weiss-sama and the others! They called me too, so Mireille brought me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Soon after, Ren replied and greeted Roy, who had been pushed in his wheelchair by Mireille.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mireille tells Ren.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll get you a warm drink, can you help me a bit?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Okay, I will. Then, let’s have your father welcome Weiss-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh! Leave it to me!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren left his room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He went to the kitchen and together with Mireille, prepared tea for a simple evening’s chat, and also prepared a small amount of food for the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After Ren and Mireille had taken the tea and food to the room, Mireille suddenly looked apologetic and said.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, I forgot the knife.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I’ll go get it!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren stumbled back to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Meanwhile, Mireille remained in Ren’s room, but she suddenly turned on her nose.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she walks toward the fireplace and fishes out the fireplace with a pair of fire scissors in her hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she pulled out the wooden box that Ren must have thrown away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh dear…… He must have been playing with it and put it in the fireplace.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The box, which had been wrapped in the fire, was mysteriously covered in a reddish-brown dripping liquid.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It touched the outside air and enveloped the entire box as if it had been hardened with wax.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hey, I don’t think Ren would play with a box like that, will he?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I wonder. You used to throw little boar bones from your desk when you were little.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If you ask me, it’s similar. It’s fun when you can throw them where you want, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. But not this box.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I heard that the fumes from the paint they use when it burns aren’t good for health. I’m told it makes it less flammable instead.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mireille nodded back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She approached the door holding the wooden box at the end of a pair of fire scissors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll take it to the warehouse.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll scold Ren, or at any rate, I’ll fix it when I can move. In the meantime you can put it in the back of the warehouse.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, we can’t show them that we have this kind of paint.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">So Mireille took the box that Ren thought had been burnt to the warehouse.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren didn’t pass Mireille in the hallway, and when he returns to his room, he is puzzled to find that Roy is the only one there.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he asked Roy why, he was told only, “She had to run some errands,” and he didn’t feel like mentioning anything in particular.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(I know it’s early, but has it burned down yet?)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren looked toward the fireplace and was relieved that he couldn’t see the wooden box.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would surely be a while before he would learn that …… it had not burned.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;- A few minutes later, Weiss entered and Lithia followed a little later.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pleasantries that began after these two stepped in kept Ren from thinking about the wooden box any longer.</p>
