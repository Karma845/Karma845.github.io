<p class="calibre4">Soon night fell and Ren started to prepare the encampment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He told Licia, who had offered to help, to rest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She looked at him with a frustrated look on her face as he prepared the encampment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re used to this kind of work?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I got used to it in the last few days. I’ve been learning the basics from Weiss-sama.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Weiss? You mean during winter?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes. Thanks to my experience that night, I learned how to handle monsters, how to make fire, and many other things about camping.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a sudden proposal by Weiss that day, but now I was really happy about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I would be even if it were just me, but especially now that I have Licia with me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(This is the guy today.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren will now deal with the monster.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The target is an F-ranked White Hawk, one rank higher than Little Boar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, it’s not much of an enemy for Ren. He was able to hunt it without any particular difficulty.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How did you do it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I tied it to a tree with ivy, and then all I had to do was cut it down.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The power of that mysterious sword.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. By the way, its true name is a secret.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……stingy”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To be honest, I wonder if it makes sense to hide it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even when I helped Licia down, I used the wooden magic sword, and it’s almost as if I had shown it to her……</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hiding only the name of the skill may be due to a bit of rebelliousness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(Absorb the magic stone while I’m at it.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">While Licia turned away in frustration, I found the magic stone and brought it close to the bracelet to absorb its power.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Secretly looking at the crystal, you can see it has grown compared to before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren Ashton.</p>

<p class="calibre4">&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a matter of fact, the level of the two magic swords could have been increased in terms of the number of magic stones.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, because Roy’s injury had taught him the importance of being prepared for emergencies, Ren didn’t use all of the Little Boar magic stones for himself, but kept about half of them for sale.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even a small amount would be better than nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, at the moment, this is all he has.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What’s this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia raised her voice in question while Ren was distracted by the bracelet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren turned his head toward her as she found a necklace in their luggage and raised his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s something I took from the demon beast master. The chain broke in the attack and flew off, but I thought I could sell it for some street money, so I kept it.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">To the naked eye, the silver chain and red jewelry were an eye-catching item.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia picked it up and muttered in a small voice, “A magic tool”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He said he was trying to keep the outside world from hearing our voices, so maybe it’s that kind of magic tool.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren continues.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s already broken, so I don’t think he’ll be able to follow our trail.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re right. You certainly don’t need to worry about that…… but don’t sell it. If push comes to shove, it might prove something, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Indeed, that is true.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren replied shortly, “That’s right”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">**********************************************</p>
<p class="calibre4">The next morning, Ren got on his horse as dawn broke.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia woke up a little later. She seemed to be in a deep sleep, perhaps because she was still out of shape.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By noon, they passed through the forest and found a village on the plain.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a small village with a dozen or so houses scattered about.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(We should stop by just in case.)&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">We still had plenty of food and water to spare, but there might be medicine, which was our original goal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although Licia was recovering, it was better to have it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ojou-sama, let’s stop by for a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Alright.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hearing her reply, Ren rode his horse toward the village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When he arrived at the village a few minutes later, a villager approached him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re a little adventurer. How unusual.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren and Licia were greeted by a middle-aged woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What brings you to our village? Is there something you want?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, actually, I want some medicine.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">After negotiations, Ren got some food in exchange for the materials of the monster.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a pity that there were no medicines or meal plants, but food was still very important. It would have been bad for Licia’s health if she had to eat monster meat for every meal.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Where are you going now?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Um…… I haven’t decided yet because it’s a trip with no particular purpose.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Then you might want to go to Clausel, which is a long way down the road ahead.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The name of the destination raised his eyebrows for a moment, though he was aware of the dangers of revealing the destination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was fortunate that the woman didn’t notice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is there something going on in Clausel?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The adventurer who came here the other day said that Clausel is going to be crowded in the near future.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Clausel will be crowded….?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. I don’t know the details, but Baron Clausel is going to be punished.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Licia gasped when she heard those words.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She had been quiet up to now, but she opened her mouth in a hurry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean? Why is this happening &mdash;-?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia’s voice was hoarse for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But in order to get the information, she is desperately trying to suppress her emotions that were about to rage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She didn’t want to offend the woman.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The adventurer says that Baron Clausel is under suspicion that he allowed monsters to invade Viscount Givens territory.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh, no…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That obviously isn’t true.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia was stunned as she listened to the story.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The woman was puzzled and concerned, “What’s wrong?” Ren managed to mend his smile because he was worried.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I think it’s time for us to leave this village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“She hasn’t been feeling well since yesterday.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is she all right? You can stay here for a night if you like.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’ll just take your good will. But, we’re in a hurry, so we’d better get going.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren also signaled to the stunned Licia and headed back to the plains.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The direction they were heading was the direction Licia had given them before they arrived at the village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My Lady. You were magnificent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">A few minutes after leaving the village.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I commended Licia for not losing her composure.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But when I called out to her, she didn’t respond.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>&#8211;2&#8211;</strong></p>

<p class="calibre4">Another few minutes passed, and then another dozen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Ren, sensing her feelings, didn’t try to force her to talk. He waited patiently for her to open up on her own.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a few minutes, she shook her body.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She opened her mouth for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……Hey, Ren…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She surprised Ren by unexpectedly calling out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, what is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ren hid his surprise and said without pointing out the change in the way she called him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">His tone of voice was as gentle as possible, slow enough not to rush her into continuing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why? My father worked so hard all these years, why is this happening to him?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……It’s because Viscount Givens was the culprit.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No, that’s not what I mean….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia said.</p>

<p class="calibre4">She knew that Viscount Givens was the culprit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“My father has done so much for Leomel, why should he be treated like this?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That is &mdash;-“</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What have we done ……? It’s true that I may have been young and foolish. But my father doesn’t deserve to be treated like this.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia’s shoulders tremble in front of Ren’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Viscount Givens’ aggressive behavior is strange, no matter how one looks at it. It shouldn’t be reasonable, but how can he be allowed to behave in such a way that doesn’t make sense….?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even the repeated words showed weakness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But.</p>
<p class="calibre4">(&mdash;- Naturally)</p>
<p class="calibre4">Licia who is with me is still a young girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s not the Saint Licia of the legend of the Seven Heroes. Absolutely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I don’t understand what nobles mean anymore…….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Finally, Licia’s shoulders shook and she burst into tears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The tears dripped onto Ren’s arms, which were turned to hold the reins and along with her trembling, she never stopped telling him how sad she was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a painful and sad sight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Ren didn’t have an answer to Licia’s question.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, he didn’t want to ignore it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, almost subconsciously, he let go of the reins and patted Licia on the head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not in the way a lover would do it, but in the gentle way a brother would do it to his sister.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“……Ren?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The hair is still dirty from not being bathed in hot water, and there’s no trace of the silky sheen it used to have.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For Licia, she didn’t want her hair touched like this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the first place, it’s not something that should be easily touched even in normal times.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If anything….. Please stroke it properly”</p>
<p class="calibre4">◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇ ◇</p>
<p class="calibre4">The next morning, shortly after sunrise, Viscount Givens arrived in the town of Clausel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At first glance, he appeared to be a man of mature years, a gentleman with carefully coiffed gray hair and beard.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, despite his appearance, he’s a man of great talent and even great ambition. As a member of the aristocracy belonging to the Heroic Faction, he’s determined to expand the power of this faction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Viscount.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">His knight called out to him as he rode his horse down the main street of the town.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s time.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;-Yes. For the sake of the future of our heroic faction, we must surely bring down the House of Clausel.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“When we have accomplished this, I’m sure that all who share our ambitions will rejoice.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Exactly… This territory is the place between our heroes and the royalists. By conquering this land, we are certain to expand the power of our heroic faction.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If that opponent is the Clausel family, then we’ll be able to control the territory near the imperial capital as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Viscount Givens nodded in reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If it were possible, I would have liked to embrace the Clausel family as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“You’re correct. But they’re the ones who have refused to budge no matter how many times the viscount has tried. We’ll have no choice but to suppress them by force.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As they exchanged words, the viscount suddenly thought back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He brought his horse slightly closer to the knight and said to the knight in a stealthy voice:&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“In order to rebirth the declining Leomel, we must drive out the royalists. And I will punish those foolish traitors who call themselves neutral. Such opportunism is the bane of the aristocracy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The knight felt a sense of reassurance as he looked at Viscount Givens, who had said these words strongly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“But still, Viscount.”&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What is it?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…… why are you so obsessed with Ren Ashton? He’s a promising boy, but I don’t think he’s worth all that trouble.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Viscount Givens chuckled and looked up to the heavens.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Viscount, I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how could Ren Ashton be worth more than a saint &mdash;-“</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It is what it is.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;-!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Beside Viscount Givens, who said this in a biting tone, the knight opened his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The overwhelming confidence in his voice, which never seems to be a deception, gives a clear sense of reason.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“The presence of the saint is no different and is material for my later negotiations with Baron Clausel. But did you think that would be enough for me to make a strong stand?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Viscount Givens said with a smile on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I only want one person, Ren Ashton. The Clausel family is just an incidental matter. It’s enough just to pressure the parent.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Why? He may have a promising future, but he’s only the son of a country knight!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Everyone will say that. But I, only I, know that it is wrong.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">His voice is more confident than before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was even more powerful and promising.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“If we take the Ashtons, our House of Givens will rise among the heroes. No, not just the heroes, but almost all my subjects will praise me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The true meaning of the implied words was not said, but only made the knight expect it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But one thing did bother him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He wondered why the Viscount had changed his words to the Ashton family instead of saying Ren Ashton…..</p>
