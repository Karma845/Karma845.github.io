<p class="calibre4">“What about the bath?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The spoiled life is over.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A bath is quite a spoiling experience……</p>
<p class="calibre4">Night. Basically, there will never be a time when Suzuka isn’t around, and I can’t have her spoiling me in the bath, can I?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sure Yuki wants to do his best on his own, so I guess I don’t have to help you out?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, oh.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">An answer that doesn’t add up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She can help me with the bath, right? Because I wanted to say that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, but I’ll cover it with a plastic bag.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She covered my right hand with a bag so that the bandage would not get wet.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">A little while later, I took a bath without assistance for the first time in a long time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The bathroom was filled with the sound of small drops of water dripping from everywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I struggled to wash my body with one hand and soaked myself in the bathtub.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m spoiled. I’ll have to …… do something about it before my departure for college.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The reason why I am in such a hurry to be able to do it, to some extent, with one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That is partly because the graduation trip is coming up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It is not a good idea to act like you are with your girlfriend on your graduation trip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For the people around us, the two of us should do whatever we want to do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If Suzuka spoils me now that I can’t use my right hand, it will only look like we are flirting to those around us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The graduation trip should be enjoyed by “everyone”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two of us should not be so busy with our own world that we forget about “everyone else”.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, well, I’ll have to buy something so I can clean the bathtub properly in our new home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I come up with another idea of what we need for our new home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It will be the first time for me to live away from my parents and in a different place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unknown experiences must be waiting for us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess I’m at a turning point …… right now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Dazed by the changing routine, I warm myself slowly in the bath.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I get out of the bath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With one hand, I managed to finish wiping myself off and finished getting dressed. I went to my room with the towel around my neck.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m done!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t wipe my hair well with one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a towel around my neck, I scrubbed and told Suzuka that I was back from the bath.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s up with the silence?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see Yuki clumsily wiping his hair, and I have an itch to dry it off myself.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I have to get used to using one hand, and I’ll dry it myself, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if you say so, come on. It’s the clumsiness that’s making me itch!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After saying all that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After she finished saying that, she took away the towel I was using and began to wipe my hair.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, I said it’s okay. I told you I’m fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, well, well, don’t say that, all right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, Suzuka finished wiping my hair and was satisfied, and she left to take a bath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While I was relaxing alone in my room, I noticed a fashion magazine on my bed, which is Suzuka’s territory.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I’m relaxing alone in the room, I see a fashion magazine in Suzuka’s territory called my bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sometimes it’s not so bad to read something like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I picked up the fashion magazine and started reading.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I opened the page with a fold on it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suzuka……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Special feature: ” Date outfit collection”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perfect for an important outing with the guy you’re interested in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She went to the trouble of reading this kind of thing to decide what to wear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, it must make her happy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She is making an effort not to show it, behind my back. All I can say is that she looks even prettier now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Okay, next up is ……</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Special Feature: ‘Ranking the Things You Want Your Boyfriend to Do to’……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Various articles appear in fashion magazines.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I started to read it to find out what kind of things women in the world want their boyfriends to do to them, but I found it to be rather silly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only thing that was written was that it was absolutely false.</p>
<p class="calibre4">‘I want to be savagely loved!’</p>
<p class="calibre4">I seriously don’t get it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I did that to Suzuka, she would probably snap at me, right?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you’re looking at my magazine!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I was just curious. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, that’s fine, but …”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She glances at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Is she wondering if I’ve noticed the fold in the page with date outfits?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Surely, I’d be embarrassed if Suzuka found out about my behind-the-scenes efforts, too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I should just keep my mouth shut and get on with it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, a women’s fashion magazine. It’s not really my cup of tea.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Which one was the one you were looking at with interest just now? I tossed the fashion magazine on the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Probably because she didn’t think I’d notice the folded corner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This kind of thing is really cute.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If it had been me before we started dating, I would have said, “You know, there was a fold on the page with an example of how to dress for a date.” I would have said something like that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’ve become a lot kinder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, there’s a part of me that wants to be a little mean…….</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, some people often put folds on their favorite pages in magazines, what about you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess I’m one of those people who don’t!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Liar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was slight, but it was folded, all right?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Don’t laugh at ……. Don’t laugh at Suzuka’s lie.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, really?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I kinda hate putting a fold on it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Pfft, can you even look at this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I pick up the magazine I let loose on the bed and show her the folded pages.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Suzuka comes up to me and takes the magazine from me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki is so mean! You knew it, but you were so mean to ask me if I folded it or not! You are so mean! I won’t help you even if you’re suffering!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yeah, yeah. Look, my hair is dry enough now, so let’s go to bed, shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka puffed up her cheeks and got angry, and I started to prepare for sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka still sleeps on the bed and I sleep on the futon on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka has been helping me since I got injured when I put down the futon that is being moved to the edge, but she won’t help me because I made her angry earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if Yuki asked me to help her, I wouldn’t help you~”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka blurts out as she looks at me with her eyes fixed on me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was mischievous, saying it out loud, showing that she was concerned about me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s such a sweet girl, I was thinking.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I found out that I did a lot of things with one hand. Thanks to Suzuka, I’ve been able to live without any inconvenience, huh? Really, I’m grateful.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe ……. I’m not going to help you even if you try to get me to help you with such sweet words!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After making a happy face for a moment, she immediately switches to an angry face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can’t get enough of that childishness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I know. I know. Good night, Suzuka.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm. I’m not going to reply to the mean Yuki…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The silly girl doesn’t realize that what she just said is a reply.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now, I wonder what her mood will be like when she wakes up tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I turned off the light and fell asleep on the futon I had laid out.</p>
