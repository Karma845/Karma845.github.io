<h1 class="single_title">Chapter 28 &#8211; College Life Begins</h1>


<p class="calibre4">A few days after Suzuka and I started living together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The entrance ceremony of the university was held.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And it was over.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We went to the ceremony as usual, got our student ID cards, had an explanation about the guidance from tomorrow, watched a little recruitment for clubs, and took a commemorative photo.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We just went out for dinner, me and Suzuka’s whole family.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then at night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I got into bed, I talked to Suzuka who was beside me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What time should we get up tomorrow?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Guidance is at 9:00 a.m. If you get up before 8:00 a.m., you will have enough time… I have to do my makeup and I will get up at 7:20 a.m. What about you, Yuki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then wake me up at 40 minutes, since it won’t take me much time to get ready.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I understand. Okay, good night~.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah, good night…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I left the miniature light bulb on and went to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A few days ago, I thought I would be too embarrassed to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m so used to it now, I’m not embarrassed, I feel nothing but happiness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m not ashamed to say that I’m happy… I guess I’m going to start my real college life tomorrow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m looking forward to it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wake up to the feeling of something stinging my cheek.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning. Yuki.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh. Good morning. Is it too cute to wake me up with a peck on the cheek?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe. Yeah? Look, I’m serving breakfast, so let’s eat, shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“As expected of you, Suzuka. I’m going to the bathroom first.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Bye~!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka saw me off, and I went to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And as I do my business, I was amused by Suzuka’s cute behavior in the morning.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The way she wakes me up is just too cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After washing my hands, I went to the living room, which is connected to the kitchen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There is breakfast on the table, grouped in one plate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Scrambled eggs, bacon, lettuce, tomato, and toast.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The main dish is corn soup.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m usually happy that you cook so neatly in the morning. I’m sorry, but if it’s too much trouble, you can cut corners and just make more pastries, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sooner or later. You know what I mean? It’s a shame to be so cold after just moving in together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know, it’s not fair of you to say that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right? Shall we eat then?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, let’s eat.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The toast made a nice crunchy sound as I bit into it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After a happy morning, Suzuka and I got on the train and headed for the university station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although it was only a few stops, we were fed up with the crowded train and headed to the auditorium where we were to meet to receive instructions on how to prepare for our future university life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since Suzuka and I have the same last name, our student ID numbers were assigned consecutively.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, we were seated next to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Having someone you know next to you is a good thing, but at the same time it is a waste because it reduces the number of people you meet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That is why I talked to the neighbor who was not Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nice to meet you, my name is … Shindou. Pleased to meet you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My name is Shima Kenta. It’s nice to meet you too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As a university student, he was very firm at first.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, as we talked, we became more and more comfortable with each other, and he lost his politeness.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Where do you live, Shindou?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A few stations away from here. What about Shima?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Me? Saitama Prefecture, about an hour and fifty minutes by train. I wouldn’t know the name of the station anyway.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s quite a distance.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I had money, I could live alone. I could manage the rent if I worked for the time it takes to get to school, but in the end, I have to work a lot to pay for food and utilities.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hearing this statement, I understood how blessed I was now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I realized that living away from my parents’ house, which I had begun to do without even thinking about it, was a luxury.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, it looks like it’s time for the guidance to start.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The buzz in the auditorium lessened as the time came.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Looking to the side, Suzuka also quit talking to someone and became quiet.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then the guidance got underway.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the auditorium, general precautions were to be taken.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After that, the students were divided into small classrooms, each with a seating capacity of about 30 to 40 students, and the more in-depth guidance was about to begin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The students are not grouped in order of their student ID numbers, but are usually separated into different rooms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I thought I would not be in the same small classroom as Suzuka, but I guess it was to divide the ratio of women in the classroom evenly. I and Suzuka were assigned to the same classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’s in the same classroom as me, but we don’t head there together. We usually go our separate ways, since it would be too much of a bad idea to do too much together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I walked into the classroom, I was tapped on the shoulder from behind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yo, Yuki. Long time no see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yashiro, a senior member of the soccer club, was in the small classroom where I was headed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s going on with you, Yashiro-senpai?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Me? SA, Student Assistant. In short, it is a part-time job to give advice and guidance to students on how to register for classes at this school. You should be grateful. What’s up with your injured hand?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It seems that a senior member from the soccer team from my former high school is taking care of a lot of things today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can only say that is reassuring.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I did it by a little unfortunate accident. I’m looking forward to working with you today. Yashiro-senpai.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ohhhh. I’ll take care of it, okay? And. Look, look. There’s a student in this classroom with the same name as your childhood friend and the same last name as you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">…….</p>
<p class="calibre4">………….</p>

<p class="calibre4">The relationship between Suzuka and me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After all, we talked about it together. We decided that if they asked us, we would tell them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would not be good to hide it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But still, cold sweat was pouring down my face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And in the midst of all this, students gathered in the small classroom one after another, after me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ahaha, nice to meet you, Shindou-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, nice to meet you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">On the way to the classroom, Suzuka came over, talking to someone who must have been a friend of hers.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh? That’s your childhood friend, Mita-san, isn’t it? Funny … I don’t think I saw Mita on the list…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Um, well, let’s see…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did you marry Mita-san, by any chance? Well, that’s not too far-fetched.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The first time is the crucial time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Large nameplate stickers were prepared so that those gathered in the same classroom could call each other by name.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the white board, there was an instruction to write your name on the nameplate sticker and stick it, so Suzuka wrote her name with a marker.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Shindou Suzuka”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Yashiro-senpai, who was watching her, put his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll buy you a drink, so let’s go out today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…I have something to do today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? What did you say? We’re going out to eat, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Uh, yes. We’re going…”</p>
