<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; There is No Need To Skip Steps</h3>


<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Two weeks had passed since Tanaka and Kaneda-san started going out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And, if you were to ask what Suzuka and I did during those two weeks…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It wasn’t as if nothing had changed at all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The two of us began living together and we got over the sense of nervousness we had.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Though we couldn’t go so far as to say that it was now natural for us to be all smiles without any difficulties when we were together, we were still having fun as we spent our days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">… But it was then that we saw the new couple of Tanaka and Kaneda-san, and it made me think.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Despite the fact that we were gradually getting along better and getting to like each other, still I couldn’t help but feel like we were a far cry from lovers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Having seen the lovers that were Tanaka and Kaneda-san, Suzuka and I came back home, entered our room together, and, contrary to our wishes, began to feel a certain impatience at the lack of advance in our relationship.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">January 5</span><span class="calibre12">th</span><span class="calibre12">.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We were now in the beginning of March, almost the season of graduations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Timewise, it had easily been 2 months.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We may have had the entrance exams come over us, along with days in which we couldn’t meet, but even so, 2 months had already passed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I may be somewhat uncertain about a marital relationship, but she is someone I want to be with.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was the impatience born from knowing that if things kept as they were with that someone, we could one day end up on different paths.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I was tormented by that thought.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I continued to be absorbed in those thoughts until I suddenly noticed that I had approached Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Say, want to try kissing at least?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“K-kissing?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, I mean. You know, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I knew that Suzuka liked me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Being that the case, I believed it’d be fine and forcefully got closer to her. However, having been childhood friends for so long, I understood many things from Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I could at least tell that, right now, at this place, Suzuka didn’t want to be kissed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“My bad. Forget I said it, I got ahead of myself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, it’s fine. I also get why you’re feeling pressured.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’d been affected by our surroundings and lost sight of myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I got the sensation that that was the one thing I should never do.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">… Well, even if I knew that, my emotions were a complicated mishmash.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Today was the first time since we started living together that I felt such a strong sense of awkwardness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The next day welcomed us as I continued to feel the awkwardness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was a considerably important day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">That’s right, it was our graduation day.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was the landmark day that marked the end of our high school life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Despite continuing to be assailed by the strange sense of urgency and nervousness about my relationship with Suzuka, I looked forward to the graduation ceremony.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked back to the many things that happened during my high school life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This last part from this year’s January was especially filled with mind-boggling days.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">At the beginning of them I had no special feelings of any sort towards Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And in spite of that, at some point I found myself liking her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">If someone asked me what thing in my high school life left the biggest impression on me, without a doubt, the first thing that I would say would be that I got married to Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">While there were many things to think about, the graduation ceremony advanced and was over in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We went back to our classroom and received our graduation certificates from our teacher.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Then, it was time to say our goodbyes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">At long last, all that was left was taking the commemorative photos and other small things before leaving school one last time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">My thoughts were running back to many things as I took the commemorative photos of the graduation with my friends. Those happy yet saddening moments went by in a heartbeat.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I stood before the school gates.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was the last time I’d go back home as a high school student.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I couldn’t help wanting to go back home together with Suzuka this last time, so I called her out.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Sorry, did I make you wait?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, I just got here so there’s no problem. Well, shall we go?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We walked side-by-side wearing our uniforms.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As I thought to myself that this was truly the last time, I felt strong emotions well up inside me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The ever-changing life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">More changes will continue to take place from now on too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Sorry, do you mind if we take a small detour?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Sure.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I decided to make a small detour together with Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The place we headed to was the park where Suzuka and I had first met when we were small.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Coming to a park at an age like ours kind of becomes a seldom occurrence, no?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Well, yes. And, why’d we come here?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I thought that this place was the best if I was to be clear in telling you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What are you going to tell me?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka had a worried expression on her face.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I laughed when I saw Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“There’s no need for that face! It’s not something as ominous as you’re thinking, ok?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Then, what is it?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Aah, well, give me a bit more time to collect myself.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The words I wanted to tell Suzuka once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I feel weirdly embarrassed saying them, so I practice saying them over and over in my head so I don’t mess up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Not yet?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Sorry, please wait just a bit more.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yeah, I’ll wait for you however long you need.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I made Suzuka wait for a few minutes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I strengthened my resolve and spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Suzuka. I like you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka looked blankly in amazement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Not worrying about that, I went on to lay bare my whole heart to her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“We became a married couple on a whim. But we are now in mutual love. I hadn’t said that ‘I like you’ clearly until now, right?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Now that you mention, you’re right. I even feel like you evaded giving a direct answer a lot too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“That’s how it was. Now comes the real thing I wanted to tell you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka held her breath as she waited for my words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">What I wanted to tell her now was, if you really wanted to say it, yes it was an obvious thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Please go out with me.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Heh, eh? Ah, erm, what?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Aah, it makes me embarrassed explaining this out loud. Because the two of us became a married couple first, we had our minds fully preoccupied by that and were thinking as we skipped all the proper steps, wouldn’t you say?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You may be right. We did get married first and thought only about what came next.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Isn’t that too unnatural? Things have their proper course. Well, there may be times when you simply skip over all that. However, after thinking about it in many ways, I realized that it wasn’t good for you and me to skip over all that process.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This relationship between us that, though slowly, continued to progress.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was so slow that whenever you compared it to other people, it was slow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">After watching a couple like Tanaka and Kaneda-san, even if I didn’t want to, I understood that it was incredibly and undeniably slow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Yesterday, while I was falling asleep, I thought it over well.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Despite that being the case, it was not like us to hurry it up.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">People each have their own pace.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We had fallen prey to ignoring our own pace and feeling like we needed to go faster and faster because we had gotten married and become a couple.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“And you’re okay with that, Yuuki?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Slowly without hurrying. Just because we got married, there’s no need for us to go and skip every step, right? Want to try thinking about this by forgetting about our marriage first? This is what I wanted to tell you. Sorry I’m so bad with words.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“No, you got your point across, so it’s okay.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“By the way, your answer…?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Sounds good to me. Before becoming a married couple, let’s try being lovers first!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As if all the dark clouds hanging over her head had cleared, she gave me a most radiant smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">All right, this was our true beginning at last.</span></p>
