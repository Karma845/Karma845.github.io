<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; We Hadn’t Even Started</h3>

<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The graduation ceremony ended, and a longer-than-usual spring vacation welcomed us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Well, it was a difference like day and night compared to the university’s spring vacations.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Our time together increased on its own, and Suzuka and I were having a smooth sailing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hand me over the manga~.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Here you go.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I stopped playing with my phone and grabbed a manga for her.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Thanks.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">For the time being, we passed the time together in that manner with leisure words.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">But, that was no longer how it was.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We had become lovers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Though the family registry said that we were in a marital relationship, we thought to go back over the different steps of a relationship that we skipped and start building them firmly from zero, so we became lovers.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka and my relationship has become clear at last.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Thanks to that, the number of times we were together and felt an uncomfortable sense of awkwardness decreased.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What’ll you do during spring vacation?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Go on the graduation trip and play with my friends like norma~l. And you, Yuuki?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Similar to you.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I see.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I went back to fiddling with my phone.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka too went back to reading her manga.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">A few minutes passed and I once again spoke and asked Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“You have any plans for tomorrow?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I don’t. My plan’s idling away like today. How about you?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“None either.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Hence ended our banal conversation once again.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Time simply continued to pass at leisure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As it did, I resolved myself to actually say this time the words I had intended to when I had called Suzuka just now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Say, Suzuka.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hmm, wha~t?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“So, you’re free tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yeah, I’m free and?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Want to go on a date?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">After great pains, I finally invited her to a date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">How to say this? Truth is, all this time until now since we became a married couple, not even once had I invited her on a proper date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We were now lovers, so I should properly invite her on a date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">That was what I thought, and I tried to say it, but I couldn’t manage to get the words out because of the embarrassment.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hmmm…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka was mulling it over for a long time.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Eh?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I had thought that now that we were lovers, I would get an instantaneous OK from her…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I waited for Suzuka’s reply with cold sweat running down my back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">After pondering it over deeply for a long time, the answer that came back to me was:</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Tomorrow’s no good.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Eh, what? Why?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Calm down, don’t fret like that. Haahh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka stopped reading her manga and looked at me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">She then headed towards the dresser in my room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It was the corner of it that I had lent her. She showed me the clothes of hers that were in it and spoke.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“It’s the first date to which you invite, Yuuki! There’s no way I could go with these clothes! I’ll get more stylish clothes, so please, I want you to wait!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, got it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I flinched at the cute reason which I could have never imagined.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“With that, I look forward to the day after tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Got it. The day after tomorrow then.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Like this, our first date was decided.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka was in high spirits.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And how was I?</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We had become lovers casually, so I wanted to go on a date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… Damn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I noticed an extremely unpleasant thing.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka was so excited about it that she would go out of her way and buy fashionable clothes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Try going on a date with some half-baked plan with someone like that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It would be the shame of a lifetime.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">In which case, all that I had left was to come up with the perfect date plan by the day after tomorrow.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Well, it was already late at night.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I’ll try thinking about it after sleeping for now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The next morning then came and greeted us.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I overslept since I was already in full spring vacation mode.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Morning, Suzuka…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I opened my eyes and noticed Suzuka wasn’t in the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Instead, there was a single note left atop the desk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><i class="fn"><span class="calibre12">[To Yuuki:</span></i><i class="fn"><span class="calibre12"><br class="header" /></span></i><i class="fn"><span class="calibre12">I’m going to buy some Western clothes! Be back soon!]</span></i></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“… Ugh.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I could feel an even greater pressure to not fail at designing a great date plan burden me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">R-right!</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">For starters, I should do the same as Suzuka and choose some nice clothes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I opened the dresser with that in mind, and:</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Damn.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I didn’t buy many spring clothes last year.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Because of that, all I could see were slightly worn-out clothes which I could wear in normal circumstances without problem.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">… Uh, anyhow…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">It may have been me overthinking it, but after seeing that note overflowing in excitement and expectations, there was no way I could stay unmotivated myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Alright, guess I’ll be going to buy clothes too.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I went outside in order to buy clothes for the date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I plan the date while being softly shook by the train.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">The amusement park, the aquarium, the zoo, the movies.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">On second thought, we should leave out the amusement park.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka was enthused about getting new clothes. The chances of her going to the date with clothes that were difficult to move in were high.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Which meant that…</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">While I was thinking about that and other things, the train arrived at a flourishing city.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I put away my phone into my pocket and went onwards to a trip in search of clothes.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">… I was more than aware that I had no fashion sense.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">As soon as I entered a shop aimed at young people, the employee came over to me and I decided to rely on them fully.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Which are the recommended clothes for a date?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Have you decided on where you are going for your date? There is no better clothing than one that fits the time, place, and occasion.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ermm, we are still uncertain about the place, but we were thinking about the aquarium, the zoo, or the movies. One of those three.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Understood. Allow me to show you some suggestions of apparel which can be worn at any of those three places.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">And with that, I went on to choose new clothes with the help from the employee.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Having been able to buy some stylish clothes, I was feeling pleased with myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Keeping the momentum, I bought some shoes too.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Next is </span><i class="fn"><span class="calibre12">that</span></i><span class="calibre12">.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Our first date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I wanted to give her some present of sorts to make it into a more remarkable memory.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I went to search for a small gift that didn’t go too overboard.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Before I knew it, it was dusk.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I returned home after having finished my preparations for our date.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I looked around the entry hall and noticed that it had traces that Suzuka had already returned.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">I took a cold drink from the refrigerator and was about to open the door to my room, which was presently also Suzuka’s room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Yuuki, wait!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I’m currently trying on the clothes I plan to wear tomorrow. And, I already went to all this, so I’d like to keep them a surprise for tomorrow, you know?”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Oh, yeah.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">My heart was throbbing in excitement.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">When I thought about just what kind of clothes she would wear at tomorrow’s date, I found my heart beating faster than ever for Suzuka.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">2-3 minutes later.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Since Suzuka told me it was fine now to go inside, I entered the room.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Sorry~.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Don’t worry. From where I’m standing, you’re so excited for tomorrow that you can’t help it. I can only say thank you for being so excited for it.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Ehehe? That so? Eh, that’s…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka had her attention stolen by the bags I was carrying.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">With the full intention of drawing her in, I pushed the bags before Suzuka before speaking.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“Because you were so excited, I tried getting excited myself. Lovers, well, the registry says married couple already though. It’s the first date I invite you on. How could I be all aloof when you’re so excited? That sort of thing.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“…”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“What’s wrong? You’re silent.”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">“I simply was so happy I got silent. A~h, it has to be that. Ever since you said that we should start as lovers first, Yuuki, every day has been so fun I can’t help it. I can’t believe how fun it’s become simply by letting go of that previous sensation of always thinking ‘for now’, ‘for the time being’. Yuuki, I love you!”</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">Suzuka jumped with great intensity and clung to me, and I gently hugged her back.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">We’re only starting.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">This is only our beginning.</span></p>
<p class="calibre4"><span class="calibre12">That was the sort of day it was.</span></p>
