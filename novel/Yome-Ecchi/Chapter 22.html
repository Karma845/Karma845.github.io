<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre3">Chapter 22 &#8211; There’s Weirdos in Every Generation</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre4">We’ve been around a lot.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Popcorn is not enough to fill our bellies.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We bought a variety of robust meals and shared them with everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And because I can only use one hand, everyone spoiled me and fed me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Well, the guys.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What makes me so happy that I have to take food from men’s hands?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, Shindou, Tanaka often sends us pictures of his dates as if he’s harassing us, but we’re curious about you and Mita-san, aren’t we? Right, guys?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yamaguchi, the good-looking nerd, suddenly spoke up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was not only the boys but also the girls who were caught up in the conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems that Suzuka, like me, doesn’t talk much about her daily life to the people around her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why they were curious about us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s normal, isn’t it? Suzuka.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, it’s normal, isn’t it? Sometimes, we go on dates, talk, that kind of thing.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I talk about our daily life in response to the expectations of those around us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps it was because I answered in a nonchalant manner that the stares from everyone were piercing me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since we’re here, why don’t you try flirting here?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Miyamoto-san suggested.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though they are corrupted, it is said that they are surprisingly capable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The first thing that comes to mind is the fact that the two of you are not the only ones who have a lot in common. I can’t imagine you and Mita-san flirting with each other……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. A graduation trip for all of us. But for now, I’ll close my eyes and you guys can flirt with each other.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I were laughing as we were pushed by everyone who wanted us to show them our passionate relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, if they are suspecting us, we will show them what we have done.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki. Yes, ah~n.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mmmm. Popcorn is better when it’s fresh.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Showing the routine of getting me to eat the popcorn.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I felt a little bit of embarrassment and reduced our presence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was just plain embarrassing, you know? I regret doing it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because, you know, usually in these situations, it’s like….</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, man. He’s hiding it, just like Tanaka, but it’s still steaming hot.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, man. I’m soaked.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">You know, they play with me like this, right?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka, too, is not jealous like me, but she is involved with me in a bad way.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I never thought Suzuka could make a woman’s face like that. Mmm-hmm, hi-hi-hi-hi-ho-ho. It’s so hot!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve really never seen Suzuka’s face like that before. Suzuka is a girl too, huh~?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She was teased about being a girlfriend for the first time, she just turned bright red and let the conversation slide.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I look at each other and laugh.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What a pain”, huh?</p>

<p class="calibre4">While being teased about being a boyfriend, I headed to an area that was opened a few years ago, where characters from a popular video game franchise are located.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just looking at the three-dimensional representation of the game world, I was transported back to my childhood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m still a child, but I don’t know what to say.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Look, look, they sell fake mustaches, see?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka pointed to a place where fake mustaches were lined up, just like the fake ears often seen at amusement parks.</p>
<p class="calibre4">They were fake mustaches in the shape of motifs of famous characters that every Japanese citizen must have seen before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Walking around the amusement park, I saw many people wearing fake mustaches.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The source of the fake mustaches was here.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A fake mustache costs 1,500 yen. That’s a terrible deal.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You say that? Well, even if you think so, you promise not to say it out loud, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, Suzuka wanted that thing, so you pointed it out to me, didn’t you? Wait here, I’ll get it for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, what is it? You want to buy that fake mustache?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kaneda-san was hooked with the idea.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Apparently, we were not the only ones who were curious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, after much discussion, it was decided that the two who lost in a game of rock-paper-scissors would wear the fake mustaches for the rest of the day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Rock, paper, scissors. Pon!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Rock, paper, scissors.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The result was that Suzuka and I lost.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To tell the truth, I was embarrassed to wear a fake mustache, but I had no choice because I lost.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I went out of my own pocket to buy an expensive fake mustache and put it on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I showed it off to the audience, deliberately imitating a character with a mustache.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Haha, Yuki. You don’t look alike!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suzuka. You’re the one who can’t laugh. You’re also pretty ridiculous with a fake mustache, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, yeah. Shindou-kun is right, Suzuka is pretty bad too, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kaneda-san took out a hand mirror and handed it to Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka smiled bitterly when she saw the hand mirror.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She seemed to be unable to accept herself with an ill-fitting fake mustache.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Damn, spending all day with this is just a regular punishment ….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Totally.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It goes without saying that everyone makes fun of me and Suzuka for wearing fake mustaches.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It cost me 1500 yen. At best, please entertain everyone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to go use the restroom.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">One of them goes to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then I, too, start moving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, me too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I finished my business first and went back to where the girls were waiting.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, guess what?</p>

<p class="calibre4">I heard a few trendy guys ask, “Would you like to have fun with me? I’ll buy you a drink. If you don’t like it, you can leave right away.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t quite hear them, though.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and the others refuse with a wry smile to the overzealous pick-up artist, but even so, the other party is not ready to give up and is still eager to get involved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Kaneda-san, in particular, seemed to be very uncomfortable as he blatantly brought his face close to hers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I knew this was a bad situation, so I rushed toward them.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, sorry for making you wait. We should all go back soon.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As soon as I say that, the look on the pickup-artists’s faces change bluntly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Damn, you really came here with a guy! Oh, man.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No way. Then, you should have said more properly that you were here with a man.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The anachronistic pick-ups quickly disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What a pity, there are always weirdos in every generation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That was a disaster. They didn’t do anything to you, did they?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I know they didn’t do anything to them, but I had to ask just in case.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then all the boys came back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And when Tanaka came back, Kaneda-san intentionally said, “I was scared. Tanaka-chan. Tanaka-chan.” They started flirting with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, I know that Kaneda-san was really scared when the weird guy forcefully brought his face close to hers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We tolerated it because of that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki, would you have preferred to have me cry like that?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do as you please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No. I wasn’t scared. But, well, if I get a little more scared, I’ll cry like that, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, well, I’ll comfort you then.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe~. Okay. Thanks.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t that obvious?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hopefully, the time when Suzuka wants to cry will never happen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m sure there will be times when she will want to cry, and that’s when I’ll let her cry without reservation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tanaka. I was scared~!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I’m sorry. I’m sorry. It’s because I took my eyes off you…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. That’s because Tanaka wasn’t there……. Next time we go out, we mustn’t leave each other, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I’ll hold your hand, don’t worry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now, let’s stop those guys who are just flirting, who say they were scared, but half-jokingly start crying halfway through, and just flirt…….</p>
