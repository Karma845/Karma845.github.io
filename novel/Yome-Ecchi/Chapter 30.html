<h1 class="single_title">Chapter 30 &#8211; At the Outdoors Club</h1>


<p class="calibre4">College life has officially begun.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After registering for classes, the first round of lectures began.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As it was the first lecture, the textbooks, attendance, tests, reports, etc. were explained.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After listening to these explanations, it seemed that the lecture time was surprisingly short, and not many lecturers used the full 90 minutes for the first lecture.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, there were some who went into great depth from the beginning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But still, I wondered if I would be able to get used to 90-minute lectures…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I waited for Suzuka on the terrace as I was lost in thoughts of my college life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, she’s here…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did you wait long?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t wait long.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, let’s go home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Neither of us have any more lectures we need to take today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There is still a lot of time left until the party “Compa” at the outdoor club that Yashiro-senpai created in the evening.</p>
<p class="calibre4">People who have a long way to go to their homes, or who live only a few stations away, don’t need to stay at the university to kill time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, if I had a friend who could pass the time with me, that would be a different story.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unfortunately, the people I met had lectures coming up, so Suzuka and I had a lot of free time to kill.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, Yuki. Have you finished your lectures today?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just when I was about to leave the university, I met Yashiro-senpai.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I have some time before the barbecue, so I’m going back home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I see. I remember you moved out of your parents’ house to live with your wife. Well, if you’re free now, you two can help me out a little bit. Preparing for the night’s barbecue.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Uh, yes. What about you, Suzuka?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I’m good.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, it’s decided. Well, head to the place where the barbecue is going to be held today, I’ll take the car.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We went to the place where the barbecue was going to be held.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The location is quite accessible, not far from the station.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We waited for 10 minutes for Yashiro-senpai to come with his car.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, I’m sorry to keep you waiting. I have some luggage in the car, so please help me carry it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is the luggage related to the barbecue?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s that, too. But there are other things, too. Look, it’s a lot more work than you think, so hurry up or we won’t make it in time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Unloading the luggage from the car that the senpai came in.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Barbecue stove, charcoal, chairs, etc.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition to that…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We want people to feel what the outdoors has to offer.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Tents, lanterns, hammocks, tarps, sleeping bags.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All these tools had nothing to do with barbecue.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I see, it takes time to set up these things, so they need our help.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Here’s how to pitch a tent I made for beginner campers. You two take a look at it and give it a try. If you have any questions, just ask.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yashiro-senpai waved his hand and started to do something else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I started to set up the tent beside him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yashiro-senpai is an amazing person. I didn’t expect him to prepare and organize so many things like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“He is a reliable senior.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He was kind to me when I injured my leg.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He is a man who gives his all in everything he does.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That is who Senpai is. The reason I wanted to enter this university was because I admired Yashiro.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Now, hold it down over there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was the season when the weather was a little humid.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The two of us finished putting up the tent in about …20 minutes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Phew. Is this okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We followed the instructions. Let’s go over there and have a senpai take a look at it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I asked Yashiro-senpai to check if the tent was set up properly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yashiro-senpai lightly said there was no problem, then turned to us and asked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, how did it go? How did you feel when you saw the tent up?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I felt a sense of accomplishment, or rather, I wondered what it would be like to spend the night in a tent set up like this.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m the same as Yuki! I kind of want to stay here~.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I thought I’d like to stay there for a while. I’m not sure if it’s a good idea or not, but it’s worth it. Well, I’ve got a few things ready to go. Look over there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yashiro-senpai pointed to a thick growth of trees.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And there were hammocks hanging from the trees.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Looks like fun!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suzuka-san is right, those things are good. Here, take a break and go experience it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yashiro-senpai patted me on the back and I went to the hammocks with Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka, who was lying in the swinging hammock, was satisfied and told me what she thought.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“This is good ……. It’s kind of relaxing. You should lie down too, Yuki!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I’ll take your word for it…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The hammock swayed and swayed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yashiro-senpai, who knows that I can only use one hand and that I would not be able to use it if it were set up high.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s probably why he set up the hammock so low.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, this is quite comfortable.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right! I’d love to sit in the hammock and read a book.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That might be nice.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I was savoring the goodness of the hammock, senpai came over and happily told us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a good thing, isn’t it? People tend to think of the outdoors as a series of inconveniences and endurance. But it also has this charm, you know? Well, I think it’s time for you to finish your break, right? Help me out, will you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, we’ll help you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Together with Suzuka, I started to help Yashiro-senpai again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Time went by quickly, and one of the people Yashiro-senpai must have invited arrived at this place.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yo. Yashiro-chan. You are doing well with your juniors, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I’m doing my best. If you came early, you can help me, too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Under~stood. Well, Yashiro-chan seems to be fine on his own, and I, um, … what should them? Those two?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Double Shindou, so call them Shindou Husband, Shindou Wife, Yuki, Suzuka, and so on.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You have no taste~! Well then, let’s continue to the two of them.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After talking with Yashiro-senpai, the senior came over to us and greeted us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nice to meet you. I am Yuko Yamanaka. Nice to meet you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, hello, I’m Yuki Shindou.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m his wife, Suzuka.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There is no use in concealing it. Or rather, hiding it would make us look suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So we decided to be open about our relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, I’m not going to go out of my way to tell people that we are married if they don’t ask.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Basically, I’m supposed to call people by their surnames, but you two seem to be so… Oh, how about this? Husband you are Shindou-kun. You, the wife, are Shindou-chan. How about it? Can I call you like that now?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, that’s fine with me too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. Well then, nice to meet you. Feel free to call me Yamanaka-senpai! Shindou-kun and Shindou-chan. Well, you two are so enthusiastic that you got married while you were still students. I wonder if we’ll get to hear some interesting stories?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As she said this, the voice of Yashiro-senpai, who was standing a little distance away from us, echoed through the air.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t ask anything too weird! If you ask anything, I’ll beat you with a hammer, so get ready for it~!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes yes. I understand~”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After Yamanaka-senpai said this out loud, she turned to us and asked with a grin.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Where did you two meet? Oh, you don’t have to talk if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yamanaka-senpai’s questioning begins.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, let’s talk about where we met … It’s not like I need to answer…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes. Suzuka and I met…”</p>
