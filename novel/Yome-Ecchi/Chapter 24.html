<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre3">Chapter 24 &#8211; Moving in is full of problems!?</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre4">Graduation trip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Nothing much happens, we enjoy the second day as usual and a few days passed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With the trip still fresh in our memories, Suzuka and I turn our attention to our room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I don’t bring a lot of stuff with me, so it’s not as bad as I thought.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My familiar room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I needed clean up my room in preparation for moving out.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The scenery won’t change much, perhaps because it was my parents’ house and I did not have to clean it up so much.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t really feel it ~”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka, who is standing next to me, said so.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s really no more than cleaning up, sweeping the desk, organizing the clothes, and that’s it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, shall we get started?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, let’s do it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We headed for our apartment, which was not far from my parents’ house.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After an hour-long train ride, we arrived at our new home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After receiving various documents and keys from the real estate agent, we were ready to go in.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, excuse me!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka entered the apartment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I also entered fearfully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though I had seen this apartment before signing the contract, I was still nervous.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to live here…….</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, we’re going to live here…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We both looked at each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Within a few seconds, our faces broke into a smile and we both laughed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What is going to happen?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We had no idea this was going to happen a few months ago.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No wonder we were laughing, right?</p>
<p class="calibre4">An empty room. I lay down on the floor and wondered.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I knew it would be strange to live away from my parents.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good boy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka lies down on the floor as well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This act was probably completely meaningless.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While doing something meaningless, Suzuka and I talked with cheerful thoughts.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess it’s just the beginning. We’ll see. I’m kind of looking forward to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I totally get it. At first I didn’t know if I should live with you, but now I can tell you that it’s normal, right? I hear that’s normal.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. I see. Hey, Yuki.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m looking forward to living with you, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My pleasure. You see, my hand is still like this, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I said, holding up my right hand, which was still not healed.</p>



<p class="calibre4">Now, there was no way I could just lie around in my new home for no reason, and packages kept arriving in my room one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre4">First of all, the luggage sent from home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Most of the furniture was left in my room. Therefore, it was too much to use a moving company, so we used a courier service.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After receiving them, the furniture delivery came next.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Several colored boxes that could be easily moved, a desk, a TV rack, and various other things.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And a bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait a minute. I don’t think I asked for a bed…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t buy a bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because sleeping with Suzuka or something like that is normally sort of a nice way to get to know each other a little better, and ……</p>
<p class="calibre4">So for the time being, we planned to sleep on a futon, but for some reason, a bed also came along.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered if it was a wrong delivery. I asked the delivery company about it, and they replied ……</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t the client’s name your father?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I knew in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I told my father and mother that we would use a futon instead of a waiting bed for the time being, I showed them a semi-double bed that happened to be on the waiting list on a shopping site so that they would not think I was being dishonest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps the waiting list had disappeared, or they went to the actual store to see what they had in stock, bought it because it was available at the time, and sent it to us.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We couldn’t turn down the favor, so we ended up having the bed brought to our room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After saying thank you to the delivery guy and returning to the room, I took out my cell phone and made a call.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mom? What was that about?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you mean the bed? You guys wanted this one, but you couldn’t buy it because it’s out of stock. Surprisingly, when you go to the actual store, they often have these things in stock. So I went with your father to see if they had it, so I just asked for it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My guess was right.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, the bed came, but if there is a futon, there is no need to sleep with Suzuka……</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hmm? Wait a minute.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What happened to the futon set that you and dad said you were going to buy for us as a commemoration of moving in together?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s a lie. It was a lie I told in order to surprise you with the bed you couldn’t get. That’s why I didn’t buy you a futon set in the first place. I did send you a comforter, though, didn’t I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, oh, I see…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Now, now, I’ll tell you the long story another time. Go ahead and do your room. Or you can let me come and help you, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Mom doesn’t have work today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She offered to help us, but I politely declined.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because it’s like, we’re both in this apartment together. It’s nice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I understand. I’ll call you later in the evening.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, sure. Talk to you later.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, talk to you later.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hung up the call.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was talking in the living room and looked for Suzuka, but I couldn’t find her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought she was in the bedroom, so I peeked in and saw her …… bouncing happily on the soft mattress of the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Are you a kid?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hehehe, I’m having fun. Yuki can jump on the mattress, too, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I have something important to tell you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The futon set that Mom and Dad said they would give us is not coming. Therefore, the only sleeping arrangements are the semi-double bed and the comforter that is here.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…”　</p>

<p class="calibre4">It would have been better if we had a normal double bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even so, we have been avoiding sleeping together because we are embarrassed to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered if we would be able to spend the night in a semi-double bed, which is a size smaller than a double bed…….</p>

<p class="calibre4">We both froze at the problem that had just arisen.</p>
