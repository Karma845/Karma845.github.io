<h1 class="single_title">Chapter 26 &#8211; Morning in a Semi-Double Bed!</h1>


<p class="calibre4">“Hmm~, I’m full!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka patted her belly contentedly with her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was showing a little even through her clothes, so I touched it gently.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s a nice pat on the middle.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki~, touching my body casually like that is s****l harassment, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She gives me a cold stare as she moves my hand away from her stomach, which I had been touching without thinking about it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, that’s the childhood friend version. You don’t actually think it’s s****l harassment, do you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Damn, I couldn’t fool you, could I? …”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I mean, why were you trying to fool me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There’s no reason, okay? Just wondering what will happen to Yuki. Uppu……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka gulped, as if she was suffering from just talking with a full stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s true that because we’ve known each other for so long, we kept eating and eating without reservation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was so deeply moved that I let out a small chuckle to myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s the lack of restraint that makes it fun to be with you…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? What did you say?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just said that Suzuka is going to get fat and plump if she keeps this up.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was asked about a leaked monologue.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m a little embarrassed to tell it like it is, so I blured it out.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kk. Don’t say that! I’ve been feeling a little overweight lately….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really? You look the same to my eyes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m absolutely sure I’ve gained weight. I definitely gained weight. I gained a lot of fat because I was lazy and didn’t want to go to school. By the way, are you okay with me gaining weight?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m probably fine with it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because I didn’t fall in love with her because of her body or anything like that. I like what’s inside, and that’s why I’m spending time with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I’m worried about her health if she gets fat and bloated, so I’ll give her a vague answer.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll love you no matter what! Shouldn’t you say something like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In my opinion, Suzuka’s current structure is a doozy. I won’t say such a cliche thing!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s terrible. Then I’m going to say it too! If Yuki gets fat, I’ll be a little uncomfortable!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She becomes a bit self-conscious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not that I don’t like her, it’s that I think she likes me a little too much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a foul play, isn’t it? ……</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ouch! Why did you peck me on the forehead!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It was just a random thing.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, you didn’t do it by accident, did you? Tell me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Whoa. Calm down, you ate too much. Right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m totally ……. But I don’t think it was the first time we had grilled meat together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We often went out to eat together occasionally with our families.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I think we ate together quite a bit when we were in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, we have never had yakiniku together. We often went to family restaurants together when we were studying for exams.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“There are so many firsts in this world. I can’t survive if I worry about such things. Is Suzuka going to write something like “anniversary” on her calendar every time something happens?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ha-ha, I won’t go that far.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, when was the next anniversary?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it college entrance day?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes.”</p>


<p class="calibre4">It was spring, but the night wind was a little chilly as Suzuka and I made our way back to our new home.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We heard an unfamiliar clattering sound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was the sound of a lock being opened, reminding us that we had just moved in.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m home. Yuki, you’re going to take a bath, right? I’ll go heat it up~”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll get the shampoo and stuff ready.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okkay.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I watch Suzuka leave, I find a plastic bag with shampoo and other things in it, and take out the things I might use from inside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took out face wash, shampoo, conditioner, body soap, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I took them out and brought them to the bathroom, arranging them in an easy-to-use position.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After a few moments, the bath was heated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I asked her to put a plastic bag on my injured hand and went to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sat down on the new bath chair and waited for Suzuka to wash my head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Normally, after putting on the plastic bag, she would come with me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry to keep you waiting! I didn’t want to get wet, so I changed into shorts.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. Well, it’s not my parents’ house, so it won’t look strange if you change into shorts.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right? No~, to be honest, it was a hassle to keep my clothes dry when I was washing Yuki’s body.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I would have been happy if you wore a swimsuit instead of shorts, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You lewd man. Well, okay, maybe next time?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Not today? You brought your swimsuit from home, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t have a stomach to show you today. Yes, turn your back!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was forced to turn my back to her, and she scrubbed my back with a sponge a little more forcefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My body was cleaned and I soaked comfortably in the bath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then, I realize that a serious problem is about to await me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“One bed…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A bed, still a semi-double bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Probably, it must be difficult to sleep close to each other …</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, whatever will be, will be.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought that at times.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I were on one bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Semi-double bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Not snug, but there is a gap of about 30 cm between me and Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still better than when we tried to sleep together on the bed in my room before.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Awkward.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We are so well aware that we are fidgeting on the bed with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But for some reason, Suzuka comes a little bit closer to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suzu, Suzuka?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Yuki. Isn’t it about time?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can feel the heat rising.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">I let myself go with it, and I try to get closer.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not nice to be unprepared.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m not stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I know it’s risky to do things without preparation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No. I’m prepared.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When did this happen?　</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, she went to the convenience store to get my spoon during the day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe that’s when…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suzuka …”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I fidgeted and turned my back on her, but then I turned to Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, not today!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka turns her back shyly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why in the world was she in an accepting mood just now?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did I do something wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Because after eating grilled meat, Yuki and I probably both smell of garlic in our mouths. …… Also, I have a large belly…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Oh.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So I’m sorry?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The smell of her mouth. The belly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And how cute is it when she turns her back on me?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wanted to attack her. I want to attack her without hesitation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So …… it is.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now that I can only use my left hand. So I don’t know if I can do it well, and I don’t want to look …… pathetic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t want to be a guy who can’t lead.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But, however.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Still, the fire that had flared up was not extinguished, and I could not sleep in agony.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The alarm rings amidst the chirping of sparrows.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I stop it and we both look at each other.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Did you sleep well, Yuki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I did for a little while. How about you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I could only sleep a little.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Pfft. What are we doing?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ha-ha-ha, I really don’t know what I’m doing.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I let my cheeks relax at the silly scene.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, we sit on the bed for a while, talking and enjoying ourselves.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Morning like this is not so bad.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, let’s go for another day…….</p>
