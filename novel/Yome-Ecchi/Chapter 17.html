<p class="calibre4">“Yes, lift up your arms.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As Suzuka told me to do, I raised my arms and rolled up the top of the bedclothes I was wearing and took it off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, I was asked to take it off.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And after taking it off, I put on a T-shirt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s very generous of you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re hurt. You deserve it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is that what this is about?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Come on, let’s have breakfast, shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I go to the kitchen with Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Last night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When my mother asked me, “Will you eat breakfast tomorrow?” I answered, “Probably” and that’s why it was usually prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Scrambled eggs, sausage, and a simple salad.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How many pieces of bread do you eat, Yuki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“One slice is all I need.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Two minutes of toasting the bread in the toaster.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A dinging sound informs me that it is done.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka was brewing coffee, so I thought I’d spread some margarine on the bread I’d toasted.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I cannot spread it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Spread margarine on bread.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What even a child can do easily is difficult.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re struggling, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sort of.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Somehow, I clumsily finish spreading the margarine on the bread.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, we sat in the dining room chairs and started a leisurely breakfast together.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s been a long time since I had breakfast with Suzuka like this. So, how were you when I was in the hospital?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I? Well, on the days I didn’t go to visit you, I went to hang out with friends. I felt like it was time to get some things ready, you know, clothes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Clothes?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki. We’re college students starting this spring, you know? Did you forget that until now we had uniforms, but from now on we have to spend our days in plain clothes?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…… Well, yeah, I guess so. Ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I sound dumb.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because of my hospitalization, I suddenly remembered something important that I had completely forgotten.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suit ……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really. You have to buy a suit to wear to the entrance ceremony.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It will be crowded at this time of the year. Well, as long as I don’t have to fix the bottoms or anything, I can get it done in time, but I don’t want to look sloppy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">If I wanted to make it in time, I can afford to make it in time.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, I intend to buy a suit that I can use for job hunting.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If that is the case, it would be better to have the suit adjusted to my size.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The interviewer’s first impression of you is your appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without it, there is no way to get a job offer. That’s what my father used to say.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’ll leave the house around nine o’clock.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I suppose. Thanks for the food. That’s it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was eating scrambled eggs and sausage with a fork, but with my non-dominant left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The plate is a mess.</p>
<p class="calibre4">All I could do was laugh bitterly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Like a child.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hah ……. The way forward. My broken right hand can’t even hold a pen, so I have to practice writing with my left hand to even keep up with my college lectures.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I see. Then, I will take the same lectures as Yuki and show you my notes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know what? We pay high tuition fees. Don’t worry about me, just take the lectures that interest you. If not you, I can ask to see the notes of someone who took the same lecture as me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m so excited. Isn’t it cold? I just wanted to take a lecture with Yuki. Aren’t you longing for it? To sit side by side with your lover and attend the same lecture.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The same lecture with Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There will surely be no conversation. Just attending a lecture together beside each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though that’s all there is to it, she seems to be somehow excited about it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can’t help it. I’ll take a few of the lectures.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, yeah, yeah. Shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Together, both of us are moving in earnest toward our new lives starting in the spring.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was while we were discussing this with our hearts filled with anticipation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mmm-hmm~”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re in a good mood.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s been a while since Yuki and I have been together.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Stop it. Don’t say cute things towards me by surprise.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe. Then, I’ll say more. I’m glad to be with you for the first time in a long time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka is happy without weighing herself down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She is highly aggressive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And perhaps because I have an injury on my right hand, which is my dominant hand, she is being very kind to me, which makes her even more aggressive.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Dangerous, dangerous. I forgot to take my pills.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We finished breakfast and relaxed together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I totally almost forgot to take my after-meal pills.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It still hurts like normal when the painkillers wear off…….</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry? Because you protected me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I told you not to apologize. How many times do I have to tell you that that was not your fault, no matter what you think?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As a result of protecting Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I got hurt.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How can anyone not feel sorry in a normal way?</p>

<p class="calibre4">You don’t have to apologize to me, okay? I’m sorry, but here’s what I’m going to do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I just tell her not to apologize, her apology will become nothing but a festering mess.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, if you have any trouble, just let me know, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, for the time being, bring me some water. I’ve come all this way. Let me take this opportunity of being spoiled by Suzuka, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Let’s rely on her in moderation, shall we?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I told Suzuka with a deliberate smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The cheerful Suzuka simply nodded her head.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, after pouring down the pills with the water I was given, I felt an itch in my ear, so I took out an ear bud from the shelf.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No. Stop.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t use my dominant hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It is not impossible, but it would be bad if I scratched the inside of my ears.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Besides, ear cleaning itself is not a necessary act, if you ask me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll do it for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suddenly, a voice calls out to me from behind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, don’t stand behind me. It startles me, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, sorry. Come on, Yuki. Come here?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As she speaks, Suzuka sits on the floor, gently slapping her own thighs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In short, I’m allowed to lie down there.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“……Excuse me for disturbing you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What do you mean you’re sorry to bother me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She giggles at the strange mannerisms.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I use her thighs as a pillow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Small, but still soft, and the left half of my face is happy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m asking you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I was asked to do it. So let’s get started, shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The sensation of going in slowly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I heard a rustling sound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m not ticklish, but I’m filled with ticklishness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I never dreamed that the day would come when Suzuka would do this to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I fall silent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka talks to me softly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m a little embarrassed. I can’t believe I’m doing this with Yuki.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know, it’s really not fair of you to react like that, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The happy time that follows with a little chatting goes by very quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">From the feel of it, it was like the final touch, and she was already playing with my ears.</p>

<p class="calibre4">And finally…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Whew!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A gentle breeze blows in my ear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It tickles, but it feels good nonetheless.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay, that’s it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Lap pillow. Good ……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I let out an exclamation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I guessed that my face had been broken up so much that Suzuka slightly loosened the corners of her mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re a spoiled child, aren’t you? Yes, move over, move over.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was forced to quit the lap pillow a little too forcefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wanted to savor it a little longer, though, didn’t I?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It can’t be helped.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I try to leave Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I said I had to do the opposite, I said I moved out of the way, do you feel like I shouldn’t?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yeah. Did you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What shall we do?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Please ……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I sink my face into her thighs, using honorifics that I don’t use much with Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be helped. Let’s get started, shall we?”</p>
