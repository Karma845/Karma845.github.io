<h1 class="single_title">Chapter 32 &#8211; A Present Full of Love</h1>


<p class="calibre4">It is pitch-dark outside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The sound of joyful voices echoing in the darkness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It is a party for the Outdoor Club, which has successfully completed its preparations and sold itself as a recruiting party.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, the people gathered here are all adults who cannot drink alcohol.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although the age of adulthood has been lowered, it is still a rule in this country that drinking and smoking must be done after the age of 20.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, there are some who break the rule, but at least it is not broken here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">According to Yashiro, the senior members want to keep the activities clean with the motto, “If you talk and talk without alcohol, you can get along with each other.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yo, Yuki. Come with me for a bit. I’ll show you how great it is to drink coffee outdoors.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“The others didn’t show any interest?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He invited me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was sure that was probably because everyone else was so reluctant to join him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“As expected of my junior. I’m a pitiful senior. Come hang out with me for a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, yes. I understand.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The two of us spread out a small table and chair at a little distance from each other and sat down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Coffee bean grinder? Yashiro-senpai set the coffee grinder to grind the coffee beans into a fine powder.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yashiro-senpai. Can’t you just use instant coffee?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you say such a terrible thing casually, don’t you? Oh, no. You know, this is what makes it so much fun, right? Go ahead, grind the coffee beans.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He gave me a coffee grinder to grind the coffee beans.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I grab the handle of the grinder and turned it. It’s was quite awkward, since I could only use one hand now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even so, isn’t it a little uncomfortable to grind?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? I use it every time I go camping. When I bought it, it grounded the beans much smoother.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why don’t you buy a new one?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It still works, doesn’t it? I bought it with my first salary as a part-time worker. I’m very attached to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He bought it with his first paycheck from his part-time job.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even if it is a little rickety, there is a certain elegance in continuing to use it until it breaks.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That spirit. Let me learn from you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s disgusting. You’re not the type to talk like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, well, well. People change, don’t they?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then Yashiro-senpai put the beans I had grinded on the filter and brewed coffee using the hot water that was boiling on the tabletop.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Here you go. It’s hot, so be careful.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">With that said, I sipped the freshly brewed coffee offered to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt the bitterness in my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not as bitter as instant…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you noticed? That’s right. Unlike instant powder, coffee made with ground beans is not overly bitter unless it is made by someone who is not very good at making it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">And the aroma is good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Unlike instant coffee, the aroma that penetrated my nose was lighter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There is no sugar, milk, or anything else in this coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I used to avoid black coffee because it is bitter and not sweet, but with this I can drink it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition, even though it is spring, the nights are still cool.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Combined with the coolness, the warm coffee made my heart warm and fuzzy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s nice, isn’t it? Drinking coffee outside.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right? Do you want to drink it black all the way through? There’s sugar and milk, just in case.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to drink it black all the way through.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The sky is as black as the coffee.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Small lights shining in dots.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Coffee tastes even better than usual when you drink it while looking at it and talking with your senpai.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, man~. You’re a stiff, you’re married.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Married early. The heat may cool off fast. Take care of your wife, will you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve heard that if you get married too early, you’re more likely to get divorced. Even if they don’t tell me, I’ll be careful not to be attached to her.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yeah. Don’t let her fall out of love with you too soon. I can see that you’re really in love with her when you say things like that so that she won’t get attached to you too soon. Well, your family doesn’t have a lot of money, does it? What about rings and stuff?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I bought wedding rings.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We put it away for safekeeping, but neither of us wear it on our fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Basically, we decided that if we had to talk about it, and if we were asked, we would tell them that we were married.</p>
<p class="calibre4">However, if we are not asked, we are not going to tell them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We don’t want to be questioned if we wear wedding rings and are married.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now, if I tell my senpai that I bought wedding rings, he will wonder where I got the money for them. I should say, “I didn’t buy any wedding rings.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t buy any wedding rings.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, what about the engagement ring?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Not yet, either.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s a student marriage. But you should still buy her a proper one someday, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We do have wedding rings, but I don’t have an engagement ring.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I don’t have an engagement ring.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can buy it for her if I use lottery money, but …</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll definitely buy it for her someday. Firmly with my own hands.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s a lovey-dovey couple indeed. Well, your wife’s birthday is coming up. I know you can’t buy her an engagement ring or a wedding ring, but are you thinking of getting her anything?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka’s birthday is coming up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since we won the lottery, I can buy anything I want to buy.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">But … I came upon an idea when I was talking to my senpai.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Senpai…, you said the other day that you were short on staff, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thus I started working toward Suzuka’s birthday.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka Side</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Haa……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was slouched in the living room, letting my body rest on the table.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I had to describe me in one word right now, I’d say I’m in a depressed mood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because, because … Yuki hasn’t been very open with me lately.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Clatter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The front door opened, probably because Yuki had come home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He clearly looked tired as he said.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Welcome home. You want to take a bath, don’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I help him with the bath, which has become a routine for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While doing so, I ask him why he is home late.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is probably the fourth time I’ve done this, but I can’t help but ask…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why did you suddenly start working part-time?　Couldn’t you have waited until your hand was healed too?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I don’t understand well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I really don’t understand why Yuki suddenly started working part-time.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because we don’t need the money.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Besides, it would have been better to wait until his hand healed, but for some reason he was in a hurry to start working part-time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? Well, it’s just a whim.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh~, really~?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I said so, but I was in a strange mood.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No way, he doesn’t want to be with me, so he’s working part-time to kill time!?</p>
<p class="calibre4">I washed Yuki’s head with a pessimistic look on my face.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You scrub a little too hard. What if I go bald when I’m young?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, I’m sorry. By the way, were you busy today?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m just tired from doing something I’m not used to doing.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. Then, after taking the bath, you’ll go to bed?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess so. I have a first period lecture tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then after Yuki got out of the bath, I got cleaned up too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We both got ready for bed and went to bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Hehe, even though I’m used to it, I’m happy to sleep with Yuki~.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But, but, but…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Sooo, sooo…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why are you suddenly working part-time and working hard until you’re exhausted …?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I just got into bed and poked Yuki’s cheek, who fell asleep right away.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m not sure if Yuki is interested in me anymore… No, I somehow know that’s not true, but come on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I know that’s not true. I’m not sure what he’s trying to do.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Haa… I’m going to sleep too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I meditated and let sleepiness take over my body.</p>


<p class="calibre4">Morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t have a first period lecture, but I get up early to make breakfast for Yuki.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Today it’s French toast.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I bought honey and good bread.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I was making the French toast, Yuki came into the kitchen.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning~ Today’s French toast, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ohhh. You’re as enthusiastic as ever today, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right? Let’s eat.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Breakfast for two.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yuki finished eating and got ready to go to the university.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m off.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Clang.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Seeing Yuki leave, I closed the front door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… Boo. It’s my birthday today and you didn’t say anything to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was anxiously waiting for it now, but he didn’t even say ‘Happy Birthday’ to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I am not sure if it might be me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m not sure if Yuki has really given up on me…</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, no, that can’t be true.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There’s nothing to be dissatisfied with…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Married life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Isn’t it still unsatisfactory for Yuki that they don’t have any night activities?</p>
<p class="calibre4">But Yuki said he won’t touch her until his right hand heals, so maybe not.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t get it! Yuki baka!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was thrashing around on the bed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then I went to the university because I had a lecture from the second period.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t have any lectures with Yuki today, so we didn’t talk at the university and came home as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yuki had until 3rd period and I had until 5th period.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He should have come home before me, so he should have said “Happy Birthday” to me, right?</p>
<p class="calibre4">But maybe…</p>
<p class="calibre4">With my chest buzzing, I fearfully open the door leading to the living room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Pow!</p>
<p class="calibre4">A loud sound descended on me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suzuka. Happy birthday!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh, ah, eh?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Surprised by the cracker that was suddenly sounded, I looked at the table in the living room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, what’s going on, there was a feast lined up that had been bought from somewhere.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you in the morning when you were expecting me to come all the way and wish you a happy birthday. I just wanted to surprise you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“BAKA! Yuki Baka!!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I smacked Yuki.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because, because, because I’m so happy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t expect to be celebrated like this, so I can’t help it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Fidgeting, he handed me a present that had come out of his pocket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered what was inside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I watched Yuki’s reaction as he handed it to me shyly and opened the parcel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Inside was a necklace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was a cute, reasonably priced, youth-oriented necklace that would look good on me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Thank you so much! I’m so happy!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It makes me happy to hear you say that. It makes all my hard work worth it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s why I’ve been working part-time lately. I also wanted to buy you something nice with the lottery money. But I wanted to give you a present with the money I earned myself.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…What’s that? I’m sobbing. Ugh, oh, no, I’m starting to cry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, come on. Is it that much?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That much? You can’t use your right hand, but you started a part-time job. I thought it might be because you don’t want to be with me. I’m such an idiot for thinking that…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I hugged Yuki while crying.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I also expressed my feelings to Yuki, who went out of his way to give me a gift on my birthday, not with the money we won in the lottery, but with the money he earned himself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hehehe~, I love you!”</p>
