<h1 class="single_title">Chapter 26 &#8211; Until My Right Hand Heals…</h1>


<p class="calibre4">“Good morning……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka came to the living room, straightening her slightly messy hair.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So the moving process is almost over and she was napping on the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was also sleeping until just a few minutes ago.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Familiarity is scary, isn’t it? I could sleep even though Yuki was next to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was so sleepy that I had no choice but to get into bed with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Familiarity is a scary thing, and what can I say, I was able to sleep normally.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Personally, I’m afraid I’ve gotten used to it in situations where I haven’t crossed the line.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, the fridge we got is starting to get cold, so why don’t we go buy a few things?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, let’s go.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In no time at all, we both went to the supermarket to finish shopping, just as we did yesterday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m a miserable cook and Suzuka has told me not to cook, so I’ve been quiet except when buying ready-made meals.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now, what’s going to be for dinner today?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s curry today! If you don’t like it, I can make something else, but curry is fine, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Curry is fine. I’ll have you make it for me. I don’t ask for luxuries.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What about the meat? We can buy beef, pork, and chicken, we could freeze them all.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Considering our budget, we’ll go with pork or chicken.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">One thing I learned when I shopped at the supermarket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Beef is expensive, and if we ate only beef, we would quickly exceed our food budget.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So, I think it is a good idea to save the beef.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If we use beef all the time, we will soon exceed our food budget. Then, we’ll have chicken, which is healthier for us.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Maybe it’s because we talked about her fat belly yesterday, but she is very health-conscious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I think it’s good that she is a little bit concerned about it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, I’m going to put my skills to good use for my beloved Yuki!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then Suzuka finished shopping as usual and went to work on making curry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I liked the way she was cooking, and I found myself looking at her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, Yuki. Taste it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She handed me a little bit of curry on a plate and asked me to taste it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without any way to refuse, I checked the taste of the curry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt that the sauce was a little thin, so I said without hesitation.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You could use a little more roux, couldn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I knew it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She placed the remaining curry roux on the top&nbsp; and melted it so it wouldn’t ball up on the top.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While waiting for it to be ready in the living room, I picked up a rag to wipe the table top and happily spin the ladle around while I managed to wet the rag with one hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, hey, Yuki. If it wasn’t me and you had started living with someone else, what would you have said about the taste of the curry you just tasted?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We have different tastes, and I think I would have refrained from saying. I think I would have said, “This is fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You are surprisingly reserved, aren’t you, Yuki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I suppose you can say that about yourself. But, however, I don’t hold back with you, who I have known for a long time. So I had to say it honestly.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, me, too… I won’t hold back. You’ve been staring at me since a while ago, are you having fun?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m having fun, I mean, it’s nice to see you in an apron…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe, yeah?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel nothing but an unreserved relationship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe it’s because it’s me and Suzuka that we start living together like this.</p>

<p class="calibre4">About 45 minutes after starting to cook the curry.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We started to eat the curry without forgetting to cook the rice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Itadakimasu. …It’s delicious. It’s better than the curry my mother makes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hehehe, I’m flattered. Well, I’ll have some too.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, what about laundry and cleaning? Now that we’re getting a sense of life, we have to make a decision, don’t we? Well, if Suzuka is in charge of the cooking, then I’ll do it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then I’ll do the cooking. Yuki is in charge of other household chores. Well, that is, after your hand is healed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. When my hand heals, I’ll get to work, and until then, I’m counting on you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, yeah. I really like that Yuki is so disciplined like that. By the way, Yuki. Did you do something bad to me when you woke up before me after sleeping?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka asked fidgetily.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I woke up first, I honestly wanted to touch her chest and various other parts of her body…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Therefore, I will say it clearly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I touched you a little bit. I won’t say which part.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki ecchi…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her voice is a little sulky and quiet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was overcome by the cuteness of Suzuka, who was still new to me, and I asked her, too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kuh, it can’t be helped. I’m a man. You know, Suzuka, you didn’t do anything to me while I was sleeping, did you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka is a terrible liar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She makes a face that says I must have slept with her first and she must have touched me in some way, so I attack her a little.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m not afraid of naughty girls, so tell me the truth. What did you touch while I was sleeping?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Eh, uh, you know…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was a little shy, and her eyes looked down.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Really?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh. Gently over your clothes, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">What a cute bride.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her initial and fearless behavior really sticks out to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, what did you think?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t make me say it! If you’re so mean to me, I won’t help you in the bathtub!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It seems I teased her a little too much.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the end, I ate the curry with a big gulp and a big mouthful.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ngugu. Well, I forgive you. But you were mean to me, and even if I wanted to do that thing, I wouldn’t let you do it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh-ho. So you mean you’re going to make a move on me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Damn it! Baka! I really won’t let you do it anymore! I’m not going to let you have it until you get down on your knees and say please mercifully to me!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wasn’t the one who first asked on the bed yesterday…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I mean, the fact that she would let me do it if I got down on my knees and asked her, she really is a little bit too fond of me, don’t you think?</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the night of the day we exchanged that she wouldn’t let us do it until I got down on my knees, I wanted Suzuka to wash my body as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As usual, I was going to ask Suzuka to wash my body, but…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“S-Su, Suzuka-san?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was so surprised that I called Suzuka as “san”.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because, as she said yesterday, she came to wash my body wearing a bathing suit.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She is wearing a one-piece but a little bit hot black swimsuit that suits her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Aren’t I cute? If you get down on your knees and ask me, I’ll let you touch me as much as you want.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“K-ku, I don’t want to get down on my knees because that would be a weird memory for me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ahahaha, Yuki unexpectedly has a fairy tale-like personality. You should get down on your knees, right? Right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I looked at my right hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A cast that will come off in a month.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To be honest, my hands probably made it so that Suzuka would definitely take the lead.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t want to show her how pathetic I was at our first time together, so I declared to Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Only after my right hand is healed. Until then, you must be patient.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. I see. So you don’t want me to see your pathetic appearance. But you were mean to me when we were eating curry earlier, so I can be mean to you too, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She hugged me on my left arm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she said deliberately said.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know, it would be a lot easier if I got down on your knees, right? It’s funny that I should say this after doing it myself, but this is embarrassing.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m embarrassed. Please quit. I really can’t control myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s too cunning to say you’re embarrassed and blush so much, even though it’s a habit you made yourself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, I want to get down on my knees. I really want to get down on my knees.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But I’m a man.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Until I can use my right hand, I’ll hold back and show her!!!</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t lick me, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kuuuh~~~~. Yuki is trying to hold back so much, it’s so cute, I might die. The sight of Yuki trying to hold back … is really nice …”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked so pleased with her eyes shining brightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As expected, she said I was cute for holding back, and she will not do something a little lewd like this in the future, will she?</p>
