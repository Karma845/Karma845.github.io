<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p class="calibre4">I talk to Suzuka, who woke up to the sound of birds chirping.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, good morning. Ehehe~. I had a great birthday last night, didn’t I? Thanks, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But I’m sorry. I think I made you feel uneasy at the part-time job. I’ll be careful next time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Last night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka, who didn’t quite understand the meaning of working part-time while my right hand was not healed, told me that she was anxious about it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Come to think of it, I would be anxious too if she did something similar.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought I would be careful next time and apologized.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. I was anxious, so it’s okay if you hug me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Although she was in a good mood and wanted to be hugged, I told her not to be silly and gave her a light chop on the top of her head</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What are you going to do today? In my opinion, I think we could make out like this…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Saturday.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I asked Suzuka what she was going to do since there were no lectures today.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmmm, oh, that’s right. As expected, it’s about time to show up at least once to our mothers, right? Yesterday, my mom sent me a message saying that if you’re not busy, it’s about time for us to come home to at least show our faces~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“That’s true.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Me and Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It has been a little more than two weeks since we started living together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought it was time for us to visit our parents and give them an update on what’s going on, so they suggested that we do.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a short train ride to my parents’ house from where we live.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, let’s go to your place first.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">My home would come later.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We decided to go to her parents’ house, the Mita family.</p>
<p class="calibre4">By the way, I had already informed them that we were coming over.</p>



<p class="calibre4">“I’m home!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka opened the front door with a bang to let everyone in the house know that we had arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, we hear the sound of running.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then one of them walked past Suzuka and came to hug me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Otoo-san! Hehehe, long time no see~!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was a girl of about 4 years old who hugged me tightly.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And her face resembled Suzuka’s.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Apparently, me and Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We got married early, but it seems that our children grow up fast too.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How can a girl who looks like she has Suzuka’s blood in her veins not be our child?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, actually, it’s not.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s been a while, Yuka-chan. But I’m not Yuka-chan’s father, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehh~, if you married Onee-chan, Onee-chan would be my mother and Yuki-onii-chan would be my father, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s true, too. It can’t be helped. I’ll become Yuka-chan’s father.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I did it~ Father! I love you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yuka happily hugged me and pushed me up against her face with a gleeful smile.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yes, this girl who looks a lot like Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She is actually her younger sister.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I greet my father-in-law while being hugged by Yuka, who adores me as her goofy father.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s been a while.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, I’m glad to see you’re doing well.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then we made small talk with her parents.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And when that settled down, my father-in-law asked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“By the way, are you free this Saturday and Sunday?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yes. Me and Suzuka, we both have no plans… Is something wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. Mother.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, then there is no problem.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her parents, pleased to see us face to face, speak happily to me and Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We’re going on a little trip. I’ll leave it to you to take care of Yuka.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">They went on a trip like that.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Me and Suzuka were left behind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Yuka, Suzuka’s younger sister.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe. Father! Play~. Play with me~! Not my sister, but my mother!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Apparently, although we got married early, we also experienced parenthood early.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thus began the family game of me, Suzuka, and Yuka-chan.<br class="header" /><br class="header" /><br class="header" /></p>
<p class="calibre4">After seeing off my father-in-law and mother-in-law, we were relaxing in the living room of the Mita house when Yuka-chan approached Suzuka and happily played a prank on her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mother! B***s!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka is burrowed into her clothes and suctioned by the innocent Yuka-chan, who doesn’t even answer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I managed to pull her off and began to gently scold Yuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Even if you suck on my b*****s, they won’t produce, so I’m quitting sucking!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe. I know~. I made something at kindergarten the other day &ndash; I want to show it to you, so wait for me, I’ll bring it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yuka-chan innocently laughed and went to get the things she made in kindergarten.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Laughing in a dazed manner, Suzuka, seeing the exchange earlier, spoke to me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Do you want to suck too Yuki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I’ll take your word for it…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I approached her deliberately and her face turned bright red and she gently pushed me away.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m just kidding, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As usual, she was teasing me, but she was weak when I countered back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This kind of thing is cute and makes me want to be mean to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I know. But is it no good?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, when I say no, I mean no, but … I know, I know. Just a little bit, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She lifted up her clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wait for her now and then, but she’s turning red, and I laugh to my great satisfaction.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m just kidding. Don’t be serious, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kuu~. Yuki’s kidding! Is it okay? If you do that, I’m going to seduce Yuki, who is also saying that I’ll endure until your right hand is healed~!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Kku, I think it’s possible, but as a man, I want to stick to my decision until the end…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Otoo-san and Okaa-san are sweet!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yuka-chan, who had returned before I knew it, pointed a finger at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In response, we both chuckled and said to Yuka in a deliberate manner.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, that’s right. Me and her are in love with each other, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right? Because me and Yuki are super lovey-dovey!”</p>
