<h1 class="single_title">Chapter 25 &#8211; Leaving the Bed Aside</h1>


<p class="calibre4">I forgot about the bed for the time being and resumed tidying up the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Just assembling the desk and before I knew it, it was lunchtime.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I left the room and went to the convenience store to do some shopping.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not a convenience store, it’s a supermarket. They don’t have any food.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Instead of a convenience store where you can shop easily, we go to a supermarket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It costs too much money to buy everything at a convenience store for all the various items we should buy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After the graduation trip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I thought carefully about how to spend the money.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As a result, we decided not to be extravagant. We decided to live as normally as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As long as there is no way to get money other than by winning the lottery, we will lead a normal life, not necessarily a budget life, but a normal life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The monthly living expenses were also decided.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Specifically, we have decided to spend 30,000 yen per person per month on food.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s about 1,000 yen a day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It is not strictly affordable, but it is a reasonable amount of money. Therefore, I used the figures that came up when I looked up the cost of food for a college student living alone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since I have never lived alone, I don’t have a good idea of the appropriate cost of living, so I’m going to work out the details a little bit from now on.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“For now, we’re going to stock up on cup noodles and …beverages. What else do we need?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While I was pondering, Suzuka, walking beside me, spoke to me, and I thought of a response.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The first thing we should buy is food…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Retort curry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, that sounds good!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ease of use is a good advantage.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That being said, I do intend to cook for myself, but it’s tough to cook every day.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fact is, cooking all three meals is definitely a hassle, and I don’t think we’ll be able to do it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Come to think of it, I haven’t been to the supermarket with Yuki since we were little.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, we went to a commercial supermarket for shopping during the school festival, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess that’s true when you put it that way. It was at the school festival, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was suddenly nostalgic about the past.</p>
<p class="calibre4">At the festival, Suzuka and I served fruit punch in our class.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Since we could only use ready-made fruit punch white balls, we used frozen ones that were sold at a commercial supermarket.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I were forced to go to the supermarket to buy them.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I heard that the senior members of the soccer team were going to have a bake sale at the outdoor club. Oh, we’re at the supermarket, but don’t buy any raw food, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, the fridge isn’t coming until tomorrow, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We went through the automatic doors of the supermarket and started shopping.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka and I returned to the front door of our new home with shopping bags in our hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m still not used to taking out the key from my pocket and going inside.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Phew~. Now, after we eat the lunch we got, we have to clean up!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry, if I could use both hands, I could do it a little quicker.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t worry about it. Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No spoons!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I can’t use a fork or a spoon because my right hand is injured and I have to eat with my left hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We just started moving.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The tableware I bought by mail order in advance will arrive tomorrow …</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, why don’t you just buy a plastic spoon from a convenience store, or something that comes with one?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, that’s so boring. Yuki has been so indifferent lately, so I thought I’d feed you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You’re such a person, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I still can’t get used to Suzuka, who no longer has any hesitation in spoiling me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, it’s not that I don’t like it, I just can’t get used to it, but I almost doubt that the girl in front of me is really Suzuka, my childhood friend.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hoho. Does that mean you prefer the childhood version of me?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, it’s not that…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, let’s give it a try, shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka opens the lid of the lunch box, splits it open, picks up the rice, and brings it to my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">” … I see.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Childhood friend version.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why do I have to do this for you? She seems to have the cold attitude.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If we hadn’t become a couple, she would have been like this when she was feeding me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hurry up and eat.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She put the chopsticks that had picked up the rice to my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had no choice but to take a bite and put it in my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wanted to say I was satisfied now that I had finished chewing, but she didn’t pause before bringing the food to my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ahhhh. Why do I have to do this to Yuki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She complains.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If she had been a childhood friend, she would have definitely said this too.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“… You’re a good actor.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Right? Alright, I don’t want to waste time on food, let’s go to the convenience store and get some spoons.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before I could say I was going, Suzuka was running to a nearby convenience store.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In the meantime, I decided to play a little prank on Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“She didn’t take the key. Okay, let’s close the door.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I locked the front door.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A few minutes later, I heard the front door moving and then the intercom rang, so I opened the front door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Locking the door behind me, isn’t that terrible?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Bad. I’m sorry. It was just a passing impulse.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">” I’m not giving you, Mr. Mean, the big spoon I got while buying dessert, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She stood in the doorway and said in a disgruntled manner.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I knows she wasn’t actually that angry, but I deliberately apologized to her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">” I said I was sorry. See?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you think you can get me to forgive you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I’ll buy you food next time.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I decided to pay for the food.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Although it is not an extravagant amount of money, I said I would buy Suzuka a meal.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, yes. I like your spirit. I’ll forgive you this time!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka went back to the room from the entrance with a big smile on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, after watching that Suzuka entered our apartment, I closed the front door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a housewarming party. Let’s go Yakiniku today.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Housewarming party. Let’s eat big! Oh, I’m not usually mad at you, and you don’t have to buy me a drink, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">This move was a good one, not a bad one.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s definitely something to celebrate.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After eating lunch, we steadily proceeded to clean up the room, looking forward to the grilled meat.</p>
