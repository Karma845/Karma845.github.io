<p class="calibre4">“Oh, long time no see. Is your hand okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I get to the meeting place, I meet Tanaka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I haven’t seen him in a while because I couldn’t keep my promise to hang out with him because of my injury.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m getting used to it. Is there anyone else here besides Tanaka?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Miki went to the bathroom. You see her bag?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A bag that was apparently a woman’s bag was placed at his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Probably, Tanaka must have come to this meeting place with his girlfriend, Kaneda-san.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Well, I am similar to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I just went to the meeting place first, and Suzuka just stopped at a convenience store in the station to buy candy and stuff.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Spring Break. How’s it going?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I went on a date with Miki and hung out with friends, so money is tight. You’re not in need of money, are you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thanks to the lottery, the state of not being in need of money is becoming the norm.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I were normal, I would be struggling with money like Tanaka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I think about it, it would be bad if I don’t take care of my financial well-being…….</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thanks to being with Suzuka? I’m not loose like that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Phew. Here you go. I’ve been waiting for you. Ah, long time no see, Tanaka-kun.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Long time no see, Mita-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ever since school stopped, Suzuka has been going out with her girlfriends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Usually all of them called her Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The only people who called her Mita-san were the boys in her class, so she was a little bitter because it had been a long time since she had been called that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sorry to keep you waiting~. Well, it was crowded even at night.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kaneda-san came back, probably from the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She is the one Tanaka calls Miki.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can clearly see that the two of them, who had quickly developed into a relationship, are not only still going on as usual, but are getting more and more heated.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Tanaka is sending me pictures of their dates.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s been a long time, Kaneda-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, Shindou-kun, how is your hand?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’d say I’m doing okay, but I’m still getting used to being one-handed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. Oh, Suzuka. Give me a piece of candy, too, please!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When Kaneda-san saw Suzuka eating the candy she had bought at a convenience store, Kaneda-san asked her to have some.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Why is it that high school girls are creatures who exchange food so casually with each other?</p>
<p class="calibre4">A little while later, the rest of us gathered safely.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We chose an amusement park as our graduation trip destination.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We will take an overnight bus, arrive in the morning, have fun at the amusement park, and stay overnight at the accommodation. The next day, we will have fun again and take the night bus back home again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s the kind of trip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Incidentally, we are not stingy when it comes to night buses, and we choose spacious three-row seats.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We got on the bus.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The bus headed for our destination after a bumpy ride with many people our age.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a few rest stops along the way, we arrived at the hotel in the morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We could not check in, but we were told that we could leave our luggage at the hotel.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We left our luggage at the hotel and headed for the amusement park before the opening performance.</p>

<p class="calibre4">We finally arrived at the amusement park.</p>
<p class="calibre4">For starters, we went to a section with a townscape that imitated the world of a certain magical fantasy movie.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wow, it’s amazing. Oh, let’s all take a picture together!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kaneda’s words were met with no opposition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Taking a commemorative photo in a place with scenery that would normally be unthinkable is a heartening experience.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Everyone lined up for the photo.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When taking the picture, I secretly see Tanaka and Kaneda-san holding hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I also see Yamaguchi, who, like me, is a nerd and whose good looks are ruined by being a nerd.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yamaguchi watches me closely as if to say, “I saw something interesting.” and then we face each other and creep closer to Tanaka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, you’ve got some nerve sneaking up on someone and holding hands with them, don’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Shindou is right. Tanaka. You’re here to have fun with everyone, but that’s not right!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I just did it on a whim.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">He was pressed and made Tanaka flinch, and he played with him in a good way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The same goes for Kaneda, “I know you want to flirt with Tanaka.” So, what do you usually do? I’ll let you off the hook if you tell me! The girls played with him in a similar manner.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Shindou is also dating Mita-san, so don’t just blame me, attack Shindo too!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sato, the representative of the “good guys,” clearly stated.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Shindou-san and Mita-san don’t show off, so of course they’re good, right? They draw the line properly and don’t bother others.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s right. As Sato says, I don’t show off, so unlike you, I don’t care! Next time you start flirting here, I’m going to ask you to buy me something, okay? This is a trip for everyone to have fun together. Don’t flirt with each other in a weird way!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Sato and Yamaguchi were absolutely right.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is a graduation trip for everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Forget about it and flirt with girlfriends? Of course that’s impossible, right?</p>

<p class="calibre4">Well, Tanaka must have understood that, and I don’t think it will happen again after this one time.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll let you off the hook this time. Here, let’s go to the next one. Next.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I took charge and let them resume walking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We walked along the town, enjoying the magical fantasy world that decorated the streets.</p>
<p class="calibre4">On the way, although it was still too early to buy souvenirs, we came across a souvenir shop, which we couldn’t resist entering.</p>

<p class="calibre4">” Oh, look, look, wands for sale! You boys love this kind of thing. Don’t you have to buy one?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Miyamoto-san, one of the girls, came to toy with us boys.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rather than being made fun of, we looked at each other and foolishly took our wands and pretended to use magic.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The girls were laughing and giggling at the sight of such a strange scene.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ha-ha-ha, what’s that?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s creepy! But it’s so funny, it’s bad!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ha-ha-ha, really, no. That’s not fair.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I can’t stand to laugh, either. Ppp, ppp. Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We were very happy that we were able to get a good laugh out of them.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh, damn. Coming to a place like this with both guys and girls is so much fun, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not often that I get to hang out with girls, except at the launch of the school festival, so it’s a fresh feeling and a lot of fun.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We went to the souvenir shop and had a good time looking at and picking up the items on sale.</p>

<p class="calibre4">As we left the gift shop, I noticed that Suzuka had popcorn in a bag hanging around her neck.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hehehe, it looks so good, I bought it! Let’s eat it together, shall we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She opens the bag of popcorn and everyone grabs a handful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">One isn’t enough, so we buy more, and we all chow down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can only use one hand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was holding something with my left hand, so I couldn’t pick up the popcorn.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Here, you eat too. I’m not going to let you take advantage of the fact that you can’t use your hands and have Mita-san feed you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Yamaguchi, a handsome guy who was too much of a nerd to be a popular guy, threw a piece of popcorn into my mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt humiliated to be fed by such a guy.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s just plain weird that I had to eat it out of your hand. How do you take responsibility for that?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh? I just made sure you didn’t naturally flirt with Mita-san.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was joking and pretended to be in a fight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Naturally, I had no intention of getting into a real fight, so in the middle of the fight, Yamaguchi brought the popcorn to my mouth again, deliberately embarrassed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. I just think you’re so cute, don’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ooooh. It was so creepy, it sent chills down my spine.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t get it. I mean, is it my imagination that Miyamoto-san looks awfully satisfied?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Miyamoto-san is famous for being an open corrupt girl.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was kind of pleased to see the exchange between me and Yamaguchi.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She was talking to Suzuka in an excited manner, “Which one of them do you think is the aggressive one?” I feel like it’s really bad when she is talking to Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she can couple in real life, she seems like too serious a person to be in serious trouble.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">To Miyamoto-san, “Yuki is a sloppy guy, isn’t he a receiver?” and I want you to quit responding to normal conversations.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Really, Miyamoto-san’s eyes are stubborn and scary ……</p>
