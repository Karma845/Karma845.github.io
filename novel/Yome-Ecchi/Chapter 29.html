<h1 class="single_title">Chapter 29 &#8211; Somewhere Along the Way, it Became the Norm.</h1>


<p class="calibre4">“Well, why are you married?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess you became more passionate than I thought you would.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After the university guidance was over, Yashiro-senpai took me to a family restaurant, although it was a little late because of the club recruitment and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Well, I knew I was going to be asked a lot of questions, but they were tough ones.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know, you… I’m nothing to you and your childhood friend Mita-san! I felt like you had nothing to do with my childhood friend, Mita-san. I don’t know how long you’ve been friends with her…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh? You don’t want me to answer in depth why we got married or anything?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You want me to ask? I didn’t dare ask you that, did I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t want to go into details, so if you could do that for me…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t like it when people ask me things I don’t want to know. I’m going to ask you as much as you don’t want to hear. So, what’s it really like?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We became friends three months ago.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No, we have always been good friends, and it would be more accurate to say that we have changed the direction of our friendship.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was reassured by my senior’s words, “I’ll ask you as much as you don’t mind.” and opened my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We are good friends. If we weren’t, we wouldn’t be married.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m jealous. Mita-san, not Mita-san, Suzuka-san, she’s so cute.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I am happy to be praised for my petite and charming Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before I got married, I wasn’t at all happy when people said they were jealous of me and Suzuka being childhood friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Now, when people say they envy me for being childhood friends with Suzuka or that she’s cute, I turn up my nose and say, “You are, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You really have changed. Before, if someone had called her cute, you would have said she was just so-so or something like that.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“At that time, I just didn’t realize how attractive Suzuka was yet.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hah … Well, I’m still going to ask about Suzuka-san, but what happened to your hand? You said something about unhappiness.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“On the way home from a date with Suzuka. I was protecting her by holding her when a boy of elementary school age pushed her and this is what happened.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I said while looking at my right hand, which is soon to be freed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…Well, that’s that. I’m glad to see you’re doing well.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I already feel like I’m injured, so don’t worry so much about it, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">There is a reason why they were worried.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I was on the soccer team, I hurt my left leg.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no noticeable trauma, but the injured leg had developed a limp and I was unable to run, which is the lifeblood of an athlete.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could never regain my running ability, and scouts were not keeping a close eye on me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Pouring everything I had into soccer would only ruin my life plan.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That is why I abandoned soccer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yashiro-senpai knew this and was worried about my injury.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I see that too. Well, you said you’d join the outdoor club I created… What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m in.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve already got all the outdoor gear I need, so I’m going to be doing a lot of overnight events for very little money. Wouldn’t your wife be mad at you for leaving her behind and staying overnight?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Since Suzuka said she wanted to come in too, I don’t think that will be a problem.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, really? No~ because I want to leave the club to the world properly. I’m just happy to have more than one first-year student join.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Senpai who won’t refuse to join the club separately just because me and Suzuka are a married couple.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I thought he might turn me down because he didn’t want me to be seen flirting with her.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Thus, Suzuka and I became a member of the outdoor club created by Yashiro-senpai.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m planning a barbecue outside the day after tomorrow, if you’d like to come. Besides your wife, I’d appreciate it if you could bring some friends.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll talk to some people I know. Of course, you won’t take any money, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Of course not. Well, I’ve rented a place a few train stops away where we can have an outdoor barbecue, so you’ll have to pay for the train fare to get there.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The cost is less than 1,000 yen round trip for a few stops, and the hurdle is low.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I should invite the guy I got along with at guidance just today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In addition, senpai also paid for the drink bar and snacks I ordered at the family restaurant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He is really a very caring senior.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Well, now that I’m free from my senpai, I say, I’m going back to the apartment where Suzuka is waiting for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I called her a while ago to tell her that I’m leaving soon.</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is the first time I’m going back to a place where only Suzuka is sober.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was looking forward to seeing how she would greet me, but I didn’t know what would happen in this day and age, so I unlocked the front door, which was closed even though there was someone in the house.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m home!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I shouted in the hallway and took off my shoes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then, Suzuka appeared from the door leading to the living room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Welcome home! Do you want a bath? Do you want to eat? Or do you want me …? Heh heh, I’m still embarrassed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I have heard this before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That time, it was kind of messy and appropriate…</p>
<p class="calibre4">The muscles of my face relax when it is said with a sense of great cuteness in it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I took off my shoes and turned toward where I heard Suzuka’s voice coming from, I could see exactly why she was so embarrassed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, that’s embarrassing, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing. But, you know, I did it for the sake of it. What?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Were you really my childhood friend?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Absolutely, Suzuka acts in a way that I can’t imagine from when we were childhood friends.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s already sticking out in my mind again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because, because, she’s wearing a bathing suit and just an apron to greet me, you know?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Heck no! Because I like Yuki! But I’m so embarrassed. I’ll go change. It’s cold wearing only an apron over a bathing suit.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“In my opinion, it would have been bad if you said one more word to me.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Then, wouldn’t that be too obvious and make me feel uncomfortable?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If you ask me, it would be better to wear a swimsuit and an apron.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll tell you what, you haven’t told me if you want to have dinner, take a bath, or have me. So, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka asked me with a sly grin.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If I had crossed the line, I would have definitely chosen her.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I decided to hold off until my right hand was healed.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ve had my dinner. So, let’s take a bath. Just in time to see Suzuka in her bathing suit.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wrhdkgn/185782.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre4">“Okay. I’ll start by rolling up the bag on your right hand.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, I took a bath and got cleaned up.</p>

<p class="calibre4">The first part was good.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m wearing a bathing suit too. Can I get in the bathtub with Yuki? We’ve been in the tub together when we were little, so it shouldn’t be a problem, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, wait.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before I could say no, Suzuka came into the bathtub and poured hot water over herself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then she looked at me and said.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s embarrassing, but it’s not so bad. Maybe next time we can go to a hot spring together?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looked very satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Suzuka was so cute that I was embarrassed to tease her.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just went out to eat with a male senior, and you’re too jealous. I mean, don’t be jealous of a guy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Goof. I guess you found out… Because I missed having dinner with Yuki for the first time in a while?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s been about…2 months since I haven’t had dinner with you… I’m not going to be able to do that. I’m laughing now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We had to have dinner together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I can’t help but laugh at it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Because I didn’t expect to be in a relationship where I share so much time with Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">No good. For some reason, I can’t stop laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can’t stop laughing. Because I didn’t expect to be so lovey-dovey with Yuki. That’s why I want to make out with you more. Eat me!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She launched a hand full of hot water at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It hit me squarely in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I remember taking a hit from my lovely and mischievous wife.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I miss it. When we got muddy and our parents got mad at us and bathed us, did we splash hot water on each other like this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Haha, yes! Maybe we are, in a way, the same as we used to be when we got married. Now that Yuki can only use one hand, it is impossible for him to launch the hot water out with his hand. Let’s just do whatever you want me to do to you!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was having a good time with Suzuka, who was attacking me by launching hot water out with her hand.</p>
