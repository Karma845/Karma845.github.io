<h3>Chapter 1: Gal and Meetup</h3>


<p>I tried meeting up with a fellow light novel enthusiast whom I had become friends with on social media, but it turned out that she was a beautiful gal from my class!</p>

<p>I never thought that I would encounter something like a long-winded light novel title&#8230;</p>
<p>With such a thought, I checked her appearance again.</p>
<p>She was a gal, a gal to the fullest, but not a light-skinned gal.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s so white that she&#8217;s almost transparent; she&#8217;s a gal with a clean and neat look.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this gal contradictory?</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, Let&#8217;s go! I&#8217;m looking forward to the autograph event!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>With that feeble reply, I start walking behind Tsumakawa-san, who&#8217;s striding confidently ahead. Her excitement is palpable.</p>

<p>I really don&#8217;t get it!</p>
<p>How did a socially awkward otaku like me end up walking through Tokyo with a gal?</p>
<p>By the way, we&#8217;re currently heading towards a large bookstore near Shibuya Station, where the purpose of today&#8217;s meetup is to attend the book signing event for the author of 『Thanks to Reincarnation, I Could Get Engaged to a Goddess (Tensei shita okage de megami to kon&#8217;yaku dekimashita)』 ——or 『Tenkon』 for short.</p>

<p>Just the other day, Minacho-san proposed, &#8216;It&#8217;s a waste to just meet up, let&#8217;s go to the signing event together!&#8217;</p><div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2649533555761525" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>
<p>So that&#8217;s why the two of us are on our way to the event venue in the bookstore&#8230;</p>
<p>Is this person Minacho-san? Are you really Minacho-san?</p>

<p>&#8220;You look kind of quiet, huh? Are you nervous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-No, I am not feeling any sense of nervousness&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why are you using polite language? You seem about the same age, so casual language is fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;.. &#8220;</p>

<p>It seems she hasn&#8217;t realized that I am, Nezumayo, is her classmate.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s understandable. I have about as much presence in that class as a roadside pebble. If anything, a pretty pebble might have more presence than me.</p>
<p>While thinking this, she continues talking with a somewhat cheerful tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;m really glad we can meet like this in real life, Nezumayo! You&#8217;ve always been there for me when I want to talk&#8230; Fufu, you&#8217;re exactly the kind of otaku guy I imagined.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;are you making fun of me right now? &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not at all. In fact, I was kind of expecting some seriously dangerous otaku to show up, so I&#8217;m disappointed to see this basic and not-so-creepy guy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop making remarks that are unclear whether you&#8217;re building me up or putting me down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry, but I&#8217;m seriously happy! ——I really like you, Nezumayo! Meeting like this in real life got me super excited! Let&#8217;s have a great time today!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;&#8230; &#8220;</p>

<p>As she says this with an innocent smile, I can&#8217;t help but be a bit embarrassed.</p>


<p>What&#8217;s with this girl? How can she throw so much genuine affection at someone who&#8217;s just an acquaintance from Twitter? She&#8217;s way too friendly&#8230;</p>
<p>As I&#8217;m thinking this, I finally ask her the question that&#8217;s been on my mind since earlier.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;By the way, are you really &#8216;Minacho&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe me? &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; I mean, I didn&#8217;t expect a sunny, outgoing gal like you to hang out on Twitter as a light novel reader and interact with an otaku like me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Nezumayo-kun, you&#8217;re being biased and assuming gals don&#8217;t read light novels, aren&#8217;t you? In this day and age, it&#8217;s better to drop those narrow perspectives, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230; With the way you&#8217;re talking, are you saying gals do read light novels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope, generally they don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t? Then why did you mislead me like that, you gal?&#8221;</p>

<p>As I retort, Minacho-san, or rather, Tsumakawa-san, chuckles in amusement.</p>
<p>Then, she squints her eyes a little and starts talking eloquently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honestly, I&#8217;m not your typical gal, you see? Ordinary gals probably don&#8217;t get saved by light novels during tough times like, &#8216;Life is so hard.&#8217; But, I&#8217;m different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Minacho-san, have you been saved by light novels?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm, just once? When I was in the first year of middle school and had just started modeling, things weren&#8217;t going well at all&#8230; Maybe it was because I was a bit of an idiot about modeling at the time. Anyway, during that time, I happened to watch a late-night anime that was seriously interesting, and I got into the light novel based on that anime. That&#8217;s when I got hooked on the world of light novels.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; So that&#8217;s how it happened&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To be honest, there are so many enjoyable activities in the world, right? From karaoke and bowling to BBQ and shopping——even movies, manga and anime, they&#8217;re all so much fun. That&#8217;s why light novels, which require consuming and interacting with text, seem like a bothersome form of entertainment that demands too much effort and energy. But I don&#8217;t know why? This is what I love the most for some reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;.. &#8220;</p><div class="code-block code-block-9" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2649533555761525" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2649533555761525" data-ad-slot="1527292983"></ins>

</script></div>
<p>&#8220;Why do I love it so much? If you were to ask me that, I wouldn&#8217;t have a straightforward answer&#8230; Maybe because it feels like the freest form of entertainment in the world. Maybe not really, but from my point of view as a reader, I feel that light novels are incredibly free. As long as the author has enough imagination, we can go anywhere, and reading them really excites me! There&#8217;s a mixture of good and bad because there&#8217;s such a huge variety – but when I dig and dig and dig into all sorts of works and finally discover a masterpiece light novel that&#8217;s just for me, I&#8217;m as happy as when I find a real diamond!  Or more like&#8230; uh, sorry, I got carried away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just as I thought she was enjoying her conversation, Tsumakawa-san abruptly cut off the conversation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I, who was amazed by her unexpected comment, said to myself in a whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minacho-san always tweets long sentences, and the gal in front of me right now was saying something similar&#8230; Could it be that this girl is actually Minacho-san&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay, you admit it! Gal Peace!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s with that &#8216;Gal Peace&#8217;? If it&#8217;s a peace sign with the fingers pointing downwards. That&#8217;s a &#8216;Down Peace&#8217;.&#8221; (TN: A pose like in the illustration (5th image).)</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re nitpicking Gal Peace, huh? Anyway, now you know, right? I&#8217;m the real Minacho, and I&#8217;m the one you&#8217;ve been having fun chats with, Nezumayo-kun!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yeah&#8230; I guess so. You really are Minacho-san&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>With her values now communicated in a manner befitting Minacho-san, I finally grasped the fact that Minacho-san = the class sunny gal.</p>

<p>However, my feelings are quite complex&#8230;I don&#8217;t mean to be rude to her, but it&#8217;s still pretty shocking&#8230;</p>
<p>After all, today I was expecting to hang out with a male friend who loves light novels. And now, I&#8217;m attending a signing event with this dazzling white gal&#8230;</p>

<p>Gals are the last people we otaku types can understand and feel at ease around, right? As I ponder this, we reach the bookstore.</p>
<p>Inside, we head toward the floor where the light novels are placed to purchase the book to be signed by the author.</p>

<p>While riding the escalator together, Tsumakawa suddenly shoots me a question.</p>

<p>&#8220;Minacho being a gal, were you disappointed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;. &#8220;</p>

<p>I was taken aback as she threw a question that was quite close to what I was pondering.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2649533555761525" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

</script></div>
<p>As I remain silent, Tsumakawa-san, for some reason, continues to speak with a cheerful smile on her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry I didn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a &#8216;gal&#8217; up until today. Among the friends I usually hang out with, there&#8217;s no one who likes light novels, so I used an anonymous account to interact with you, Nezumayo. But I think I also had a hidden thought somewhere in my heart that it would be a bit weird to call myself a gal who likes light novels. I didn&#8217;t mean to keep it a secret, but it was a little unfair because I never told you about it&#8230; surprised, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, I was really surprised. First of all, I didn&#8217;t even think you were a girl&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But even if that&#8217;s revealed before, it&#8217;s okay. I just wanted to meet Nezumayo today.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saying that, Tsumakawa-san turns to me and smiles.</p>
<p>In response, I don&#8217;t know what expression I should make and end up with a wry smile, somewhere between a smile and awkwardness. Then, she extends her hand toward me and says,</p>

<p>&#8220;Nice to meet you, Nezumayo-kun. I&#8217;m Minacho, a high school girl from Saitama, and I&#8217;m a full-on gal—please take care of me in the future!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;N-nice to meet you too&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

</script></div>
<p>Unable to grasp the offered right hand, I only manage to say something like that.</p>
<p>Then, she takes my right hand herself and says, &#8216;Here, shake hands!&#8217;——At that moment, I feel my hand enveloped by a soft, girlish touch.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s with this softness&#8230;?! Is it possible that girls are made entirely of baked pudding or something? </p>

<p>As we step off the escalator, Tsumakawa and I each pick up a copy of the first volume of &#8216;Tenkon,&#8217; which is stacked on display in the light novel corner. And naturally, we both start looking through the light novels on this floor.</p>
<p>Just as I was marveling at the extensive selection of books in the store, Tsumakawa next to me picks up a light novel from the shelf. Then, she shows me the cover and says,</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, look! The art is by Iida Paberu-sensei——it&#8217;s so hot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can only agree. Even though it&#8217;s explicit, it&#8217;s not vulgar, which is impressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! This cover is so eye-catching and messy!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by eye-catching and messy&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s certainly eye-catching, but it&#8217;s not really that messy&#8230; If anything, it&#8217;s moe and a well-organized mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it more weird to say it&#8217;s &#8216;moe and a well-organized mess&#8217; ?&#8221;</p>

<p>After I respond with that, Tsumakawa retorts and chuckles again.</p>
<p>Even though we&#8217;re just having an insubstantial conversation&#8230;this gal, I can&#8217;t help but think that she&#8217;s having a bit too much fun.</p>
<p>However, even though it&#8217;s a bit hard to believe, I can somewhat sense that she&#8217;s the genuine Minacho through these light exchanges.</p>
<p>..I see. This girl, who&#8217;s always had those silly exchanges with me on Twitter, is the real Minacho&#8230;</p>

<p>『Can someone give me a recommendation for a good light novel?』</p>
<p>『That&#8217;s right +1! Tell this Minacho what novels you recommend!』</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2649533555761525" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>
<p>『Please don&#8217;t reply to other people&#8217;s tweets asking for recommendations. How self-centered!』</p>
<p>『You have a point! Then, let&#8217;s exchange recommended light novels! I&#8217;ll give you Minacho&#8217;s recommendation, so you should recommend one too!』</p>
<p>『In that case, I recommend &#8216;Tenkon&#8217;!』</p>
<p>『Thanks~! Well then, goodbye!』</p>
<p>『That&#8217;s not what you promised!』</p>

<p>I often exchanged this kind of conversation with Minacho-san on SNS.</p>
<p>&#8230;I never imagined that the person I was having this conversation with was the gal from the same class, though.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hm? What&#8217;s up? Have you fallen for Minacho?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-No, it&#8217;s not like that&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>While I was lost in thought while looking at Tsumakawa-san, she said something unexpected.</p>
<p>She probably asked jokingly, but I could never imagine falling in love with a three-dimensional girl.</p>
<p>Yet, she continues with a deliberately cheerful smile,</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh—. If Nezumayo-kun were to fall for me, I&#8217;d be quite happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-No, that&#8217;s not it. I haven&#8217;t fallen for you&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need to be so embarrassed. Be honest, you——&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey&#8230; Could you not just pinch my cheek without my permission? You gal have a way too close sense of personal space!&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-9" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Heheh, that&#8217;s what being a gal is like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of emotion are you showing off with that smug face?&#8221;</p>

<p>I retort to Tsumakawa, who&#8217;s massaging my cheek with her right hand.</p>
<p>This girl, taking advantage of her status as a gal, is way too casual with her physical touches&#8230;!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really mind her being easygoing, but before engaging in physical contact, could she at least consider whether the other person is comfortable with it or not!?</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>And so, Minacho (Tsumakawa-san) and I toured the store until around 2 o&#8217;clock, and the starting time for the autograph session arrived.</p>
<p>We participated, got the author of &#8216;Tenkon&#8217; to sign our copies, and now, with content smiles after accomplishing our goal, we&#8217;re taking a break in a nearby cafe.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yatta! I got Nasutake-sensei&#8217;s autograph! My excitement goes through the roof!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right? When I actually saw the author in person, I couldn&#8217;t contain my excitement either&#8230; My excitement goes through the roof!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, could you not casually use the gal language I use? Do you look down on gals?&#8221;</p>

<p>Being told that by Tsumakawa sitting across from me, I apologize and say I&#8217;m sorry.</p>
<p>By the way, this cafe is the type where you order your drinks in advance.</p>
<p>I got an iced coffee, while Tsumakawa loaded her vanilla frappuccino with various toppings, transforming what was originally white into a brown liquid.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure if it can still be called a vanilla frappuccino after all that&#8230;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Hey一, today was super fun! Thanks, Nezumayo!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hm? Why are you thanking me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? Well, because I said &#8216;I wanted to meet you&#8217;, we met, and it was really fun, so isn&#8217;t it appropriate to say &#8216;thank you&#8217;? Is there any other word to say besides &#8216;thank you&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;.. &#8220;</p>

<p>Saying this without any hesitation, Tsumakawa smiles at me&#8230;and seeing that, I unintentionally look away.</p>
<p>In response to my reaction, Tsumakawa-san&#8217;s expression takes on a mischievous look, and she continues.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, I thought that maybe Nezumayo-kun would get nervous around me, a gal, and stop talking to me—but hehe, it was a lot of fun! You did a good job!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Minacho-san, aren&#8217;t you underestimating me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, I&#8217;m not underestimating you! ——Also, it&#8217;s not like I think that if I&#8217;m a little nicer to you, you might start falling head over heels for me and become a convenient guy for me or anything! I&#8217;m definitely not thinking like that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been underestimated more than I thought&#8230;don&#8217;t underestimate me while acting like tsundere!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, changing the topic, isn&#8217;t tsundere great? I really like tsundere girls! Nezumayo, do you like tsundere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably among guys who read light novels, there&#8217;s no one who doesn&#8217;t like tsundere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahaha, right? ——Hmm, I&#8217;m not saying that I&#8217;m happy to find someone who also likes tsundere like me or anything, but it was nice to hear that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go full tsundere even when expressing the joy of finding someone who likes tsundere. Your tsundere is starting to have a gestalt collapse.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I retort like that, Tsumakawa still seems to enjoy herself and says, &#8216;There&#8217;s no way Gestalt Collapse happening!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;It seems like this gal is having too much fun talking in a tsundere-like manner.</p><div class="code-block code-block-10" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>As I was about to laugh at that thought, Tsumakawa took a sip of her vanilla frappuccino, then with a calm expression, she smiled and says,</p>

<p>&#8220;But you see, I like tsundere girls, but I can&#8217;t be a tsundere myself&#8230; Look, I tend to blurt out what I&#8217;m thinking right away. Are you surprised?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Personally, I&#8217;m not surprised at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heheh——Well, I think not saying what you&#8217;re thinking might be a disadvantage. Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s better to say your feelings first, like &#8216;I like you!&#8217; to the person you like, so they won&#8217;t have a hard time liking you back? You see, I&#8217;m the type who tends to say my feelings first.<br/>
Do you understand?</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand, but at the same time, I do understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which one is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tsumakawa teases me with that retort, but that&#8217;s actually quite close to my real feelings.</p>
<p>While I personally can&#8217;t relate to that, I can understand why some people are like that.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in my mind, I gaze at Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t have to understand what I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8230;Not that it matters, but I think she&#8217;s been smiling happily all day today.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;m going to change the subject——Actually, it&#8217;s not going to change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your way of saying that is pretty odd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nezumayo-kun, do you have a girlfriend right now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ve never had a girlfriend in my life, let alone now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, is that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>Even though she&#8217;s the one that asked me, Tsumakawa responds with a lack of interest.</p>
<p>Then, she delivers an unexpected line while twirling the tips of her tea-colored hair between her fingers without blushing as if it was something insignificant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, how about dating me?&#8221; (Text in img)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was puzzled for a moment.</p>
<p>She spoke those words like asking a friend next to her, &#8216;What class do we have next?&#8217;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no passionate emotion behind it; it was an incredibly dry confession, and since it was a confession I wasn&#8217;t accustomed to hearing, my brain couldn&#8217;t catch up with her words&#8230;</p>
<p>Date? Tsumakawa and me?</p><div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

</script></div>

<p>Before I could even process the cute gal&#8217;s confession, I struggled to understand it in the first place.</p>
<p>So, I ended up closely staring at Tsumakawa&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>In response, she smiles teasingly at me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Are you trying to judge whether I have a pretty face or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She&#8217;s overly generous with her smiles even to a guy she barely knows&#8230;</p>
<p>While feeling bewildered in that manner, I managed to squeeze out a genuine question.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;but, Minacho-san, you don&#8217;t, uh&#8230; actually like me, do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know?!</p>
<p>She doesn&#8217;t actually like me? Then why did she just confess to me?</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I don&#8217;t dislike you. If you asked me to kiss, I think I could totally do it, but well——I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve developed the desire to do it yet&#8230;Ahaha, sorry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why am I being confessed to, only to be rejected right after&#8230;? Is this some kind of paradox joke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not like that! ——I mean, I really had a great time just now! So, I thought, maybe I could fall in love with you, and that&#8217;s why I asked you out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What——?! So, even though you don&#8217;t like me, you confessed to me because you think you could fall in love with me?&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-2649533555761525" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script></div>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8230;Uh, do gals really have a lax sense of chastity?</p>
<p>Normally, confessing is something you do after you&#8217;ve developed feelings for someone, right?</p>
<p>Yet she spent the day with me and came to the conclusion that she could potentially like me — not that she actually like me — and then confessed to me.</p>

<p>&#8230;Isn&#8217;t the speed of her confession as fast as Formula 1?</p>
<p>I commute to school by bicycle, so I can&#8217;t keep up with her!</p>

<p>I felt again that I couldn&#8217;t understand gals at all&#8230;</p>
<p>For someone like me, the phrase &#8216;I want you to go out with me&#8217; is a word that might never escape my lips for years.</p>
<p>It holds such weight, fear, and it&#8217;s something to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>However, she just casually said it without any fear or sentiment attached.</p>
<p>To her, it&#8217;s probably like a cute request, akin to asking a classmate, &#8216;Can you help me with my homework?&#8217;</p>
<p>Such is her sense, and while I won&#8217;t deny her conduct, I thought that she was different from me, like I felt that we&#8217;re different breeds of human.</p>
<p>So, after considering all that, the only response I could offer to her confession was this,</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t go out with you, Minacho-san. I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah? Is that so, tensage&#8230;&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-9" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>(TN: テンサゲ, tensage means a state of lowered tension. An abbreviation of &#8216;Tenshonsage&#8217;, which is a combination of &#8216;tenshon&#8217; meaning a mood or feeling and &#8216;Sage&#8217; meaning lowered. In english, maybe it was &#8216;buzzkill&#8217; ? Idk.)</p>
<p>She says those words with a slightly sad expression.</p>
<p>Honestly, someone who&#8217;s genuinely sad wouldn&#8217;t say &#8216;tensage&#8217;, but still, she seemed somewhat shocked.</p>
<p>Then, she takes another sip of her frappuccino and after a satisfied &#8216;Mmm,&#8217; she looks straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, let&#8217;s be friends!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t give up that easily!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a smile that seems entirely unaffected by the fact that she was just turned down, Tsumakawa presents a new request, and I respond with a quip.</p>
<p>I see, so this is the mindset of a gal&#8230; It&#8217;s positively scary for an introvert like me!</p>
<p>While I think that to myself, I voice my sincere feelings without holding back.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so fixated on me, Tsumakawa-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;..Hm? Tsumakawa-san? Did I mention my last name to you, Nezumayo-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tsumakawa is surprised by my slip of the tongue.</p>
<p>In response, I consider that since it&#8217;s already out, there&#8217;s no point in hiding it any longer, and I explain our relationship.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Tsumakawa-san might not have noticed, but we&#8217;re classmates in the same class&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;Ahaha, uh&#8230; Nezumayo-kun. You&#8217;re really funny, aren&#8217;t you? ——No way, that&#8217;s impossible. I mean, if you and I were in the same class, it&#8217;d be incredibly rude of me not to realize it. So, there&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s true&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;.. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, no way&#8230; I said there&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s true! I like everyone in the class, so there&#8217;s no way I forget the faces of my classmates or anything like that——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;.. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;really? &#8220;</p>

<p>Sensing that I&#8217;m telling the truth, Tsumakawa&#8217;s face turns pale.</p>
<p>Then, she clasps her hands together in an apologetic pose and bows her head vigorously.</p>

<p>&#8220;S-seriously? I&#8217;m so sorry, Nezumayo-kun&#8230; By the way, Nezumayo-kun, your name is, um&#8230; What kind of name is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m Ryosuke Yoda, a first-year Class D student in Private Yuunagi High School.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ah&#8230; Oh, I see! Yoda! It&#8217;s Yoda! Why didn&#8217;t I notice?! Looking at you, you&#8217;re so Yoda! You really are that Yoda!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too obvious!&#8221;</p>

<p>When I retorted like that, Tsumakawa-san apologized again with a serious tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;uh, I&#8217;m really sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Honestly, there&#8217;s no need to feel so bad about it&#8230; Not many classmates can actually recognize me, probably less than half.</p>
<p>What a sad follow-up!</p>
<p>As I was scratching my cheek with a somewhat awkward expression, Tsumakawa suddenly raised her head and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; then, if Nezumayo-kun is in my class, from now on, I can discuss light novels with Nezumayo anytime in the classroom&#8230; How about that!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out with these abrupt topic changes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, but seriously! If Yoda, my classmate, and Nezumayo are the same person, that means Minacho can talk freely with Nezumayo in class, right?! Hooray! I&#8217;ve won big time!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t just declare victory like that on your own. Besides, having a class-related conversation when we&#8217;re not even friends——&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now about that, as I said before, if being a girlfriend is out of the question, then let&#8217;s be friends!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tsumakawa tries to steer the conversation back on track, repeating her request.</p>
<p>Not knowing how to respond, I&#8217;m left bewildered, and she continues.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nezumayo-kun, you seem like a serious guy, so I guess you can&#8217;t take dating lightly. Hmmph, my pride was hurt a little, but I&#8217;ll forgive you this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why am I the one who needs forgiveness when I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, being friends should be okay, right? Let&#8217;s become friends!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;.. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? You&#8217;re getting all quiet, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>

<p>While letting Tsumakawa&#8217;s words wash over me, I take a deep breath.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>Regarding this matter, while I do think that I might be the odd one, still&#8230; Due to certain two events, I&#8217;ve become unable to believe in &#8216;three-dimensional women,&#8217; including her.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I said my response to Minacho-san, who I always enjoyed talking with on Twitter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Minacho-san&#8230; Even being friends is a bit&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haaaa!? You&#8217;re way too stubborn! I&#8217;m going to turn into a demon and be so mad at you! &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you not suddenly being so intimidating and getting unreasonably angry?&#8221;</p>

<p>The white gal says something frightening in an intense tone, and my honest emotions slip out.</p>
<p>Then, she crosses her arms and gives me a stern look.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

</script></div>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you explain the reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>So, I reluctantly started to tell my own story, something I don&#8217;t really want to talk about.</p>
<p>&#8220;Actually, I&#8217;m somewhat skeptical about women&#8230; There were two events that led to this—first, when I was in my first year of middle school. An idol I was supporting along with my sister suddenly announced on Twitter, &#8216;I&#8217;m getting married and retiring as an idol!&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, that&#8217;s great news. You should be supportive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s so great about it? It&#8217;s a marriage announcement and a retirement announcement at the same time! Our Yuna-chan, who we were cheering for as an idol, is quitting the idol world! And what&#8217;s more, she was in a no-dating group, but she&#8217;s been in a full-blown romance since her active days! That handsome actor is seriously unforgivable&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your expression is way too intense. But hey, isn&#8217;t it normal for your favorite idol to eventually get married? How much did Nezumayo like that idol?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to gather all the dragon&#8217;s ball.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like being able to fulfill the impossible demands Princess Kaguya made to the prince who proposed to her in &#8216;The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter&#8217;!?&#8221;</p>

<p>After I retorted like that, Tsumakawa laughed out loud and replied with a gleeful voice.</p><div class="code-block code-block-7" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

</script></div>
<p>Stop it, don&#8217;t laugh. That wasn&#8217;t a joke just now.</p>
<p>Really, I was dead serious about being able to do that!</p>

<p>&#8220;That incident led me to firmly resolve that I wouldn&#8217;t believe in three-dimensional women——however, I fell for the female artist 『ArlSU』 soon after.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your resolution collapsed way too quickly! Sounds like a two-panel manga.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, unlike idols, it&#8217;s not like I fell for a female artist based on her appearance! I just like ArlSU&#8217;s songs, and since my feelings for ArlSU aren&#8217;t romantic, I&#8217;m not making the same mistake again! You know, I&#8217;ve learned from my failures!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then&#8230;? If you&#8217;re not into her and simply become a fan, then it&#8217;s not a big deal, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, that&#8217;s how I started to promote the singer ArlSU&#8230; And then, two years later, she said on a radio show, [I seriously can&#8217;t get a boyfriend, someone please take me!] However, soon after that, she got caught having an affair with a big company&#8217;s president, and it became a hot topic on the internet&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the moment. That&#8217;s when I decided I&#8217;d never expect anything from three-dimensional women ever again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like you were really into her, huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made a precise remark. Well, maybe.</p>
<p>I actually was never a fan because of her face, but when ArlSU&#8217;s affair scandal came out, I felt the same way as when Yuna betrayed me! Damn it!</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; after going through such experiences twice, I&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t trust real-life women anymore because women will betray me. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t need a girlfriend or female friends. I decided not to get involved with real-life women, and, in return, I&#8217;ll only pour my love into the two-dimensional girlfriends living in the world of fiction&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;.. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the reason I can&#8217;t be friends with you&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>After talking at length, I told her again, and I quietly bowed my head.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>Honestly speaking, it is a story that is hard to be understood by others, but I was that invested, and that&#8217;s the truth. So, when I was feeling betrayed, I was genuinely hurt.</p>
<p>The love I offered and the love I received were completely imbalanced. What I offered was a genuine devotion, and yet what came back felt like a paper lantern.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t bear the fact that what I gave was real and substantial, but what I received was hollow&#8230;</p>

<p>As I continued to pile up these thoughts, the gal in front of me carefully chose her words and spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s just because you&#8217;re into some stupid celebrity. Whether we become friends or not, those things doesn&#8217;t matter, right? — Miona won&#8217;t deceive you, so let&#8217;s become friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that in my head&#8230; But, due to the experiences that have piled up inside me, I&#8230; I&#8217;m scared of becoming friends with three-dimensional girls&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;. &#8220;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t separate these thoughts. To me, the two I supported and the women around me&#8230; They look like the same kind of beings. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m scared. I feel like I don&#8217;t want you to get any closer&#8230; uh, I know it sounds pathetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221; &#8230;hmm, I see. Well then, no worries. ——yosh-yosh.&#8221;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what part of what I just said convinced her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Tsumakawa, as if she understood something, began to pat my head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh—? Don&#8217;t act like you&#8217;re my grandma!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why grandma? At least say I&#8217;m your mom.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Tsumakawa-san was retorting me, I turned my head away and escaped her hand.</p>
<p>Despite just having talked about being uncomfortable around women, she&#8217;s making this move&#8230; Gals are terrifying&#8230;</p><div class="code-block code-block-9" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>As I was thinking that, Tsumakawa gave a mischievous smile after seeing my awkward expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;For now, let&#8217;s head back soon. —How about we take the train together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, alright&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>With that conversation, Tsumakawa and I left the cafe.</p>
<p>Then, without saying anything to each other, we arrived at Shibuya Station.</p>
<p>We passed through the ticket gate, boarded the Shonan-Shinjuku Line, and amid a crowded train——</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really packed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>That was the only conversation we had until we reached my nearest station, &#8216;Saitama Shintoshin Station.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, this is my stop.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today was fun, but from now on, I can return to my usual, unrelated relationship with Tsumakawa-san, I thought as I got off the train.</p>
<p>At the same time, she smiled and waved her hand at me and says,</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s hang out again sometime!&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230; Hang out again&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bye-bye! Gal peace!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a smile on her face, Tsumakawa-san made a &#8216;Gal peace&#8217; gesture, making a peace sign with both hands, then turning it upside down with fingertips pointing downward.</p>
<p>She continued this until the doors closed&#8230; and eventually, the train, carrying the mischievously smiling white gal, gained speed and moving away departing from the station.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;I told you we can&#8217;t be friends, so there shouldn&#8217;t be a next time&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Although I dazedly retorted like that, the train had already gone far beyond my sight&#8230;so there was no way that she could hear me.</p>
