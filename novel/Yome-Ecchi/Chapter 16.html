<h1 class="single_title"><strong class="calibre3">Chapter 16 &#8211; The End of the Date Was the Beginning of a Spoiled Life</strong></h1>


<p class="calibre4">“We had a great time today!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Just before dusk, after enjoying the aquarium to the fullest, we started walking home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With the smell of the water lingering in the air, we reflected on our day.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ah!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki. Don’t forget that you said you would protect me at the place with the tank full of small fish?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was said in a deliberate way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I lightly poked Suzuka on the head.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I won’t forget you, don’t worry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Wait, why did you poke my head?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You say stupid things. Do I look like the kind of guy who says he’ll protect you and then immediately changes his mind?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see. Then I’m relieved.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She looks relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As we leave the aquarium and make our way to the bus, we stop at a rather nice scenic spot.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Would you like to take in the view for a little bit?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">We both look at the landscape.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, we didn’t stay here just to admire the view.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With determination, I took out a small package from my bag and handed it to Suzuka, who was glued to the view.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Suzuka. Here you go.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, my gosh. Don’t throw things at me out of the blue.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry. My bad.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“And what’s this?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a present for you. It’s a small one, though.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">First date.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Rather than a present with a lot of thought put into it, a lighthearted present would be better.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With this in mind, I gave her what I had chosen.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What is it….?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She opens the parcel nicely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had given gifts to Suzuka before, but this was the first time I had given her a present since we became lovers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fidgeting, I wait for her reaction.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After swallowing hard, the present finally emerges from the package.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a pass case!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s my first present. You don’t want me to give you something weird and fancy, do you? Well, I don’t think it’s a good idea to give it to my lover…….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m the one who is on the defensive.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After I give it to her, I regret whether I really did the right thing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Fearfully, I see Suzuka’s reaction.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Of course I’d be happy with anything Yuki gives me, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“How do you really feel about being given a pass case?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not my birthday, and it’s not Christmas, so I’m sure I’d rather get a present that’s not so crazy.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That means ……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I mean, I’m happy. Because this present was given to me because my current pass case is getting worn down and stained, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s what I meant.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s a gift that shows you’ve been looking out for me. How can I not be happy?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She told me with a kind smile that there was no need to look so worried.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A successful present.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The pounding of my heart has not yet subsided, but I feel relieved.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s good to hear.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I mean, isn’t that a little unfair? Suddenly, you’re handing me a present. I didn’t prepare anything, you know?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s a surprise for you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m so frustrated that I’m going to prepare a present to make Yuki happy next time, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll be looking forward to it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">After handing over the present, we talk for a bit, taking in the view.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When it comes to a lover’s date, things are going well.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s when we might kiss and do all sorts of things.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But then I realized that it’s not all about the s****l stuff.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It would be a shame to move on without slowly and surely getting to know each other.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s the first time, and I should be able to feel the happiness that I can’t feel now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You know what, Yuki?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just called out to you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">A brilliant smile is directed at me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Will Suzuka protect me? I remember how worried she was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I would do anything to protect this smile.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, let’s go home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah, I guess so.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I quit gazing at the scenery and start walking.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Walking slowly along the path to the shuttle bus, we come upon a set of stairs.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was while we were descending the stairs, which were a bit high.</p>
<p class="calibre4">A boy running vigorously bumped into Suzuka’s back.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If she had been able to stand on her feet, she would not have fallen down.</p>

<p class="calibre4">An unexpected blow.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She didn’t have any strength in her legs and feet, and she almost fell down.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Damn it, come on!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I managed to hold Suzuka as she tumbled down the stairs, and she and I fell down the stairs.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ittsu……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was able to hit the ground with Suzuka in my good graces.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Perhaps Suzuka is safe.　</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I …… looked like I was in trouble.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yu, Yuki!? Are you okay!?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tsk, ah, ah.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I strained my voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I look at my screaming arms and hands, and they are clearly not looking good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t lose consciousness, but the pain fills me up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I get into an ambulance, which the parents of the boy who pushed me probably called, and we ride to the nearest hospital.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Surprisingly, my arms were fine, but the condition of my fingers was not good, so I had to have surgery.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was quite a catastrophe.</p>


<p class="calibre4">Well, it’s funny to say it’s just broken bones, though.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After a few days in the hospital, I was released without incident.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oops!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka, who came to escort me out of the hospital, helps me with my bags.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My left arm is fine, but I guess she was taking care of me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nah. If you fall down and you can only use your left hand and you’re holding a bag in your left hand, it would be hard for you to get to it, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I see what you mean. I’m really sorry. I’m so sorry. I even had you escort me out of the hospital.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The hospital to which I was taken was near the aquarium.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had surgery there and was hospitalized.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Naturally, it would take some time to come from home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was so grateful to Suzuka who came to check on me for a few days, including visiting me at the hospital.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, I’m fine. I’m fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, it’s been a while since I’ve been home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I didn’t think it would take me this long to get home from the aquarium.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With a bitter smile on my face, we took a cab home, though I was afraid of the fare.</p>


<p class="calibre4">And when we came home, Mom and Dad were away for work.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It felt strange to be home for the first time in a while.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, how’s my accident going?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s been confirmed that we will pay for all the medical treatment. The lawyer said I can claim some money for damages.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“That’s good to know.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">The cost of treatment, including surgery and hospitalization.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a painful expense, even though I usually win the lottery.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s inconvenient that I can only use …… my left hand.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Isn’t it about time for your medicine?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka prepares water for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I pour the water down with the medicine I got home.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m a little tired. I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I go to my room and sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It had been a long time since I slept on my bed, which was completely occupied by Suzuka, as I had trouble putting down the futon with one hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I woke up, it was night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I went to the living room, my mother and father had come home.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Apparently, they were talking about my injury with Suzuka.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mom, Dad, I’m home. And welcome home.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki, welcome back. How are your wounds?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It still hurts, but I’m fine.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m glad to hear that. Speaking of which, I know you’ve been wiping yourself off, but go take a bath for the first time in a while. As long as you cover yourself with a bag and don’t get wet, you’re good to go, right?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I guess so. But it’s hard to do with one hand, so why don’t you help me with the bag?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh dear, you don’t have to ask me, Yuki has a lovely wife.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mom looks over at Suzuka.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Then Suzuka rolls a bag in my hand.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m going to go in …….”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I went to the bathroom with a towel and clothes in my left hand, but for some reason Suzuka came to the bathroom as well.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Mother-in-law said I should go help Yuki bathe.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…… I see. We act like lovers, but formally we are a married couple.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“So, what are you going to do?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’ll go in alone if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hmmm. If I say I don’t mind, I don’t mind, okay? But, you know, it’s kind of awkward to say, how should I say it ……”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It is me and Suzuka, who have never even kissed before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Washing in the bath, that’s too much of a hurdle.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We’re even just going at a slow pace.</p>
<p class="calibre4">There was no way she wouldn’t flinch at the act of skipping several flights of stairs.</p>

<p class="calibre4">But, however…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mom came to check on us in the changing room.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, you haven’t entered yet?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Why did you come?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I’m worried about my son.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As soon as she said that, she left.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I know because I am a family member.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mom will definitely come back to the changing room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What if Suzuka doesn’t help me and waits for me when she does?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course they would be suspicious.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If they suspect discord, that’s when mom’s meddling will hit us.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If I don’t wash Yuki, there will be a lot of trouble, so I will wash you. I mean, Yuki was injured protecting me in the first place. Let me take care of you normally?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I understand. Then, please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just keep the towel around your waist, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t have a hobby that I enjoy showing off to you, and I’m going to wrap up. Turn around.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I made her turn around and take off my clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre4">After wrapping the towel around my waist, Suzuka and I went to the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I sat down on a chair and Suzuka picked up a sponge and started to wash me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“After all, you don’t have to do this, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Now that Suzuka is also in the bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre4">We are the only ones who can know what’s going on inside the fogged up room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Mom must think I’m washing as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I told her that Suzuka didn’t need to bother washing me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“‘It’s my fault you have a body like this, so let me take care of it? Yes, turn your back.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka starts to wash my back and arms with a scrubbing sponge.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When she starts, I’m a little embarrassed but surprisingly okay with it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I told Suzuka at the aquarium, I have a desire to be spoiled.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I can feel that desire being fulfilled.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“….. Damn, it’s too good to have Suzuka do this to me….”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, at the aquarium, did Yuki want to spoil me?　When I asked you, you said you wanted to be spoiled. Do you feel like I’m echoing your desire to be spoiled?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s so bad it’s echoing all over the place.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ehehe. I see. Then, I’ll do my best. Any itchy spots, customer?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She scrubbed my body and washed my hair carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Needless to say, I washed the important parts by myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">After such an experience, we realize.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“We’re not too sexually active, are we?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I guess you could say that. Why did I wash Yuki normally without incident? If it had been normal, something would have definitely happened.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…… Well, is this how it’s supposed to be?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Ummm, yes. Isn’t that possible?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Hearing Suzuka’s somewhat cryptic response, I made up my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As Suzuka also said, we should still avoid s****l matters.</p>



<p class="calibre4">It was the first morning at home after being discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I woke up rubbing my eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Good morning. Yuki.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, yeah. Good morning.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I returned the greeting and looked over at Suzuka, who was sleeping beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her sweatshirt pants had slipped down a bit and her underwear was visible.</p>

<p class="calibre4">…… gulp …….</p>
<p class="calibre4">I swallow with fresh saliva.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yesterday, I concluded that we still need to avoid s****l matters.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The stimulation hits me so hard that I almost forget that.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My pants are slipping down. …… Oh, Yuki, you saw my underwear that was showing from my pants that were slipping down, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I got my favorite teasing.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She’d say these things, but when I’d counter with something like, ‘Oh, that was ecchi’ she’d instantly get embarrassed……</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I didn’t see it.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, really?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Well, I’ll say it then. It was rather naughty.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Come on, shy away from the initial intention, like you always do.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Huh? Oh, yeah, I see. Heh.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Suzuka is shy as usual.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But today, she was a little different from usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I can’t help it. Just a little bit, okay? …… Yes, that’s it!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">She glanced down her pants and shyly showed me her adorable, cute underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I say she did that to me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m already in the habit of concluding that we should still avoid s****l matters, but now it’s getting bad.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, quiet, what’s wrong with you?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“No, no. It’s nothing, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I want to take it slow and still take care of things like we would.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But can I do that without attacking Suzuka?</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Oh, Yuki. I’ll get you a change of clothes now.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“You don’t have to go that far, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yuki is allowed to be spoiled because he got hurt as a result of having to cover for me, okay?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Thus began the days of being spoiled by Suzuka.</p>
