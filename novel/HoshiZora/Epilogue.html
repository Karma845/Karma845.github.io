  <h2>Epilogue: Wish Upon a Planet</h2>  
    
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, there it is! That’s the North Star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Which one?… Oh, that one! Huh, it’s surprisingly plain!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s a second-magnitude star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought it’d be, like, sparklier or something!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was one week later, on the school’s rooftop at night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai and Igarashi-san were pointing at the shining stars in the northern sky and chatting to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai was holding out a star guide app on his smartphone to Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, that’s the Big Dipper, and that’s the constellation Cassiopeia. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, the Big Dipper  <i class="calibre4">does </i> kinda like a ladle, dontcha think? Cassiopeia is just like a zigzag, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Didn’t you learn about that in science at junior high?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our chaperone, Chiyoda-sensei, was standing next to them with a wry smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it  <i class="calibre4">was </i> part of the high school entrance exam curriculum, if I recall correctly…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I’m the type to forget everything once the exam is over!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Studying isn’t supposed to work like that. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-sensei suddenly laughed and looked up at the starry sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, let’s leave it at that for today. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a beautifully clear night. A deep ultramarine stretched out across the entire sky, with countless lights twinkling on its surface. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>Occasionally, patchy clouds would cover the lights, and towards the east, around Shinjuku, the city lights made it difficult to see the stars. Still, it was a good enough setting for our first stargazing session. There wouldn’t be many places in the 23 wards of Tokyo where you can see so many stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, simply put, it was loads of fun. To do this stuff with like-minded friends at night, long after school had ended for the day. For some reason, it made my heart race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for me, I was filming them with my smartphone—Igarashi-san and Rokuyo-senpai looking at the sky, and Nito peering at the moon through a telescope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, though, it was too dark to be able to capture much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since looking at the stars was the priority, we couldn’t turn on any lights, but this’ll still make for a good memory in its own way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As for the footage, I might need to put my thinking cap on and come up with other ways to do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’d be awesome if we had a setup where we could connect the telescope and a camera to capture the stars that way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-sensei approved our video as an activity achievement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, this will do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were in the staff room, where we went to show her the video. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-sensei, for whatever reason, had a happy look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I accept this video as an achievement of the Astronomy Club’s activities.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four of us couldn’t help letting out a loud cheer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was lunchtime in the staff room. We weren’t really allowed to be noisy, and so the other teachers were looking at us with annoyance. But we couldn’t help ourselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Shh</i>,  <i class="calibre4">shh</i>. Keep your voices down a bit. Also, about this video. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-sensei continued with a wry smile. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>“The quality between the first and second halves is different, so I hope you guys work on that…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first half and second half!? Is she implying there’s a difference between what Nito and I made!? Well, yeah, of  <i class="calibre4">course </i> there is, but did she really have to point that out?! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah! I knew it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Igarashi-san agreed apparently, as she stood there grinning for some reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The part Chika made is wayyy better, isn’t it!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ahaha</i>, well, can’t really do much about that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai, too, just laughed away and didn’t deny the difference in quality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s keep at it and improve your skills from here on out. Sound good, Meguri?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, sounds good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean, come on, this was my very first time editing a video, and I went into it completely blind. But, as she says, I’ll keep at it from here on out, for sure…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, also…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a slightly probing voice, Chiyoda-senpai said, “This is just a suggestion, but…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, what is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it’s okay with you guys. . would you make me the advisor of the Astronomy Club?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My brain couldn’t process what she was saying for a second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito seemed to be in the same boat, as she had a vacant expression on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You, as our advisor, Chiyoda-sensei?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-senpai nodded to us. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a>“I’ve actually been asked by the head teacher of the grade to be a club advisor for a while now, within the limits of what I can do. I was a bit hesitant since I don’t have much experience, but. . with you guys, if it’s for the Astronomy Club’s activities, I’d really love to support you and give it a try.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued, “Besides, you guys are going to have stargazing activities at night, correct? In that case, you need someone to supervise. It should be beneficial for everyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right, yeah, that makes sense. We’d definitely need that kind of arrangement for students to meet for club activities at night…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Fair warning, I can’t be with you all the time because I have young children, but would you consider letting me take the role?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spoiler alert—we welcomed her with open arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, Chiyoda-sensei became the advisor of the Astronomy Club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">There were also changes for future Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um… so she ended up disappearing again, as usual.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was back in the present timeline after the club’s survival had been decided, to check on the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Matoko sounded like she was having a hard time saying it, and for some unknown reason, seemed apologetic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She became uncontactable a week before the graduation ceremony, same as before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I’d been prepared for that. All I’ve managed to do so far is keep the club alive. Actually dealing with Nito’s issues in a more serious way will happen from now on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why I didn’t think everything would be solved so easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That said—</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>“But… the contents of the letter have apparently changed a little,” Makoto continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh, the contents? How?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Before, at a glance, it seemed like a suicide note, didn’t it? That’s how it was reported in the news, anyway. But this time…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto looked up at me and met my eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And with a kind of awkward smile, she said, “Apparently now it says</p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Please don’t look for me. I’m going to live somewhere far away’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Oh, I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding, I sat down on a nearby chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Going to live somewhere far away’. . I see. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something warm welled up in his chest. For the first time, I clearly felt a sense of accomplishment. I’d managed to change the future by rewriting it. At the very least, Nito isn’t dead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was enough to make my hands tremble. Enough to make me want to cry tears of joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, back on the school rooftop, under the starry sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Hey, Meguri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nito peered through the telescope, she suddenly called out to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks… for everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .No, no,  <i class="calibre4">I </i> should be the one thanking  <i class="calibre4">you</i>,” I replied with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks to your help, we were able to finish the video. Honestly, if it weren’t for you, the club might’ve really been finished.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aw, you’re exaggerating. Besides… it’s not just about that. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lifting her head from the telescope, Nito turned to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You promised me, didn’t you?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>My heart skipped a beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You said you would stay by my side, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yeah…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I scratched my head in embarrassment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I definitely did say that, and those were my true feelings… but to be told so bluntly was friggin’ embarrassing. The late night mood could’ve been the reason she was being so forward…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You worked so hard… ‘cause of that… didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nito continued speaking she leaned her body closer to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You tried to keep the club going to be by my side, to protect me, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was lost for words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did she know? She was spot on, just like she’d been the other day. That I’ve been working so hard to save her, to rewrite the future, and prevent her from disappearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I decided to stay by her side. I didn’t care how much hardship or effort it took to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, I was planning to keep all that a secret. I was doing it because I wanted to, not because I wanted Nito to owe me anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And honestly, there’s no way she would have understood why I wanted to help without first knowing about my plan to rewrite the future. So, I was planning to keep it a secret until the end…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Hehehe</i>, you’re making a face like ‘How did she know?’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito peered into my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She seemed to be enjoying herself, giggling with a hand covering her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can just tell, y’know…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Oh, I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe Nito  <i class="calibre4">could </i> do things like that. She’d make a big name for herself in the music world. She’s a once-in-a-lifetime genius with an incredible sensitivity 170</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>for things. From Nito’s perspective, my thoughts might be surprisingly transparent. So, even if it was surprising that Nito noticed my true intentions, it didn’t feel strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I like you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito took a step back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I like you, Meguri.” </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wgGkZKN/index-179-1.jpg" alt="index-179-1" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Hearing her say that completely threw me for a loop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My heart was pounding. Heat surged through my entire body. All the words inside my head seemed to fly away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you, Meguri? How do you feel about me?” She asked, peering at my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a complete reversal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the total opposite of when I confessed to Nito before the rewrite. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no sign of tension or anxiety on her face; she was simply looking straight at me—</p>
<p class="calibre1">It felt like the whole world was there. In Nito’s clear eyes, and what was flickering beyond them. In her school uniform, and her slender body inside it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the delicacy of her fingers and lips—and the emotions hidden within her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think this must be the world. Something profound that’s still unknown to me. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a>“I. . I like you too!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I almost got lost in it for a second, but then I managed to squeeze out an answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve always liked you! Since the day of the entrance ceremony!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ahaha</i>, I’m glad.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito laughed, blushing a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, as if it were the most natural thing in the world, or like she was inviting me to have lunch together—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, let’s go out, the two of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In that instant my mind overheated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Joy, embarrassment, and confusion completely broke my brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My lips suddenly felt hot. My hands started to shake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, there was no reason to turn her down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-yeah… let’s do it!” I said, my voice shaking with determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s go out!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yay!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stood up and bumped her shoulder against mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fragrant scent, like flowers, tickled my nostrils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright then. . let’s be boyfriend and girlfriend from now on, Meguri. Let’s take care of each other, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-yeah. Let’s take care of each other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was acutely aware of the smile plastered on my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is crazy. . I’m so happy. I’m so incredibly happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How could things change so much from my first high school life? I never thought that such a happy future, way beyond what I imagined, would be waiting for me…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking up, I felt like there were more stars twinkling in the sky than before. It was as if they were blessing us, and my heart filled with even more joy—</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>“. .B-but, are you sure you want  <i class="calibre4">me</i>?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It felt like a dream, so I couldn’t help asking her that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are heaps of guys out there who are much better than me… is it really okay for me to be your boyfriend?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s you I want, Meguri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t know if I’m really worthy of being told that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Of course you are. I know a lot about you, Meguri. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito took a step back, and her cheeks relaxed as she peered into my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can be kinda lazy and carefree, but you’re actually a really hard worker.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Am I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can be pretty slow and not very perceptive, but you’re actually very kind and considerate to your friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .You’re giving me too much credit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve got no clue how to react when she compliments me so much to my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s probably because I’ve hardly ever received compliments from anyone…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope, I’m not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, if you say so. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not done yet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued, “You treat everyone equally. You get along well with girls too, as friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I started to feel a bit uncomfortable about what she was saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Getting along well with girls, as friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure, Igarashi-san and I are friends, but can we really say we’re that close at this point? Makoto and I will become good friends, but that’s a story for next year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Also, you’re actually very caring towards your juniors,” Nito said. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>“You regret your own mistakes, and if you can redo things to fix them, you try your absolute hardest to do that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you mean by that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was completely speechless and couldn’t move a muscle. She had perfectly nailed the situation. She tilted her head with a puzzled look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She walked over to me, bringing her face close to mine, and…</p>
<p class="calibre1">…Briefly touched her lips to mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was my first kiss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ehehe</i>. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito giggled shyly, her cheeks turning crimson. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an expression she’d never shown me before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You came from the future, didn’t you?” Nito asked me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meguri, you returned from the future to save me, didn’t you?” </p>
</body></html>
