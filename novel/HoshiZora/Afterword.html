    <h2>Afterword</h2>
    
<p class="calibre1">Good morning, good afternoon, and good evening. It’s Misaki Saginomiya here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, I don’t have many regrets personally. Of course, I make frequent mistakes, and there are times when I think, “If only I had done things differently, the outcome might have been different.” But I have a sense of satisfaction that I have thought enough and made efforts throughout the process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, while I do feel down and get discouraged (quite often), I don’t have many regrets. . It seems like I’m living a very fulfilling life, doesn’t it? Like living without regrets, like giving it my all every day. I don’t lack confidence in that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But recently, I started to wonder, “Is that really enough?” Because doesn’t that mean I’m thinking I don’t have any “choices”? Am I just living to avoid making mistakes? Isn’t making mistakes and having regrets an important part of life? Isn’t it through those experiences that we can create something? That’s why this work,  <i class="calibre4">Ashita, Hadashi de Koi</i>, became a work that encompasses my yearning for those “mistakes” and “regrets”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The story begins after Sakamoto finishes his high school life filled with mistakes. Certainly, he regrets and feels down at times. The days he experiences in the story are surely very valuable. I want to portray that properly. But also, the other days. The days spent in carelessness and inertia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those days are beautiful in their own way. If I can affirm those as well, Sakamoto might truly obtain what he truly desires. That’s how I feel now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Youth cannot be spent without mistakes, after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. .And so, that was Volume 1 of  <i class="calibre4">Ashita, Hadashi de Koi</i>. It follows the two previous works,  <i class="calibre4">The Reader, the Protagonist, and the Two of Us, From Here On</i> and  <i class="calibre4">The Distance of a Triangle is Endless Zero</i>, with Hiten-san. It feels somewhat strange, doesn’t it?  <i class="calibre4">The Distance of a Triangle </i> was a work that lasted for about five years from the planning stage to the present. During that time, I also worked on several other new works. . But to start a new work with Hiten-san again, it feels both fresh and nostalgic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have changed a lot over these five years. Thanks to the positive reception of  <i class="calibre4">The Distance of a Triangle</i>, I gained confidence and a bit of ease in my 176</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a>feelings. But at the same time, I think there are things I’ve lost as well. The thoughts I had back then and the thoughts I have now are completely different, and when I reread  <i class="calibre4">The Distance of a Triangle</i>, there are moments where I’m startled by my own behavior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Starting to write scripts was also a significant change. Theater is truly fascinating. I’m completely engrossed in it. I think it will have a big impact on my future storytelling as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The world has changed a lot too. I never expected things to turn out like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The world as a whole, including Japan, and even the publishing industry, within a smaller scope. I myself have gone through some difficult times, but there are surely others who have gone through even more difficult times or are still going through them. I feel that even the way stories are necessary for the world has changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, the production system has undergone significant changes. My long-time editor, Mr. K, who has been with me for nearly ten years since my debut, has moved to a new place. For this work, I collaborated with the promising new editor, Mr. S. With their completely different editor characters and expertise, it was quite interesting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So. . everything has truly changed. The circumstances have changed since I worked on  <i class="calibre4">The Distance of a Triangle</i>. Therefore, I strongly aimed to make this work,  <i class="calibre4">Ashita, Hadashi de Koi</i>, a work of “myself in 2022”. I didn’t really try to follow trends, but I definitely wanted it to be a contemporary work, a work of a contemporary author. So, this time, I aimed for the “best work” in this situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were challenges and doubts, and there are probably some parts that are wrong. But if those things can ultimately contribute to the power of the work, just like Sakamoto and his mistakes, that would be great. I hope  <i class="calibre4">Ashita,</i> <i class="calibre4">Hadashi de Koi </i> becomes a necessary work for you in the present moment. Well then, let’s meet again in the next volume. See you. </p>
