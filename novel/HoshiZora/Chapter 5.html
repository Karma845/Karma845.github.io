    <h2>Chapter 5: Something About Us</h2>
    
<p class="calibre1">“Nito!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Let’s just talk for now. </i> That’s the promise we made before coming to the park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there, right next to her house, was Nito—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Hey, you okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was sitting on a bench, her head hung slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a little past 10 pm. Darkness, like the deep sea, surrounded her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m pretty sure in the daytime this place is bright and open. Neighborhood kids come to play here, their energetic voices echoing in this fun space. And yet—no, maybe  <i class="calibre4">because </i> of that—the swings, slides, sandboxes, and play equipment in the dark of night feel kind of distant, making me feel as if I’ve seen something I shouldn’t have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in the middle of that scene, Nito. She was wearing sandals that looked a bit like clogs, and a light T-shirt. She sat silently in a pair of comfy pants you’d wear around the house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had a laptop on her lap. Most likely the laptop she was using not long ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Everything was going so smoothly,” she said in a terribly raspy voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her gloomy tone didn’t match her usual self at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I put all the material together as planned, and all that’s left is fine-tuning and adding captions, so it’s not difficult at all…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito raised her head as I nodded, looking at me with pleading eyes. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>“It was looking like I’d be done before midnight, and I could tell everyone I finished earlier than I thought. I was happily working away, wondering if everyone would praise me and how nice it’d be if the video gets some views, even just a few…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Go on…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded deeply in response to her plea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito seemed really upset. That being so, I first wanted to make sure to listen carefully to what she had to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito slightly lifted up the laptop she was holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This laptop is really old.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She continued in an even smaller voice than before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think my dad gave it to me as a hand-me-down, maybe seven, eight years ago. But it was working fine, you know? It never had any weird glitches or anything. Sure, it was a bit heavy, but. . suddenly, the screen stopped working…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito dropped her shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think it’s physically busted…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding, I took a deep breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I’m really sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, her head down, sounded like she’d burst into tears at any moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What should I do? At this rate, it won’t be ready by tomorrow… Everyone worked so hard… What should I do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the sound of her voice, I wondered if she’d already started crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt a pang of pain in my chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not Nito’s fault, it’s mine. Because I left the editing to her, we ended up in this situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not something for you to worry about, Nito. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I desperately tried to convey that to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If anyone’s at fault, it’s me. So firstly, don’t blame yourself so much…” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>That’s right, Nito shouldn’t feel so responsible. It’s mostly my screw-up that led to this, so Nito doesn’t have to shoulder everything by herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .That’s not it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shook her head vigorously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked up and called out to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amidst the radiant glow, tears began to spill from her large, gem-like eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Why did it have to turn out like this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s when Nito started pouring her heart out to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought things would go smoothly this time, but why is it turning out like this.. when we are so close. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt a small jolt of surprise hearing her shaky voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong? You don’t need to blame yourself so much…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were definitely in a pinch, and there wasn’t a moment to spare. But. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">something was off with Nito. This was the first time I’d seen her so upset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s always like this for me. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s mouth twisted in self-mockery as I was left speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m so  <i class="calibre4">sick </i> of it. . Making everyone feel like this.. It always ends up like this. I get their hopes up and then betray them. But I can’t stop it. . Why is it always like this!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Always like this? Making everyone feel like this? Betraying them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t understand. I don’t know what she’s thinking, or what experiences led her to say those things. If anything, hasn’t Nito more than exceeded people’s expectations.. ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nito. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time I questioned it, I also understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These were… her true feelings. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>No longer able to keep up her appearances, nor even care about them anymore, her feelings poured out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally, I thought Nito was good at controlling her emotions. She was a model student in class, a laid-back girl in the club room, and mysterious and charismatic as a musician. I was able to keep her like that in my mind… and only once failed to do so. When she disappeared, abandoning everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And that girl—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No matter how hard I try, it’s always the same…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Was now saying that, lips trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even though I finally got to meet you, Meguri. Even though we became friends like this…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, looks like we’re getting to the heart of the matter now. What Nito is showing me now is a side of her I didn’t see in the first three years of knowing her. And, it’s a side she’s never shown me from the start of the rewrite until today. I’m seeing it, right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t care about myself anymore. . I deserve what’s coming to me. But then, if we all gather like this again. . I’m sure I’ll just end up hurting everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll ruin everything for everyone. . If that’s the case, I. . I should. . I should just. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with a girl in this state in front of me, even in front of a suffering Nito… it was strange. My feelings were as calm as the water’s surface without wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking up, I saw stars dotting the night sky, shining through the silhouette of the buildings. The fleeting specks of light were like glitter spilled on black construction paper. The lights of an airplane flickered as it crossed the sky from north to south. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—There are so many things I don’t understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—There are so many things I don’t know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">About Nito, what she’s dealing with, or what will happen to us from now on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But still, it’s clear as day what I should do. There’s no doubt in my mind—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s going to be alright.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">By saying it out loud, I reaffirmed how calm I was. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>With such a serious problem at hand, it’s obvious we’re up against the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So why was I not panicking, or getting anxious? Quite the opposite—my mind had never been clearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sure we can figure something out. So, please calm down, Nito.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I feel as though a switch has been flipped inside me. What does this mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why am I so calm. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment’s thought, I quickly came to an answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito is in pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She might even be crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, what should I do? What was the reason I decided to rewrite my three years of high school? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To save Nito. </p>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Gx0435P/index-161-1.jpg" alt="index-161-1" border="0"></a>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>If that’s the case, then now is the time. I’ll do everything within my power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ll confront the situation before me as the person I am. Now. . I believe I can do that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna check the situation,” I said as softly as possible to Nito as she looked at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The material is all still there, right? And the edited files we’ve made so far haven’t been deleted?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, they’re on the cloud.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She nodded, still visibly upset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I might not have been able to save the work I did just before it broke. . But I can check the files from my phone. . I even have them on a USB stick, just in case.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So basically the biggest problem is we don’t have a computer to work on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We probably can’t use a family computer, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right. The only other one we have is my dad’s computer, but he probably has it at work, and even if he had it at home, I don’t think he’d let us use it because it might have confidential information on it. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, that certainly makes sense. Handling company PCs is definitely a top priority for companies, and it’s unthinkable for an outsider to use them. Even  <i class="calibre4">if</i> it’s the daughter of an employee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What about an external monitor? If the laptop’s one is broken, we might be able to output the image to an external monitor.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, we don’t have that either. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No worries. You also don’t have a tablet or anything like that either, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks. I understand the situation now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m really sorry. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s voice trembled again as she hung her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What should I do…? If we can’t make it in time because of this… What am I supposed to do…?” </p>
>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>“It’s okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took a deep breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have a clear understanding of the situation I’m in. Of what I should do next and what I should tell Nito—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll do it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I made sure to say it loud and clear, with all my strength, so it would reach her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll take over the rest of the editing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She snapped her head up. Her voice was stiff as she asked, “Meguri, you’re going to edit it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. We have a laptop in the living room, so I’ll just bring it to my room and work on it. You can send me the files that are on the cloud from your phone, and I can work from where you left off, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .But you don’t have the editing software do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll buy it when I get home. They sell it online for people to download, don’t they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They do… but…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So I’ll beg my parents to buy it right now, and I’ll try to learn how to use it as I go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“B-but that’s…. it’s not cheap…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s voice deepened in surprise. She probably hadn’t expected me to suggest that idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean yeah, it definitely isn’t cheap,” I admitted with a candid laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But there are student discounts, so it won’t be too bad. Besides, we’re going to be making videos regularly from now on, aren’t we? It’s not fair to leave all the editing to you, Nito. Sooner or later, it’s something we’ll have to do anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s right—Nito will become increasingly busy from now on. As she becomes successful as a musician, she’ll have less free time. The window of opportunity to ask her for help with editing is closing fast. So, I need to learn 156</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>how to edit myself. No matter what we decide right now, that’s going to happen anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .It’s gonna be difficult, you know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if pressing her point further, Nitto added, “Working with software you’re not used to, I mean. It might take all night. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If ‘tough’ is all it’s gonna be, then it’ll be a piece of cake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help laughing as I said that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, in this world, there are plenty of things that you can’t undo. If a bit of hardship is all it takes to avoid those, then we’re actually pretty lucky, I’d say.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, I see,” Nito said, sounding as if she was chewing on my words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought I saw a flicker of light illuminate her face. Maybe the moon was peeking through the gap in the buildings above us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay then. . got it. Thank you, Meguri. Please let me rely on you. . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, leave it to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Please let me rely on you. </i> Those words lit a fire in my chest. Just hearing Nito say them gave me an almost infinite surge of energy. I could pull an all nighter, no sweat, or even work non-stop for three days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .U-um listen.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito stood up from the bench. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She started mumbling hesitantly—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well okay, in that case… I have a proposal. You see, today, it’s actually just me at home. My parents are at work and my sister won’t be back from her drinking party until morning. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .R-really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, um. .” she started off, leaning into peer at my flustered face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If our parents allow it. . would you like to work together at my place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>After a few hours of work, it was already past 2 am. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only sounds were the whirring of my laptop’s fan, the clicking of my mouse, and the preview audio from the video. And, Nito’s voice here and there—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh, we’re a completely normal family.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were in Nito’s room, at her computer desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito spoke in a hoarse voice behind me as I faced the screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My dad, mom, older sister, and I all live together. We’re not a particularly musical family though, just a normal one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, really? That’s surprising. I figured your family background was more unique.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My parents aren’t around much because my dad works on a ship and my mom works in publishing… They’re just regular office workers really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the dimly lit room, the laptop monitor in front of me shone brightly, like a portal into another world. It felt like we were the only ones left on Earth, having an intergalactic chat with another planet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After psyching myself up for a possible fight with my parents, I somehow convinced them to buy the editing software. My random request must’ve taken them aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My parents kept asking for reasons over and over again, and were worried I was trying to pull the wool over their eyes. But once I explained the necessity of this software for our club activities, and that it’d be useful in the future, they understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That said, they were dead set against me going to Nito’s house. I couldn’t bring myself to lie, so I explained everything honestly… and copped an earful as a result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">— <i class="calibre4">“You’re only fifteen years old.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">— <i class="calibre4">“And besides, she’s a girl, isn’t she?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">— <i class="calibre4">“It just makes no sense. Not happening.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">All valid arguments. If I were in their shoes, I would’ve said exactly the same thing to my kid. There’s no way parents would approve of high school boys and girls spending a whole night together. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>But when I didn’t budge, my parents gradually started to get the hint that, </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This must be really important.” In the end, after Nito’s parents and my parents talked on the phone and introduced themselves, we were given special permission to do it. For that, I can’t really thank my understanding parents enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, I spent about an hour downloading and installing the software before heading over to Nito’s place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll do the work after all! If you lend me your computer, that’s more than enough!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I firmly turned down her offer and started doing the work myself. Truth be told, it was my mistake that got us into this mess. It would’ve been better to do it this way right from the start, without relying on Nito. Honestly, it’s all my fault, so I have to take responsibility and fix it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, after reluctantly receiving a tutorial from Nito, I had a rough grasp of how to use the software. I learned how to edit and arrange clips, and add captions. I had no problem with basic stuff like that, and I got a good pace going. Of course, in terms of quality, my work couldn’t hold a candle to the parts handled by Nito. At this rate, though, I should be able to get everything done before the sun comes up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, as I continued editing the video on my own, I chatted sporadically with Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mone is really special, isn’t she?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, yeah, I s’pose so. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think she’s probably going to be my best friend for life. We’ve known each other for so long, y’know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since kindergarten, right? Igarashi-san told me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, you two talked about that too. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Why do you sound so unhappy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m just a little worried you might steal Mone away from me. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You too, Nito!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I remember when I copied Minase-san’s hairstyle.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? You had short hair? When?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>“Um, in junior high. I was really obsessed with her back then.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you grew it out after that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep. I was so in love with her that I was afraid I’d end up copying everything about her, from her music taste to her favorite books.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, I see. I would’ve liked to see you with short hair.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our conversation was random, from our childhood memories, to family, to Nito’s relationship with Igarashi-san, and her admiration for Minase-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s sounded sleepy, but for that reason, it felt like I was hearing her true feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, this is it. Us talking like this was exactly the kind of relationship I wanted. I mean, I think I wanted it so badly I was willing to rewrite three whole years of high school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the conversation moved on to music. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know, I clearly remember the day I decided to dedicate my life to music,” Nito murmured, as the clock inched towards 4 am. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh really? Was there something that triggered it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s not so much a trigger, but you know, back in junior high, they told me I could play the piano in the music room after school. So, I started spending hours and hours every day playing and singing, and that became my routine before going home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if she were telling an old story, Nito’s words began spilling out of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was  <i class="calibre4">really </i> fun. I thought it was more fun than anything else. Honestly, up until then, I hadn’t really been enjoying life very much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait… you’re kidding, right? Even Igarashi-san said that you were always amazing, even back when you were a kid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could hardly believe my ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san described her as a superheroine, like a character out of Pretty Cure. It’s hard to believe someone like that couldn’t enjoy life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s not exactly true. .” Nito said, with a hint of self-mockery. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>“It’s not like  <i class="calibre4">nothing </i> was fun at all, but everything I did was only a little bit enjoyable. Even as a kid, I’d wonder, ‘Can I really keep going like this?’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I get you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I nodded, a thought came to me. Maybe she’d just been pretending all this time. Even now, Nito acts the part of a model student in class, just as she’d been playing a superheroine since she was young—hiding another side of herself in her heart. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m truly realizing it once again. Right now, I’m connecting with Nito Chika as a human being. Not as a genius musician, nor as a former lover harboring regrets, but Nito Chika as a person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But even for someone like me, even with all my issues, I really enjoyed playing the piano. When I was making music, it made me unbelievably happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“One day, as I was heading up the stairs to the music room after school, I had this random thought.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, a scene flashed in my mind—</p>
<p class="calibre1">The dimly lit staircase in the evening. The faint light shining through the window. The smell of varnish, the posters on the walls, and the distant sound of shouts from the sports clubs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in that scene… the hope reflected in her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With this, I feel like I can keep going,” Nito said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With music. . I can keep on walking through this long life.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s voice was trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It sounded as if she was singing the joy of that moment, and a thrill ran through my chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we have this kind of relationship—one where we could talk about our childhood memories late at night. If we could keep things like this. . who knows, maybe the future might change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt like I could do anything if it was for that. I felt like I could endure any sort of hardship or pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, by the way, I talked to Minase-san on the phone yesterday.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a>Nito’s expression changed in an instant, as if she’d remembered something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s official. The creation of Integrate Mag and my affiliation has been decided.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, really? Congrats!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I knew it was going to happen, but I still felt happy hearing the news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s great, getting to work with the person you admire. There’s nothing happier than that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I’m really happy. But, uh. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What’s wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito hesitated and started to stumble over her words. Her voice had never sounded like that before, and I couldn’t help but stop what I was doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is there something you’re not happy about? Like about the contract or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, no, nothing like that. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, as if to no one in particular, she muttered, “Hey. . I wonder what’ll happen…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stared out the window at the lightless city as she spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I. . I wonder what’s gonna happen to us. Can we really get through this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The anxiety in Nito’s voice was obvious. Beyond that hoarse and trembling voice lay her barefoot emotions<a href="#p171"><b class="calibre3">¹</b>. </a></p>
<p class="calibre1">She was already feeling uneasy at this point, questioning whether she could continue with music, or whether she could manage to live a good life. And she <i class="calibre4">had </i> failed once already—in her first high school life. She’d reached a breaking point somewhere along the way, leading to her disappearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That being the case—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s going to be okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I smiled at the girl next to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ll be fine, Nito.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really. If anything happens, I’ll help you. So, don’t worry.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>Maybe I was going too far. Saying things like this might give away my feelings. But still, I wanted to express myself. I wanted her to know my true feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thank you,” Nito said with a soft smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay then, promise me. Promise me that you’ll always stay by my side.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I promise.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t abandon me, okay? When I’m in trouble, come rescue me, got it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Absolutely. Now then…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I clicked the mouse and stretched my arms out wide. I glanced up at the clock—nearly 5 am. The sun would rise soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking out the window next to the desk, I saw the pale light of morning filling the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s house was on the fifth floor of an apartment building, and from here, I could see the school, the station, and the city of Ogikubo where I lived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The day was beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we took another step closer in our relationship, a new day dawned for us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After I filled my lungs with morning air, I clicked on the screen a few more times—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s done, Nito. The video. . it’s finished!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow…!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Just to be sure, could you check it over for me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, got it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We switched places and Nito checked over the video. The freshly edited footage started playing on the monitor. It was a video showcasing the activities of our club, filmed right in our club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I figured that this must be the beginning. Rewriting our high school lives, with this video as the starting point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With exhaustion and a sense of accomplishment coursing through my body, I burned the flowing images on the monitor into my brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito finished her final check of the video—</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a>“Okay. Yep, it’s perfect!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She glanced back at me with a smile plastered on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re amazing, for doing all this on your first try…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? That’s a relief. We managed to make it in time! Somehow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m really sorry. I’ve been a real pain, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, it’s all good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alright. . with this, we’re done for today. Now all I needed to do was go home, take a quick nap, and show everyone the video in the club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once I hit upload, our activity achievement will be complete, and the Astronomy Club could continue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Whew</i>. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling relieved, I unconsciously flopped onto the desk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito let out a short laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Thanks, Meguri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice was full of happiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She took a small breath, and just like in response to my confession that day—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“From now on… let’s support each other, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a href="#p169"><b class="calibre3">¹ </b></a>“<i class="calibre4">Barefoot emotions</i>” (hadashi no kanjou) is a metaphorical Japanese phrase rarely used in normal conversation. It’s used to depict raw, unguarded, and vulnerable emotions. It’s pretty obvious the author uses it here as a throwback to the title. </p>
