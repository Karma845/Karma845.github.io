    <h2>Chapter 2: Spring Time Machine Disco</h2>
    
    <p class="calibre1">Predicting things is the most interesting game in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has never once gotten old for me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—If I put my head down and start studying seriously for a test, I probably won’t fail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—If I make an effort to socialize with people more this year, I can make friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—If I talk to Nito during the next break, I can patch things up with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—If I knuckle down and study hard for entrance exams this summer, I might be able to scrape through and get into a university. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relying on those “predictions”, I fooled myself into thinking I still had some potential and ended up endlessly procrastinating. And by the time I realized they were more like  <i class="calibre4">delusions </i> than actual  <i class="calibre4">predictions</i>, it was already too late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was too late to recover that lost time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that point, I couldn’t really change my attitude anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wasted time pointlessly, not lifting a finger… and now I’m stuck with this disappointing present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s more or less how my high school life ended…</p>
<p class="calibre1">And today, here I am, having made several more predictions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, though, it’s not a delusion. It’s a genuine prediction. Hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, it’s still just a theory, but…” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>I showed Makoto the notebook I had hastily written last night, sacrificing my precious sleep in the process. I pointed to the jam-packed page where that theory was written. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna test it first. To see if my prediction is correct. As in, if it’s really possible to change the past!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is probably the most motivated I’ve been since starting high school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something unfamiliar and hot was rising up in my chest. Maybe this is what they call “hope.” When I saw that faint glimmer of possibility, I couldn’t help but seize the moment and take action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, compared to how wound up  <i class="calibre4">I </i> was—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.”’</p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto, sitting across from me, lethargically sipped her iced tea through a straw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned away and stared out the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Change the past, to save Nito-senpai. . is that the TLDR?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the day after the graduation ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite it being midday, the fast-food joint near our school was packed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were men in suits who appeared to be working, and young people around our age who seemed to be studying. A group of lively uni students sat at a nearby table. Just the sight of them was enough to drain my mental energy, knowing I was a ronin now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now isn’t the time to talk about stuff like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The matter at hand was yesterday’s mysterious phenomenon. Based on that, I’d constructed a theory. One that could save Nito by changing the past. And, I was determined to test it out, no matter what it took. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I need your help, Makoto!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, I delivered my heartfelt plea to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look, I’m a graduate now. I can’t get into the school without your help, </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘cause you’re still a student.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The trigger for time travel is likely playing the piano. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a>By playing Nito’s song, I was sent back three years to the day of the entrance ceremony. And then I came back to the present by playing it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, the trigger  <i class="calibre4">has </i> to be the piano. In short, if I touched those keys again, if I played Nito’s song in the Astronomy Club Room—I just might be able to travel back three years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure, there were a lot of uncertainties. Like, there’s no guarantee the piano was the real trigger, and even if I  <i class="calibre4">could </i> travel to the past, I didn’t know if it’d be the  <i class="calibre4">same </i> past as the one three years ago. As long as I didn’t know the rules behind it, anything could happen. That being so, all I needed to do was experiment. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/XVmb8Sd/index-42-1.jpg" alt="index-42-1" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p43"></a>Well, there’s no point just thinking about it, I have to test it out and see the results. For that to happen I needed Makoto’s help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why I asked Makoto to meet up with me today on such short notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Makoto seemed surprisingly lethargic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Senpai, you sometimes get like this, don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto let out a bored sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s like you’re a science geek or something. You’re just throwing all these technical terms at me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. . yeah, I s’pose you’re right. Sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As someone who once aspired to be an astronomer, I sometimes get carried away with my explanations. I guess some people might just say I’m an otaku who talks too fast. My grades were too shit to confidently call myself a science major though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makota finally turned to face me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…I think it’s impossible, to be honest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Impossible? What is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Everything, from start to finish.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing her arms and tilting her head slightly, Makoto continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Time travel? Changing the past? You don’t seriously believe that’s possible, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Uh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, you can’t just expect me to suddenly believe something like. It’s just too much of a stretch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had a point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, yeah—going back in time was something you only saw in Sci-Fi manga and anime. Even  <i class="calibre4">if </i> it’s possible, saving Nito is a huge leap to make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But Makoto, didn’t you say your memories changed?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, that’s true.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>Makoto gave an immediate nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s true my memories have changed from you being a loner to actually having friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See? That’s proof, isn’t it? Proof that the past was changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, I think it was just a misunderstanding. Maybe both of us were just confused and temporarily went a bit loopy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You really think so?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s more likely than time traveling back three years, isn’t it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Uh, hmm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another fair point. It’s hard for me to argue with that…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Plus, even if you  <i class="calibre4">can </i> change it, what’re you planning to actually do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">How’re you going to save Nito-senpai?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh! Yes, about that…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I flipped through the pages of my notebook and moved from the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phenomenon Analysis” section to the “Nito Rescue Plan” section. I’d carefully planned that part too, of course. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are lots of things to think about, but I figured priority number one should be the Astronomy Club’s survival.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The Astronomy Club?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep. It was disbanded after my first year. We kept using the club room without permission for a while, but it was basically just squatting at that point.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Astronomy Club where Nito and I met. When we started high school, it was hanging on by a thread. That year, it fell below the minimum number of members required and was disbanded by the time our second year rolled around. In turn, it was one of the main reasons Nito and I drifted apart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, we continued using the club room without permission, and Makoto, who came later, also hung out there. But there’s no doubt that it deepened the rift between Nito and me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I should add, because of that, Makoto isn’t technically a “junior of the Astronomy Club.” Instead, she’s more like a fellow member of club room squatters. When you put it like that, it kind of has a student protest vibe to it. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>“So, first, I’m thinking of recruiting members to stop the club from disappearing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mm. And how exactly is that gonna save Nito-senpai? Like, if the Astronomy Club exists, Nito-senpai won’t disappear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Well, I was thinking about a lot of things yesterday.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I crossed my arms and looked down at the table. An ad for a part time job was stuck to my tray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Would you like to join our staff? Hourly wages starting from 960 yen~. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Students and housewives welcome.』</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her music career seemed seriously tough, especially after second year. I dunno how to put it—she was really famous but she became gloomier than before. She seemed more like the singer NITO even when she was at school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Really? I probably didn’t notice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well, I guess I didn’t really notice it back then either. But you know, I was going through old pictures on my phone recently, and I remembered something. Maybe because of the gap between my perception and reality, I always thought, 'Wow, Nito is amazing,' and that she was doing great. But maybe there were signs that it wasn’t really like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were pictures of Nito from her first and second year, and some playful videos that I’d taken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While subtle, I thought I caught glimpses of Nito’s changes in them. Her sad look and the lack of energy in her voice. The random negative comments, or the fact that she wasn’t as talkative. Maybe those were her signs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honestly, though, I can’t be sure if that’ll lead to the reason for her disappearance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d be the first to admit that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reality was there’d been no new info from the authorities since. There was rampant speculation online about the cause, but at the end of the day, they were all just rumors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She might’ve disappeared for reasons completely beyond my imagination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know what? I thought the first step was to be there for her, and be the kind of person she could talk to about her problems. But to be honest, I ended 38</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>up giving up, and we drifted apart. Now, though, I really wanna step up and support her, in a way that truly matters.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s why I wanna give it a shot. I need your help so I can play the piano in the club room.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto fiddled with the wrapper of her straw with her fingertips. The damp wrapper gradually crumbled under her nails. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the very least, it didn’t look like she agreed with my opinion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Why do you seem so against it?” I asked hesitantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You still don’t believe it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not  <i class="calibre4">just </i> that I don’t believe it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto leaned her elbow on the table. She stared out the window and let out a sigh tinged with sadness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Is it really okay to change the past?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Hey, you guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha—?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone abruptly called out to us from behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled, I spun around…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Who’re you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was someone I didn’t know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A random young guy was standing behind us. He had a dignified and well-defined face, a slight wrinkle between his eyebrows, thin lips that exuded confidence, and a well-toned body. He appeared to be in his early twenties, give or take a few years. He had this kind of. . intimidating aura, like a tough older brother, as he looked down on us. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Huh? What’s this? Don’t tell me we’re about to get mugged or something. .? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I was having lunch with my friends over there and happened to overhear your conversation.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, s-sorry. Were we being too loud!?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>“Nah, not that. Do you guys by any chance. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lowered his voice a bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .know Nito?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Errr, um. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah right, did he hear us mention her name? Oops, I should’ve lowered my voice a bit. But, how should I respond? Is it okay to say we know Nito? She’s a celebrity, so should we keep it a secret? Plus, this guy looks kind of scary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I glanced at Makoto for help, but she was looking out the window, pretending not to notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, I can’t blame her. Even as a guy, I’m pretty scared in a situation like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Yeah. We went to the same school as her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After hesitating for a bit, I decided to answer honestly. Besides, it felt like lying to this person would be difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, um, we’re pretty worried about her. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Figured as much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He let out a short breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, I’m also an alumni from that school. Graduated last year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I see. So you’re a senpai. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gave a small nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something about his gesture was boyish, making him seem less of a delinquent than I initially thought. At first glance, he definitely  <i class="calibre4">seemed </i> like a tough guy—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Wait! Rokuyo-senpai!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help yelling as it suddenly clicked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re Haruki Rokuyo-senpai, aren’t you!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That well-defined face and commanding presence. No doubt about it. I remember seeing him numerous times at school. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>This was Rokuyo-senpai, who was so famous at our high school that not a single person hadn’t heard of him. He was the heart of the popular crowd, excelling in both sports and academics. But, he wasn’t the flashy type. He was serious and straightforward, and if something didn’t sit right with him, he would speak up to both teachers and seniors. It’s like he stepped out of a badass battle manga or something—that’s who the famous Rokuyo-senpai was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yeah, that’s me. You know my name and everything, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, anyone who went to our school would remember you. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Speaking of which, the Rokuyo family are wealthy landowners in the Kichijoj<a href="#p84">i<b class="calibre3">¹ </b></a>area, and one of their ancestors is even mentioned in Japanese history textbooks. On the other side of the fence, the rising star of the Sakamoto family is my cousin Kippei-kun, who won the Minister’s Awar<a href="#p84">d<b class="calibre3">² </b></a>in an invention contest when he was still in elementary school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, about Nito—I was shocked when I saw the news too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, that’s why you asked. By the way, Rokuyo-senpai, did you know Nito?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Sort of.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai’s face clouded over slightly for some reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were working together at some events, and we talked a bit. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, right. Nito and Rokuyo-senpai were often involved in committees and event organization together. That’s probably where they interacted. But his expression seemed to imply there was more to it than that. It looked like he had some thoughts about Nito…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Did something happen?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help but ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did you and Nito have a disagreement or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, nothing like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His lips twisted into a pained expression, almost like he was making fun of himself. I didn’t know why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I guess you could say we were rivals. . No, we couldn’t even be  <i class="calibre4">that</i>.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>What did he mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What happened between them for Rokuyo-senpai to make a face like that. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before I could ask, he continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, I’ve been wondering what happened to her. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if trying to wrap up the conversation, he pushed on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then, I heard you say something about being able to help her, and I just  <i class="calibre4">had</i> to ask.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I see. . Sorry, but I don’t have much solid information either. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai reached into his pocket and took out his smartphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, give me your contact info. If you find out anything about Nito, I wanna know. If there’s anything I can do to help, I’ll do what I can for you guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh, ah, r-really. .?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a bit sudden, but I couldn’t exactly refuse when he put it that way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hesitantly took out my own smartphone and exchanged Line IDs. With a simple, “See ya”, Rokuyo-senpai returned to the table where his friends were waiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tension finally seemed to ease. Across the table, Makoto took a deep breath and let out a “Phew…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m totally exhausted. . That was so scary. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I didn’t expect to run into him, here of all places.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn’t seem like a bad guy, but the tension was overwhelming. Just being in the presence of his aura was enough to drain my energy. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anway, I don’t have the energy to think about anything anymore. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a tired expression, Makoto slurped the rest of her drink in one go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, as if resigned, she rested her chin on her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .For now, should we give going to school a try?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The way she muttered it made it sound like she was talking to herself. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>“I still don’t believe it, but let’s try it at least once.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, you’re a lifesaver.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Honestly, don’t you suck too badly at this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Astronomy Club Room, Makoto sighed deeply after I’d been struggling at the piano for nearly twenty minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why haven’t you been able to play it even once today? How’d you even manage to do it yesterday? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“J-just hold on a sec!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I played Nito’s song on my smartphone again and wiped my sweaty palms on my pants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yesterday I managed somehow ‘cause I had some momentum going. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now that I’m calmer, it’s actually pretty tough,  <i class="calibre4">haha</i>…” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I can’t play it. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s melody is just too difficult and I can’t play it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wasn’t the type to touch instruments much to begin with, and Nito’s song itself was very complex. It wasn’t just the white keys that needed to be used, but the black keys too. The hurdle was just too high for an amateur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, wasn’t it a miracle that I was even able to play it so smoothly yesterday? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahhh, what should I do? Should I make some sheet music or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, forget about tricks like that. Let’s just keep trying. C’mon, play it, play it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm, well, I guess so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I started hitting the keys again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, my fingers didn’t move the way I wanted them to, and I kept having to start over again and again. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>“If only there were notes like in rhythm games, this would be wayyy easier to play,” I grumbled to myself as I let my fingers dance on the keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m telling you, if there were notes falling from above I’d nail it without a single mistake.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sadly that only exists in the world of games.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto crossed her arms, acting coldly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t have all afternoon. If this is gonna take too long, I’ll just go home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, no, you’ve got plenty of free time, right? I mean, it’s not like you have a part-time job or plans to hang out with friends, do you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So what? There are still plenty of things to do. I wanna play Apex and I haven’t even watched the VOD of my favorite V-tuber from yester— huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto had apparently noticed something as she was speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked at my hands on the keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait. . Did you just manage to play it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I lifted my finger from the last key I just pressed. I looked down at the piano in front of me too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She might be right. I probably didn’t miss a single note just now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, somehow I actually played it—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Lights danced around me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the darkness, they began to orbit around my body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s the same as before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same phenomenon as yesterday, happening again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And gradually the lights sped up, my vision turning completely white—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Meguri-kun?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When my vision cleared—Nito was in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong? What’re you doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her glossy black hair, her eyes peering at me with curiosity, her straight posture, and the uniform that suited her slender body so well—</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>“. .A-ah, uh, that. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a slight thumping in my chest, I looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun-bleached curtains, the musty smell, an upright piano, an old radio cassette player, and an old world map with Germany divided into East and West. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s no mistaking it, this was the club room. The Astronomy Club Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As predicted, I’d returned to the day of the entrance ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, you see, I was just thinking about a lot of things…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took another look at Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Sorry, I was spacing out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite it being the second time meeting again, despite it being a sight I’d seen yesterday—Standing in front of her, my heart filled with unconditional love. Just the fact that Nito was there, having lost her once, made me uncontrollably happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unaware of my feelings, she said, “<i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>? Hey, wait a sec, you’re acting suspiciously.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito shuffled closer to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The faint scent of her shampoo, and her body heat where we touched. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, were you staring at me while you were spacing out, Meguri-kun? The fee for looking at me is 600 yen per second.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No way, that’s way too expensive! It’d cost me around 40,000 yen just to look for a minute.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Obviously! I’m not some cheap girl, y’know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Girls who aren’t cheap don’t put a price tag on themselves…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I burst out laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">That’s right. I always used to joke around and laugh with Nito like this…</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Oh yeah. Um, just to be sure, can I ask you something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took a step back and cleared my throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What month and year is it right now?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>“. .It’s April 5th, 20XX.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought she might find my question strange, but to my surprise, Nito answered easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, you could just check the calendar on your smartphone for that…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah! Right! That’s true,  <i class="calibre4">haha</i>. . It really is April 5th.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took my smartphone out of my pocket as she suggested. It was brand new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The latest model at the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure enough, the date Nito mentioned was right there on the screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, yep, just as I thought. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I pocketed my smartphone, I came to a few realizations. I felt like some of my questions had been answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Firstly, the trigger to go to the past is definitely playing the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, to return to the present, I probably just have to play Nito’s song again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an uphill battle earlier, so it won’t be easy to go back and forth, but for now, I’m relieved that I won’t be stuck in the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next is figuring out how time works regarding the destination of time travel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the looks of it, it seems I’ve picked up from where I left off last time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Put simply, every time I play the piano, I will alternate between advancing time here—three years in the past—and the present I just came from. It doesn’t seem like time moves forward in one while I’m in the other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, seems easy enough…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can easily manipulate the past to suit my needs this way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If time moved forward in the past while I was back in the present, there was a chance I might miss something important. But if I can spend time in both timelines without that happening, then I shouldn’t miss out on anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although, it’s also a tad scary to think time in the present  <i class="calibre4">might </i> advance while I’m here…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Hey!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito raised her voice in annoyance. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>“What’s  <i class="calibre4">really </i> going on? You’ve been acting kinda strange for a while, Meguri-kun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A-ah! sorry, sorry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oops! I got too absorbed in my thoughts! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I cleared my throat and quickly got my mind in order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um… I was just thinking about what to do from now on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘From now on’? What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What I mean is, I wanna keep using this club room from now on, if we can.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I slowly nodded to Nito, who tilted her head in confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I was thinking about what it’d take to revive the Astronomy Club.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s better to strike while the iron is hot. So, it’s probably best to talk to Nito about it today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I told Nito the plan I’d come up with in the present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think we need at least four people to start a club at this school and get a club room. If you join, we just need to find two more members, and then we can use this place for the next two years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was explained when the Astronomy Club was disbanded in my previous high school life. The club was scrapped because it didn’t have the minimum of four members. Therefore, this time, all I have to do is change that outcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I figured I’d try recruiting. It’s still early in the school year, but I think we can find two people. Maybe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be honest, I  <i class="calibre4">do </i> feel quite a bit of pressure to recruit those two people…</p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s super intimidating to talk to students I don’t know. But Nito’s future was at stake. Her  <i class="calibre4">life </i> was at stake. That being the case, I can’t just cower here—especially since I’ve already been through high school once before. As the “me” who has returned from the future, there’s every chance that recruiting new members will be a piece of cake. Hopefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s eyes widened in surprise. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>“Yeah, you’re right. I don’t mind joining, either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For real? You’re a lifesaver.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But seriously, what made you randomly start thinking about that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d predicted that she’d ask that question. And I had the proper answer prepared, too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Well, you know, this place does seem pretty comfortable, just like you said.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stood up from the piano and walked over to the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“High school life can be pretty rough sometimes. I figured if you have one place where you belong, it makes things a bit easier. And for now, it feels like this place is the best option.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Totally.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito giggled quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y’know, I thought if people saw me like this they’d be even more put off. If that’s how you feel Meguri-kun, then this might be a good place for us to hang out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right? And, um. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I trailed off, hesitant to say more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Truth is, there’s another reason why I want to revive the astronomy club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My true feelings that I couldn’t even tell Makoto. I want Nito to know them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I. . I want to become an astronomer,” I said firmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito looked at me with a serious expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s been my dream since I was a kid. I want to know what’s out there in the distant universe. I want to find a new star and name it myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the dream I’d given up on during my three years of high school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spending every day by Nito’s side, I’d forgotten my old dream. Looking back, the reason I visited this club room in the first place was because I hoped it would lead to that same dream someday. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I was thinking, it wouldn’t hurt to get ready for that. I don’t have to go all out, but I want to read some stuff and do some stargazing, hopefully giving myself a solid base to dive into studying more seriously in the future.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>There’s no doubt in my mind that if I were to rewrite the past three years, especially if it meant saving Nito, it’d be worth it. But just being by her side isn’t enough. I want to become a person worthy of standing there. So, I have to rewrite myself as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have to turn these wasted three years into something Nito can be proud of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Hmmm</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s mouth gently curved into a joyful smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That sounds like a nice dream,” She said in a sing-song voice, peering at my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes, like wet glass beads, looked directly into mine—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I really like people who work hard.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As “really like” left her lips—words I’d heard from her before—my heart nearly exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My body felt strangely hot, and my brain tingly and numb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, got it. I’ll help recruit some more people for the Astronomy Club too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, I really appreciate it. Honestly, it would’ve been tough doing it on my own.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I know  <i class="calibre4">haha</i>. Oh, but I have one request.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito sat down in front of the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, with her right hand dancing on the keys, she played a mysterious melody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna be allowed to play this piano during our club activities. Truth is, I’ve been doing a bit of music and I wanna make some original videos of me playing and singing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .O-oh, really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, even after our activities are done, I wanna be allowed to play.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gotcha. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My reactions were a little vague. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>The fact that Nito was into music was a given for me. Being told again, I almost unconsciously responded with an “I know” kind of reaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, right. This is actually the first time I’m hearing it here…</p>
<p class="calibre1">So, I should probably act more surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .No way, that’s awesome! I seriously admire people who can play the piano. I mean, it must be crazy hard to coordinate all ten fingers so skillfully, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just a little while ago I was struggling just to play a melody! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Haha</i>, it’s not that hard. Anyone can do it with practice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, it’s not that easy. . Anyway, it’s okay for you to play the piano. It’s not like this club room belongs to me, so feel free to use it however you like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? Yay!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito bounced up from her chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She bumped her shoulder against me as I stood at the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright then. . Let’s do our best to recruit new members.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She peered at my face as she said that. She leaned closer to me—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“From now on, let’s work together—Meguri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time in this timeline, she called me by my first name, sans honorifics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emotions welled up in my chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt Nito’s body heat through her uniform. The resonance of her voice when heard up close. The sweet fragrance that tickled my nose. Nito has a tendency to get up close and personal. Strangely enough, she doesn’t do that with anyone else, but she often touches me like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can’t tell you how many times I was embarrassed when she did stuff like that in my previous high school life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now──it was extremely nostalgic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was so nostalgic that my chest ached. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, I was reminded that I still loved Nito. Again, I resolved myself to be by her side and help her. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>“Yeah. Let’s do this, Nito.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With all those feelings in my words, I nodded to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright, let’s start recruiting tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, Nito and I kicked off our recruiting efforts for the Astronomy Club. This time, though, I had a promising lead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite appearances, this is my second time around in high school, so rounding up members is going to be a piece of cake! Surely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">The next day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry bro, no can do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Me neither.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Same.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why the heck not?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a three way rejection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d approached Nishigami and his two friends Takashima and Okita during our lunch break and was instantly shut down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help standing up from my chair and pushing back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not like I’m saying we have to do anything full-on. Just coming to chill is fine, isn’t it?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, well, I dunno man…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nishigami, who was munching on his parents’ homemade bent<a href="#p84">o<b class="calibre3">³</b>, </a>scrunched up his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“C’mon, think about it, our high school life is just beginning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah bro, we’re gonna be busy with girls and having fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been thinking about trying to draw manga.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Listen. .” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>Nishigami summed up the collective opinion of his group, “Sorry, but we’ll pass.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Seriously?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They…  <i class="calibre4">passed? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn’t expect to be shut down so quickly. I was hoping they’d at least <i class="calibre4">consider </i> it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I know the truth! Nishigami, Takashima, and Okita are all talk! They say they’ll do all that stuff but end up doing fuck all for three years! They  <i class="calibre4">do </i> end up joining a club—the Go-home Clu<a href="#p84">b⁴ </a>that is—and waste away their high school life! Not that I can say that out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, stargazing is actually pretty fun!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Refusing to give up, I stubbornly persisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s beautiful, it’s romantic! Perfect for making high school memories!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Bro, I’m not sure about watching the stars with a bunch of dudes…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Won’t we have to meet up at the railway crossing at 2 am or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not really into staying up late, so. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What kind of image of stargazing did they have? It’s not like in some son<a href="#p84">g⁵! </a></p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, the club members won’t  <i class="calibre4">just </i> be guys! I’ll keep that to myself, though, as I don’t want to lead the conversation in a weird direction! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay then, what about just putting your names down? You don’t even have to come to the club room. Just write your name in the roster and become a ghost member. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh? Not sure about that one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t that kinda sketchy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Better to stick to the rules, I reckon.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They’re completely right! I don’t have anything to say in defense! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn’t expect these guys to have such strong moral compasses. I didn’t get that impression from them…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Alright, fine, I get it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If they still said no after all that, then it’s probably hopeless. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>Giving up, I sat back down in the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A deep sigh escaped from my lungs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What should I do. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve only been rejected once, but it really took a mental toll. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">I guess I’m still just me after all…</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I figured I could do better this time around, seeing as I’d been given a chance to rewrite the past three years. I’d been fired up, telling myself, “It’s New Game+, you’ve got this!” But, yeah… turns out I’m still the same old me, stumbling over the same old obstacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d completely forgotten about that…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, that’s our deal, but I’m rooting for you man.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nishigami smiled as if to comfort me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve still got a month to recruit people, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, that’s right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nishigami said, clubs in our school were still in a recruitment period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recruitment happened throughout April, and starting from May, the club activities for the new school year will officially kick off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s when the headcount for the club’s survival will happen, so, as long as we recruit two more members by then, we’ll be home free. That’s the plan, anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That said, other clubs are also desperately trying to recruit people now. So, Sakamoto—hang in there and give it your best shot, got it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, got it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, Nishigami’s right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not the time to be discouraged like this. There’s still time, so I should try a little harder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And… there’s something else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure, Nishigami and the others didn’t join, but just being able to talk about the club made me feel relieved. It genuinely made me happy that they 53</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>supported and cheered me on. In my previous high school life, there wasn’t anyone who would even say stuff like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, I’ll give it my best shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I started eating the rest of my lunch. Eating lunch alone isn’t bad, but eating lunch with friends makes it taste one or two times tastier than normal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, I see. Well, that can’t be helped.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was after school the same day, in the club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I told Nito that my plan to recruit friends had fallen through, she gave me a wry smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not that surprised they didn’t say yes, honestly. The Astronomy Club is pretty niche.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was sitting in a chair, barefoot as usual, after taking off her indoor shoes and socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even in our first high school life, Nito was basically always dressed like that in the club room. The sky-blue nail polish on her toes stood out refreshingly in contrast to the warm colors lighting up the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True enough. Still, I’m sorry. It would’ve been an easy solution for us if it had worked out.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s fine, it’s fine. I’ve got just the thing for a moment like this— <i class="calibre4">ta-da</i>!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito pulled out a sheet of paper from her bag—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I tried making a design for a recruitment flyer. Whaddya think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow! It looks amazing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a stylish design. The pitch-black background imitated the night sky, with the recruitment messages spelled out with constellations. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>₊✧₊Astronomy₊✦₊Club₊✧₊recruiting members!₊✦₊</p>
<p class="calibre1">₊✦₊Let’s watch₊✧₊the stars₊✦₊ together!₊✧₊</p>

<p class="calibre1">“Wow…!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was impressed by the quality of the work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nito, to think you can make designs like this…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was easy to read, well-organized, and had a playful look to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The quality was so good you’d have thought she’d commissioned it from a professional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, Nito wasn’t just a wiz on the piano, but also with this kind of thing too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, it’s pretty amateurish, but I thought going for something cute would fit the vibe and make it more appealing and easy to connect with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito giggled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked as if she might melt into the orange light of the setting sun at any moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay then, let’s start handing these out tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure thing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things probably won’t go perfectly, but let’s just keep at it and give it our best shot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep… let’s do it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito seemed to have a lightbulb moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aha! Maybe I’ll play something to motivate us for tomorrow. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She headed towards the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, you’re gonna play something for us?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>“Yeah, I’ve been working on a song of my own recently, and I’m planning to upload it as my first video. Mind giving it a listen as a sorta rehearsal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">That’s right. It was like this before, too. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">The day after the entrance ceremony. After school in the club room that day, Nito played the first song she ever made to me—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No worries, I’d be happy to!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, let me know what you think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito sat down on the chair and faced the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, I felt as if her expression had completely changed. From the casual high school girl to a musician in a blink of an eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I already saw glimpses of NITO. I could clearly feel the aura that surrounded the genius musician. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, she focused on the movement of her hands, and the music began to flow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the intro finished, she started to sing. The melody was lively, yet somehow nostalgic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lyrics were probably still a work in progress, and were like random English gibberish to my ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even in her high school days before the rewrite, this was a song and performance in which I could instantly feel her raw talent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to NITO after her debut, it was still a little rough around the edges. The melody and lyrics needed some polish. But, without a doubt, it was filled with the essence of her charm in every way. I was on the verge of tears, hearing her perform live like this after such a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While I was absorbed in listening, the song ended. The afterglow faded, and Nito relaxed her shoulders, returning to her usual self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she turned towards me, she tilted her head anxiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .So, how was it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She followed up with, “I actually think I’ve been able to create a pretty good song myself. . thoughts?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>The unsure look on her face was unusual for her, and her nail polished toes were wiggling nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This might’ve been the first time. The first time Nito let someone listen to her song. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">So I told her my honest thoughts in a single word—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Genius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ahahaha</i>.” Judging by her joyful laugh, I guess she took it as a joke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Astronomy Club, please join us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Our club room is on the fourth floor of the south building!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raising our voices, Nito and I handed out flyers to students arriving at school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reactions were varied. Some looked happy as they took the flyer and read it, while others took it reluctantly and stuffed it into their bags. Some glanced at us and ignored it, while others straight up ignored us completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, surprisingly, my excitement didn’t dim as I continued handing them out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We need to print more of these ASAP.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, let’s ask to make copies in the staff room after school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">During a lull in the crowd, Nito and I had that exchange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Distributing the flyers was going surprisingly well. I figured it’d be a win if we were just able to hand them all out before the club recruitment ended, but to my surprise, we’d handed out so many in just three days that the stack was only a thin booklet in size now. What a good miscalculation to make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were standing in front of the main entrance just before school started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This spot, at this time of day, was where most club recruitment happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Around us, members of other clubs were doing the same thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re the tennis club! Won’t you come play tennis with us?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>“Brass band club! We went to the nationals last year! Let’s aim to be the best in Japan together!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Judo Club here! Judo club! Judo club! Judo club!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to the sports clubs in their full uniforms or protective gear, or the brass band and light music club playing instruments and performing, our Astronomy Club may have appeared a bit plain, but we were still holding our own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, I thought things like, “Well, the second time around should be a piece of cake!” or “Has my hidden talent finally blossomed?” But today, I understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, an Astronomy Club, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, please join us if you’re interested!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You a member too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I am!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, I’m a little interested. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s all because Nito is so popular. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was the center of attention among this year’s cohort of new students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her enthusiastic recruitment efforts, interested students flocked to her like moths to a flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you spend a lot of time in the club room every day?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I do. At least for now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I see, I see. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A male student, wearing a sly grin, nodded along. His ulterior motive couldn’t have been any more obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why’re guys always like this?! There’s no shot he’s  <i class="calibre4">just </i> thinking about doing club activities! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a closer look, I noticed it wasn’t just guys, but also girls, who were drawn to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, Nito-chan, you’re joining this club?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, you should join too if you want, Rina!” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>“Hmm, I dunno. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Nito’s popularity really is something else. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">How was it even possible for everyone to like you so soon after the school year started…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be fair, the Nito standing in front of people right now is in her so-called</p>
<p class="calibre1">“model student mode”, so I understood why everyone liked her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Morning, Chika.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, Mone, good morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were even students who, every morning, would come just to chat with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chief among them was a petite gyaru with bright hair, contact lenses, and perfect makeup—Mone Igarashi-san. She was the girl who was taken to the hospital by ambulance on the day of the graduation ceremony, after the news of Nito’s disappearance. Just like before the rewrite, the pair of them seemed pretty close. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, how long are you gonna keep doing this recruiting thing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san said as she hugged Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s lonely coming to school by myself.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, I think we’ll probably be doing it for the rest of the month.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously… that long?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san pouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, she turned her head in my direction and shot me a fierce glare. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Oh no, she hates me…</i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Because I stole her chance to walk to school with Nito, she must really hate me now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I do feel bad about it, but I suppose she’s unlikely to forgive me, huh? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, c’mon, we’re high schoolers for Pete’s sake. Surely she can handle walking to school by herself, can’t she? Being so clingy isn’t a good thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Well, okay I guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>Igarashi-san pulled away from the hug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it’s something you wanna do, Chika, I’ll support you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aww, thanks.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got this, good luck!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san waved goodbye as she walked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…Anddd another student immediately came over to Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seriously, what kind of attraction power is this? Is she a mascot at some theme park or something? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait, I just realized, I haven’t been handing out flyers during this whole ordeal, have I? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Am I… just holding Nito back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now that I think about it, the stack of flyers in my hand has hardly decreased at all since we started this morning. I only remember handing them out to about ten people or so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously though. . I haven’t been contributing at all!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now that it’s finally sinking in, I’m starting to get anxious about the current state of things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I said I wanted to help Nito, but it turns out  <i class="calibre4">she’s </i> the one helping  <i class="calibre4">me</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, we’re the Astronomy Club! We look forward to your support!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I raised my voice in a panic, I continued to think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can’t keep relying on her to carry me. I need a strategy. Something doable for me. A special plan that could really draw in new members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I mulled it over, I looked up at the pale blue sky. It resembled a watercolor painting, with a lonely pure white half-moon floating in it. If I’m going to do it, it should be a recruitment method unique to the Astronomy Club, right? If I can’t convey its appeal, I won’t be able to get anyone interested in the first place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, suddenly, I had a brain blast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s it! I just need to show them the stars!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the morning of the following week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having put the finishing touches on the creation I’d come up with for recruiting, I stood before it in all of its glory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh wow! I love it, I love it!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito was bouncing up and down like an excited little kid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is amazing. It’s like a  <i class="calibre4">real </i> starry sky. It’ll definitely have a strong impression, don’t you think!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stars were scattered about around us in countless numbers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were in the main entrance, in which there were neat rows of dark brown shoe lockers lined up. Stuck all over them were my homemade glow-in-the-dark star-shaped cards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each card had messages like:</p>
<p class="calibre1">『Astronomy Club, looking for new members!』</p>
<p class="calibre1">『Come to our club room on the 4th floor of south building for more info.』</p>
<p class="calibre1">『Feel free to take this card!』</p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Nito said, if you squint your eyes a bit, it sort of looked like a “starry sky”. I called it “The Main Entrance Galaxy Strategy”. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was obvious that the Astronomy Club’s biggest appeal was stargazing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Personally, I’m more interested in stuff like discovering new celestial bodies, collecting data on dark matter, and following up on new theories about Oumuamua<a href="#p84">⁶</a>—But let’s be real, what truly captivates most people is, without a doubt, the enchanting beauty of the starry night sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, I figured we should simply  <i class="calibre4">show </i> them. Show them something that looked like a starry sky in a really impactful way. With that in mind, I’d come up with the idea of sticking small star-shaped cards all over the entrance every student passed through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were 150 cards in total. Because I did it alone, both making all of them and sticking them up turned out to be a mammoth task. If my strategy works, though, a heap of students will know about the Astronomy Club, including new students without a club yet. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a>What’s more—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“These cards are glow-in-the-dark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking one off, I showed it to Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This entrance gets really dark in the evening, so, when it’s time to go home, these will glow and make it look like a real starry sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, that’s amazing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito pulled my hand closer and cupped both of hers around it, creating a pocket of darkness to check if the card really did glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s really cool. You’re so creative.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“W-well… it only works until the lights turn on after it gets dark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My attention was focused on the hand Nito had pulled close to her. The softness of Nito’s belly firmly pressed against it left me feeling flustered inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here she goes again with the casual touching. . Also, how the heck is she this warm and soft despite being so slim? Just this alone is more than enough to make a teenage boy’s heart race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While that was all happening, the time for school to start approached, and students began trickling into the entrance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They maneuvered through the various clubs that were also recruiting and made their way towards the shoe lockers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Whoa! What’s  <i class="calibre4">this</i>!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, stars!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The area, which had completely transformed from yesterday, left them in awe, and the amazed voices of students arriving filled the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“An Astronomy club, huh…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Didn’t even know there was a club like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing them, Nito and I reflexively exchanged glances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .It worked.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, now everyone seems interested. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">New students were filtering in one after another. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>The star cards caused quite a stir, and some of the students couldn’t resist peeling one off and asking, “Can I take this home?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Yes, for sure! If you’re interested in the Astronomy Club, by all means,</i> <i class="calibre4">please take it home! We made them easy to peel off for that very reason! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">One by one, the stars were disappearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, there were plenty of them left on the shoe lockers, so it didn’t look empty as yet. Awesome. . it went exactly as planned. Waking up early and sticking them all on was worth it, after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While I was patting myself on the back—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m surprised they were able to get permission for this to be honest.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—That voice reached my ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No other club has ever recruited like this before. I’m amazed they were able to convince a teacher.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right. If someone did this without permission, they’d be in  <i class="calibre4">a lot </i> of trouble!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Permission. Convincing a teacher. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I completely forgot! I should’ve cleared this with a teacher beforehand!” I blurted out without thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh, seriously? You haven’t talked to anyone about this yet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next to me, Nito’s eyes widened in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope… I was too caught up in making the cards!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, right… Even something as simple as handing out flyers needed permission. So, logically, such an out-there recruitment strategy would <i class="calibre4">obviously </i> need a teacher’s stamp of approval! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s go to the staff room right now, and explain everything properly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-yeah. If we don’t, worst-case they make us take them all down again!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We nodded too each other and hurried to the staff room—</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>—The result of which was we were able to get permission to keep them up during the recruitment period. But, not before our homeroom teacher, Chiyoda-sensei,  <i class="calibre4">thoroughly </i> chewed us out. And, we were given orders to clean up the area every day, since the star cards might end up as litter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You’re right Chiyoda-sensei. Don’t worry, we’ll make sure to handle that part properly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“See ya later.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, see you tomorrow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost two weeks have passed since we started recruiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito and I finished our work for the day and parted ways at the school gate to head home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This has been our routine for a while now. We meet up at the club room early in the morning and start recruiting. After school we wait in the club room in case someone wants to join, and come home time, we leave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Haaa</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I sighed and absent-mindedly looked up at the sky. The clouds were dyed in gold and lavender marble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A small light was just starting to twinkle in the eastern sky. If I become an astronomer, I might know the name of that star on sight one day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Children’s joyful voices echoed in the distance, and a scooter raced past me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I’m surprised things aren’t going better honestly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A lot of time had passed since we started recruiting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d already handed out nearly two hundred flyers, and the stars at the entrance were all gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were a fair few students who came to the club room for a visit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five, to be exact—both girls and boys. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>The vibes weren’t bad and they seemed interested in doing club activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that interest went nowhere, as none of them actually took the final step to sign up. It blows my mind that they’d come all the way to the club room and still not join. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Well, yeah, it’s probably not an easy group to join.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I muttered to myself, I tried to put myself in their shoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are only two members right now, and those two are quite close. . so it’ll be tricky to fit in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I were in the same boat, I’d probably think, “Will I just be a third wheel if I join this club?” or “Are these actually two dating?” It’s not hard to understand why they’d be hesitant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, what should we do then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How on earth can we find a third member at this point? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d only reached the halfway mark for the recruitment period. Still, I found myself feeling increasingly anxious as we hadn’t managed to find any potential members yet—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the suburban street I was walking down, I could see a figure standing in the distance. A small silhouette, backlit by the setting sun. What’s more, they were standing in the middle of the road, arms crossed, seemingly looking this way…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Uh, what…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had a strange feeling about them, like they were a bit off. Standing there like some Nio guardia<a href="#p84">n⁷ </a>in the middle of a road cars drove through, I sensed they might be trouble. At times like this, the best thing to do is steer clear and not get involved. I’ll just play it cool and act like nothing happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luckily, there was a fork in the road between us. I figured I’d make an innocent face and slip away in that direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I turned the corner with a face that said, “My house is this way~”, I thought I was in the clear—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—H-hold it!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>The sketchy person was running towards me. Also, it was a familiar girl’s voice…</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/sgTTdsS/index-74-1.jpg" alt="index-74-1" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>“Igarashi-san!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s childhood friend she went to junior high with. The one who hugged her the other day and whined that they couldn’t walk to school together. And on graduation day, the girl who was freaking out after hearing the news of Nito’s disappearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mone Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why the heck are you running away? I’ve been waiting for you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, if someone is standing in the middle of the road like a friggin’ Nio guardian, of course I’m going to run!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m fully aware she has it in for me! I  <i class="calibre4">still </i> felt like booking it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmph… well, whatever. Anyways, Sakamoto, I needa talk to you about something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Talk. .? Uh, wait, how’d you know my name?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, there are heaps of ways to find that out, aren’t there? Like, digging around on social media or eavesdropping on conversations and stuff.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Scary.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait, is Igarashi-san really like that…? That’s kind of stalker-ish behavior isn’t it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be fair, if I really wanted to know someone’s name, I could probably find it out too…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, Meguri Sakamoto-kun. Born May 30th, blood type O, attended Shimenmichi Junior High School.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s seriously creepy! How’d you even find all that out?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Poker-faced, Igarashi-san pointed to a nearby park with an expression that left no room for argument. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Um, can I borrow your face for a bit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her tone sent shivers down my spine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Am I about to be interrogated? Is she going to demand that I give Nito back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is she holding a grudge because she can’t walk to school with Nito. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chika and I have been friends since kindergarten.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“O–oh, right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were sitting side by side on the swings in the park. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As predicted, Igarashi-san started the conversation like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our families are super close, we’ve been in the same class since elementary school, and we’ve had  <i class="calibre4">a lot </i> of sleepovers… Basically, we’re best friends with each other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh-huh… Yeah, figured as much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I casually nodded along to the completely predictable turn of events. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, though, I think Igarashi-san and Nito make a great pair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both came across as high-class, were stylish, stood out, and were popular with boys. Plus, Nito’s black hair and Igarashi-san’s bright hair perfectly complemented each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But y’know…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san continued, “Lately, ever since you started the Astronomy Club, it feels like we’ve grown apart. Like, you’re always together in the mornings and after school, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mm, yeah, I guess so…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well she used to spend that time with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I seriously can’t accept it. That Chika ditched me so easily to go join an Astronomy Club, and isn’t hanging out with me like in junior high.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">…Yep, I figured it’d be something like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Nito is my best friend, so you should back off.’ That’s where this is going, isn’t it? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>Well, from my perspective, that can’t happen because we need to recruit new members as a pair. Nito is a key member, and if she quits, the Astronomy Club will be donezo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That aside, I couldn’t help picking up on Igarashi’s obsession with Nito through the tone of her voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every now and again I notice people in those kinds of relationships. They’re possessive in a way that goes beyond just being friends, and seem sort of dependent on each other in some way or other. Honestly, I don’t understand why someone would be so attached to a friend like that. I can’t wrap my head around the desperation Igarashi-san is feeling, either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Why’re you so obsessed with Nito?’</p>
<p class="calibre1">That question was my way of searching for a compromise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, I get you’re best friends and all, but why be so clingy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .A bunch of reasons.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igrashi stared down at the toes of her loafers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Such as?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Why do I have to tell you that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because we won’t be able to find a solution if I don’t know a bit more about your side of things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I guess so. Um. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san went silent for a while, apparently lost in thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After about the length of three breaths, she finally spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .When I was in kindergarten, I was kinda bossy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her words started pouring out of her little by little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, when I say bossy, like I had a bad personality and tried to control everyone.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait, you were doing that kinda thing even in kindergarten?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I guess I was pretty mature for my age. I really looked up to Pretty Cure<a href="#p84">⁸ </a>and wanted to be a proper heroine, but I couldn’t pull it off. I just ended up being mean to everyone.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>“. .Ah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, I can understand how she feels. Like, wanting to be the main character, but at best, feeling like you’re a mean side character. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think it’s pretty mature to realize that about yourself even in kindergarten, but I bet there are a lot of people who feel that way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back then, Chika was in the next class over, and we finally ended up in the same one when we were older. We had a big fight right away ‘cause she got mad at me for being mean. But y’know, after fighting with her over and over, I got it. I was like, ‘Oh, she’s pretty much exactly what I’ve always wanted to be, and everyone likes her. She has already achieved the ideal image I had in mind’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once Igarashi-san got going, she was surprisingly talkative. Maybe she’d been wanting to open up to someone about her feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, after hearing her story, and about Nito’s past too, I blurted out—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I totally get it~” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—That. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. . I totally get it. Nito becomes the person she wants to be before anyone else… and she works really hard to get there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before I knew it, I was sympathizing with her. I felt a strong connection with Igarashi-san’s story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, I see. . it’s not just me. It’s not just me who feels this way about Nito…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh!? You understand!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san’s eyes widened in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You really understand, Sakamoto!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, definitely. Like, even when I try my best to hand out flyers, everyone just gathers around her… it’s always like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In reality, over the next three years, she’s going to make her dreams come true. So, I understand being practically blinded by that brilliance all too well…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“You too huh, Sakamoto… I see…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. Sorry, I interrupted your story. What happened next?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, right. So, um. .” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>Igarashi-san cleared her throat as if to gather her thoughts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyways, one day, while I had that in my head, we randomly ended up playing together. We needed to form pairs for a recital rehearsal. And. . I thought maybe she would hate me, but it wasn’t like that at all. Actually, she was just as nice to me as she was to the other kids,” Igarashi-san mumbled shyly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I thought… ‘I wanna be friends with her. I wanna be her best friend’.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, I get it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was probably a defining moment. Someone she once thought was her rival was now being kind to her. And if that happened back in kindergarten, it would’ve had a significant impact on Igarashi’s personality development, I think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, she turned to me. She spoke clearly, as if she was confessing something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So… I wanna be Chika’s number one.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sounds like a protagonist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The straightforward way she said it made her sound like a protagonist at the center of some story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna cherish her, and I wanna be cherished by her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It made perfect sense. I understood Igarashi’s feelings all too well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Truthfully, I’d developed similar feelings for Nito. I’d become obsessed with her brilliance in more ways than one. In a nutshell, Igarashi-san and I were kindred spirits. And if so—If she cares about Nito that much—then there’s only one thing I can do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . Just join the Astronomy Club!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling a deep sense of connection, I tried to convey my strong feeling of</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously, I highly recommend it!” to Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Igarashi-san, you should join too. .! Wouldn’t that solve everything?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how you looked at it, it was the best solution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san would be with her beloved Nito, and we’d get a new club member. It was win-win. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>And, in this situation, I feel like  <i class="calibre4">only </i> someone like Igarashi-san could be the third member of the Astronomy Club, given she knew both Nito and I. She’s the only one who fits. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“J-just hold on a minute!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san, looking flustered, frantically waved her hands in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Huh? Did I get the wrong end of the stick? Maybe she didn’t want to join the club? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure, I’ve thought about it too! Joining the Astronomy Club, I mean! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I figured as much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, I wanna know more about you first! I wanna know your intentions, Sakamoto!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My intentions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep. You’re. . working really hard, aren’t you? Like, to keep the club going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, yeah, that makes sense. Even from an outsider’s perspective, it was pretty obvious that I was desperately trying to recruit members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I was wondering. . why? Is it to get closer to Chika or something? If that’s the reason, it worries me. She’s a serious girl. I don’t want you to have that kind of ulterior motive.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No no no, that’s not my intention!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hastily shook my head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I seriously do want to become an astronomer! That’s why I wanted to keep the Astronomy Club going. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Oh, really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san tilted her head, looking surprised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Cause, from my perspective, I couldn’t help but think maybe you actually liked Chika or something. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing her say that made me regret my knee-jerk excuse. Without thinking, I’d shot down the “reason” for getting close that Igarashi-san mentioned. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>But. . I wasn’t being honest. The main reason I wanted to keep the Astronomy Club going was so I could stay close to Nito. I definitely have that feeling for her, and I should’ve shared that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san truly cherishes Nito, of that much I can be certain. Certain because of all the stories she’s shared with me, and what I heard on the day of our graduation. When I found out Nito had disappeared and I heard her heartbreaking cry. That cry was one only someone who  <i class="calibre4">truly </i> cares about Nito would make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Sorry, I lied.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I came clean. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re spot on. I’m working hard to recruit more members for the sake of being with Nito. I  <i class="calibre4">do </i> want to be an astronomer too, but I can’t deny that either.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, that means…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san peered at my face with an unexpectedly calm expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You like Chika?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, I do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment’s hesitation, I honestly admitted it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve liked her for a long time.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crap, I accidentally said something I shouldn’t have. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">For a long time. </i>” It hasn’t even been a month since Nito and I met in this timeline. That comment was clearly out of place. But, I got carried away in the heat of the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether it went over her head, or she misunderstood something, Igarashi-san dropped her gaze as if she was satisfied. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you really  <i class="calibre4">do </i> like Chika.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well. . yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Argh. This is really embarrassing. What the heck is this!? Seriously, why am I getting into deep love talk like this when I should be calm!?” To be fair, it’s the kind of situation where you  <i class="calibre4">should </i> talk about it, but man, I said “I like her” </p>
<p class="calibre1">with such confidence! I feel like my face is about to burst into flames! </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a>But, as if to wake me from such embarrassing thoughts—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Then, wouldn’t it be better not to get in the way?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a heartbreakingly lonely expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san’s voice quivered, as if she was on the verge of tears, but she forced a smile—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’re really that serious about Chika and she goes along with it…wouldn’t me joining the club just be a hassle for her?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those words from her caught me by surprise. I was under the impression this girl had no intention of reining in her possessiveness towards Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Y’know, even  <i class="calibre4">I’ve </i> got some level of self-awareness.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess Igarashi-san saw right through me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She gave me a wry smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve been thinking about it too. That this kind of dependency isn’t good, I mean. I’m a high schooler now, so I’ve gotta learn to be more independent.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another surprise. That she had the ability to look at herself objectively like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, I also think it’s not right to force ourselves apart, if that makes sense? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, getting too close and weighing her down is also not what I want. I wonder what the best thing to do is. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Again, it resonated with me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the rewrite, I’d never had the chance to experience things like this. I had barely any friends, and I never came into contact with the struggles of someone my age. It doesn’t matter if it’s a smiling classmate, or a flashy girl who seems like they haven’t got a care in the world—everyone has struggles in their life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing that, I can start to imagine that maybe this girl also had some regrets at the graduation ceremony. Maybe she thought there were things she could’ve done, and things she  <i class="calibre4">should’ve </i> done in those three years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Maybe you should try finding a new type of relationship?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was half talking to myself as I gave Igarashi-san that suggestion. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>“Not dependence, but a relationship where you can stand by her side. As equals. Why not try looking for it in the Astronomy Club?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could almost see Igarashi-san’s eyes  <i class="calibre4">pop </i> as they suddenly went wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stared straight at me through her strange colored contact lens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san’s facial features looked pretty childish when I saw her like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to Nito, who looks her age, or Makoto, who looks mature, Igarashi-san’s face could easily be mistaken for a junior high schooler’s, or maybe even an elementary schooler’s. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In those features, I could see her innocence, or maybe, her purity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stared at me with a confused look for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ugh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She broke eye contact and looked down, gripping the chains of the swing tightly, and let out a pained voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh? Hey, what’s wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I wanted you to be a jerk.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Say what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted you to be an asshole, Sakamoto.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What? Why?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Because if this is how it’s gonna be…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san lifted her head. She looked straight at me, eyes swimming with tears. She looked equal parts regretful and happy as she muttered her next words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Then there’s no way I can stand in the way of your relationship with her.” </p>
