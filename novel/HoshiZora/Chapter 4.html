   <h2>Chapter 4: Stay Unforgettable</h2>
    
<p class="calibre1">Everyone had gathered in the club room after school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With desperate hope, I was checking last year’s club diary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, no matter how many pages I flipped through, no matter how many new notebooks I opened, all I found were trivial notes of everyday club life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s no use.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muttering, I sighed and closed the notebook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I thought, the club did  <i class="calibre4">nothing </i> last year. No presentations, no participation in competitions.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, I’d felt a faint glimmer of hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The period we needed activity achievements for was from April of last year to the present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That means, for twelve of those months, the four of us weren’t here. So, maybe the seniors did something. Maybe they did something that could conceivably be called a presentation, or participation in a competition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But those hopes were quickly dashed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the past year, at least, the Astronomy Club in this high school hadn’t really achieved anything worth mentioning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, to be fair, I had the same attitude during my first time in high school, so I could hardly complain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn it, what should we do. .!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help but scratch my head in frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ugh, what can we do to create activity achievements now? I’m sorry guys, it’s my fault for not handling things properly. .” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>That’s right, this is all my fault. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to keep the club alive. To achieve that, I got everyone involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet, I didn’t check the conditions thoroughly? That’s absolutely unbelievable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure, in my high school life before the rewrite, I didn’t have room to worry about anything other than the number of club members. I didn’t even bother recruiting new members, and my vague understanding was just, “We need at least four people to keep the club from getting disbanded.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, no, that’s exactly why it’s my fault. Knowing that my understanding was vague, I should’ve checked that first this time around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meguri, it’s not your fault,” Nito said, looking concerned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was sitting at her usual spot in front of the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You just started high school, so it’s normal not to know stuff like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, I’ve been relying on you too much, and I didn’t check it myself. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Sorry guys, I actually knew we needed activity achievements,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai said with a face full of self-blame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There was this one time when my friend wanted to start a club. I knew the requirements, but honestly, it didn’t really register in my mind. I just figured we’d already have some achievements…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That isn’t your fault, Senpai, ‘cause you just joined not long ago…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyways, what should we do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san bit her lip and looked at everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s the plan now…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How ‘bout we just do some stargazing tonight as a quick solution for now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai stood up from his chair and went over to the telescope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can use this thing, yeah? So, with this, we can observe the stars tonight, jot down our observations in a notebook, and hand it in.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, they won’t accept that,” I answered while rummaging through the club’s equipment shelf. I wasn’t giving up just yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Research results like that need to be presented to the public. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then, then!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>Igarashi-san pulled her smartphone out of her pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s check if there’s some kind of competition happening tonight! I dunno if there’s a competition for astronomy, but maybe. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I looked into that too, but there wasn’t anything. Honestly, there are hardly any astronomy competitions to begin with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I should note, things weren’t like this until the year before last. Sure enough, we found traces that the Astronomy Club had organized a few presentation events before last year. During the school’s cultural festival, for instance, or during the club recruitment period. Even during the sports festival. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whenever the Astronomy Club had a chance to present, they would set up an exhibit in the club room or even turn the whole room into a planetarium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Apparently, they even pitched in to make those big cheering banners for the sports festival when the occasion called for it. That’s how our seniors protected the club room, and the club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, that tradition had grinded to a halt last year. And now, only four people who don’t know how to run the club are left in this room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Damn, what do we do?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I sat down in front of the shelf, racking my brain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How do we even start building up achievements at this stage?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I ran through all the possible scenarios in my head. We could try doing surprise presentations or organizing our own competition. Heck, we might have to just lie and make up some activity achievements if necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, none of these options were foolproof. If we failed, we wouldn’t be able to submit anything to our teacher, and if we get caught cheating, we might be punished with suspension or something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, in the silent club room, I continued to contemplate our next steps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A suffocating silence descended upon the room. We’d spent quite a lot of time in this room, but it might be the first time it has been like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere was usually relaxed and laid-back, with no tension—like being in the cozy warmth of a futon. That was what the Astronomy Club room had always been. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now, the air here was thick with tension. It was hard to breathe, and I desperately tried to think. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>How long had this silence gone on for? Was it because of a lack of oxygen or was it just me overthinking? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as my vision started to fail—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah well, I guess it can’t be helped, can it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—I heard a voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s nothing we can do. We’ve all tried our best, haven’t we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice came from Nito, who wore a bittersweet expression. Yet, there was also a sense of relief and joy on her face as she looked at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What do you mean?” I asked her timidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Does that mean… you’re saying we should just give up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, I guess so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito nodded and gave me a forced smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Shouldn’t we just accept that there’s nothing more we can do here?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, there might still be something we can do…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You think so? With the time we have left, it’s probably too difficult.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito said it casually, as if she were making small talk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In my memories, Nito was a girl who never gave up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when things weren’t going well with her music or when she copped hate online, she never let it stop her. In interviews, she talked about how she sometimes felt like giving up, but she always found the motivation to sit at the piano and continue her creative journey. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That Nito was saying it’s “too difficult?” Are you kidding me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She let out a small cough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I… I’m really grateful,” Nito continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“To Mone, to Rokuyo-senpai, and most of all, to you, Meguri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She squatted down in front of me and tilted her head, peering at my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve been working really hard this whole time, haven’t you? Leading the way and brainstorming ideas to protect the club. I mean, not everything went 129</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>smoothly, and we failed a few times, but Meguri, aren’t you usually the type to not try so hard? You were the type who liked to take it easy, weren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, I was.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did she know that…? I thought I’d never shown that side of me to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe Nito has a good eye for people too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meguri, you really gave it your all. Mone and Rokuyo-senpai joined the club because of you, right? If you hadn’t tried so hard, we wouldn’t have even had the chance to hope like this. So, I’m really grateful. That you went that far for us, y’know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, she looked into my eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I’m sure the reason you worked so hard was.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes, deep as eternity, pierced straight through me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .For me too, wasn’t it?” Nito asked me straight up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure, it was for your own sake too, but you also tried hard for me, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How did she know? How did Nito pick up on that? It’s a bit comforting to know that she was able to sense it. I wanted to say that. I wanted to say that I wanted to save her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, I didn’t respond. I didn’t have the right to nod in agreement, not after the foolish mistake I’d made, and failing to meet everyone’s expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, that’s enough now. . if that’s what it’s about, let’s just give up. I mean, why not just make the most of the time we have left and have fun together. Just the four of us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a brief second, I imagined doing just that. Giving up on the club’s survival. Forgetting about our activity achievements, and spending the remaining days in this room, just the four of us. That really wouldn’t be such a bad thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the club disbands, we still have this year to continue our activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, to be honest, Makoto and I were sneakily using this club room even after that. With the friendships that have formed among us, who knows, maybe things will turn out differently in the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It doesn’t necessarily mean that I won’t be able to save Nito. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>“So, Meguri…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito smiled again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s okay. Let’s give up on the club and spend the rest of the time however we want.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I won’t give up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That response came out almost unconsciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, but I still don’t want to give up. We’ve worked so hard up to this point, to end it like this because of my mistake. .I absolutely don’t want that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s not your mistake, Meguri!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito stood up quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There were four of us, and none of us thought to check! Everyone’s to blame!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even if that’s true!” I yelled before I could catch myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the first time I’d spoken to Nito like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t give up yet! I wanna keep thinking about if there’s anything I can do until the very end!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remembered the thing that set all this in motion. It was the day of the graduation ceremony, before the rewrite. Nito had disappeared. I remember the regret and despair I felt at the time. That future is waiting for me if I give up now. After giving up on so many things without any real determination during those first three years, that’s what comes next. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">I used to think that effort required talent. I still might think so now. But that doesn’t matter. If I give up here, Nito might disappear again. If there’s even a one percent chance to reduce that possibility, I want to fight until the very last second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  <i class="calibre4">have </i> to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I’m sorry. . I’ll think about it a little more.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Meguri.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I suddenly noticed Nito staring at me, as if in a daze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d never seen her make that face before, not during the current timeline, or before the rewrite. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>She had this vacant look on her face, but it was different from her usual absent-mindedness. What a strange expression…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Uh, what is it?” I couldn’t help but ask out of worry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I didn’t say anything weird, did I? Is there something on my face?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I have a bit of a habit of doing that. Like when I’m having a serious discussion, I might have a runny nose, or when I’m deep in thought, my lips might be shiny from oily food in my bento. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, it’s not like I have the time to care about those things right now. I couldn’t care less about my appearance at this point in time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I-It’s nothing,” Nito answered as if she was trying to dodge the question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She cleared her throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was just a little surprised. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I-I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we were talking, the school bell suddenly chimed, indicating the end of the school day. Once that bell rings, we can’t stick around in the building anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Well, there’s no helping it. Let’s go home for today,” I said to everyone as I stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll brainstorm ideas again tonight. Then, tomorrow we’ll put them into action with everyone and submit them to the school the day after. We should be able to make it in time. So. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I slung my bag over my shoulder and I looked at Igarashi-san, Rokuyo-senpai, and Nito in turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .If you could help me, I’d really appreciate it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Honestly, though, I have no clue what we should do…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was walking home. Under the dusk-laden sky, I trudged along the suburban streets, letting out a sigh and murmuring to myself. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>“I seriously have no ideas… How the heck are we gonna come up with any activity achievements now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I looked up, the setting sun was sinking towards the suburban area to the west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recently, it felt like the days were getting longer and longer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I was in elementary school, a year felt like an eternity, but now that I’m in high school—No, now that I’ve already finished high school once—365</p>
<p class="calibre1">days feels like it goes by in a blink of an eye. Times that by three and it makes three years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I realized how difficult it is to make significant changes to the future in such a short amount of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, should I go back to the future and think about it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A light bulb suddenly went off in my head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I go back to the present timeline, time stops here… Should I think this over carefully over there?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yes, it should be possible in theory. If I can’t come up with any ideas, I’ll think about it over there until I do. Maybe I should even ask Makoto for advice too. As soon as I come up with a good idea, I can return here, and there’ll be no time loss. I might only have a day left, but at least I won’t run out of time before coming up with any ideas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .School is closed for the day.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I probably can’t go back to the future today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I’m going to play the piano, I should do it first thing tomorrow morning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’ll be cutting it very close though…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While lost in thoughts like that, I arrived at my house. It was old, and about a fifteen-minute walk from Ogikubo Station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I opened the front door and called out, “I’m home!”, I heard a reply from the living room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, welcome back!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That voice belonged to Mizuki. She’s a third year junior high schooler, and my younger sister by one year. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>She’s a bit absent-minded and carefree, and that’s coming from  <i class="calibre4">me</i>. For a second, I considered talking to her about what happened today. I even considered getting her input on getting activity achievements… But, I doubt she’d have any useful advice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can’t be helped, I guess. As planned, I’ll spend tonight deep in thought on my lonesome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took off my shoes and walked down the hallway until I reached the living room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And as usual, I opened the sliding door while saying “Ahh, I’m tired～” in an old man’s voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry for intruding.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard a voice that sounded like a rolling bell, but it wasn’t anyone from my family. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I looked, there “she” was, sitting on the sofa. A mature and refined face, and a petite and slender body. Her hair was black instead of gold, but it was still cut stylishly short. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My partner in crime during my first high school life—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Makoto!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto Akutagawa was here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh? Y-yes.. that’s me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, wh-why are you here!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto looked at me with a puzzled and slightly frightened expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I came to hang out with Mizuki. . But, how’d you know my name. .?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">C-Craaaaap! I messed up.  <i class="calibre4">Again</i>! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she said, Makoto was originally a friend of Mizuki’s. That’s why she started coming to our house to hang out and we got to know each other. Shortly after enrolling in my high school, she started hanging around the Astronomy Club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And… that’s right. The first time she came to our house to hang out was around this time. I was so preoccupied with the club, I completely forgot. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>“Oh, um. . from Mizuki! Yeah, Mizuki talks about you a lot!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I tried to come up with an excuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And, y’know, Mizuki showed me some pictures on her phone, so I was just surprised. .  <i class="calibre4">Ha-ha</i>, sorry! I just blurted out your name all of a sudden. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, really. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto still looked suspicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Mizuki wasn’t buying it—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait, did I ever tell you about Makoto, Nii-chan?” She said in her usual carefree tone, tilting her head in confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t think I’ve ever shown you photos or anything. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, you did! You mentioned it before! I’m sure of it. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I dunno…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m sorry. Your brother just lied to you. But it’s an emergency, so please forgive me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Well, it’s getting pretty late.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto looked up at the clock, as if realizing the time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I should probably head home now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, right. Then I’ll walk you there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, I’ll come too. It’s getting dark.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto’s house was only about a ten-minute walk from here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not far, but it’s getting dark and it’s not safe for two junior high girls to walk alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto looked at me with a puzzled expression again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Thank you,” she muttered under her breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—And y’know, Shimamura keeps dragging her feet.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>“He should just confess already. Those two clearly have feelings for each other.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Walking along the dimly lit suburban street, I watched the two of them as they chatted away animatedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sounds of television shows and cooking drifted from the surrounding houses, and combined with the scent of spring, it reminded me a bit of my own days in junior high school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, y’know, while he’s doing that, Makino started hanging out with other boys too. It’s so hard to watch.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hope it doesn’t end in tears. Our class has been getting along pretty well.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conversation between Mizuki and Makoto seemed to have defined roles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mizuki vents her recent complaints to Makoto, and Makoto comments on them. That’s the pattern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But seriously, are they talking about confessing or not confessing already? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even at the junior high stage. .? When I was in junior high, I don’t remember people talking about that. Maybe everyone was just dating and kissing behind my back? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But still—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, by the way, what do you think of the seating arrangement in our class this time, Makoto?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, I think it’s good.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—I totally understood why Mizuki felt like talking to Makoto about this stuff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto has this aura about her that makes you feel like sharing things that you’re not satisfied with or things that have made you feel frustrated. And yeah, you also feel like sharing the good stuff and the happy moments, but when you’re hurt or in trouble, Makoto has this way of giving you a wry smile and saying, “That’s a tough one.” She’s got a knack for being there as a listener and offering support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess that kind of personality hasn’t changed since junior high. Even now, she was giving Mizuki a reassuring smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, Mizuki, your seat is closer to the window now. Plus, you’re also closer to Nishiki. If you think about it that way, it’s not so bad, is it?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>“Ah, when you put it that way, maybe you’re right. I s’pose it’s not as bad as I thought. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mizuki nodded in agreement to Makoto’s answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, Makoto, I’m so sorry. You’ve been forced to listen to the Sakamoto siblings’ whinging for so long. You and Mizuki will end up going to different high schools, but you’ll still be stuck listening to  <i class="calibre4">my </i> stories for another two years. Please continue to put up with the Sakamoto family, I appreciate it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Oh, right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—I remembered something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, Makoto.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wh-what is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled at suddenly having her name called, Makoto turned towards me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh, right. Here, I’m just her friend’s older brother. Sorry for startling you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Can I talk to you about something for a bit?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to talk about all of it. My situation, and my struggles—with this Makoto. Truthfully, I’m not sure if she can come up with a genius solution that solves everything. Maybe expecting a junior high schooler to come up with a miracle idea like that is a bit too much. But still, I felt like I could organize my thoughts somehow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve talked to Makoto for dozens, if not hundreds of hours at this point. Just talking to her made situations seem clearer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, sure. . I guess.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She still looked puzzled, but nodded anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s cautious and can be a bit skeptical at times, but deep down, she’s a kind-hearted person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks… Anyway, I’m in the Astronomy Club right now. It’s about to be disbanded soon, so I’m trying to come up with activities to keep it going.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A club, huh. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, we have to submit our ‘activity achievements’ to the school by the day after tomorrow. It’s either records of the club participating in a 137</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>competition or presenting research results to the public, but we haven’t prepared for either of those. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What, neither? And it’s due the day after tomorrow?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded and slumped my shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Makoto’s eyes widen, I couldn’t help but think, “Yeah, it looks tough even from an objective standpoint,” and “Clearly it’s not going to be easy.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But. . I really wanna save the club.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stood up straight and continued speaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, I wanna find a way to do it. Makoto. . do you have any good ideas?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>, let’s see…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto crossed her arms and put on a thinking face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A competition or a presentation, you say? By presentation, you mean just showing the public what you’ve been doing or something like that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I think so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got it. Well then…” Makoto said nonchalantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to say, “Well, this is something you should have thought of already,” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto suggested an idea to me in that same tone…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .So what do you think? Oh, but maybe you’ve already thought of that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking unsure of herself, Makoto scratched her cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If so, there might be something else you could do. . I feel like there should be. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Makoto!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without thinking, I tightly grasped her hands with mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s it! That should work!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?! Ah…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Startled again, Makoto’s eyes darted about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’m sorry for scaring you again! But I can’t hide how happy I am! </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>“Oh man, I’m glad I talked to you about this! You’re so reliable, Makoto!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“R-really? Glad I could help…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was so happy I almost hugged her impulsively. Nah, I won’t do that. If I did, either Makoto or Mizuki would probably report me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, I’m  <i class="calibre4">that </i> grateful. Makoto’s idea was something that would solve all of our problems. And in a sense, it was an idea that our Astronomy Club could definitely put into action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright! I’ll let everyone know first thing tomorrow!” I told myself as we walked towards Makoto’s house again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no time, so I’ll prepare as much as I can today. Tomorrow, it’s all or nothing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Hey, Makoto. Have you known Onii-chan for a long time?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I just met him today. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could hear Mizuki and Makoto whispering to each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You seem pretty close for having just met. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m not sure why. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve already spent two years with you, that’s why. When you become a high schooler a year from now. When that time comes, I’m looking forward to spending time with you in the Astronomy Club Room again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—So, I wanna finish this by tomorrow!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the next day, after school. Me, Nito, Igarashi-san, and Rokuyo-senpai were gathered in the club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I finished writing down the idea Makoto gave me on the whiteboard and made my declaration—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“With this, we can make a presentation to the public! It should be recognized as an achievement and contribute to our club’s activities!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of that. In the face of the brilliant idea I presented to them—</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>“Oh. . a ‘video’, huh?” Nito murmured, sounding impressed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san and Rokuyo-senpai followed suit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘The Journey to Discovering an Asteroid’. And we’ll upload it to a video sharing platform. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can for sure make this by the deadline.” </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Why don’t you make a video?” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the idea Makoto suggested yesterday. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“You should make videos showcasing the club’s activities and your future</i> <i class="calibre4">goals, and keep uploading them to your own channel regularly.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve gotta say, I was genuinely impressed by that idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’d be perfect as a presentation to the public. If all goes well, we can kick things off by ourselves, in no time at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, making a big video right from the start would be tough. So, at first, it’ll just be an introduction. A video that summarizes the channel’s purpose, self-introductions, and future activity plans. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But still, if we set clear goals there, it could work. If we make our intentions for this channel clear, showing our commitment to keeping it going, there’s a good chance it will be accepted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, in this Astronomy Club, we have Nito. Nito already has her own channel and has uploaded videos that’ve gotten a lot of views. She said she does everything from filming to editing her videos herself. So, she should have plenty of know-how. If any issues pop up… well, I could always ask for advice from Minase-san as a last resort. On the day we met, she gave me her business card and said,  <i class="calibre4">“If you ever need anything, please don’t hesitate to contact me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Even for the smallest things.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why Makoto’s idea was an absolute game-changer and a perfect fit for us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .By the way,” Nito said, glancing at the whiteboard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Discovering an asteroid’ sounds like a really great goal, and I’d love to give it a try too… but can we really achieve something like that as high school students? And also, why did you choose it as our goal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“U-um, about that…” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>Right, an explanation is in order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Originally, I wanted to name a star.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I said that, I thought back to my childhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When I was a little kid, I learned that the stars in the sky have names, and sometimes the person who discovers a new star gets to name it… I thought it was amazing. To give a name to a light in the sky like that. And, it would still be named that even after I’m gone. It really moved me, y’know, even though I was just a kid…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think it was on our way home from a family trip. On our walk back from the station, my father told me stories like that as we watched the starry sky together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every visible light from here, and all the stars that are confirmed to exist even though we can’t see them now, each of them has its own story and has been deeply intertwined with human history for a long time. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">People say you can’t see the stars in Tokyo, but that’s a lie. The night sky in Ogikubo was filled with lights scattered like a jar of sugar tipped upside down, and as a young boy, I absorbed them all into my small being—lights that had traveled billions of light-years to reach me. I felt a shiver run down my spine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My legs were shaking and I felt like I was going to cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s when I fell in love with stars. As I researched more, I found out that high school students who belong to astronomy clubs occasionally find undiscovered asteroids.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai leaned forward, looking interested. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Damn, that’s pretty romantic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know right? You can’t just name it right after finding it, of course. You have to observe it for at least four years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I shot Rokuyo-senpai a wry smile and added, “You have to accurately understand their orbit, so it’s impossible to name them while you’re still in school. But, if you clear those conditions, the discoverer can name the asteroid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, if everyone’s okay with it, I was thinking we could set that as the ultimate goal for our channel. And if we actually do find one. . It’d be nice if we could all name it together.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>Well, to be honest, it’s half a pipe dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Discovering an asteroid as a high school student in Japan is a big deal, and happens only a few times a decade,  <i class="calibre4">at most</i>. It’s something that even makes the news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accomplishing such a lofty goal might be challenging in reality, considering the size of our club. Still, I wanted to set a goal like that now. Instead of doing nothing because it seems out of reach, like the first time, I want to keep reaching and reaching with the belief that we  <i class="calibre4">will </i> eventually reach it. That’s because, at the end of this, the future Nito will be there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Okay, let’s do it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if determined, Nito took out her laptop from her bag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna make a video. Let’s do it together. I’ve got all the equipment we need, so there’s no problem.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alrighty, let’s do our best then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san, with a gentle smile, was the next to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Count me in. I like stargazing, and making videos sounds kinda fun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sounds good, I’m in too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai gave a firm nod in agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, that sounds awesome. Like a complete comeback after being on the ropes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded along with each of their answers, fully embracing what they were saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, bowing my head deeply, I said, “We’ll have to work quickly. . but please help me!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">First, I started by breaking down the video’s structure. I had a general idea of how I wanted it to flow, the information I wanted to convey, and the specific visuals for each scene. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>“—We’ll start with the title first, like this. We’ll have a photo of the club room in the background and the title will appear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I put a table in the middle of the club room and was going through each point with the club members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“After that, we’ll make a big reveal of our goal. Then, I think it’s a good idea to briefly talk about it and summarize our planned activities. We should make it clear that there’s more to come after this.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone was listening intently to my explanation, which was heartening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve only ever watched videos, not made them, so I’m anxious about whether this will work. If I get input from these club members, It’ll definitely be a success. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then, we’ll show off the club room and equipment, and wrap it up with some final words. Since it’s our first video, we don’t wanna make it too long, maybe like five minutes tops. Thoughts?” I looked up and asked everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So far, this is what I’m thinking, but does anyone have any opinions?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">After deciding on the video’s structure, we agreed on the role of each member after a quick discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Video Editing]: Nito Chika</p>
<p class="calibre1">[Narration]: Haruki Rokuyo</p>
<p class="calibre1">[Cinematography]: Mone Igarashi</p>
<p class="calibre1">[Script]: Meguri Sakamoto</p>
<p class="calibre1">[Internet Guru]: Haruki Rokuyo</p>
<p class="calibre1">[Producer]: Meguri Sakamoto</p>
<p class="calibre1">Thanks to our different areas of expertise, we quickly sorted out the division of tasks without any hassle. I have to say, I felt pretty satisfied with our setup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This, by the way, is just the basic role assignment. In reality, we’ve agreed to be 143</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>a bit more flexible. If anyone has spare time, they’ll help out the members who seem busy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Alright, let’s get to it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Is my smartphone good enough for recording?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—I reckon I’ll do some voice exercises.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone started working on their assigned tasks. Feeling encouraged by their enthusiasm, I also started writing the script on my smartphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright, good to go. Account set up, and channel created!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai looked up from the computer he’d borrowed from Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What do you think of this? I combined a photo of our club room and an image of the starry sky taken by our seniors for the header pic.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Wow, that looks amazing!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san, who’d been taking footage of the club room, broke into a smile as she looked at the screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s kinda stylish!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, it really is!” I chimed in, leaning in to look at the screen too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our very own “Amanuma High School Astronomy Club Channel” had been created on the popular video sharing website we often use. And, as Rokuyo-senpai mentioned, the header showcased a familiar image of the club room along with a mesmerizing starry sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This looks… really cool.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For some reason, it was oddly stylish. There was hardly any decoration, just a simple combination of materials. Yet, somehow, you could still sense the creator’s design sense in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there was an indescribable emotion attached to it. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>Seeing our own channel on the video site we always use feels surreal. It feels like we’ve grown a bit as people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I think it looks great too!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After me, Nito nodded happily. She stared intently at the header image…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“How’d you combine these images? Did you edit them together?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, there’s photo editing software on this computer. I gave it a shot, and somehow ended up with this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, I see. That makes sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">‘Somehow ended up with this’, huh? Isn’t that the professional photo editing software that Nito uses? It’s not exactly something you can just casually mess around with. Come on Nito, don’t just accept it so easily. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Phew…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After finishing writing the script, I took a short breather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking out the window, it was about time for the sun to set. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Checking the progress of the production against the current time… Yeah, we’re cutting it close. Will we be able to get all the material we need before school’s over? It’ll be a close thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we can just get this done, then we’ll have accomplished today’s goal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Alright, let’s do this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can’t afford to relax too much. There are still parts left to write. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening the memo app on my phone, I started to write additional narrations for self-introduction and club room showcase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—And with that, we’re done gathering material for today!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>The school bell chimed, signaling to the students that it was time to leave and go home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Honestly, we cut it close… but yeah, I think we managed to get everything we need.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I checked the list and gave a firm nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No doubt about it, we should have everything we need for the video now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All that’s left is to edit and upload it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once that’s done, we’ll have a club activity achievement to show. We can save the Astronomy Club from being disbanded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I feel a bit bad for Nito having to do more work after this though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, that’s the only thing that bothers me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll need you to edit until late into the night. . Sorry about that, but we’re counting on you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All we had time to do today was get all the material together. Sadly, that meant the actual editing needed to be done at home. And Nito was the only one with the equipment and skills for that. So, I’m sorry to say, all the work from now until the draft upload was on Nito’s shoulders. After that, we plan to meet up at school early in the morning and check the video together before actually publishing it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, leave it to me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito nodded, though she looked a bit tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t worry, I’ll have it all finished and ready by tomorrow morning, no problem!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, thank you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded and turned back to everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, that’s it for today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san and Rokuyo-senpai also nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now we’re in the real home stretch, so let’s do our best until the end!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>That night, I lay on my bed, staring at our channel on my smartphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were no videos uploaded yet, and not even a single subscriber. The channel was an empty shell, yet to be filled. Yet, I almost felt like I could see it. I could see new videos being updated there little by little. Each of our daily lives taking shape, one by one, lined up here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito is probably in the middle of editing the video at home as we speak. I’m truly grateful for her working so late into the night. I meant to help her, but in the end,  <i class="calibre4">I </i> was the one being helped. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once everything is settled and the survival of the Astronomy Club is secured, I really want to take her out and treat her to something as a thank you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I know what she likes to eat like the back of my hand. Whether it’s Fromage or Mont Blanc, I want to treat her to anything she wants. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Phew</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I rolled over and stared at the smartphone’s screen again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What will this channel be like three years from now? In the rewritten future, what kind of scenes will be captured here? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I imagine those scenes that lie ahead, I can’t help but feel a mix of joy, anxiety, and a strange sense of nostalgia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then—</p>
<p class="calibre1">An incoming call flashed up on my smartphone’s screen—【Nito Chika】</p>
<p class="calibre1">I casually tapped the [Answer] button and brought the phone up to my ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . Hey, what’s up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe she’s calling to ask for advice about editing. Or maybe she’s calling to tell me she’s done. Knowing her, it wouldn’t be a shocker if she finished earlier than anticipated…</p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nito’s voice echoing through the phone was—</p>
<p class="calibre1">〖…I’m sorry.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">—Unusually stiff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .W-what’s wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve never heard Nito sound like that before. What on earth happened…? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>As my doubts crept in—</p>
<p class="calibre1">〖My computer…〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">She reported matter-of-factly in the same stiff voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖…It broke.〗</p>
</body></html>
