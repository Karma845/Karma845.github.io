    <h2>Prologue: 1001 Seconds</h2>
    
<p class="calibre1">After school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could almost hear the  <i class="calibre4">tick, tick, tick </i> of time slowly passing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On a rainy afternoon in the first spring of our high school life, I found myself alone with her in the small club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, imagine, like, ten years from now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito spoke as if the thought had just struck her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By then we’ll have graduated from high school, may or may not have gone to uni, may or may not have jobs—we’ll be doing grown-up stuff anyway.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I lifted my head and glanced at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was hunched over, adjusting the angle of the tripod attached to her smartphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I was thinking that someday I’ll probably look back on these days in the club room with you, Meguri, and have fond memories of it. Kinda like ‘Oh, that was my youth.’” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . What got you thinking about that all of a sudden?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not sure. Just a hunch I guess.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes shifted from her hands to me and she smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides, my hunches are usually pretty spot on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>. Then let’s make sure we remember this conversation ten years from now I s’pose…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep. Please do, ‘cause I’ll probably forget.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>She’ll forget. Yeah, sounds like the Nito I know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It might’ve just been a random thought she’d had without much meaning behind it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in that moment her words felt special to me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that they were important somehow, and I wouldn’t forget them even after 10, 20 years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Okay, all set.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding, Nito sat down in front of the piano. As a test, she let her fingers dance on the keys, playing a mysterious melody. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright, I’m going to start recording. Sorry, but don’t talk for a bit.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Hmm? What’s up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her fingers still on the keys, Nito peered at my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Is something going on, Meguri? You seem a bit off today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She tilted her head curiously, her eyes piercing through me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You seem kinda spaced out, or like, your reactions are slow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s fair, I probably did seem off today. I’d been playing an FPS on my handheld console and was losing.  <i class="calibre4">Badly</i>. I was even struggling to keep up with Nito’s conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of it—because of the view in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her silhouette blurred together with the warm colors framing her. Her sky-blue painted toenails shone against her bare feet. The melodies that her fingertips played, the dust particles flickering in the sunset air, and the uncertain future ten years from now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My emotions were a dam about to burst as I took it all in, and I couldn’t hold them back anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…I like you, Nito.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words poured from my mouth before I realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Will you go out with me…?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Her smartphone’s camera was probably already recording. It captured everything. But I couldn’t stop myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito was silent for a moment, then smiled faintly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? You’re saying that  <i class="calibre4">now</i>…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, sorry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t people usually confess more formally than that…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Another fair point. Things  <i class="calibre4">had </i> escalated quickly. I should’ve come up with a better plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In hindsight, confessing on a whim might’ve been a pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My anxiety started to skyrocket. Regret was overloading my brain’s CPU. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I bit my lip. I’ve failed… I’m about to be rejected. Here it comes—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Please take care of me,” Nito said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If you’re okay with me… then please take care of me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at her as she lined up her nail polished toes on the floor. Her eyes, swirling with countless specks of light, stared straight at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .For real?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“For real.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Not joking?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Dead serious.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“With me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Who else would it be…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked a little embarrassed and smiled shyly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I let out a whoop of joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I grabbed her hand, practically jumping with joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It feels like I’m dreaming. Thank—you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, you’re really that happy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Heck yeah! You’re gonna be my girlfriend, right?!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>“…Yeah. I’ll be your girlfriend. Ah. .saying it out loud like that is so embarrassingly cringy…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her cheeks in flames, Nito looked at me shyly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She hesitated for a second, as if choosing her next words carefully, “. .Let’s support each other, okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at that face, I was sure. It wasn’t just a feeling, it was fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I knew for sure that many joyous days were ahead of us. We were going to be very happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the beginning <i class="calibre4">. </i> Nito. Me. This place. Our three years of high school would start right here, right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next thing I knew, I was shouting like crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’ll definitely be happy together!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then—</p>
