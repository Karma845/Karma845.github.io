<h2>Chapter 3: Just Living Enough for School</h2>

<p class="calibre1">“So, what happened?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, not much has changed, really.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was back in the present timeline’s club room, the day after graduation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto, who was perched on a desk, answered my question halfheartedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Igarashi-senpai definitely joined the Astronomy Club. But, you guys still couldn’t meet the minimum number of members with just three people. After two years, you all grew distant the same as before, and Nito-senpai has disappeared again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Makes sense, I guess.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I nodded, I glanced around this timeline’s club room, which I hadn’t seen in a while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, with things as they are, it’s likely to turn out that way. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It felt a bit refreshing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d spent about three weeks in the past. In that short amount of time, I was beginning to get used to being a first year student again. I felt strangely uncomfortable with how long my hair was now and the school uniform that fit me too well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After our rendezvous at the park, Igarashi-san decided to join the Astronomy Club, just as Makoto said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito had been over the moon. It was heartwarming to see her giggling and hugging Igarashi-san when she came to the club room. It almost felt like they loved each other, or had maybe awakened their inner yur<a href="index_split_001.html#p132">i<b class="calibre3">¹</b></a>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">78</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>Anyway, we still couldn’t find a fourth member, and I guess the future didn’t change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks like there’s a long way to go, doesn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It does, but…” I started saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are a few things that have become clear.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I sat down on a chair next to Makoto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Things that have become clear?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah. Firstly, it’s clear I actually  <i class="calibre4">did </i> go back to the past. It’s also clear I’ve been jumping between the past, three years ago, and the present. And, that I can change things.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had a hunch about it before, but now that I’m back here, I’m absolutely certain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was no hallucination or anything of the sort, but actual time travel. I can go back to the past and change things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That means—I can save Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking about that again made my spine tingle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Also, it’s weird, but you’re the only one who can understand the changes that happened because of the alterations. While Nishigami and the others only know about the current timeline, only you remember the timeline before the changes.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was something that stood out to me as strange last time, too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two sets of memories were coexisting in Makoto’s head. Judging by Nishigami’s reaction, it seemed that Makoto was the only one who experienced this phenomenon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now you mention it. . that’s true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto crossed her arms with a confused frown on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why only me…?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Maybe because we were together the times I jumped back and forth between the past and present. I have no real proof of that, though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s the only plausible reason I can think of right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">79</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>But, Makoto being aware about the pre-change timeline wasn’t really an issue. Actually, it was pretty useful to be able to debrief with her like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I feel like saving Nito all on my own would be an uphill battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Alrighty, I guess it’s about time to jump back again,” I said, having finished discussing everything with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait, you’re going back already? You’re not going to stay here a bit longer?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope. I’m worried about Nito back there. Plus, I feel bad for dragging you into this over and over again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, that makes sense.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason I came back to the present this time was essentially to “check, just in case”. To check whether the future really  <i class="calibre4">can </i> be rewritten. And to check that I could actually return to the present day club room after all was said and done. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On top of that, I wanted to know exactly  <i class="calibre4">what </i> had changed. Igarashi-san joining the club was a big deal, so this time I should’ve been able to get a clearer picture of the changes. And in the end, I was able to get the result I hoped for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that in mind, I figured it was about time to jump back three years again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Sorry, but I’ll be annoying you with my piano playing again,” I told Makoto with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It might take a while, so please bear with me. I’ll try my best.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, sure, whatever,” Makoto said curtly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, she lowered her gaze and paused, as if searching for her next words—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .So you’re going back, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice seemed to waver ever so slightly. That voice, trembling with loneliness, was very unlike her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What’s wrong?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instinctively, I leaned in to peer at her downcast face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Makoto lifted her head again, and in her usual curt tone, said, “Nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just do your best.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>“. .? Well, if you say so. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I nodded and started to trace the melody with my fingertips. My five fingers clumsily picked it up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, I couldn’t shake my anxious feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why did she seem so lonely? Why did her voice sound so sad when I told her I was going back to the past? And. . didn’t she seem a little distant? Wasn’t her usual familiarity just a tad faded? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It might just be my imagination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe it’s just because it’s been a while since I’ve seen Makoto and I’ve forgotten what it felt like before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, after thinking about it for a moment, it suddenly clicked in my mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Is it because the past has changed? </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">I redid the past and became friends with Nishigami. And to add to that, with Igarashi-san joining the club, I ended up making more friends than before the changes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Does that mean some of the time I used to spend with Makoto was eaten up by them? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The more I became friends with others, the more distant I became from Makoto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. .I’m not sure how I feel about that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The time I spent with Makoto was precious to me. Was it okay to unknowingly overwrite and let go of those moments like this.. ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But before I could delve deeper into that thought—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—Light engulfed my vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the darkness, the light began to whirl around me, gradually picking up speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seems like I’d successfully played the melody again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As my vision slowly returned to normal, and gravity regained its hold on my body—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Phew.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>I was back in the club room after school, three years in the past. The room was pretty much the same as the one I’d just come from, yet it had a subtly different feel. It felt like the vibe in this place has gotten a little brighter since Igarashi-san joined us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, the actual reason is that her stuff was strewn all over the place, making the room seem livelier by default. There were makeup tools, mirrors, manga, games, and all sorts of other crap scattered around. Honestly, it was starting to get pretty messy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But besides that, I felt like the overall atmosphere of the room was lighter now. That feels like proof that I’m leading Nito to a happy future, and I’m quietly chuffed about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then, I heard the sound of someone running from the far end of the hallway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The racket was audibly filled with excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the noise reached the front of the club room, the door was yanked open—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah! There you are, Meguri!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, with a rare excited energy, burst into the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carrying that momentum forward—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, listen to this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Woah!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She tackled me, hard. That’s way too much! If this were a Pokemon battle, the attack would’ve been  <i class="calibre4">super effective! </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san, who’d been trailing behind Nito, was also speechless. Even she seemed shocked by this level of enthusiasm. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oblivious to our reactions, Nito took off her indoor shoes and socks—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess what, I got a message from someone who saw my video!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From who?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“From Minase!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>That name. . I remembered it. She was an important person who had a major impact on Nito’s life before the rewrite. And, by extension, she was an important person in my plan to save Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, um, Minase is a writer I really admire.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s eyes sparkled as she sat down and continued talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s a uni student now, but when she was in high school, she started a blog that became super popular. The creators she recommends, like new writers, musicians, and manga artists, all get high praise. People even call them part of the ‘Minase community’ because she features them!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh really? I haven’t heard of her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">While my response seemed to suggest this was news to me, I, of course, knew about this beforehand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase was a critic Nito had admired for some time. Nito’s taste in music and her sense of style seem to have been nurtured by her blog. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, now that Minase had reached out to her, they hit it off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Later, Minase would start her own personal talent agency, Integrate Mag, and become Nito’s manager, or her creative partner. And they’d begin working together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, Minase-san praised me a lot in her email!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito excitedly fiddled with her smartphone, before turning it towards me to show me the email. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And when I replied saying that I’m a fan of hers too and have been reading her blog for ages, she asked if we could meet up. . It seriously feels like a dream!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Chika’s been going on and on about this all morning.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san, looking exhausted, slouched in her chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ugh, I’m so over hearing about Minase. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But it makes me really happy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Clutching her smartphone to her chest, Nito had a dreamy look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing her like this, I smiled and said, “Good for you,” before starting to think. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>At this point in time, when Minase had reached out, there was no sign at all that Nito would disappear in the future. Quite the opposite. She was at the peak of her happiness, eagerly looking forward to that future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, NITO was slowly gaining popularity online. The first original song she uploaded had already hit 30,000 views. Her new song that she just uploaded was blowing up even faster. Word had started spreading among keen-eared music fans that a seriously talented person had burst onto the scene. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean, think about it, 30,000 views is amazing. Having such a massive number of people listening to your song is mind-boggling. It’s hard for me to even fathom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No doubt, after this, Nito’s going to start facing some real struggles down the line. And eventually, it’ll lead to her leaving a suicide note and disappearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That being so—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I’d like to meet her too! Minase-san, I mean,” I said to Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now that I think about it, I’ve actually seen her blog before too. I’m curious to know what kind of person she is.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>, what’s this? Do you have an ulterior motive?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito peered into my face with a teasing look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you want to meet an older university girl, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, it’s not like that! I just want to hear her story!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I just want to get closer to her, just to be on the safe side! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Besides, I barely know anything about Minase-san. I can’t have ulterior motives towards someone like that…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s true—I don’t know much. Who Minase is. Who Nito will be making music with in the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, to be honest, I’m a bit cautious. Depending on how things unfold, I’m mentally prepared for a potential clash with Minase. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, the one who answered my concerns was—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .She’s really beautiful.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>—Igarashi-san, who for whatever reason, had a very disdainful look on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“She’s got black short hair and a great body. She’s so beautiful, she could totally be a model or something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, I see…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And I think she probably lives nearby too. Sakamoto might be trying to hook up with her for a one-night stand…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No way I’d go for her just because of that!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, I like Nito! Igarashi-san knows that! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hold on, how does Igarashi-san know so much about Minase? And why does she even know where Minase lives.. ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Wait, Igarashi-san, you’ve been following Minase’s blog for a while too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nope, I heard about it from Chika for the first time today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Then how do you know so much about her. .?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“‘Cause I checked out all of her blog posts during class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I read all three years’ worth, figured out her address, real name, and everything.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Heh, scary…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That settles it, she’s a total internet stalker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, why are you so concerned about Nito’s relationships? I thought you wanted to stop being so dependent…? Maybe it’s time for you to start standing on your own two feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, for now, I’ll tell Minase-san that a friend of mine wants to meet her too,” Nito said, clearly trying to wrap up the messy conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t guarantee she’ll be okay with it, but I’ll tell her. Oh, also, I’ve got a proposal for everyone today.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, a proposal?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is it?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>It must be about recruiting new members. There’s only one week left until the end of the recruitment period. So basically, we’re in a bit of a pinch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know how we always try brainstorming here, but we always run out of time before we can come up with any good ideas? Like, we can’t really think it through properly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mhm, we always run out of time, don’t we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, as if she had a lightbulb moment, raised her index finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why don’t we think about our future plans at my place?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said it as if it was some kind of brilliant idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If we keep brainstorming in the club room, we’re gonna be limited by time. . So, how about you come over to my place on a day off?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gross, that outfit is so cringe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the weekend, and I’d arrived at Ogikubo Station to meet up with Igarashi-san as promised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was waiting for me, arms crossed, and spat out those words the second she saw me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously, you’re all dressed up like  <i class="calibre4">that</i>, just to go to someone’s house? It’s so cringe.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!? Why!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help snapping back at her after such a surprising reaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, this is the first time I’m visiting her house, isn’t it!? And there’s a chance I’ll meet her family… So obviously I’d want to make a good first impression!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We stood in the crowded station plaza, with all sorts of people in all sorts of outfits passing by, and I definitely stood out as particularly dressed up. I’d 86</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>hurriedly bought a nice shirt and jacket from a fast fashion store. I’d even used hair gel to style my usually messy hair, and borrowed leather shoes from my dad. I’d spent quite a bit of money on my outfit, but I had no regrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today, after all, was the day I visited Nito’s house for the first time! </p>
<p class="calibre1">When Nito proposed the idea a few days ago, I instantly agreed. Of friggin’</p>
<p class="calibre1">course I wanted to see Nito’s house! Even in the three years of high school before the rewrite, I never  <i class="calibre4">once </i> went there! Igarashi-san had no reason to say no either, so now we found ourselves on our way to Nito’s house. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahhh, I wonder what her room is like…</p>
<p class="calibre1">Was it filled with stylish furniture, or would there be cute clothes lying around…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The anticipation was swelling up in my chest. Fluffy, sparkling images filled my head. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ugh.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san, for whatever reason, gave me a disgusted look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sakamoto, I bet you’re thinking about how good Chika’s room smells or something…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">How’d she know!? Did I accidentally say it out loud!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, you didn’t say it out loud, but it’s written all over your face…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She could read that too!? Is she some kind of mind reader!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also, there was another thing bothering me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I turned to face Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why’re you wearing a tracksuit, top to bottom? It’s like. . you’re going on a school trip or something…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I tilted my head in confusion at her outfit choice. She was wearing a black tracksuit from a famous sports brand and looked incredibly sporty. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>Despite seeming like someone who paid attention to fashion, she’d chosen a strikingly casual outfit. You’d expect her to be wearing some edgy makeup and a distinctive backpack, like an Ogikubo “Yuateya<a href="#p132"><b class="calibre3">²</b>” </a>. Then, why were her clothes so casual. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You know, now that I think about it, after Nito said, “How about you come over to my place?” Igarashi-san seemed a bit annoyed. Why? Did she have some kind of issue? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Well, you’ll understand once we get there.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sighed and started walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Once you see it, you’ll know why I’m dressed like this. C’mon, this way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .O-okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san started heading towards Nito’s house. I nodded and followed her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, we arrived at Nito’s house and went to her bedroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Welcome—make yourself at home!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Oh wow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the door opened, and took in every detail, I finally understood everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing that caught my eye was the  <i class="calibre4">mountain </i> of clothes. That’s no exaggeration. There was no way to tell if they were even washed or not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unfolded clothes were piled up, forming a mountain on the bed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn’t just the bed, either—pants, skirts, and other clothes were strewn across the floor. I could hardly believe my eyes. Seeing a girl’s skirt spread out like that—especially one the girl I liked had taken off—I thought I might feel excited. But instead, my enthusiasm took a nosedive. It all just felt so disgustingly… lived-in. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>Not only that, there were books, manga, printouts, and other random crap littering the room. A thin layer of dust had accumulated on a nearby electronic piano, with plushies, a desk clock, and a towel carelessly tossed on top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was no different for the study desk. There were empty disposable contact lens boxes, one visible earring, stationery like ballpoint pens, mechanical pencils, erasers, and a box of headache medicine peeking out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a word, it was a  <i class="calibre4">mess</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s room was a bona fide mess, and would probably go viral if someone took a picture and posted it on social media. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only upside to this unfortunate situation was that there wasn’t any leftover food or drinks left around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If a classmate came, one who only knew Nito as a model student, they’d probably faint on the spot when they saw it. If Chiyoda-sensei saw it, Nito might lose her position as class rep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in the middle of this wasteland—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meguri, this is your first time coming here, right~?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Nito was smiling cheerfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, this might be the first time a boy has come into my room! So you should feel honored, since you’re special!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito wore a comfy combination of a T-shirt and flowy long skirt, beaming with a bright smile at odds with the warzone around her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Ha-ha</i>… thanks…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, just so you know, my parents are out because of work and my sister’s at her university club. But don’t go getting any funny ideas!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Roger.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is she joking? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did she purposely make her room messy to surprise us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That must be it! I can’t think of any other reason! There’s no way Nito, who can create such delicate music, would have such a messy room! Haha, that makes sense. Yeah, it’s obviously a joke! </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>I’m sure we’ll quickly tidy up and move on to discussing our plans from here on out… That’s what I thought, but—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a bit cramped, but feel free to sit anywhere~” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nito said that, she used her nail polished toes to move things on the floor aside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, a space appeared, just big enough to fit our butts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .O-okay.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I finally accepted that this was for real. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, so that’s why Igarashi-san wore a tracksuit. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Excuse me. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I sat down a little ways from Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, something’s not right… Even though she made some space for us, I still can’t relax with all the bags and printouts that were left behind touching my butt. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what about the room owner herself? There’s no more space on the floor, is there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as the thought crossed my mind—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright then!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito heroically sat down on the bed. Without any hesitation, she plopped down on top of the pile of clothes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s begin the first Astronomy Club strategy meeting!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, as I thought, finding more members by the deadline with our current methods is pretty much impossible, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Guess so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mhmm.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>Since we’d come all the way to Nito’s house, we were all kicking back and occupying ourselves with whatever was on hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito and I were playing a video game, while Igarashi-san was reading manga, and so the conversation just kept dragging on and on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Most of the first years should already know about the Astronomy Club by now, right? We’ve given out sooo many flyers, and those star cards have been up for quite a while… Oh, Nito! The enemy shooter went that way!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got it, I’m on it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright, well, if no one is applying to join, I think we have no choice but to change our methods. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking back, I’d say our recruitment efforts weren’t all that bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the club being on the brink of disbandment, we’d managed to attract a fair amount of attention. At least now, I think pretty much every student knows we exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, we’ve yet to get any new members as a result. The only person who joined was Igarashi-san, and she’s Nito’s friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That being so, it’s pretty obvious that sticking to the same recruitment methods won’t get us anywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, you know. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san pouted, her eyes still glued to the popular shonen manga she was reading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s our plan? How can we attract even more interest than before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Hmm, maybe I could do some acoustic performances?” Nito casually suggested as she finished off the enemy shooter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Look, the brass band and light music club attract people with their performances, don’t they? If we can stand out like they do, we might still have a chance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I don’t really like that idea. Wouldn’t it just attract people who’re only there to see you, Chika? I don’t want those kinds of people showing up! I only want people who I personally approve of to get close to you!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>Igarashi-san said that with such confidence. She really wants Chika all to herself, doesn’t she? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Does she  <i class="calibre4">really </i> have any intention of changing her relationship with Nito. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What do you think, Meguri? </p>
<p class="calibre1">After getting shot down by Igarashi-san, Nito crossed her nail polished feet and looked over at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Got any ideas? Something different from what we’ve tried before, I mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, about that. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a match ended, I set down my controller for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I do have one, actually. I’d agonized over it at home last night and managed to squeeze out one final idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That said—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I do have one, but it’s kinda iffy. Might be hard to pull off. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s definitely iffy. Compared to the flyers Nito made and my star-shaped cards, this idea was kind of… lacking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or rather, it’s probably going to be quite difficult to actually put it into action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it can’t be helped. It’s not like we have any other ideas, do we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Guess not.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, Nito is probably right. There’s no use worrying about it anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, then let me explain. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I reluctantly began walking them through my recruitment idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright… we’re gonna try recruiting a completely different group of students—not like any we’ve approached before.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, we continued to laze around at Nito’s house, playing games and chatting. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>Next thing we knew, it was almost 6 pm. As it was nearly time for dinner, we decided to call it a day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Okay, take care, you two.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well. . we have an idea now, so let’s start chipping away at it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“See you next week.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">We said our goodbyes and left her house, heading home. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, thoughts?” Igarashi-san asked me on our way to the station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Now that you have visited your crush’s room and seen the truth, how was it? Honestly, that was something that could flush even a hundred years worth of love down the drain, don’t you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“About that. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her room was definitely shocking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I used to think that girls were special creatures. Unlike boys, they were cute, smart, glamorous, and wonderful even when left alone. But. . that was a fantasy. I finally understood that real girls, just like us, can have messy rooms, find doing laundry annoying, and slack off with cleaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of that—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think I might actually like her even more now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I feel like I’ve finally seen the  <i class="calibre4">real </i> her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s true my perspective has changed a bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure, I was shocked, but strangely enough, it made Nito seem even more radiant to me. That’s how I felt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, who is just a human being like me, became such an amazing musician, creating beautiful, dignified music. I find that kind of moving, you know…</p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s not some otherworldly being, but a girl my age living in the same world as me. Realizing that simple truth, a warm affection for her began to grow within me. That’s the kind of feeling I had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, it didn’t seem like Igarashi-san got where I was coming from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh. . You’re joking, right. .? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>She seemed more disgusted than ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, seriously, I can’t deal with guys who have a fetish for dirty rooms.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s not what I’m talking about!” I yelled in a panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s a more normal conversation than that! I just saw a genuine side of Nito, and it helped me understand her better. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>, really. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san still looked skeptical. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Man, how little does she trust me? Isn’t her bias against me a bit too much…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked away from me and let out a small sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, as if murmuring to no one in particular…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s much better than someone who’d lose interest just ‘cause your room is messy. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">And then, the following week. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Astronomy Club here. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Our club room is on the fourth floor of the south building. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please join us if you’re interested. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As discussed, we were trying a new recruitment method, but failing badly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The recruitment strategy I proposed at Nito’s house over the weekend had been a massive failure from the get-go. The proof lay in our whispered voices, so quiet they were nearly inaudible. In a stark contrast to our previous enthusiastic recruitment efforts, we did this one in near-silent whispers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We were in the north school building, where classrooms of all grades were located. Specifically, the hallway on the third floor, in front of the second year classrooms. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>“If you’re interested… Please come join us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Stargazing is really fun. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You can even come just to hang out. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was really embarrassing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Handing out flyers to second years, whose doubtful gazes said, “What are they doing? Are they trying to recruit  <i class="calibre4">us</i>?” was incredibly uncomfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My idea was to recruit older students. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally, club recruitment is targeted at first years. And yeah, we’d mainly handed out flyers in front of the first year students’ shoe lockers, and stuck star cards on them, too. But what about second years and above…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I figured that if there were older students who hadn’t joined a club yet, we could maybe snag some new members from that group. So we immediately printed more flyers, and made our way to the third floor before school started, but—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please consider. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We would appreciate. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Please. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—It was just wishful thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Recruiting older students was just a pipe dream. We simply weren’t able to hand out flyers. They probably didn’t think anyone would be recruiting them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second years just gave us suspicious looks and refused to take the flyers we offered them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was tough. I never thought that recruiting second years would be this difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s not like we were being pushy or anything, but just being around older students made me feel extremely anxious. I just wanted to go home, take a warm bath, play some games, and sleep soundly in my soft futon. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seemed Nito and Igarashi-san were feeling the same way. Even model student Nito, usually so composed, looked tense and was speaking softly, while Igarashi-san’s face was beginning to turn pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is she okay? She looks like she’s about to faint. She  <i class="calibre4">did </i> faint during the graduation ceremony after all…</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>“<i class="calibre4">Haah</i>. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I sighed, glancing at the clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">…I think we’re reaching our limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We still had a bit of time left before the bell, but maybe we should start packing up soon. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sure, we were desperate, but there was no point in wasting time on recruiting methods that weren’t working. Our club members were exhausted too.  <i class="calibre4">Perhaps it’s time for a strategic retreat</i>. Just as that thought crossed my mind—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’re you guys doing?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone called out to us. A powerful, deep, husky voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I turned towards it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Club recruitment? For us second years?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a familiar face in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Short, neatly cut hair and a manly, well-defined face. A tall, toned body and a wrinkle between his eyebrows. And, an aura of strength that enveloped his entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, R-Rokuyo-senpai!” I accidentally blurted out a bit too loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-It’s been a while!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruki Rokuyo-senpai. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A tough looking guy who had spoken to me and Makoto a while back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That Rokuyo-senpai, with a group of slightly delinquent-looking friends in tow, had come over to us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, I would’ve been intimidated and unable to say anything. I probably would’ve been too scared to do much more than force a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in this incredibly stressful situation, I was relieved to be approached by someone whose face I knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, we were recruiting for our club…” I started to say. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>“But, we couldn’t hand out any flyers at all, and we’re in serious trouble. If we don’t recruit one more member, our club will be shut down, but we just can’t seem to find that one person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words flowed from me easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe I was being overly familiar with someone I’d only met once before, but I figured this much was fine. We’d exchanged contact info after all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, sounds like you’re in a tight spot.” Rokuyo-senpai said in a casual tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But then he peered into my face curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait… it’s been a while? We haven’t talked before now, have we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">Craaaaap!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I messed up! We hadn’t talked in this timeline! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conversation I was referring to happened three years in the future. It was with Rokuyo-senpai after he’d already graduated high school and became a uni student. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was careless! My feelings had been hurt from the soul-crushing recruiting process and I wasn’t thinking rationally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What should I do!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">How do I get out of this!? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Think, me, think! </i> Now’s the time to unleash the full power of my dormant brain cells! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Oh,  <i class="calibre4">ehehe</i>. Have we never actually talked before?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment of deep thought (0.1 seconds worth), that’s the line that came out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, I might be mistaken… No, umm, the thing is, I’ve always looked up to you, Rokyu-senpai… So I’ve, uh, kinda been simulating conversations with you in my head for a while now. .  <i class="calibre4">ehehe</i>!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>Talk about creepy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What kind of creepy backstory am I making up!? Look, Igarashi-san is completely disgusted! And Nito is looking at me with a “Seriously. .?” face! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai must also be at a loss on how to react! He’s probably going to say something like, “You’re annoying” and punch me, isn’t he…!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now the panic was setting in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I braced myself for the impending blow, reflexively stiffening my body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“— <i class="calibre4">Hahaha</i>, what’s with this guy?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai, for whatever reason, started laughing in amusement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s definitely a lie. But hey, it’s kinda funny.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Huh? Did I just manage to wing it? Did I seriously just save myself from a huge mistake with  <i class="calibre4">that</i>. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai seems more laid-back than I expected…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, so you’re recruiting for your club. Got it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai grabbed a flyer from my hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, good luck. If I think of someone, I’ll send them your way.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, really? Thank you so much. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I bowed my head slightly, and Rokuyo-senpai walked off down the hallway with his friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But to send people he knows.. wait, really? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is he really willing to do that for me? Rokuyo-senpai. .? Nah. . probably not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I mean, there’s no way someone from that crowd would want to join the Astronomy Club. But still, is it okay for him to go that far for us.. ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless, there’s no doubt he said it out of kindness, so there’s no reason for me to refuse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I decided to gratefully accept his words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank you, Rokuyo-senpai. . really. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">That day marked a turning point in our recruitment activities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They started to come. Every day, visitors came to the club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, so this is the Astronomy Club Haruki was talking about.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, I didn’t know there was a club room like this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“When the heck was this map made? Way before we were born, I bet?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A group of second year students, who looked like they were friends with Rokuyo-senpai, dropped by. They actually did seem interested in the Astronomy Club’s activities, looking at the telescope and star chart with curiosity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait, did Rokuyo-senpai really recommend us.. ? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why. .? Do delinquents have a soft spot for their friends? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, an opportunity had come knocking, and we couldn’t afford to let it slip away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s why the three of us tried our hardest to welcome them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, for now, it’s just the three of us!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re pretty flexible! You can join us and do whatever you like!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ll be doing actual astronomy stuff, but you can just hang out if you want!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, I hadn’t really interacted with many seniors like them before. They were handsome, stylish, or simply dazzling. They were seniors just like Rokuyo-senpai himself—outgoing types. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being around people like that always made me feel nervous. I felt inferior and couldn’t really talk to them normally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other two club members were also struggling to adapt to this change—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, thank you!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We do things every day!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We’re planning to do some stargazing soon!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>Firstly, Nito was acting differently than before. When she was usually in the club room she was barefoot and a bit of a slob. But now, she had socks and indoor shoes on. From my perspective, it looked like she was forcing a smile as she interacted with the seniors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This feels a little. . off. Nito came to this club room wanting a place where she could relax. Isn’t this the complete opposite of that. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next, Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since she was naturally outgoing, she had no problem chatting with the seniors, unlike me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, after the activities ended each day—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“That guy definitely had the hots for Chika. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I feel like that person and Chika will eventually fall out. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I seriously can’t deal with hardcore party people. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was wary. She sized up each senior who visited, noting down whether they’d make a good fit or not on her smartphone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, what’s the deal. .? You wanted to stop depending on Nito, didn’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was pretty obvious, so I stealthily asked her that when Nito wasn’t around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-It’s not like I’m being clingy or anything!” Igarashi-san insisted, looking pretty flustered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, it’s only natural to worry about compatibility between club members!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright then, does that mean you’re worried about  <i class="calibre4">my </i> compatibility with the seniors too?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Don’t avoid the question so obviously!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anyway, there were a few things that worried me like that. But now wasn’t the time to hesitate. Me and the others somehow pumped ourselves up, pushing aside our worries, and kept going with our sales pitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so, the last few days were very busy as we did our final push. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With only four days left in the recruitment period remaining. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">100</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“In the end, not a  <i class="calibre4">single </i> person joined our club, huh. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once again, it was just the three of us left in the club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I slumped my shoulders as I muttered to myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So many seniors came to visit, but not a single one joined. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s somehow how things ended up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of students who’d submitted an Astronomy Club application to date was a big fat zero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, the club still only had three members: me, Nito, and Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It felt like things went pretty well. Everyone seemed genuinely interested in the club’s activities, and there were many seniors who left a good impression despite their unique personalities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So then. . why? Did they just pay us lip service. .? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, well, it can’t be helped, can it?” Nito said with a wry smile, her feet bare for the first time in a while. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think they  <i class="calibre4">were </i> actually interested when they came to visit. From the conversations we had, I didn’t get the feeling they were just being polite.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, yeah, it’s tough to join a club in your second year, isn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing her arms with a huff, Igarashi-san followed on from Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like, they’ve been high schoolers for a whole year now, so their daily routine is pretty much set. Starting a new activity now, unless they’re really drawn to it, would be tough, wouldn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, good point. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her words hit home, and I found myself nodding in agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The seniors who dropped by did seem to be busy after school. Adding club activities to their schedule now would be tough for sure. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They probably weren’t the type to just laze around every day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">101</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>Until now, they spent their time after school hanging out with friends, working part-time, going on dates, or studying. It’d be difficult to change a routine like that, nurtured over a year—especially for the sake of joining some small club. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then, there was a knock at the club room door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh… another visitor!? This might be our last chance. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">As those thoughts ran through my head, I called out, “Come in!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Nito hurriedly pulling on her socks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the end—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yo. Oh, you guys are here.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—The person who entered was.. Rokuyo-senpai. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As always, he was powerful and commanding, with a deep, husky voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, um, what brings you here today?” I asked curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Do you need something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I glanced over, I saw Nito removing the socks she had just put on. Wait, is it okay for her to be so relaxed in front of this person? How is she even deciding that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, I was just thinking that I might’ve caused some trouble.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai scratched his head as he sat on a nearby chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My friends came to visit quite a bit, yeah? But I heard later that none of them decided to join in the end. Seems like a lot of trouble for nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What!? No, no, no!” I blurted out at his surprise apology. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, there’s no need for you to apologize, Rokuyo-senpai!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, we’re super grateful. That people came to visit and were interested in the club, I mean.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If it weren’t for you, we probably wouldn’t have had a single visitor till now. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, but I figured at least one would join. Guess everyone is busy after school.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, seems that way. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">102</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>Smiling ruefully at my senior, I nodded along with a similar expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, we were just talking about that too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Glad you understand. They’re not bad guys, ya know. So, what’re you guys gonna do about the club now? The recruitment period is almost up, but are you guys planning to keep pushing until the last minute?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, yeah, we’re going to try at least.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing my arms, I put my thinking cap on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We only had four days left to recruit. You could definitely say we’ve been backed into a corner. But, we had hardly any options left. I couldn’t think of any decent strategies at this point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, we have no choice but to keep going, even if it means crawling on the ground…” I said to Rokuyo-senpai with another wry smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There’s no helping it. We’ve just gotta slog through. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s all we  <i class="calibre4">can </i> do. We have no choice but to push forward, putting our last bit of hope into it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And if that doesn’t work. . I don’t know what I’ll do. I’ll have to come up with something completely different for my Nito Rescue Plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>, that right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding, Rokuyo-senpai crossed his long legs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But surprisingly, he fit pretty well in the club room. So far, everyone who came to visit kind of stood out. Flashy people in a plain room makes them feel out of place. Rokuyo-senpai, though, doesn’t feel out of place at all. Instead, it feels natural for him to be here, creating a sense of harmony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why is that? Objectively speaking, it couldn’t  <i class="calibre4">be </i> more mismatched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“By the way, why’re you guys trying so hard to protect the Astronomy Club?” Rokuyo-senpai asked curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were pretty desperate when you tried recruiting second years, am I right? Seems like you’re most hardcore when it comes to recruitment this year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You guys really that into stars?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . Ah,  <i class="calibre4">haha</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, that would definitely come across as strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">103</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>So I couldn’t help laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s not exactly like that. Each of us has our own mixed reasons for wanting to protect this place…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gotcha. Like what?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai, looking interested, turned to Nito and Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, I. . actually, I sing and play the piano,” Nito started saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I make videos of my own original songs and share them on video sites. I had this awesome idea of using this place to shoot them.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Gotcha. You’ve got the piano here for it I guess. By the way, what name do you use for posting vids?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s NITO. In English.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“NITO, huh. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Saying that, Rokuyo-senpai fiddled with his smartphone and found Nito’s video. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He pressed [Play] and the song flowed from the phone’s speaker. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh snap, fifty thousand views. Sick. Song’s really good too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seemed he genuinely liked Nito’s song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving the song playing, Rokuyo-senpai turned to Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And you? Why do you wanna protect the Astronomy Club?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, ah. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san hesitated a bit as she looked down. But then she raised her head, as if she’d made up her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna have a new kind of relationship… with Chika.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What, me!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s eyes widened in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I guess this is the first time she’s hearing it, so it must’ve caught her off guard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep. Like, we’ve always been really close, haven’t we? I think of you as my best friend, Chika, and I know you feel the same about me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">104</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>“Mmhm. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But you know, lately I’ve been thinking that I haven’t been relying on you in a good way. I’ve been getting jealous and hating it if I’m not your number one. I think it’s becoming a bit of an unhealthy dependency. . But it’s also hard to distance myself, so I didn’t know what to do.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san looked at me as she continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s when Sakamoto was like, ‘Why not join the Astronomy Club?’ It would let us build a new relationship while still being close to each other…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san’s face suddenly relaxed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So. . Yeah. I thought I should also do my best to protect this place.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .I see.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito looked down with a shy expression. Her nail polished toes fidgeted while she spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s what you were thinking. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh wow, these two are flirting again. I might seriously start to become a yuri otaku at this rate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As for me. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was finally my turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m the only one who really wants to do stargazing and things like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Um, I want to become an astronomer someday. That’s why I want to start doing stuff now, to give myself a solid base. . And…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I thought about it for a moment, I decided to casually add something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I also have something I personally want to protect. . That’s what I’m working hard for.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yeah, I couldn’t just leave that out. It’s because both those things were present that I’m so serious about this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The regrets I left behind in my past high school life. In order to not repeat them, for the first time in my life, I’m living each day with everything I’ve got. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s no real point in hinting at that here, but for the sake of my own feelings, I just couldn’t keep silent about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">105</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>I suddenly noticed—Nito was staring at me intently. Eyes as black as night, shimmering with a glimmering light, like glitter. They were staring at me as if they could see right through me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait, what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why is she looking at me like that. .? Did I say something weird? Well, yeah, I guess I did hint at some kind of backstory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm, got it. Then I’ll join. The Astronomy Club.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But… even if I did hint at something, isn’t her reaction a bit strange? Just because I mentioned wanting to protect something, does she have to stare so intensely? It’s not like I said anything particularly special. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I join, you’ll have enough members, yeah?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahhh, did she misunderstand? Maybe she thinks I meant “I want to protect Igarashi” or something? Maybe she thinks I like Igarashi-san and I’m trying to support their relationship. That’s possible, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How ‘bout it? If you guys are cool with it, I’m down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">If that’s the case, it could be a problem. I only love Nito, that’s it. I definitely didn’t mean for anyone to get the wrong idea and cause any trouble in that regard. Maybe I should clear up this misunderstanding. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">. .Huh? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I feel like there was something said that caught my attention just now. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">While I was lost in thought, I have a feeling that Rokuyo-senpai said something outrageous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stopped my train of thought and replayed the memory from the last few seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Hmm, got it. Then I’ll join. The Astronomy Club.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—If I join, you’ll have enough members, yeah?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—How ‘bout it? If you guys are cool with it, I’m down.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Wh-whaaat!?” I screamed and ended up falling off my chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">106</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>“Rokuyo-senpai is gonna join!? The Astronomy Club!? Seriously!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Your reaction was slow. .” Rokuyo-senpai muttered under his breath, and smiled wryly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“How long were you holding that in before screaming? Scared the shit out of me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, no wonder my reaction was slow! If you drop something like that out of nowhere, obviously my brain would need time to process it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A-are you for real!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes I’m for real. So how ‘bout it? You cool with it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Um, I’m fine with it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s tone suggested she was just as surprised as I was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think everyone else will probably agree too. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito looked at me and Igarashi-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two of us nodded in agreement with lightning speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s definitely surprising, though. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But while I’m still intimidated at times, my impression of this person has changed a lot over the past few days. Despite having a tough exterior, he is genuinely kind-hearted and treats people like us as equals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If that’s how it is, then there’s no reason to say no. In fact, it’s a relief to escape this predicament. I’m truly grateful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But why, Rokuyo-senpai? I feel like I’m missing something…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hmm. . honestly, it’s just a gut feeling. Haven’t really thought it through.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai crossed his arms and looked thoughtful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’ve always had this idea of starting my own business someday. My folks want me to take over the family business, but I’d rather start a business with my friends.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, starting a business, huh. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus, his parents want him to take over the family business…</p>
<p class="calibre1">To think there are people like that in real life. It’s like something out of a drama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">107</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>“So, that means I’ll have to work with all sorts of people, yeah? Not just my friends, but also people with different personalities. But everyone around me is just like me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, that’s true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of Rokuyo-senpai’s friends are the so-called “outgoing” type. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he were to start a business, it wouldn’t necessarily work with just those kinds of people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“That’s what got me thinking about doing something with different types of people, but ones I can trust. I had no clue what to actually  <i class="calibre4">do </i> though. I didn’t have any connections either. So, when you guys were recruiting and we chatted, I thought, ‘These guys are pretty cool.’ They’re totally different from me, but they’re dedicated. So, yeah. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rokuyo-senpai stood up and flashed us a refreshing smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d be stoked if you’d let me join you guys. So how ‘bout it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Spoiler alert—the three of us welcomed him with open arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We wrote Rokuyo-senpai’s name in the fourth slot on the club member list. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And just like that, the Astronomy Club managed to gather enough members. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a total success, and the club’s survival was secured—</p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">That night, as I lay on my bed, I thought back on everything that had happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My days during those three years of high school, before the rewrite, always ended with bitter memories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To think that it would turn around like this. Just by giving my all, the situation had changed so much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It still feels kinda surreal…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I breathed out, closing my eyes against the glare of the fluorescent lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staring at the rainbow-colored afterimage that remained on my eyelids, I found myself lost in thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">108</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>Nito, Igarashi-san, and Rokuyo-senpai. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I would never have believed my past self if he told me I’d be in a club with such incredible members. Even now, it still feels like a dream. But it’s not a dream, it’s reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In my second run at high school, my days are much better than the ones before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Well, we did cut it close though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only four days had been left on the recruiting clock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Rokuyo-senpai hadn’t joined us, there’s no doubt the Astronomy Club would’ve been donezo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, compared to the first time, when we couldn’t even get to the starting line, the difference is like night and day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I might be able to save Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We might be able to reach a completely different future. The joy of that possibility was certainly there, but more than that, I was surprised. I was surprised that I could push myself this hard, and as a result, the situation had changed so much in less than a month—</p>
<p class="calibre1">The smartphone on my nightstand started to vibrate. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Bzzz</i>,  <i class="calibre4">bzzz, bzzz</i>. This unfamiliar vibrating sound. . It’s a call! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hurriedly grabbed my phone and saw【Incoming call: Nito Chika】on the screen—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—H-hello!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Hello. Sorry for the sudden call.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s voice came through the phone I hastily pressed to my ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Your voice sounds strange, were you asleep?〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">It was high-quality sound over Wi-Fi. Hearing it so close to my ear tickled my heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, no, no, I was just spacing out. It was sudden, so I was surprised. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Good, I’m glad. Can we talk for a bit now?〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, yeah, sure…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">109</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>What is it? What could she want to talk about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">We’d talked on the phone a few times when we were dating before the rewrite. Like, when we met up or when we went to the countryside with our families during the summer holidays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, we didn’t talk on the phone as much as typical couples, so I was curious why she went out of her way to call me like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖It’s good about the club, isn’t it? It looks like it’s going to continue,〗Nito started saying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖I never thought Rokuyo-senpai would join, but I’m relieved. Thanks for working so hard.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no, it goes both ways. Thank you too. For helping me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖You’re welcome.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard a muffled noise on the other end of the line, and the tone of her voice suggested she’d changed positions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is she lying down? Is she lying down on her bed like me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt a little flustered. Imagining her lying on her bed in her room, far from here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be fair, Nito’s room is a mess. It’s probably covered in clothes, and the actual sight might not be that pleasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still─there’s a melancholic sexiness in Nito’s voice with her laying down like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She seemed to have picked up on my agitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Oh, what’s up? You suddenly went quiet.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, no!” My voice went up a bar in panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, well, it’s nothing. Anyway. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖 <i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>, could it be. .〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s voice audibly brightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖You were imagining me lying on my bed and got excited, didn’t you?〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">She hit the nail on the head. So much so that I was dumbstruck. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>I felt a sudden jolt. Sweat broke out all over my body, and I didn’t need a mirror to know my face was turning red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, after a moment’s thought, I regained my composure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Well, actually, that’s exactly right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">After taking a deep breath, I shot her a playful smile through the phone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I got so excited I lost the ability to speak.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖. .Wha—?〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, because you’re so cute, just talking on the phone makes me really nervous.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖. .Wh-what…?〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">Even over the phone, I could hear Nito’s embarrassment and could tell she was blushing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Y-you’re meant to deny it…〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">Yep, that’s Nito for you. She’d make a joke, and if by chance I went along with it, she’d get extremely embarrassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We used to play around like this a lot when we were dating. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/qg52pPp/index-119-1.jpg" alt="index-119-1" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>It’s been over a year since we had this kind of exchange. I found myself on the brink of tears, overwhelmed by nostalgia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Hahaha</i>, sorry, sorry. It was a joke, I’m just messing with you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖. .Huh?! What the heck is that?! So annoying.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I said I’m sorry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖What the heck?! It’s so hard to react when you say something like that!〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito let out a “Jeez…” in frustration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Really, Meguri, you do have a sort of  <i class="calibre4">way </i> about you. Like, you’re oddly comfortable around girls.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh. . Really?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Well, remember when we first met in the club room? You helped me when I fell over. Not many guys would do something like that.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Oh right, something like that did happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I suppose extending a hand to a girl they barely knew might’ve been a tall order for most. But then again, from my perspective, Nito was my</p>
<p class="calibre1">“ex-girlfriend.” So, it’s not that I’m comfortable around girls, but instead, I’m comfortable around  <i class="calibre4">Nito</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖So I feel like I’m being toyed with, and it’s frustrating.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to do that. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Are you sure about that…? Okay, then…〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s voice hinted at a sudden thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖If you  <i class="calibre4">do </i> feel bad about it then, there’s something I want you to tell me.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sure, what is it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Meguri. . you said you have something you want to protect, didn’t you?〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">My heart skipped a beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖What does that mean? Are there other reasons you want to protect the Astronomy Club that you haven’t told me about?〗</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>So, that’s been bothering her after all. About my slip of the tongue and the accidental hint I dropped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How should I respond? Should I just brush it off? Make up some other reason? Would that be the safest option? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Sorry. I’ll tell you about it eventually.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—After a moment’s thought, that’s what I said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s something important, so I can’t tell you right now. But I think I’ll be able to tell you eventually. Can you wait for the explanation until then?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I honestly didn’t want to lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don’t want to repeat the lies I kept telling myself and others during those first three years. Especially when it comes to such an important topic. And, especially when it comes to Nito Chika. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Oh. I see.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito sounded disappointed. I could almost see her pouting right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Well. . okay then. As long as you tell me someday. I have some ideas of my own as to what ‘it’ could be anyway.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? I wonder if you’re right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖I think I’m right.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">No… sorry to say, there’s no way you could guess. That I want to save you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That to do so, I traveled back in time three years. </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖. .Oh, right, there’s another reason I called.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh, why’s that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖I talked to the writer I mentioned before about you.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">“A-ah. Minase-san, wasn’t it?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The university girl who would later become Nito’s partner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had completely forgotten about her with everything that was going on with club recruiting. But that’s right, Nito was going to meet her soon. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖Yep, that’s right. I’m supposed to meet her tomorrow. And it seems that Minase-san is a little interested in you.〗</p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>“. .Huh, seriously?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">〖So, please. . let’s meet her.〗</p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“All of us live quite close to each other, don’t we?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we sat in a quaint café near Ogikubo Station, the closest station to Nito and my houses on the JR Chuo Line, Minase-san smiled at us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I live in Nishi-Ogikubo, so it’s within walking distance.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was definitely beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Black bobbed hair. Eyes that seemed to hold the galaxy. Thin lips and clear, porcelain-like cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She seemed perfectly at ease in this cozy little café, and I could see why Igarashi-san had spoken so highly of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, beyond that, there was something mysterious about her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, I might be a bit nervous.. ” Minase-san said, smiling innocently again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I hardly ever get to meet high school students in person, y’know. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had only been a few minutes since we met at the station. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I really couldn’t get a good read on her for some reason. Sometimes she looked like a calm, intelligent, and sharp woman, and other times she looked like a young, innocent, and carefree girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her tone of voice, expression, and way of speaking changed constantly, making it hard to keep up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The impression I got from her blog was the same. Since we were meeting in person, I quickly checked it out beforehand. The way she wrote, what she recommended, and how she approached her work was so varied that it was hard to believe it was all done by the same person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So for a while, there were people out there who actually thought that</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Minase” might be a collective name. They believed it couldn’t possibly be just one person running the blog, but instead a circle of writers working together. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/HYhy83Y/index-123-1.jpg" alt="index-123-1" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>But, it was strange to see her in person like this. It’s like her expressions and voice changing like that is just second nature to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, maybe that’s just how people are. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito is like a completely different person when she’s in class, in the club room, or when she’s the musician NITO. As for me, I’m the type whose personality changes in the middle of an FPS game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Well then, hello again, I’m Minase,” she said as she handed Nito her business card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase was in serious mode now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You told me before that you’ve been reading my work, but I write and manage a blog while attending university. . That led me to writing reviews for other online platforms and participating in subculture-related events. I mostly identify myself as a writer, but I also have other ideas and plans about supporting creators and the like.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I-I’ve been reading your blog since junior high!” A very excited Nito eagerly butted in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually, my first real exposure to music was through your blog. I used to listen to all the music you recommended. . That’s basically what shaped me into who I am now. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aww, that makes me so happy!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase-san’s face suddenly became childlike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really?! Thanks so much. . It makes me really happy to hear that from my readers.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s nothing. . Oh, I should introduce myself too—My name is Nito Chika. I’m a first year high school student and I play piano and sing under the name NITO.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Nito finished her introduction, they both turned to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, I guess I should introduce myself too, even though I’m just a background character. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, I’m Meguri Sakamoto. I’m in the same class and Astronomy Club as Nito.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“<i class="calibre4">Hmm</i>, Sakamoto-kun.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>Minase-san leaned in to get a closer look at my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So you’re using the same room with the piano in the video, aren’t you, Sakamoto-kun?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, that’s right. After club activities are over, she sometimes shoots videos there and stuff, so I get to see it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Aww, I’m so jealous!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was back to her innocent mode again…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanna hear Nito-san’s music live too. . Oh, by the way, I’ve checked out your videos too. Gotta say, I was blown away. It’s been a while since I’ve come across such amazing talent. I’ve been itching to meet you in person.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ahh. . I’m so happy I could cry.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as she said, tears started welling up in Nito’s eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And also, I have a little proposal in mind, but for that, I want to know more about your life, Nito-san… and what your friends are like too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh, a proposal. .?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s eyes widened in surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Right. I know exactly what this proposal is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same thing happened before the rewrite. Starting today, Nito will soar even higher as a musician. Meeting with Minase-san was  <i class="calibre4">that </i> important for Nito’s future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But there’s one thing that’s different from last time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Me. I’m here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I definitely hadn’t been as invested in Nito’s music activities before the rewrite. I want to use that difference in a meaningful way to change the ending—the one where she disappears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“As I mentioned earlier…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase-san switched to serious mode and continued talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to start supporting creators.. The internet is full of young talents with amazing skills. But, they’ve got to deal with all the miscellaneous tasks that come with creating, which can feel tedious to some. What’s more, it’s tough for 118</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>creators with the same goals to connect. There’s no system for like-minded creators to collaborate and support each other in their creative endeavors.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah, I see, there might be something to that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Major record labels and talent agencies used to perform the role that online creators are doing themselves now. There are definitely some advantages to it, but there would also be a lot of challenges to overcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So basically, it means that it’s difficult for alternative cultural communities to emerge. I think magazines used to fulfill that role. People who enjoy content like that, both creators and fans, find it challenging to discover or create the works they love on the internet.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mhm, mhm, I totally get it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito nodded energetically in agreement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The people I like are also all working independently, and it’s hard to find them through connections.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">They seemed to really understand each other, but I’m starting to feel a bit left behind in their conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, right now, I’m thinking of forming a kind of group that gathers and assists my favorite creators, regardless of genre. Like a label to support creators who are individually active in various mediums, like music, novels, manga, and videos.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ohhh, that’s a good idea.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, being a fan of Minase-san, seemed overjoyed hearing that, and her face lit up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, that’d be great not only for creators, but for fans too. When you recommend other creators, you can sense their consistent style, and it makes it more likely for me to become a fan too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks, it’s reassuring to hear you say that. By the way, we already have a name for the label, it’s called ‘Integrate Mag,’ which means integrated magazine. Anyway, here’s the deal…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase-san looked straight into Nito’s eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She spoke her next words clearly. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>“Nito-san, would you like to be the first affiliated creator?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">—“<i class="calibre4">Wait, I need to talk to my parents about this first!” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">That was Nito’s response to Minase-san’s invitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the outside, though, she looked absolutely thrilled. Her excitement was practically overflowing, and it was clear as day she wouldn’t back down from her decision to join, even if her parents were against it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, in the future, I knew Nito definitely joined Integrate Mag. In turn, her fanbase exploded, her popularity skyrocketed, and she became an acclaimed national musician. As things progressed, Integrate Mag also went through the process of becoming a proper company, and it evolved into a dynamic group of emerging creators, including novelists, manga artists, streamers, and fashion designers. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">This is where it all starts</i>, I thought while watching the conversation between Minase-san and Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The movement that would have a massive impact on Japanese culture began right here, right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the conversation ended, and Nito went to the restroom—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. . . ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Awkwarddd. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Left alone with Minase-san at the table, I was feeling extremely awkward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Uh, what should I talk about. .? What’s the right kind of conversation to have when you’re left alone with a woman in her twenties? Talk about makeup? Clothes? Love? I had no friggin’ clue. I mean, I could barely hold a conversation with girls  <i class="calibre4">my </i> age, so with an older woman, there wasn’t a snowball’s chance in hell I’d be able to have a decent conversation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Restless, I reached for my cup to drink some coffee. But the cup was already empty, and all that happened was I made the idiotic sound of me slurping air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">120</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>Sneaking a glance at Minase-san, I saw her staring down at the table with a serious expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had a thoughtful look, like she was deep in creative thinking. It was so captivating that it made me even more nervous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now that I think about it, was I kind of in the way? Wasn’t it a bit thoughtless of me to butt into such an important conversation between the two of them…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The anxiety was causing a sweat to run down my back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Actually…” Minase-san said hesitantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“There are a few things I wanted to talk to you about too, Sakamoto-kun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh, with me?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, when I listened to Nito’s music. . I was blown away by her incredible talent and amazing sense of artistry. But at the same time. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her eyes wandered, as if searching for the right words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…I also felt an indescribable sensitivity in her music.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, I think I understand.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d definitely felt a shadow like that lurking in Nito’s musical. Neither model student Nito in class nor life-sized Nito in the club room gave the impression of being “sensitive,” so much as “pure” or “straightforward.” But I could feel those subtle hints of sensitivity in her music, or to put it bluntly, a certain fragility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think that’s why the Nito three years from now was accepted as the</p>
<p class="calibre1">“mysterious genius.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And so, I think that when a girl like that, someone who is sensitive, presents her music to a large audience it naturally puts a lot of pressure on her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’ve seen many creators who end up cracking under that pressure.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase-san took a small sip of her coffee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I want to make sure Nito-san doesn’t end up like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s pretty sharp, I must say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Minase-san predicted, Nito would “crack” in three years. Leaving behind a suicide note, she would disappear from our lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">121</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>Right now, I’m sure nobody could predict a future like that. It was probably beyond anybody’s wildest dreams that she would become a nationally acclaimed musician either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this person, Minase-san, was the only one who noticed the signs at this stage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, to prevent that I’ll give her my full support and take responsibility. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">but personal relationships, or rather, the relationship with school friends also matters, I think.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked at me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Are you two dating right now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .No, we’re not dating.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her straightforward question left me stumped for a second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, just friends?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Uh, well. . right now, yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Haha</i>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase-san laughed at my slightly awkward response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She leaned her elbows on the table, looking at me as if at a puppy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .You like her, don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I flinched reflexively. But, yeah, I guess it’s probably obvious. It was bound to come out, given how much I’d stuck my nose in so far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And besides, I think it’s better to be upfront about it here. I want to be involved in Nito’s creative work as much as possible. And I also want to leave a strong impression on Minase-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, I do like her. So, I’m sorry for butting in like this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s fine, it’s fine.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase-san shook her head with a playful expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m the type who finds that kind of thing fun. I’ll be cheering for you, Sakamoto-kun. You seem like a good kid.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, thank you…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">122</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>As I nodded, I noticed Minase-san’s eyes darting towards a corner of the cafe. Curiosity piqued, I followed her gaze and noticed Nito coming out of the restroom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well then, we should keep what we just discussed our little secret for now.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Minase-san, looking cheerful, placed her index finger against her lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’d be nice if we could support Nito-san together. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I agree.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nodding, we shared a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Together, as her supports.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be honest, there’s still so much I don’t know. Right now, there’s a big difference between the Nito I spend my days with and the future her that disappears. I can’t really wrap my head around the fact that she’ll end up like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But. . I’m sure it’ll become clear in time. What Nito is grappling with. The pain she will experience. Her worries and despair. I’ll come to know these things. I’ll see a side of her that I couldn’t see before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite my anxiety, and the fear of whether I can handle it all—at least I’m not alone in this anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking that way, I felt a little weight lift off my shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—So, these are the members of this year’s Astronomy Club.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the next day, in the staff room. Just two days before the recruitment period ended, I handed in the paperwork to my homeroom teacher, Chiyoda-sensei. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We were able to get four people, which should mean the club can continue for the next year. Could you please check this?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I handed over the application form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">123</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>That morning, we all gathered in the club room to double check the form, now listing the names of all Astronomy Club members—Nito Chika, Mone Igarashi, Haruki Rokuyo, and Meguri Sakamoto. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With this, I’ve cleared a major hurdle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, I might be able to stay by Nito’s side. I might be able to support her. I felt proud, not for anyone else, but for myself. Even  <i class="calibre4">I </i> could change my life if I tried hard enough. It might be the first time I’ve truly felt that way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Hmm.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Chiyoda-sensei looked at the names lined up on the form, she sounded happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m a little surprised. You pulled together quite the group. And even a second year too…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-sensei, with her bobbed hair swaying, smiled brightly. She would be my homeroom teacher from my first to third year. She was strict with me, as I had a habit of slacking off, but she also had a good understanding of her students and had the trust of my classmates. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-sensei is thirty years old. She moved to our school from a high school in Nishi-Ogikubo when she returned from maternity leave, after having twins last year. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, everything’s in order,” She said, looking at me with her bright smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You did well. I’ll be supporting your club activities from now on.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Thanks a lot.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, what about the report on your club activities?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh? Report?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes. A report on the activities that the club has been doing from last year to this year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she spoke, Chiyoda-sensei opened a drawer in her desk and took out a student handbook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Here, it’s written in the school rules, isn’t it? The conditions for the continuation of a club.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">In that instant, I felt my blood drain from my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">124</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>The conditions for the continuation of a club were clearly stated in the school rules.. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The number of members should be four or more by the day before Constitution Memorial Day. From the previous school year to the above date of the current school year, there should be records of the following activities: Participation in competitions as a club activity, presentation of research findings or activities of a similar nature.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was frozen in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chiyoda-sensei’s expression darkened as I stood there, unable to utter a single word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice was low and probing as she asked, “. .Are you, by any chance, not prepared?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to answer, I simply nodded my head slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today was April 30th. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The deadline was the day before Constitution Memorial Day, which gave us only two days until May 2nd. </p>
