    <h2>Chapter 1: Write; Rewrite Treatment</h2>
    
<p class="calibre1">In the blink of an eye, three years had passed, and my high school life came to an end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having finished attending the graduation ceremony, I was sitting on a bench near the main gate reminiscing about the day of my entrance ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It went by so quickly, didn’t it…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A faint, lustrous scent hung in the air. The gentle noon sunlight caressed our uniforms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What met my eyes were countless cherry blossom petals dancing in the spring breeze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pale pink undulated, swirled, and flowed like a living creature. The black of our graduates’ uniforms really stood out against the color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sense of excitement reminiscent of a movie’s final scene filled the air. I remembered a scene just like this one playing out three years ago, on the day of our entrance ceremony; the school filled with contrasting cherry blossom pink and black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It feels like something straight out of a top-notch manga, don’t you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I said to Makoto, sitting beside me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You know how the first and last chapters have those scenes that repeat? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s probably the only thing that makes high school life bearable.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, like, everything else is just tossed out?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For some reason, Makoto, who’d been watching the scene in front of us, let out an amused laugh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“All the high school memories, events, and little things—throw them all away.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p13"></a>Short golden hair swaying, Makoto looked at me with mischief written on her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The uniform looked stylish on her petite body. Her overall outfit, which <i class="calibre4">technically </i> violated school rules, suited her mature face surprisingly well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“True… I guess?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But I s’pose it wasn’t  <i class="calibre4">all </i> bad. Wasting my youth with you I mean, Meguri-senpai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Mmm…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto laughed again, but if I’m honest, I feel a bit sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d wanted to spend my time here more meaningfully. Studying, club activities. Friendships.. and romance. I’d wanted to do all the fun things I was meant to do in the prime of my life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in reality, it’s just as Makoto said, the one year before she entered this high school plus the two years after that. I couldn’t fully commit to anything, or give it my all where it mattered most. I kind of just drifted along. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My grades were terrible. I didn’t have very many friends. And barely any memorable moments to be proud of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d been a super lazy person since I was a kid so that always put me at a disadvantage. It was my fault though, so I had no right to complain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d really hoped my third year would be way more exciting and eventful, y’know?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’ve got FOMO<a href="#p38"><b class="calibre3">¹</b></a>. I get it. Not everyone can have all that though.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Only a few people  <i class="calibre4">can </i> I s’pose…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s something people fall back on, but I still think working hard is a talent, too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those who can do it,  <i class="calibre4">do</i>, and those who can’t,  <i class="calibre4">can’t</i>. A small part of the difference between them might’ve been upbringing or life experiences, but the biggest part was simply innate ability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously getting hung up on that wouldn’t change a single thing, so it wasn’t an excuse not to work hard. But personally, I think it’s true. And, I didn’t have any natural talent either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Amazing people are  <i class="calibre4">really </i> amazing, I guess…” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p14"></a>“Yep. They’re on a whole other plane of existence than us.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They just keep pushing and pushing, endlessly.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right? How the heck can they do that?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s a high chance we both had the same girl in mind right now. Another member of the Astronomy Club Makoto and I belonged to. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Nito Chika. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’d been through three crazy years and become successful in the blink of an eye. She’d drifted so far away now that she’s completely out of reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She didn’t even show up to today’s graduation ceremony. She must’ve been too busy with “work” to make time for something like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makes sense, I guess. She’d started living in a dorm in the city center after she moved out of her parents’ house. She came to school on breaks between work and that’s about it. That’s what she’d said in a video of her being interviewed I saw online anyway. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Actually, wasn’t the first time we met near this very spot on entrance ceremony day? </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Oh, sorry! The cherry blossoms were so beautiful that I couldn’t see where</i> <i class="calibre4">I was going…” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Nice to meet you. I’m Nito Chika.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s as if I could suddenly hear her voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were the same words as that day. Her pleasant voice resonated in my ears. But it was—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Looks like Nito-senpai’s video reached over two hundred million views.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Drowned out by Makoto’s sudden off-hand remark. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Wow.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Her name was even mentioned as a candidate for this year’s Kohaku Uta Gasse<a href="#p38">n<b class="calibre3">²</b></a>.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Seriously? She’s at that level now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“They say she’s been booked for performances overseas too.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>“Wow…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I gave Makoto dumb responses, I tried to remember Nito’s face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her smiling face, her angry face, her face when she was on the verge of tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All those faces I must’ve stared at time and again in the club room after school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t remember them. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Meguri-kun. Meguri Sakamoto-kun.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Oh, what a nice name.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, I thought I heard her voice again, before it was snatched away by the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright then, thanks for the past two years.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, no~ I have a feeling our paths will cross again sooner or later” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Could be, could be. We might accidentally end up as classmates at the same uni or something.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But senpai, that’d make you  <i class="calibre4">my </i> junior.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh please no, let’s not go there…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the front of the school gate, I bantered back and forth with Makoto, who’d come to see me off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Starting this spring, I’ll be a roni<a href="#p38">n<b class="calibre3">³</b>. </a></p>
<p class="calibre1">I half-assed studying for exams, so I’d ended up not having the score to get into my first choice of university, or my backups for that matter. I reap what I sow, I suppose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for real, if I fail two years in a row and end up as Makoto’s junior it’ll seriously kill me. If that happens my dwindling self-esteem will be erased completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Haaa</i>…” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>I breathed out a sigh as the wind swept through the area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With my vision blocked by flower petals, my nose caught a nostalgic scent again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re thinking about Nito-senpai, aren’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto read my mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Kinda, yeah.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Isn’t that a bit pathetic? Still being hung up on your ex like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, it’s normal to still have  <i class="calibre4">some </i> lingering feelings, is it not?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, yeah, I guess it’d be normal when it’s someone like her.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She’s right about that. Nito and I had actually been dating for a while before the breakup. So, we were in the typical ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend relationship now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In hindsight, it must’ve been love at first sight. I fell in love with her on the spot when I happened to bump into her near this gate, on the day of the entrance ceremony. I’d been quick to confess that love, while also being prepared for rejection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her long hair, her radiant smile, her melodious footsteps, and the light blue of her toenail polish were vividly etched in my memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, let’s just try to forget about it and move on, okay?” Makoto said with a rare gentle smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“The other person was the school’s most popular girl and is now a national musician. You were never really in the same world to begin with.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, you’re right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she said, Nito was way out of my league. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s sad to admit, but I’m an underwhelming average guy with nothing special about me in any way. My looks are average, my personality is average and my abilities are average. I also have a bit of an otaku side, which is pretty average for our generation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So I never understood why a girl like Nito, who was very popular with boys back then, chose  <i class="calibre4">me </i> of all people to date. There was a queue of guys vying for her attention, so why did she choose me? </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p17"></a>“<i class="calibre4">Haaa</i>. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I sighed again, looking up at the school building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I were to compare my high school years to a manga, this would be about where the epilogue ends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Filled with regret until the very end, what was my high school story all about…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Mm?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto, still beside me, sounded confused as she glanced around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wonder what’s going on, everyone’s acting kinda weird, don’t you think?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Yeah, I think so too.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I looked over in that direction I noticed that the graduating and current students—who up until that point were happily chatting and taking pictures and videos—now wore worried looks and were murmuring quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Some stared intently at their smartphone screens, while others frantically typed out messages. Some were saying stuff like “No way, is this for real?” and</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But we haven’t seen her recently.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did something big happen? Hopefully, it’s not a disaster or anything like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .This can’t be true! Why!?” One of the graduates suddenly yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a petite, flashy-looking girl, her lips trembling. I recognized her as Nito’s childhood friend. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Since the 20th!? That’s like a week ago! I didn’t hear anything about this!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her outburst caused even more of a commotion. The murmurs grew louder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What the heck’s going on?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Meguri-senpai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto, who’d been looking at her smartphone, sounded tense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Take a look at this.. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned the screen towards me. Bewildered, I looked at the news article displayed on the screen. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p18"></a>【Breaking News】Singer NITO Leaves Behind Suicide Note and Goes Missing</p>
<p class="calibre1">At noon on the 27th, Integrate Mag, the agency representing singer NITO (18), revealed that they have lost contact with her. According to the press release, they lost contact with NITO after a rehearsal in the city on the 20th. When they visited her apartment, where she lived alone, they found a letter addressed to an acquaintance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A search request has already been filed, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department is currently trying to locate Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">NITO — A singer-songwriter who debuted after her cover song video, posted on a video-sharing site during her first year of high school, went viral. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Popular among the younger generation, she has a mysterious presence and a strong influence among them. Her latest songs have received high praise not only in Japan but also overseas, with performances scheduled in the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t wrap my head around it. I understood the words. I understood the meaning. But, I couldn’t quite accept it as reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, missing. No contact for a week. A suicide note left at her apartment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“U-um, should we just try calling her or something?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still sounding tense, Makoto began swiping on her phone’s screen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her fingers were trembling slightly, and I could tell she was unusually upset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y’know, maybe it’s just fake news…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto pulled up Nito’s contact information and hit [Call]. After a few long seconds with the phone pressed to her ear…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .No good, it’s not connecting.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked up at me, as if pleading for help. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What should we do? What  <i class="calibre4">can </i> we do…?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>I couldn’t find the words to answer that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memories of her flashed through my mind. Nito, who was always smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, who was a hard worker. Nito, who was friendly but had a lazy side too, and yet stepped onto a stage worthy of her charm. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“I’m looking forward to high school life.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">“Let’s have a good three years together, Meguri-kun.” </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">Her voice echoed in my head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Senpai? Where are you going!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before I knew it, I’d started walking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My feet naturally led me to  <i class="calibre4">that </i> place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe I shouldn’t be doing this. There might not be any point in going there. Yet—for some reason, I couldn’t stop myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to feel Nito’s presence, even just a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey, Senpai! Wait up, please!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without answering the flustered Makoto, who was following me, I headed toward the school building in a daze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">I stopped in front of the Astronomy Club room. In front of the small room where Nito, Makoto, and I had spent so much time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door was carelessly unlocked, and I stumbled inside. Makoto followed me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Senpai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Why did this happen…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It felt like all the strength had left my body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t even muster the energy to reply to Makoto’s concerned look, and I slumped down into a nearby chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What does ‘missing’ even mean…” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>I couldn’t believe it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“And a suicide note too…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">My memories of her and what was in the news article didn’t match. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We had spent  <i class="calibre4">a lot </i> of time together in this very room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I raised my head and looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stuff belonging to the school was scattered everywhere—like mineral samples and an old world map that still showed Germany divided into East and West. There was a broken radio cassette player, a desk covered in graffiti, and a dusty plaster bust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While it was  <i class="calibre4">technically </i> the Astronomy Club Room, it was used more like a</p>
<p class="calibre1">“storage room” for unwanted crap. Many old and worn-out items were stored in the musty air. The only things belonging to the club itself were a telescope and a star chart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And—the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An upright piano placed in the corner of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My eyes were naturally drawn to it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the early days of the club, Nito would write songs, perform them on that piano, and upload the videos online. After everything that happened, that thing feels like a part of her, an empty shell that she’d left behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Senpai,” Makoto called out to me, her voice gentle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Let’s take it easy for now, okay? Should I go buy us some drinks?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, it’s fine. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn’t feel like drinking anything. </p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Is there something I can do? </i> The thought crossed my mind briefly but I quickly dismissed it. The cops were already on the move, anything I did at this point would just be getting in the way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, for now, in this place, I just tried to remember her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her face, her words, the time we spent together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Scenes that should’ve been burned into my eyes, and the sound of her singing I’d heard again and again. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>It was supposed to be easy to remember. Whenever we were hanging out, I’d often think to myself,  <i class="calibre4">I’ll never forget this scene. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">But…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was all fuzzy. In my mind… my memories of her were fading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I can’t remember. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I fumbled for the memories, but there was no doubt about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s been almost three years since we started dating and nearly two years since our inevitable breakup. With that much time having passed, my daily life with Nito was beginning to become a distant memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This can’t be real, forgetting like this—oh, that’s it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">An idea struck me and I latched onto it, moving to the front of the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I opened the lid and reached out my hand to touch the dirty keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Senpai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—Slowly started to feel out the melody of Nito’s song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, I’ve hardly ever played the piano, and I’m not even that knowledgeable about music. But I felt out the melody all the same, note by note. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I don’t do this, I feel like she’ll disappear. I feel like her existence will disappear along with my memories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I kept messing up, but I tried to follow her song as best I could on the piano. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It didn’t go smoothly at first, but slowly it started coming together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Wow, you remember it pretty well, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto, next to me, laughed painfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’d almost forgotten that song.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I really liked this one, it’s my favorite,” I replied, my fingers still awkwardly placed on the keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It’s been stuck in my head all this time.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>I said that to console myself, but honestly, I probably didn’t understand it at all. I  <i class="calibre4">definitely </i> didn’t understand Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d never felt the slightest hint that she’d be pushed to the brink like this someday, or that she’d completely disappear. I believed that she was a girl who was untouchable by such tragedies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If only I’d noticed. If only I’d understood Nito better. Would the future have turned out differently? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Could I have taken away some of her pain? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .You really still love her, don’t you?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">For some reason, Makoto’s voice sounded resigned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Even now, you can’t get Nito-senpai out of your head.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Ah, yeah, I guess so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I gave her a firm nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think that’s probably true.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I finished playing the melody, I opened my heart to Makoto. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I still have feelings for Nito, even now—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—The next instant light engulfed my vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wha–?!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A blinding flash of light. I reflexively closed my eyes against the pure white light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a few seconds, the image burned into my retina faded and I cautiously opened my eyes…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was floating in darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything else had vanished, and I was floating in a completely dark space. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t feel any gravity. There was no heat or cold. It just felt like… nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking around, I could see several lights orbiting my body. Dazzling lights of different sizes and speeds, like revolving planets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is this.. ?” </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>Despite my confusion, the lights gradually rotated faster and faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light turned into a whirl, swirling around me at high speed until my vision was filled with pink light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“This is. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It felt… familiar for some reason. I had no idea what was going on. Yet, for whatever reason, it was a strangely comforting experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment, I realized—</p>
<p class="calibre1">Cherry blossoms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Countless cherry blossom petals were dancing around me. I suddenly noticed the overwhelming scent of flowers. It felt like a warm spring breeze was brushing against my skin—</p>
<p class="calibre1"> <i class="calibre4">Thud</i>. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Something hit my chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, sorry!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I heard a voice—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“The cherry blossoms were so beautiful that I couldn’t see where I was going…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">—A familiar one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice of someone who used to be very dear to me and who was always by my side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind stopped, and the storm of cherry blossoms settled down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gravity returned, and petals fell softly to the ground, clearing my vision—</p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a girl in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had long black hair, which she held back with one hand, and a bright, composed face with a smile lighting it up. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/W2W8GGv/index-24-1.jpg" alt="index-24-1" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a>Her straight posture, her slender fingers, and the shiny toes of her loafers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nice to meet you. I’m Nito Chika.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those were her words to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You’re a first-year too, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her glossy black hair, her curious yet demure eyes, her porcelain-like nose, and her brightly colored thin lips—</p>
<p class="calibre1">No mistaking it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without a doubt in my mind, Nito Chika was standing right in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Wha–?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unconsciously, I looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somehow I—no,  <i class="calibre4">we</i>—were standing near the main gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gate had a characteristic worn and mossy appearance of a public school. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dreary car park was nearby. Beyond that, I could see the entrance to our fifty-year-old Amanuma High School and a fountain that’d probably been in operation for the same length of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Students wearing the same uniform as us were gathered around, and there were some adults who appeared to be parents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lively chatter, and the festive atmosphere that filled the air—I’d seen this scene before; It was the entrance ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three years ago, the day Nito and I met—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Hey.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito peered at my face with a puzzled look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s up? You’re spacing out. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“A-ah, yeah. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I cleared my throat quietly and answered, feeling dazed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, I’m a first year too. My name’s Meguri Sakamoto. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I said that, I realized it was the same line I’d used three years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s right, back then, on the day of the entrance ceremony, Nito and I bumped into each other in a storm of cherry blossoms. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a>That was the beginning of everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Meguri-kun. Meguri Sakamoto-kun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito repeated my name as if rolling it around in her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wow, that’s a nice name,” she said, smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing her expression—I finally understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a hallucination. This is just all a hallucination I’m seeing after the shock of Nito’s disappearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As proof of that, everything was just like it was three years ago. The scenery, the words coming out of Nito’s mouth, even down to the stiffness of the loafers I wore. Everything was a recreation of that day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking a closer look, Nito was much less fashionable compared to her recent self. Though she became much more fashionable over the three years of high school, the person in front of me was definitely the first year version of her, still giving off a junior highschooler vibe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I’d completely returned to my past self, too. My head was a bit cold given I’d cut my hair too short, and I carried a brand-new bag. My uniform felt stiff and a little big for me. That makes sense as I remember buying one size larger in anticipation of my growth spurt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Well, that settles it then—It  <i class="calibre4">must </i> be a hallucination. I was replaying the convenient parts of my memory, trying to protect myself from the shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So that’s how it is. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Realizing that brought me a huge sense of relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it’s just a hallucination, it only makes sense for Nito to be standing in front of me. I’d been thrown for a loop to begin with, but now I understood it, it all seemed so simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, it was an incredibly high-resolution hallucination. All the other students around me had returned to what they looked like back then too. I could even see teachers I’d completely forgotten existed after they’d transferred to different schools. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I suppose things like this could happen. Maybe, despite my appearance, I’ve had some crazy photographic memory talent hidden away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Chika!” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>“Y-Yes!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone had called out to Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Sorry, gotta go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, right.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m looking forward to high school life. Let’s have a good three years together, Meguri-kun.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, Nito waved and ran towards the source of the voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then it hit me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ah… that’s right. That hand wave, and those nimble footsteps—they were what made me fall in love with her instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“But seriously, this hallucination has gone on way too long!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The entrance ceremony and class orientation had ended. Finally free, I walked down the hallway muttering to myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, I thought it was a pleasant hallucination. I mean, I got to see Nito again and relive those memories. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My feelings had settled down a bit because of that. I figure I’ll be able to handle things more calmly once I get back to reality. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s great and all, but it has already been around three hours since the hallucination started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What’s going on? Is it normal to have a hallucination that lasts this long? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe I fainted in real life? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, “Seriously, it’s way too realistic. This almost feels real. ” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yep, it’s  <i class="calibre4">too </i> realistic. Every detail is just too vivid in this hallucination. Is this what they call 5K? Don’t these things usually have some blurry parts? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since it was so realistic, I tried fixing a few mistakes I’d made in real life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like, my self-introduction in class. Three years ago, I tried to tell a joke and 20</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>completely bombed. Because of that, I ended up being ostracized by my class right from the get-go. So, in this hallucination, I just kept it simple and safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I also remembered the time I forgot to take a form home for my parents to sign and ended up getting put on blast by my homeroom teacher. So, I made sure to put that in my bag, too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Doing things like that, the version of me in this hallucination can start a new life that’s at least better than reality.  <i class="calibre4">Good luck, me. </i></p>
<p class="calibre1">On the flip side, though, it made me reevaluate real life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nito really is amazing after all.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito, who was in the same class as me, was just as much of a “superheroine” </p>
<p class="calibre1">as she was in real life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As she had the best grades in the entrance exam, she was chosen to rep the new students and give a speech at the entrance ceremony. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In class, she was quickly made the class rep and confidently greeted everyone on the first day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She treated her classmates equally, attracted attention from lots of boys because of her beauty, and was clearly trusted by the teachers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, that’s right, that’s how she was right from the start…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Caught up in the nostalgia, I unintentionally let those words slip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Back when Nito wasn't NITO yet, but just someone who was there by my side, laughing with me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite it being my second time, despite having already experienced it, she was still as dazzling as ever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s what I was reminded of after such a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, I should be able to see a slightly different “side” of her pretty soon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So. . she  <i class="calibre4">should </i> be in here right now, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Muttering, I stopped in front of a certain room. The Astronomy Club Room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In real life, I ran into her here on the day of the entrance ceremony too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was interested in astronomy and dreamed of becoming an academic someday. I thought joining the Astronomy Club would make my high school life more meaningful. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>And, in that club room, I ended up running into Nito in the most unexpected way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .You’ve got this.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I mentally pumped myself up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I grabbed the doorknob and opened it forcefully—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“…Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I’d predicted, Nito was there. Sitting on a chair in the old, run-down room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her beautiful black hair I’d been admiring in class earlier. Her white cheeks and round eyes that reflected the afternoon sunlight, appearing as if they were scattering light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mind you, her posture was a big contrast to the impression she gave off in class. Firstly, she’d taken off her indoor shoes and socks. Also, her bare legs were crossed on top of the desk in front of her. And, as if that wasn’t enough, the shorts under her skirt were completely exposed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">—There she was, her bad manners on full display, slouched in the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To top it all off, she had a game console in her hands, completely engrossed in playing some FPS or other—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Whoa!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">She flipped over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a loud noise, Nito toppled over along with her chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Y-you okay!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ouch…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hurried over and reached out my hand to her. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/1vkSr9s/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">Nito frowned and grasped my hand, then staggered to her feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, sorry. Sorry for showing you a weird side of me. You’re Meguri-kun, right?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Right. And sorry for barging in so suddenly. I didn’t think anyone would be in here. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know right,  <i class="calibre4">haha</i>.” She laughed, and I was once again struck by a strange feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is too real to be a hallucination, isn’t it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I really showed you an embarrassing side of me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito chuckled and rubbed her sore butt. She must’ve hit it pretty hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I wanted to keep this side of me a secret.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Haha</i>, talk about bad luck right from the first day, huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help but chuckle a bit at our nostalgic banter. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>It was hard to square this Nito with the current one in real life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Genius musician NITO, model student Nito-san, lazily playing games in a club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Huh? Aren’t you surprised?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito peered at my face curiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I mean, I showed you a completely different side of me than the one in class.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .A-ah! Yeah, that’s right!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I reacted too late and panicked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“No, I  <i class="calibre4">was </i> surprised! You’re way different from the image I had of you until just now!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I know, right?” Nito said with a wry smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She wiggled her nail polished toes restlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I thought I’d try to be the perfect student at school, y’know.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s right… Nito Chika was this kind of girl. I knew she had multiple sides. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, Nito the model student. Top grades, beautiful, and the pure-hearted heroine of the school. She was the total package, turning heads and capturing the hearts of both guys and girls alike. Nito Chika, the embodiment of perfection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second, NITO the singer. The “shadowy genius” who sings against the backdrop of a nostalgic old club room. That’s the public image of the mysterious musician NITO. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third, club room Nito. A chill, lazy high school girl and a bit of a slob. The relatable girl-next-door Nito. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All these sides of her were genuine, but for me, the carefree Nito in front of me is the easiest to get along with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Oh, by the way, Meguri-kun. Are you interested in joining the Astronomy Club?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep. I was planning on it.” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>“I see, I see. Me too, actually. Well… I’m not really into astronomy though, I just wanted to use this room,” Nito said with a mischievous smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My older sister is a graduate from here. She told me there’d be an empty club room this year.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“So, you took the chance to slack off and I caught you in the act.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Pretty much.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a giggle, Nito playfully bumped her shoulder against mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, I didn’t think anyone would come on the  <i class="calibre4">first </i> day. I messed up, didn’t I?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">…That expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her casual touch and the tickling scent of her shampoo were all so nostalgically familiar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, things don’t always go as planned, do they?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I walked towards the piano, I couldn’t help taking a sarcastic jab at myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt like talking a little bit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Back then, I had high hopes for my high school life. I wanted to have a great time, make lots of memories, and get closer to my dreams.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I placed my fingers on the piano keys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I gently pressed down, a simple “Laaa♪” sound echoed through the after-hours school building. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But before I knew it, it was over without me being able to do anything. I’m full of regrets. I knew it would happen, but I couldn’t change.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What do you mean?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito gave me a confused look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“It was over? You couldn’t change?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yep, that’s just about how I  <i class="calibre4">thought </i> you’d react.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It’s such a realistic hallucination. It’s not like Nito would conveniently know about my regrets here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a bit of comfort, I started to trace Nito’s song on the piano keys again. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>“. .Ah!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nito’s eyes went wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">. .Oh, right. That’s the kind of reaction I’ll get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This Nito hadn’t written the song yet. And a boy in front of her was playing the melody she would later create. I’m no musician, so I can’t fully imagine, but it probably felt pretty bizarre. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“But, I mean… I’m glad I got to see you again.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I smiled at the Nito in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I’m glad I could see you one last time, Nito, even if it’s just a hallucination.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .What do you mean by that—” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment Nito opened her mouth, I finished playing the melody—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—Light engulfed my vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a second, everything went pitch black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lights began to swirl around my body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same strange space as when the hallucination started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the lights rotated faster and faster, everything in front of me was painted white—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Senpai? Senpai!?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">First, that voice struck my ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What’s wrong? You suddenly spaced out. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Um, uh. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I came to, Makoto was in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking around—it was the same old, familiar club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the setup in this room was different from the one I was in with Nito just a moment ago. The map and the radio cassette player were slightly more worn, and the curtains more faded. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>And, most importantly, my uniform actually fit me. A small flower decoration for graduates was pinned on the chest—</p>
<p class="calibre1">—The hallucination had ended. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was just a daydream, brought on by the shock of Nito’s disappearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It ended, and I returned to reality…</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .No, sorry, it’s nothing.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Really? Well, if you say so.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah, sorry for worrying you. Alright then, I guess it’s time to go home.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alrighty, let’s go.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having talked it out, we left the club room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We changed our shoes at the entrance, and headed for the main gate, where a bunch of students were still remaining. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The end of a dream is always bittersweet. I wanted to talk to Nito a little more. There were things I wanted to say and things I wanted to ask. If possible, I wanted to apologize too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But. . yeah. I feel much better now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .  <i class="calibre4">Haaa. </i>” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I took a deep breath, a faint sweet scent tickled my nose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There’s no point in panicking anymore. There’s nothing I can do, so I’ll just wait patiently for more news. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What other choice do I have? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whatever happens—Nito probably won’t be a part of my life anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">⭒₊⭑✧⭑₊⭒</p>
<p class="calibre1">“—Ah, there you are, Sakamoto!” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As we approached the main gate, a graduate suddenly called out to me. It was Nishigami, a guy who’d been in the same class as me in our first and third years. He was surrounded by a few of his friends. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>They came over to us with concerned looks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Hey bro… you okay?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Man, your ex, what happened to her. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Igarashi-san was hyperventilating and had to be taken to the hospital. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">we’re worried about you.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Ah, umm. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was thrown for a loop as they started bombarding me with questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Well, yeah… honestly, I’m freaking out a bit. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Igarashi-san, the girl who’d broken down earlier. She collapsed? This has really become a big deal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides all that, I had a not-so-pleasant memory of Nishigami and his group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My self-introduction on the day of the entrance ceremony, where I slipped up badly in real life, had led to my failed attempt to become friends with Nishigami’s group. We’d been chatting a bit before that, but the distance between us grew after the disastrous self-introduction. They weren’t necessarily bad guys, but I seemed to be a “pretty weird person” to them after that. Makes sense I guess, considering how much I messed up from the start. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the first stumbling block of my high school life. It became the starting point for my endless stream of slip-ups. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, even when they spoke to me like this, I couldn’t help but feel awkward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Besides, there was one more thing that bothered me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Wait, Nishigami, did I ever tell you and the others I was dating Nito. .?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I feel like I hadn’t revealed that to them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn’t intentionally hide it, but only a few students around us should’ve known that Nito and I were dating. It was kind of embarrassing to go around telling people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So why does Nishigami, who I barely talked to, know about it? Could it be that it turned into a huge rumor and I just didn’t notice? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Nah, nah, nah. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Nishigami just laughed with a face that said, “You’re kidding, right?” </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>“You asked us for advice all the time during our first year. Like, where you should go on a date or what clothes to wear—shit like that.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Like, you basically humble bragged about it while we were eating lunch together, remember?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“You were trying to show off to us single guys.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nishigami and his friends laughed among themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wait. . asking them for advice? Eating lunch together? I didn’t do that. I never did that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Anyway, if anything happens, just hit us up.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nishigami put his hand on my shoulder, his expression serious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“We can’t do much, but we can at least lend an ear if you wanna talk or need some advice.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yeah man, don’t even think twice about it.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Alright then…” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just like that, they left through the main gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I watched them walk away, I was still a bit dumbfounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Still, I desperately tried to organize the conversation in my head—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Has the past been rewritten?” I muttered before I could catch myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Yes, that’s the only thing that makes sense. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I’d one hundred percent messed up my self-introduction. After that, I hardly talked to Nishigami and his group, until today. There’s no way I could’ve gotten their advice or eaten lunch with them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the hallucination—in that bizarrely vivid illusion—I managed to avoid bungling my self-introduction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Am I… in that future right now?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hallucination I just had. . Am I now living what comes after it…? </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Senpai.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto, who’d been anxiously watching our conversation, spoke up. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>“Yeah, what’s up?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I think something’s wrong with me.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“What is?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“My memory’s changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Huh?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn’t help but stare at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Senpai, you were supposed to have hardly any friends in class. That’s why you used to come to the club room during lunch breaks, and I joined you. But. . </p>
<p class="calibre1">when you played the piano, when you played Nito-senpai’s song in the club room just now. . suddenly, my memory changed.” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Makoto looked around nervously before focusing her gaze on me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“I remember you having normal friends and eating lunch with them. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the help of Makoto’s words a theory formed in my mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought what I saw earlier was a hallucination. I thought it was a fleeting dream my desires had shown me. But if my past had  <i class="calibre4">actually </i> changed, if reality had changed to match that illusion—</p>
<p class="calibre1">“. .Did I go back three years?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those words slipped from my lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“Did I go back to when I first met Nito, back to my first year?” </p>
<p class="calibre1">That’s gotta be it, that’s the only thing that makes sense. The “time travel” </p>
<p class="calibre1">seen in Sci-Fi novels and manga—Did that really happen to me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I played Nito’s song in the club room, some mysterious power was at work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then I went back to my first year and slightly changed a few things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If that’s true. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I thought about it, an idea floated up in my mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">“If I could go back to that time again, if I could redo everything from the start. .” </p>
<p class="calibre1">A glimmer of hope sprouted in my chest. Even if it might just be a pipe dream. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>“Can I. . save Nito?” I muttered softly, as if to confirm to myself. </p>
