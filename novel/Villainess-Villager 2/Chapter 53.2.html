<h3>Chapter 53.2 - Anastasia (5) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We arrived at the Elven village just as the sun was setting over the mountains to the north. It was getting dark. We were probably deep in the lost forest near Linzea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Lost Forest of Linzea was famous, and there were rumours that it might be the hidden home of the elves. However, no one who has set foot in the Lost Forest returned alive. Not long ago, the selfless Wise Sage Loringus entered the forest in search of some kind of secret medicine and went missing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Allen easily crossed it and reached the other side of such a lost forest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The elves seem to welcome Allen, but I guess I&#8217;m considered an outsider. They seem to be very wary of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But considering what humans have done to elves, it was unavoidable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen, thinking about that, took my hand, who was feeling a little depressed, and walked on, exchanging friendly greetings with the elves of the village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we entered the building and were quickly ushered into the presence of Her Majesty. How much trust has Allen earned by being able to meet Her Majesty without prior notice?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a brief exchange of greetings between Allen and Her Majesty, it was time to talk about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, who&#8217;s this girl?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, let me introduce her. She is Lady Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett, my&#8230;&#8230;precious lady.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m happy! He called me his precious lady!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, this person is Allen-sama&#8217;s&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna-sama, She is this elf village&#8217;s Queen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am Anastasia, daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. It is an honour to meet you, Your Majesty.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a ladylike bow to avoid any shame as the daughter of a duke and most importantly, as Allen&#8217;s precious lady. Then Her Majesty&#8217;s expression changed slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu, I see. Anastasia-san is a young lady from a good place. Then, do you understand why the elf village is closed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It hit me where it hurts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Then knowing that, why did you decide to come here with Allen-sama, Anastasia-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that is&#8230;.. I&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unable to answer well, I mumbled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, not again! Why can&#8217;t I speak well when it comes to Allen!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, could you give us a moment, please?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, then Anna-sama, I&#8217;ll be outside.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen was urged by Her Majesty to leave, leaving me and Her Majesty alone in the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Anastasia-san, you said you know why it&#8217;s closed, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then you understand that Allen-sama will be in danger if it becomes known that he is in contact with the elf village, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Yes. I knew that. There are those among us who despicably capture beautiful elves and treat them as slaves. They will try to intimidate him into telling them about this place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then why did you follow him here instead of pretending you didn&#8217;t see anything? Anastasia-san is not Allen-sama&#8217;s wife, is she? And even if he says that you&#8217;re his precious lady, you can&#8217;t promise any future to him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With an indifferent expression on her face, Her Majesty gave me a good argument. I couldn&#8217;t refute her reasoning and frustratedly bit my lip.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then why? Is that the extent of Allen-sama&#8217;s existence to you, Anastasia-san?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Majesty&#8217;s tone became accusatory, and her words pierced my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt so frustrated and ashamed of myself that I found myself with tears running down my cheeks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, to shed tears in public!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am not qualified to be the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Her Majesty spoke to me, who is like this, in a gentle tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even though you understood that, even though you thought about it rationally, Anastasia-san chose to come here. Don&#8217;t you know why that is, Anastasia-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That is……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know. But I really shouldn&#8217;t say it out loud. Yet, I couldn&#8217;t hold it in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because I&#8230;&#8230;I like Allen! That&#8217;s why. That&#8217;s why! I don&#8217;t want him to go anywhere without me! With another woman!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her. Because of the difference in status. Because of my duty as a noble. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s why!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, ahhhh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a deep sense of regret for having said those words, and then tears rolled down my cheek again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In other words, Anastasia likes Allen-sama, but they can&#8217;t be together in the human world, is that it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, why don&#8217;t you live with Allen-sama in this village?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We, too, want our benefactor, Allen-sama, to live happily. If it&#8217;s a love that can&#8217;t come true in the human world, why don&#8217;t you just leave everything behind?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The suggestion was so sweet that I was tempted to jump at it, but that is absolutely unacceptable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That is &#8230;&#8230;. unacceptable. As the daughter of a noble, who has lived on the blood of her people, I have the duty to devote myself to the service of my people. So&#8230;&#8230; I, I alone to grasp such happiness&#8230;.. it&#8217;s unacceptable!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Her Majesty asked me with a sincerely curious look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s strange. Then why don&#8217;t you try to choose the path that grasps both?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-san was able to live thanks to her people and needs to serve her life to them. If that&#8217;s the case, why don&#8217;t you live for the people together with Allen-sama?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s ideal. If there is such a path, I would love to take it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But is there really such a path?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, would Allen try to achieve that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-san, it seems to me that you are a little too self-sacrificing. Why don&#8217;t you relax your shoulders and be a little more honest with yourself?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, I am&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t say anything back to Her Majesty, who said that as if she was gently admonishing me.</span></p>
