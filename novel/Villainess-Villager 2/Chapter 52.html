<h3>Chapter 52 - Villager A Flies with the Villainess.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, Sheryl Laura-san. Is it good that the existence of the Elf Village gets found out?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked Sheryl Laura-san anxiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? Of course, it&#8217;s bad.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, you know what? Sheryl Laura-san, when you make a request at the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild, they check your identity. If Sheryl Laura-san had made the request, there would have been a big fuss, and she would have been caught.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;ll be fine. If I call the spirits, they can take care of a human or two.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san says it smugly, but it&#8217;s different, that&#8217;s not it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What on earth am I supposed to do with her? She&#8217;s completely out of touch with common sense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Not one or two, but ten or a hundred will come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh my. I&#8217;ve heard stories, but do humans really want to catch elves that badly?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, well, some people are like that, but that&#8217;s not the case. It&#8217;s because Sheryl Laura-san is a suspicious person here. How in the world did you get into town?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? I went in through the gate as usual, okay? I didn&#8217;t get stopped, you see?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey! Gatekeeper! Nice, but do your work properly!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay. For the time being, let&#8217;s go to the summer festival. I didn&#8217;t need to pay for the commission, because you took care of me, and I didn&#8217;t want to get found too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s go together! Immediately!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Instead, please allow me to take Anna-sama with us. Or rather, without Anna-sama, Sheryl Laura-san won&#8217;t be able to leave the town. She&#8217;ll be stopped at the gate.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But this little girl is not your wife, is she?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, I can&#8217;t just have her go with us to the gate and be done with it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph? Right, that&#8217;s what Allen thinks.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san moved her gaze slowly between me and Anna. Then gave a small sigh with a slightly disappointed expression and said something outrageous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, should I pass it by as your fiancée?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fi, fi, fiancée &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna froze. (T/N:- this interaction will be a sugar overdose in her POV.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm, no, yes, let&#8217;s not even think about it. I don&#8217;t want my head to physically fly off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, please do that. Umm, Anna-sama? If you don&#8217;t mind, would you like to go with us to the elf village? We&#8217;ll find out more about the adventurers later.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Oh, oh, ohh!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s how I managed to get out of this situation, and took Anna back to the Duke&#8217;s residence. I don&#8217;t know how she did it, but she came back in a flash with permission to stay out overnight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with Anna&#8217;s face pass, we slipped out of the gate for the nobles and headed for the Lurden Airport in the northeast forest.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen, what is with this place? Why is there this straight, open space in the middle of the forest?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna said this with a surprised look on her face as we arrived at the airport.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is my secret base. The only person who has been here is you, Anna-sama, so please keep this to yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, ohh. It&#8217;s just me, is it?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Anna looked somewhat happy when she said that.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Then, I&#8217;m going to get ready, so please wait here.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said so and carried Buitor out of the underground hangar.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? From the ground?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s a skill I have. I didn&#8217;t know what would happen if I made it public, so I kept it a secret.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I see, &#8230;&#8230;. secret, is it? Alright!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. And before I go any further, please do not go wild. Also, since it&#8217;s originally a single-seater, I&#8217;m going to tie you both up with a rope to secure you. Is that okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;m looking forward to flying on that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fly? What on earth are you saying &#8230;&#8230; No, it&#8217;s Allen, so he can do something like that. Okay, I&#8217;ll prepare myself.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once they agreed, I tied them to Buitor.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, um, Allen? Why am I tied up like this? Maybe this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought about it a lot, but I don&#8217;t think I can get a good balance other than this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-Hey, Allen. Isn&#8217;t it getting overloaded? And that, close, aren&#8217;t you too close?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. But other than this, it doesn&#8217;t seem to be stable, so please bear with me. Then off we go.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I start the wind magic engine and use full power to levitate Buitor vertically.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lay face down to steer, and Ana lay down so that her face was around my waist. Anna&#8217;s ample breasts were hitting my buttocks and thighs, which was a perk, but&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hiiiiiiii! I knew it.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Sheryl Laura-san, who was screaming, was suspended in midair. Just like I did when I carried the Orc before, I put ropes through the hooks that were for luggage suspension and hang Sheryl Laura-san in a suspended state.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen! Amazing! It&#8217;s amazing! And fast! What on earth is happening?&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Buitor accelerated quickly, gaining altitude, and then I heard Anna&#8217;s excited voice coming from around my back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It is similar to the way a piece of paper is blown away by the wind. It is also an application of wind magic.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not true, but no matter how much I tell them about lift, they&#8217;ll never understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, the royal capital and the royal castle are so small already!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. It takes about 4 hours to fly to the Elven Village. We should arrive just as the sun is setting.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Sheryl Laura-san, who was supposed to be hanging, was quiet. But, I can feel her weight, so it&#8217;s not like she fell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, as I thought you are amazing, Allen.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt Anna rest her head on my back as she whispered in a calm voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I trust you, it&#8217;s as if she is telling me so. I felt Anna&#8217;s weight and warmth, and at the same time, my heart was pounding and filled with something warm and fuzzy inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I see.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am…….</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really like Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, the only reason was that I felt sorry for the character in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when my memories of my previous life came back, I had a light-hearted hope that I could have a chance with the &#8220;villainess&#8221; while helping my mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m ashamed!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to hit the me of that time when I was thinking about such a thing. Isn&#8217;t this the same as that of Amy!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna is Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as my mother and I are not characters in a game, Anna is naturally a person too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is very hardworking and has a strong sense of responsibility, and desperately works hard for the populace even if it kills her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the truth is that she&#8217;s shy, she&#8217;s not good at expressing her emotions, and she&#8217;s clumsy, but when she&#8217;s having fun, she smiles and laughs wonderfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, I fell in love with that Anna. (T/N:- Finally, he has realized his feelings. But still, I like Anna&#8217;s one.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By no means was I supposed to like her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With us boarded like that, the Buitor glided effortlessly through the high summer sky.</span></p>
