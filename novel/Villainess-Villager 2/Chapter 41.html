<h3>Chapter 41 - Villager A Participates a Duel.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rode back to the dormitory in the school carriage and put in my pocket the special automatic pistol I had prepared for this day. I then put on my adventurer&#8217;s gear, grabbed my camouflage dagger, and headed back to the royal castle to enter its training grounds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Many spectators had already gathered, mainly students and guests who had attended the party. And the moon was shining brightly in the sky above.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-kun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-san.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia, Margaret, and Isabella worriedly called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the game, Anastasia was alone at this point, but it seems Margaret and Isabella came along with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but mutter to myself when I realized that Anastasia wasn&#8217;t isolated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is good, you idiot!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, no. I just thought that Anastasia-sama is well taken care of by her friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the third time today, I saw her surprised face. Moreover, this time her face was red. Margaret and Isabella were looking at Anastasia with smiles on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, Anastasia-sama, I will win for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yes. And, one more thing, Allen. That witness is from a faction that&#8217;s hostile to my family, the Ramslett. Be careful.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I know that trick from the game, and I have no problem with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Thank you very much. But there is no problem. I have no intention of relenting.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I walked to the centre of the training area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince, the five capture targets, Amy, and the man who would witness the duel were already there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, The Crown Prince &amp; Co. were underestimating me, as they were not wearing any armour, and the weapons in their hands were probably borrowed. Did they borrow a spare one from the knights?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you credit for not running away. But you can&#8217;t win, can you? I can still let you off the hook&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince begins his tedious talks, but after coming this far, I&#8217;ve already entered a rough adventurer mode. (T/N:- Probably his adventurer lifestyle after the duel.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To reduce the possibility of defeat to zero, the opponent must lose their composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why I agitated him in the earlier exchange and made him lose his calm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, again. You&#8217;re annoying! You know what they say, the weaker the dog, the more he barks. Just come at me. I&#8217;ll beat you all to a pulp. Or are you trying to get me to turn it down because you&#8217;re not confident? Your-High-ness?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You! It&#8217;s too late for regrets, know that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince who got on my cheap provocation was easily enraged. The other capture targets were also ready to pounce on me right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grinned at Amy, who was standing behind them with her hands folded in front of her, staring at them as if she were praying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy&#8217;s face quickly reddened, as if she noticed the expression on my face, and then a look of anger appeared on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, the declaration of war is over. Let&#8217;s do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will destroy destiny right here, today!</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped away from the Crown Prince &amp; Co. and held up my dagger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then the duel between Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett and Amy von Brayes will start.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The referee loudly declared the beginning of the duel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Lady Anastasia&#8217;s representative is Allen, and Lady Amy&#8217;s are Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren, Claude Justine de Westerdale, Oscar von Wimlet, Markus von Beinz, and Leonardo von Jukes, a total of 5 representatives. At the request of Lady Anastasia, this will be a 1 to 5 irregular system, and all acts other than killing will be permitted! (T/N:- what a loophole rule, totally in favour of Allen. (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">≧▽≦</span><span style="font-weight: 400">))</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the signal from the referee, I created a smokescreen. And then, using </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400">to hide, I moved close to the five people who got frozen in place and presented them with the specially made bullets I developed for this day from close range.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, this automatic pistol is equipped with a suppressor, and since it is fired by wind magic, the sound is very different from guns that use gunpowder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, a former Japanese, Amy would never dream of being shot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And since it&#8217;s loaded with special rubber bullets, they won&#8217;t die unless they get hit on the critical spots.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it might be able to break a bone or two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the smoke screen cleared, Leonardo and Claude, who had been beehived by rubber bullets, were lying down, blowing bubbles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shot Leonardo and Claude, who were good in close combat, with particular care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a natural result.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Guu, uh, uh, what was that &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Markus, Oscar, and the Crown Prince were also struggling, but unfortunately not to the point of falling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my pocket, I secretly concocted a water balloon filled with pepper ingredients and threw it at Oscar&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The water balloon, which made a beautiful clean hit on Oscar&#8217;s face, cracked with a crisp sound, and the blinding liquid containing the pepper component attacked Oscar&#8217;s face mercilessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gyaaaaaaa, eyes, my eyes!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then approached Oscar, who collapsed and placed a dagger on his neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come on! Witness!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, um.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you don&#8217;t admit this, I&#8217;m going to slowly slice his neck! Can you take responsibility?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I understand. Leonardo, Claude, Oscar, incapacitated.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that, I hurried to get away from the rest so that they wouldn&#8217;t attack me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In less than a minute, the three of them were knocked out, and the Crown Prince and Markus didn&#8217;t seem to understand what had happened. Amy, who was behind them, also has a hint of impatience in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, there is a reason why I left these two last. The Crown Prince is the next king, and Markus is the next head of the Court Magician, and in the game, it was said that he was the future Prime Minister. I need these guys to change their minds and become decent. If they don&#8217;t, they will eventually repeat the same kind of foolishness, which will lead to the destruction of the Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Claude is a prince from a neighbouring country, so he doesn&#8217;t matter. And Leonardo&#8217;s position as the successor to the Knight Captain will be in doubt if he loses to me in this situation, so he&#8217;ll have to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar, well, even though he&#8217;s from a Marquis family, isn&#8217;t he a lower priority compared to these two?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s better to have two than three enemies, and as long as they&#8217;re still conscious and listen to my sermon, that&#8217;s all that matters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I put out the smoke screen again, I hid in </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and shot rubber bullets at the Crown Prince and Markus one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gat!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gut!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I talked to them in a condescending tone as they knelt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Your Highness, Markus-sama. How does it feel to kneel to someone you thought was beneath you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-You bastard &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do you think you can get away with this &#8230;&#8230; for free? If you stand up to us, your family will too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Markus-sama? As you&#8217;re about to lose in this duel, Are you threatening me with your status now? Were you trying to get me to withdraw because you were afraid of losing just now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But now I&#8217;m the representative of Anastasia-sama, the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. Markus-sama&#8217;s current words are also getting directed to the Duke of Ramslett, Are you planning to assassinate the Duke of Ramslett?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;U, gu~tsu&#8221; (T/N:- Just the raw, didn&#8217;t know what to translate it into.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Markus bit his lip in frustration.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In general, don&#8217;t you think you know who&#8217;s more reasonable in your heart?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I &#8230; Amy &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as you can&#8217;t argue with it, I guess that&#8217;s what it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, if they knew what they were doing, that&#8217;s even worse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Just because you want to protect her doesn&#8217;t mean you can make one-sided assumptions without any evidence, you know? At least, as far as I know, Anastasia-sama was in a position to stop it rather than bullying Amy? In addition, it was Amy who was trying to provoke Anastasia into raising her hand, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Neve&#8230;r, Amy &#8230; will never do something like &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t believe that such a man, who puts emotion first at the expense of reason, is the future prime minister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh, can&#8217;t you believe it? Are you going to judge us with coloured glasses like that and aim for a Kingdom where false accusations and corruption will be prevalent in the future?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha, I-I&#8217;ll &#8230; never do that &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Markus, unable to say anything back, mumbles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s fine. You guys apologize to the Dukes of Ramslett and Anastasia-sama. It is time to end this. If a short-tempered person like you becomes the future Prime Minister of this Kingdom, we&#8217;re all going to die! Reflect on that!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kicked Markus in the face as hard as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gah!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I grabbed Markus by the hair as he fell to the ground, made him look up, and put the dagger to his neck.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Witness!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ma-Markus, incapable of fighting&#8221;</span></p>
