<h3>Chapter 45 - Villager A is Invited to a Dinner Party.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few days after the Duke promised me his full support, Sebastian-san came to visit my parent&#8217;s house again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, it&#8217;s been a while. I am here to extend an invitation from the head of our family. We would like to invite you to dinner tomorrow, so please come with your mother. Our family will provide a carriage to pick you up. Also, since we understand the situation, please do not wear formal clothes, and come dressed as you normally would in town. Also, there is no need for you to bring any souvenirs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Sebastian-san left the written invitation and went home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, who was here?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The butler of the Duke of Ramslett. I&#8217;ve been invited for dinner with my mother tomorrow evening.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, what should I do? I don&#8217;t have a dress. Also, Allen has the uniform only, umm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mom, Sebastian-san said that we don&#8217;t need to wear formal clothes. He reminded me that we should come dressed in the usual clothes used to walk around town. He was concerned that I probably wouldn&#8217;t have that kind of clothing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;More-more than that, getting invited by a duke feels like fluffy and unrealistic. Oh! That&#8217;s right. I have to tell them about this absence in tomorrow&#8217;s afternoon work. Allen also has nothing planned tomorrow, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, my mother rushed out of the house.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you for inviting me today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I had been told, I came here in casual clothes and empty-handed, but I still felt uncomfortable. Sebastian-san guides us through the Duke&#8217;s huge mansion and into the dining room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There the Duke, Anastasia, and what I assumed to be Anastasia&#8217;s mother and brother were already seated waiting for us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hello, Allen-kun, welcome. And you must be Allen-kun&#8217;s mother. Nice to meet you. I am Gerhard Kreinel von Ramslett, the head of the Ramslett family. My daughter is often supported and helped by your son and for that, I&#8217;m very grateful.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke then naturally took my mother&#8217;s hand and kissed the back of it. As expected of a nobleman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is my wife, Elisabeth, and my son, Friedrich.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to be the Duchess and the next Duke, also Anastasia&#8217;s mother and brother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s an honour to meet you Elisabeth-sama, Friedrich-sama. My name is Allen.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said and knelt so as not to be rude.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My name is Katerina, Allen&#8217;s mother. Thank you for inviting me today.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my mother said that, she spread the hem of her skirt and bent down a bit to take a bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Today, I have invited my daughter&#8217;s benefactor and his mother here. Let&#8217;s not be so formal about it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Duke said so, we stopped the courtesy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come on, Anna, Allen-kun is here, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elisabeth-san says so and brings Anastasia in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Allen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia-sama, nothing&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You! Was that not a way to say goodbye!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia said to me with more emotion than I&#8217;ve ever seen her show in my life. I didn&#8217;t see her the last time I was here, and I thought she hated me, but I guess not.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved to find out that she didn&#8217;t hate me, and I couldn&#8217;t help but smile at how cute this emotional Anastasia was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha! What are you laughing at? I am!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Excuse me. It&#8217;s good to see you again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, ahh. Yes, me, me, too. Also, you know, umm, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m grateful, for the representation&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to be. Also, I couldn&#8217;t leave it that way.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Ohh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m a little surprised at the appearance of Anastasia that I can&#8217;t see at school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-kun? Anna has been worried about you for a long time, you know? On the day of the incident, she ran crying to her father&#8217;s room in the middle of the night.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mother! That&#8217;s not it! Also, I was not crying!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Elisabeth-san says so in a funny way, Anastasia denies it with a bright red face.  (T/N:- Kawaii, =</span><span style="font-weight: 400">￣</span><span style="font-weight: 400">ω</span><span style="font-weight: 400">￣</span><span style="font-weight: 400">= )</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh my, Anna. That&#8217;s right, Allen. If you don&#8217;t mind, why don&#8217;t you call her &#8220;Anna&#8221;? I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;d like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? What? M-Mother?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought, Anastasia, who is laughing according to her age, is far more attractive than having such a frozen expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, then Anna-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, geez. Then, only when no one is around, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, Anna-sama.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, I introduce my mother to Anna, who is turning bright red, and the dinner party begins. Then the Duke gets right to the point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, the reason why I&#8217;ve called you both here is that I thought I&#8217;d like to give you a report on how this whole thing went down.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look the duke right in the eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;First of all, the apology to the Ramslett family, which was decided as a condition for the duel, was settled on the fact that His Highness the Crown Prince and Miss Amy would apologize to Anastasia, representing the Ramslett family, during the school&#8217;s opening ceremony next term. Because it would make sense to do it in a place where there are people who saw the scene of the insult.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And the engagement between the Crown Prince and my daughter is officially cancelled. As expected, I couldn&#8217;t continue the engagement after what they did to her.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, the Duke took a breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, my daughter seems to be quite fond of you, Allen. I would like you to be her &#8216;friend&#8217; as well, Allen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, if I could do it, I will.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that&#8217;s why he said the word &#8216;friend&#8217; so strongly. Of course.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And finally, regarding your treatment, I have had the royal family approve that Allen-kun and Katerina-san will come under the protection of our family. Therefore, you will not have to leave school and will not be punished.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s true. If you want, you can work here after graduation, or I can find you a job. But first, make sure you make the most of your time at school.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Duke-sama. Thank you. Thank you very much.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother and I thanked the Duke for his kindness. Apparently, I don&#8217;t have to drop out of school, and I can continue to attend school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, I&#8217;ll be in your care again next year.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia said to me, rejoicing, and a big smile bloomed on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me too, I look forward to working with you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to reply with that, but her smile that I saw for the first time was very attractive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m glad I worked so hard just to see this smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I honestly thought so.</span></p>
