<h3>Chapter 64 - Villager A Overrun the Imperial Soldiers.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m off!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I saluted the garrison captain of the fort, who was watching me curiously, and launched the Buitor revised. The takeoff method is not a vertical takeoff, but a normal takeoff using the runway I just cut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s saying, &#8216;What!? It flew!?&#8217;. Some of the soldiers beside the garrison captain sat down as if their legs gave out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, this Buitor Rev. is the result of a series of improvements to Buitor in preparation for this war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, the fuselage has grown a size or two. The cockpit is covered with removable polycarbonate panels from the front and part of the sides, which are aerodynamic and protect me from the wind chill, although I still have to lie down to fly. Also due to the larger fuselage, it has more space for storing things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, it is designed to be ridden by two people with Anna in mind, so once I rescue her, I hope to enjoy flying with her again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the main feature is that it has been modified to be able to operate as a bomber. I&#8217;ll explain this as I use it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m currently flying at a low altitude of about 200 meters above the ground. Normally, when I fly, I fly at a height of about 1,000 meters, though I measure it by eye. However, I chose this altitude because I can use binoculars to visually check whether the soldiers on the ground are friends or foes at a height of about 200 meters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, these binoculars were also made by me. I&#8217;m not an expert, so I couldn&#8217;t make anything too sophisticated, but the mechanism itself is not difficult, so I think I was able to make something decent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a bit bulky, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, as I was doing this reconnaissance flight, I spotted an enemy unit ahead of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were fifty, maybe a hundred of them. I don&#8217;t know how the Est army is being distributed, but it&#8217;s probably on the scale of a company.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, well. Let&#8217;s make these guys my first target. This is war now. There is no time for hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I move into glide flight and perform alchemy to shift the Buitor Rev. into bombing mode. Bombing requires a bit of concentration, so I don&#8217;t want to waste any magic power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I reached the airspace above the enemy troops, I start bombing them. The enemy troops don&#8217;t seem to have noticed me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Round transparent spheres were created from the belly of the Buitor Rev.&#8217;s fuselage and were dropped one after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This ball doesn&#8217;t use gunpowder at all, but it&#8217;s still a decent bomb, and it&#8217;s quite powerful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, this ball is made of ice. And, the ball has a hollow structure that is filled with appropriately sharp pebbles, glass pieces, metal pieces, etc., along with compressed air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this ball has a magic circle dug into it which magically reinforced only the inside to prevent it from bursting under the pressure. I don&#8217;t know what the air pressure is inside, but let&#8217;s just say it&#8217;s very high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When this bomb hits the ground, the ice, which is not reinforced against any impact from the outside, easily breaks and the magic circle loses its effect. The result is a powerful blast and shock wave that scatters sharp, hard objects. In other words, it&#8217;s just a bomb with no gunpowder or fuse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I didn&#8217;t put anything sharp in it, I could at least kill an Orc if it exploded nearby.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when something sharp splashes together, it can damage a wide range of Orcs. In other words, it can put more enemies out of combat by the same logic as a fragmentation grenade (Frag grenade).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I don&#8217;t have advanced technology such as targeting or precision guidance, so I have to rely entirely on free fall, but I drop a lot of bombs in the spirit of hitting the target in numbers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was going to make a proper bomb, but it didn&#8217;t work because I didn&#8217;t have the proper knowledge of fuses, and the cost was too much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this approach solves all of those problems.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because the only materials needed to make this bomb are small, low-value magic stones such as Horn Rabbit&#8217;s and Goblin&#8217;s magic stones, and sharp objects that you can find in the area.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You may think that there is nothing in the sky, but as long as there are clouds, there is water vapour, and unless you are in an arid region, there is no shortage of water.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, it is not carried in the form of a bomb, so there is no danger of it going off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve brought along five little magic bags full of ingredients that I&#8217;ve been knocking around at the Lurden Store. These bags have been a bit of a pain, but I can&#8217;t turn my back on them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, if I don&#8217;t run out of this material, I won&#8217;t have to worry about running out of ammunition.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I&#8217;m at an altitude of about 200 meters, so the magic and bows of the Imperial soldiers can&#8217;t reach me no matter what.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the bomb I had dropped fell to the ground and exploded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Starting with a loud explosion, dozens of bombs that I had dropped in batches exploded one after another, and the sound of the explosions echoed from this far behind me. I turned to check the results while regaining the altitude I had lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I checked the area where the smoke was rising. It was too small to see with binoculars, but I couldn&#8217;t see anyone moving. It looked like they were annihilated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? If I look closely, I can see someone moving at the edge, but he appears to be injured.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even though I&#8217;m used to seeing them when I&#8217;m fighting off demons and bandits, I feel like I might get PTSD if I see too much of what I&#8217;ve done, so I&#8217;ll leave it at that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve taken away the combat capability of a single company, and that should be enough.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mission accomplished. Now, on to the next.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I steeled myself and looked for the next enemy unit. Then I dropped bombs on the enemy units I found.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, I found enemy units and bombed them, and when the sun was setting, I finished the first day&#8217;s battle and returned to the base.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- What to say he massacred the battlefield. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">（</span><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span><span style="font-weight: 400">゜ー゜</span><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span><span style="font-weight: 400">）</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen returned&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh. Good work there. I heard some kind of tremendous noise over and over again. What was that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s me. Today&#8217;s results include the annihilation of 4 battalion-sized Imperial troops, 12 company-sized Imperial troops, and 9 platoon-sized Imperial troops.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha? What did you say? How the hell did you do that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I bombed them from the sky with magic. They didn&#8217;t seem to understand what was going on, so it would work for a while yet.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The garrison captain of the fort replied although he did not seem to understand what was happening.</span></p>
