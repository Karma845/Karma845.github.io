<h3>Chapter 46 - Villager A Challenges the Great Dungeon of Orcs with the Villainess.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About two weeks after the new year, Anna came to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen. I&#8217;m thinking of challenging the newly discovered Dungeon in Altmunt. Would you mind escorting me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Into the Great Dungeon of Orcs? Fine, but how deep do you want to go?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Great Dungeon? What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oops, without a thought, I answered her. So it was discovered recently.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, trying to correct it improperly will not do me any good, so I decided to confess it obediently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually, a long time ago, I found an undiscovered Dungeon in the depths of the Altmunt forest and conquered it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? What did you say? Allen, wasn&#8217;t the Goblin Dungeon the only one you traversed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because even though it was an undiscovered Dungeon, the boss on the bottom level was only the Orc King. There were no traps, and it wasn&#8217;t that big of a deal, so I thought I didn&#8217;t need to say anything about it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anna hears me say that, she puts her hand on her forehead and has a dumbfounded expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Seriously, they say there&#8217;s a fine line between genius and all but were you also of that group?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s rude, I&#8217;m not a genius, so there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;m even close to them. In my previous life, in college, there were a lot of people who were a lot better than me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been traversing it with high-speed laps, so if you can protect yourself at least, I can probably conquer it with Anna-sama, but what do you think?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, Allen. What is a high-speed lap?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? To raise the level, I just traverse the Dungeon and then transfer to the entrance and repeat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna is putting her hand on her forehead again. As I thought, she must have been overwhelmed when she was made to be the Crown Prince&#8217;s fiancée.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I think it&#8217;s more attractive when her expression changes like now. As I was looking at her, Anna stared into my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Iya, I&#8217;m not that immune to women, so I&#8217;m embarrassed when they stare at me with such a beautiful face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, it&#8217;s okay. You&#8217;re you. So, are you going to take care of it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, gladly.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so with that, Anna and I went to play in the Great Dungeon of Orcs. (T/N:- Dungeon date(?).)</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a long time, I rode a horse-drawn carriage to Altmunt. It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle to take a horse-drawn carriage over a long distance that would have taken a few hours if we had taken the Buitor, but it&#8217;s nice to travel by horse-drawn carriage because it has a retro feel to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after a long journey, we arrived at Margaret&#8217;s family house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hi, Allen-kun. Long time no see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Margaret-sama, it&#8217;s been a long time.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kneel and bow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, Allen-kun. You&#8217;re my classmate. Also, you&#8217;re the knight who saved Anna-sama&#8217;s life.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not like that&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, jeez. I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about, Allen-kun, who was able to defeat five of the strongest students in the school. If it weren&#8217;t for Anna-sama, I would have recruited him as a knight myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Margaret!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know, I know. Anna-sama, I&#8217;m not going to snatch your precious Knight-kun away from you. I&#8217;m not like that whore.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Ah, right. Besides, Allen&#8217;s not that kind of guy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Hmm? What is this exchange? Maybe I am wishing it &#8230;. No, I can&#8217;t. The Duke reminded me that I&#8217;m only a friend, and if I put my hand on her, my neck will fly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not metaphorically, but physically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, with that exchange, I was given a room at Margaret&#8217;s mansion and taken care of. What&#8217;s more, I was even accompanied by a maid!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I&#8217;m grateful, but the mansions of the aristocrats were unnecessarily large and luxurious, and for a mediocre citizen like me, I felt uncomfortable in a place like this.  </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, of course, I didn&#8217;t spend a dream night with the maid, okay? </span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, I took Anna, Margaret, and the five knights guarding us to the Great Dungeon of Orcs. We went through the formalities and entered the Dungeon, but unlike the time when it was undiscovered, there seemed to be a lot of adventurers taking on the challenge.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then let&#8217;s proceed quickly. However, I would like to get an idea of your abilities, so if any orcs appear, please try to fight them by yourselves. If it looks dangerous, I&#8217;ll help you right away.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The five knights seem to think I&#8217;m a shady person, but they followed the orders of their master, Margaret, to the letter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll do it first.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I readied my Nikov and fired a shot at the Orc that had come out from the back. With a loud bang, the bullet struck the Orc right between the eyes, and it collapsed and stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? What was that now?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna and Margaret say so and become speechless. The knights also froze, their eyes darting around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;With the application of wind magic, I sent iron bullets flying and shot them in. This is a magical tool to assist with that. I made it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I see. As expected of Allen, I&#8217;m counting on you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Anna returned from the astounded state and said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, things went pretty fast. The knights followed my instructions, and we were able to move forward with ease.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, we quickly traversed the Orc&#8217;s Dungeon, which I knew all too well, and easily defeated the boss at the bottom level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, with this, you have now conquered the Great Dungeon of Orcs. Congratulations!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, ohh.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I had to rely on Allen-kun halfway through, but yeah. Thanks.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, we quickly conquered the Great Dungeon of Orcs and later added the achievement of the Great Dungeon of Orcs Conqueror in my guild card.</span></p>
