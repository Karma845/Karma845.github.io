<h3>Chapter 51 - Villager A Accepts the Nomination Request?</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As expected of Allen, I was saved.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura said that while sticking to my back. But for some reason, Anna is looking at me with cold eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen. What&#8217;s with that girl?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen. Who&#8217;s this little girl?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me a little girl? A girl smaller than me, calling me a little girl? This rude person! Identify yourself!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s wrong with calling a girl younger than me a little girl?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was confused by the atmosphere that seemed to be about to erupt, the brunt of it turned on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Allen! Do something about this rude little girl!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen. You&#8217;re on my side, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, wait a minute. What do you want me to do?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Anna, numbly, reached out to pull off Sheryl Laura&#8217;s hood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Anna-sama. You can&#8217;t do that. You&#8217;ll cause a big scene if you do that!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost stopped her from pulling off the hood. If the long ears of an elf get exposed in such a place, it will be a big fuss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen. I knew you&#8217;d help me, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Allen! Aren&#8217;t you supposed to be on my side?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura says so in a bouncy voice, and Anna gets angry at me with a tearful expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, not again, please stop this. For the time being, let&#8217;s go to a place where we can talk calmly!&#8221;</span></p>
l
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I grabbed their hands and started walking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People have gathered here because of the current argument. If Sheryl Laura&#8217;s ears get exposed in a place like this, it would be a big problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I took them to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild and asked Master to rent a reception room for VIPs. And after asking him to make sure no one came in, we finally had a calm environment to talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Introduce her to me, Allen.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, Anna-sama. This Lady is Sheryl Laura-sama. She is the daughter of the Queen of the Elven Village. Sheryl Laura, this is Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett, daughter of the Duke of Ramslett, and the one to whom I am indebted to.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna froze beautifully. Then, after being frozen for a few seconds, she immediately changes to the expression of a noblewoman and performs with the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">curtsey</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> of a lady.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were Her Royal Princess, and I apologize for my rudeness. My name is Anastasia, daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. Your Highness, Sheryl Laura, it is an honour to meet you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph. Yeah. Now that you know it&#8217;s okay. So, why are you in such a weird pose?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna froze again.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/G7sr9Yq/Image00013.jpg">

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna-sama, I apologize for the delay in explaining. They don&#8217;t have such manners in the elven village, and status doesn&#8217;t matter much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, Sheryl Laura-san, What on earth do you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m here to ask Allen for a nomination request. There&#8217;s going to be a summer festival in the Elf Village which we celebrate once every 10 years. So I came to invite Allen. I don&#8217;t know much about it, but when an adventurer gets a nomination request they are supposed to do it, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because you haven&#8217;t been coming around lately, Allen. Meryl, Rho-sama, and everyone in our village misses you, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I haven&#8217;t been there lately you say, but didn&#8217;t I go during winter vacation? And why are you risking your life to come here just for a summer festival?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, Sheryl Laura-san? You know that human towns are dangerous for elves, don&#8217;t you? Also, you didn&#8217;t say anything about it when I went there this winter, you know? Why didn&#8217;t you tell me then?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, no, um, you know. I was wondering if I could get a ride on that flying boat of Allen&#8217;s.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t take such a risk for something so simple as this!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uuu, I&#8217;m sorry &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, what am I going to do now? Anna found out about Buitor, too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen, looks like you&#8217;ve got a lot of explaining to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s gaze is very cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;First of all, why are you familiar with the elves?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s because Allen is a benefactor of our village.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san answers Anna&#8217;s question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uu &#8230; So why is Allen a benefactor?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s because Allen is the treasured child of the Wind God who descended from the sky when the village was attacked by an evil spirit!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The god of the wind&#8217;s &#8230; treasured child?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? You don&#8217;t know? Fufu, You guys look like you&#8217;re getting along, but you&#8217;re not. Oh, maybe he&#8217;s just using his power to make you obey him, is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Sheryl Laura-san!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna looked blatantly shocked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please don&#8217;t bully Anna-sama too much.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, no. You want a little girl like that, Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura said with a colicky, happy laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please don&#8217;t make fun of me. There are things you can say and things you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph? Well, okay. So, I&#8217;m going to ask Allen to come to the summer festival, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh. Well, that&#8217;s fine. So, when is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It starts tomorrow.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, if it&#8217;s Allen, shouldn&#8217;t we get there in no time?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, yes, but &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Wait! If Allen&#8217;s going, you&#8217;ve to take me with you too, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we were exchanging these words, Anna interrupted us from the side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, you can&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t take any other human other than Allen into the village. If you&#8217;re Allen&#8217;s wife then it would&#8217;ve been possible, but you&#8217;re not, right? You guys don&#8217;t look very close, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anna heard that comment from Sheryl Laura, she fell silent and froze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, but what should I do? This seems difficult.</span></p>
