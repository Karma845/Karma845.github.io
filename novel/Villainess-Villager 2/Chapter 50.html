<h3>Chapter 50 - Villager A Helps a Passerby.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, despite the Duke&#8217;s anxiety, I finished the final exam of the first term without any problems, and the results were posted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1st place Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett (500)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1st place Margaret von Altmunt (500)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1st place Allen (500)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">4th place Isabella von Luinberg (489)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">5th place Markus von Beinz (457)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">9th place Amy von Brayes (421)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">10th place Oscar von Wimlet (417)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">32nd place Karlheinz Bartille von Centraren (392)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">38th place Leonardo von Jukes (223)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212;-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We did it. Not only did Anna get a perfect score, but Margaret got a perfect score, and Isabella is very close to getting a perfect score.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And for some reason, Amy, who was supposed to be a smart girl, is getting worse and worse. It seems to me that the content of the test is just barely up to the level of Japanese junior high school, but how can this happen when she has memories of her previous life?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I don&#8217;t care. There is no real harm these days.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy is as quiet as if she&#8217;s been nailed, and the Crown Prince and his friends are in a state where they are helpless against Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He doesn&#8217;t mess with me at all these days because I win in both magic and sword fighting in the class by an overwhelming margin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if I was lazy or couldn&#8217;t get out, but I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t level up during the winter break.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, as long as they don&#8217;t interfere with us, there&#8217;s no need for us to do anything to them as we don&#8217;t care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m more concerned about succession disputes and foreign relations than that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conflict can only occur on the same level. And the opposite of love is indifference.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never thought I would feel these words this way.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, today I have promised to go to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild with Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, before I go, I&#8217;m not talking about introducing Anna to master or anything like that. If I do that, my head will physically fly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? What if it doesn&#8217;t mean that? Well, I know that but still&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, we students at the school need to do some independent research during the summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Anna wanted to know about the role that adventurers play in this country, so we decided to visit the guild to see if it could be a theme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve notified the guild in advance, so there should be no problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Margaret and Isabella are also planning to do independent research together, but they have their own interests, so I&#8217;ve asked them to do some research at the library today, and we&#8217;ll get together later to decide on a theme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that we had changed into civilian clothes, we headed for the guild on foot instead of using the Duke&#8217;s carriage to avoid causing a scene. Anna was too conspicuous, so I asked her to wear a hooded cloak, though it would be a little hot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We walked down the main street of the town, then around the corner to a street that was off the main street. Thereupon I saw Amy and her friends, who I thought were unimportant earlier, in an alleyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Amy-sama? Also, the Crown Prince and the others? What on earth are they doing in a place like this?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you look closely, you can see that they seem to be surrounding a small person wearing a crude linen robe against the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm? I&#8217;m not sure about the situation, but what is going on here?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We look at each other and nod, then quietly approach them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That person looks very thin. A man would not be that thin, so it must be a woman who is surrounded by them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m telling you that we&#8217;ll get rid of the monsters. So hurry up and guide us to the village.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We are the best in our grade. We will not abandon those who are in trouble because of being attacked by monsters.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following Amy, Leonardo says so. However, since I am special, I&#8217;ll leave it at that, but isn&#8217;t the top performer of the grade already Anna, and aren&#8217;t you guys the ones that are largely isolated?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, how can you be so high and mighty even if you&#8217;re at the top of your class?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hii, That&#8217;s why I told you there&#8217;s no such thing as demons&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The woman, who looked completely terrified, countered with a shiver.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How dare you lie to me, the next king?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not lying.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Umm? For the time being let&#8217;s help her? I feel like I&#8217;ve heard that voice before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in contrast to them, Markus and Oscar, who are together but don’t get involved. I wonder if they feel guilty about it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I feel like I&#8217;m just as guilty when I don&#8217;t stop it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glanced at Anna, and she nodded widely, so I called out to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey. What are you guys doing out here in a place like this?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Amy glared at me like an Oni.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! Are you going to interfere with me again? It&#8217;s not like you&#8217;re trying to stop me from getting my blessing, is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um? What are you talking about?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have no idea what she is talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the next moment, the petite woman dashed toward me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen, help me!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she tackled me in the stomach with tremendous force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Owa~tsu!? W-What the hell?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t avoid it because Anna was behind me, so I took it in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? Could that voice be Sheryl Laura-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! Please, some weird guy is threatening me out of nowhere! Help me! I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s going to take my money!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard that, I felt the air around Anna become cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dangerous! Is she angry!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Your Highness, what are you trying to achieve by committing robbery in the middle of the city?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-What kind of nonsense are you saying? We came here because Amy received a divine prophecy that there would be a person here who would seek help for their village which will get attacked by the monsters. And according to the prophecy, this woman appeared in the exact place and appearance described in the prophecy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? Prophecy? Blessing? Sheryl Laura-san will?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see! So this is the compulsory event of the request for help from the elf village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, Sheryl Laura-san. Did something like that happen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We&#8217;re not being attacked by the monsters! I&#8217;m here to request Allen for a job!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san, who tucked herself behind my back, said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, that&#8217;s how it is, so can you stop pestering her now?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, he glared at me and wouldn&#8217;t follow those words.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness? Is it really okay for Your Highness to rob in the middle of the city?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Anna said this to the Crown Prince with the cold glare she had shown for the first time in a while, he looked as if he had given up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuh, It&#8217;s no use. Let&#8217;s go home!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Wait a minute? Karl-sama.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then they glared at us and walked away embarrassed.</span></p>
