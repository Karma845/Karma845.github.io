<h3>Chapter 41.1 - Amy (2) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? What&#8217;s with him!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That nerd, why is he applying for the proxy on his own!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, villainess, what are you doing admitting him as your representative!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scenario wasn&#8217;t like this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you have any idea what would happen if you fought in a duel against two royals?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, not again! As I thought, he is aiming for the villainess! I should have just made him a servant instead of letting him ruin my life like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pisses me off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, but that&#8217;s right. Well, good enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, we have five of the strongest students in the school. Even though that nerd was an adventurer for a while, he will lose in a heartbeat!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, about the duelling demands. I followed the game&#8217;s scripts, but wasn&#8217;t the one for the villainess different?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this okay?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll be fine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because Karl-sama and the others are on my side, and if Karl-sama and the others win, she will be sent to the Empire anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s no way Karl-sama and the others are going to lose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was thinking about it, that nerd said that he&#8217;s going to win in 1v5. Isn&#8217;t that hilarious?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought you were smart because you can study, but did you go crazy because you wanted to show off your good side to your beloved villainess?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, Markus was thinking about your well-being, but will you choose death that much?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, what the hell is this guy? Isn&#8217;t it life-threatening to utter such abusive words to aristocrats?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone&#8217;s totally pissed off now. The only rule is one can&#8217;t kill each other, but he&#8217;s a commoner anyway, so no one&#8217;s going to complain if he dies, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, but if you get killed by Karl-sama while defending your beloved villainess, will you be happy about that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uwaa! Creepy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess is also kind of pouting. Is it possible that she&#8217;s in love with this dull, gloomy commoner just because she was going to get dumped by Karl-sama?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uwaa, really, how unsightly. Did you change your dream from the future Queen to the future bride of the commoner?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufufu, how unsightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides? Unfortunately, he&#8217;s going to die now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I think that I can see the face of the villainess when the man who tried to shield her got killed ungracefully &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yup. Like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like that, more so like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Amy imagining things, I guess.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m starting to look forward to it. I wonder what kind of expression she&#8217;ll make?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the witness was found safe and sound.  He was definitely the witness of the game. If you were about to lose, he would give you a potion in the name of drinking water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, on the villainess side, it&#8217;s just water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the judges are on our side, so they don&#8217;t stand a chance at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, it is a shame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Karl-sama, Claude-sama, Markus, Oscar, and even Leo, for the duel, you all &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. We&#8217;ll definitely be victorious for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama says so to reassure me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But can&#8217;t we solve it by talking more? I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s just a matter of getting along. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, come on Amy. Will you cover for the guys who harassed you so much?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Really, the woman we&#8217;ve chosen is like a saint.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There&#8217;s no need for that. Any woman who harasses you deserves to be crushed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. As the future Knight Captain, I can&#8217;t overlook such an evil woman.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Claude-sama, Oscar, Markus, and even Leo also said the same lines of the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, we&#8217;re still according to the game&#8217;s scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Everyone &#8230; yes. Um, please be safe.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m going to send them off with the lines from the game. That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s fine with this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now all I have to do is look at them from above. I don&#8217;t know why the two cronies (T/N:- as it&#8217;s Amy&#8217;s POV I&#8217;ve kept it like this) of the villainess are still together in this situation, but I&#8217;m sure it doesn&#8217;t matter in the face of the coercion of the scenario.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. It doesn&#8217;t matter!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll be cheering everyone on in prayer pose, just like in the game.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then that nerd asshole looked at me and smirked, making a face that pissed me off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the! What is wrong with him!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Annoying, annoying, annoying, annoying!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then the duel between Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett and Amy von Brayes will start.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, what, they have already begun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have to worry about what he would do to me when he is going to die soon anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Start!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, the duel has begun. Who&#8217;s going to attack first?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if he will get killed by Oscar&#8217;s arrow with the blessing of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Bow King</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">? Or is it the magic of Markus with the blessing of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Sage</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">? Or will Leo, who has the blessing of</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">and works harder than anyone else, cut him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Claude-sama, who has the blessing of the </span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Fist King</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, is a bit quarrelsome and seems to be pissed off at that nerd, so maybe he will quickly beat him to a pulp. &#8230;&#8230; Huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What just happened?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly smoke came out, and he disappeared, and then I heard a strange noise after which, why did Claude-sama and Leo had to fall &#8230; and were foaming at the mouth &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? And why are the other three crouching?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, what is this! What are you doing! Kill him soon!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Water balloon? Why do you have such a thing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gyaaaaaaa, eyes, my eyes!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey! It&#8217;s not fair to blind him! What are you doing in a sacred duel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then that cowardly asshole nerd walked up to Oscar and put a dagger to his neck!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, no! What are you doing? You will kill my Oscar!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I understand. Leonardo, Claude, Oscar, incapacitated.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved to hear that. Even though I&#8217;m a future saint, the only blessing I have now is</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Healing</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. In the second year, I will be blessed by the spirit of light, and then I will get the staff of Holy Guidance, and finally, I will receive the blessing of the</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Saint of Charity</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So if they get badly injured, I can&#8217;t heal them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was relieved to think so, he put his hand in his pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I think he&#8217;s got something. What are you going to do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the smoke came out again, and then there was that strange noise. Even Karl and Markus fell to their knees and couldn&#8217;t move anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s going on? Hey! Hey!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Reflect on that!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He kicked Markus in the face as hard as he could, and Markus fell to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, he&#8217;s got a dagger on his neck!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Witness!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ma-Markus, incapable of fighting&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wha,wha,wha-what&#8217;s going on?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is such a strong guy mixed in!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;re not a game character, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please stop!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stop! Stop!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though you&#8217;re not a character in the game!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though you&#8217;re not a mob!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t you ruin my world!</span></p>
