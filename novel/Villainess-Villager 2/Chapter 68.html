<h3>Chapter 68 - Villager A Wants to Save the Villainess no Matter What.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walked down the hallway, hiding, two well-dressed men walked in front of me, talking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How&#8217;s that thing working?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m almost there. Normally her ego should have collapsed in less than a day.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As expected of the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett, something like that?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was tempted to point the gun and question him, but I held back the urge just in time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need to know exactly where she is kept, and what they&#8217;ve done to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t let my emotions get the better of me again and fail at this point.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Your Highness. But it&#8217;s getting weaker and weaker, so I gave it the Demon Sword of Ice Extinction last night. Now it&#8217;s only a matter of time..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your Highness? Moreover, at his age, does that mean he&#8217;s the Crown Prince of the Est Empire?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides a magic sword? Then Anna!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A CGI of the game&#8217;s fallen villainess laying waste to the capital with a frozen expression crossed my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I was surprised that the daughter of the Duke has a loved one.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She was wearing an engagement ring. She must have had a fiancé. I heard that she never took off her ring and hair ornament when she took a bath, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems that she was abandoned by that pampered idiot prince &#8230; she was probably having an affair with one of his retainers anyway. It was fun to see her reaction when she heard he died in the war.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Can you get that guy, too?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If we can break her mind and manipulate her into doing what we want, we can get her to talk.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You, piece of shit! Anna is not a thing!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then it might be a good idea to get that woman to open her legs in front of that man.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It will still take some time to adjust to that level. The first priority is to control the mind with the despair of the magic sword. It is the one and only one body with two blessings,</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Ice Magic</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">and</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〖</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400">〗</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. It exists for the sake of the demon sword of ice extinction, so you can&#8217;t afford to fail this one time.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These guys &#8230; what do you think people are?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tch, oh well. By the way, it seems that the cowards in Centraren hadn&#8217;t made any preparations as expected. It&#8217;s almost time to capture the whole of Bruseni.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation between the Crown Prince and the man proceeded to talk about the war. Apparently, they are assuming that Centraren will lose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s a shame. It is you and your empire who have lost the entire region of Bruseni.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re right. I just didn&#8217;t expect him to agree to such a ridiculous deal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The Crown Prince is a true fool. He was only able to fix things because of that woman, but there was nothing inside. Moreover, I heard that he stole the Jade Seal, and without going through the Duke, he accepted this deal of getting the Bruseni region in exchange for that woman, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Seriously, that&#8217;s just plain stupid, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What! Did he really think such a deal was possible?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That idiot!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By now, the people of Xaus must have invaded the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s territory. No matter how strong the Duchy of Ramslett&#8217;s army, if they separate from the country, it will not be free.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now we just need to see if Norsane in the north will make a move or not.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;ll work. I&#8217;ve already talked to Westerdale. If that idiot Crown Prince becomes King, we&#8217;ll have a country of easy-going idiots. And once the Dukedom of Ramslett is cut off, they won&#8217;t be able to feed their people. Then the rest will fall into ruin on their own.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mmm, I see. So Westerdale really was connected to Est behind the scenes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, I don&#8217;t think Claude will ever come to the front stage anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, it seems that Centraren is still seen that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This country is already &#8230;&#8230;. No, now is not the time to be thinking about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Whoa, we&#8217;re here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who is not the Crown Prince casts some kind of spell on the wall. Then the wall suddenly disappears, and a staircase appears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it was a hidden staircase with a magic-related mechanism.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. No wonder I couldn&#8217;t find it no matter how hard I looked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince and the man turned on the lamp and walked steadily down the stairs, with me following close behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> was a skill I acquired in order to obtain a Scroll of Appraisal, but I&#8217;m really glad I took it. Without this skill, I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to break into a place like this by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after descending a long spiral staircase, the Crown Prince duo arrived in front of an iron door. It had a lock on the outside, which clearly indicated that it was meant to keep people in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he opened the peephole of the iron door and looked inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s coming along nicely, isn&#8217;t it? Let&#8217;s give it a little stimulation.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, they unlocked the iron door and opened it, then went inside. I also followed them inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, beyond that, illuminated by the lamps of the two, there was a strange figure of Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell did they do to her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is dressed in a lyrical costume, but her face is expressionless. Her eyes are blank, and her face is a mess of tears and snot. Also, the sloppy drool is dripping, and the smell of filth is drifting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, she must have resisted a lot. If this happens, she won&#8217;t be able to use the magic she originally had, so I&#8217;ll have to re-educate her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Tsk. Can&#8217;t you undo that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s impossible. It&#8217;s too late now. But it&#8217;ll only delay the actual launch for a few years.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He describes Anna as if she were a domestic animal, no machine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna turned her head toward us, but it was not hard to imagine that she did not see anything in her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A, Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna makes a small noise with an expression that does not make you feel intellect.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was nothing in there that reminded me of Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who was sleeping peacefully in my arms, was as beautiful as an angel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who had a cute and teasing voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who was surprised to fly for the first time, and was also excited like a child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who accepted my proposal, and was happy enough to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who was nervous, tense, and afraid that she would drop Miryl-chan in her unfamiliar arms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who was so embarrassed that her ears turned red when I carried her like a princess.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who was jealous of me because she suspected the relationship between me and Sheryl Laura-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The same Anna, who used to say that I was a cross between a genius and something else and got dismayed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who was so happy to hear that her exam grades had caught up with mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna, who was trying so hard to make something good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna, who was worried and angry with me for being her proxy when she needed a proxy for the duel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I met her again, that Anna, who turned bright red and was angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even the Anna, who had been struggling to endure unreasonable things for the sake of her noble duty with a frozen expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- these lines may feel odd because of my limited knowledge, I apologise in advance.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of these things are important to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Anna, who was always so fascinating, was nowhere to be found.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it&#8217;s too late, as the man says.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">……Even so!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I! No matter what! Want to save Anna!</span></p>
