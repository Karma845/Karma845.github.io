<h3>Chapter 62 - Villager A Volunteer for Student Soldiers.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am Otto von Jukes, Commander of the Knights. The Knights are looking for brave young men and women to defend this country against the unilateral, illegal, and outrageous aggression of the Est Empire! Raise your hands if you are willing to stand up for your country!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I raised my hand first. I&#8217;m worried about Anna, and I want to look for her right now, but without any clues, it&#8217;s a waste of time to search in the dark. Then I&#8217;ll do what I can do now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve already discussed this matter with the Duke. Besides, going to the front to prevent the destruction of the royal capital should not be a bad option.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, if she is taken to the Est Empire like in the game, and the empire tries to use Anna as a weapon, then!?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have to absolutely stop that!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. So you&#8217;re the scholarship student, Allen-kun. Is there anyone else?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The students tensed up at the loud voice that came from the podium. Then, I hear the most pathetic voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it bad that the commoners are going and we, the nobles, are not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But look, the crown prince hasn&#8217;t run for it either, so why not?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Certainly&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I can&#8217;t fight a war&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As these conversations were going on, a few people raised their hands here and there, and eventually about a third of the students joined. However, the Crown Prince and the others did not join till the end.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What is royalty for? What are nobles for?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Leonardo, you&#8230;.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, the volunteer students were taken directly to the royal palace where we were given military uniforms. We were told that we would be treated as apprentices and that we would basically be working in the rear, carrying relief supplies, doing paperwork, and helping out at the first aid station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that&#8217;s a problem for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After changing into the military uniforms provided to us, we came before the presence of the King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well done. Brave students. To crush the ambitions of the treacherous Est Empire&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knelt in silence and listened to the king&#8217;s long and gratifying talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wish you all good luck.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;Hah.&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if everyone was touched by the story or not, but I raised my hand and asked for an opportunity to speak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t just let them take over the chain of command. No matter what, I need to get them to agree to one of my demands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? Well, I&#8217;ll allow you to say it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you, Your Majesty. My name is Allen, and I am an adventurer under the protection of the Duke of Ramslett.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mmm? Ah, so you&#8217;re the commoner he was talking about then. So, Allen, I heard that he won&#8217;t cooperate this time, but is that the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s intention to not unite in the face of a national crisis?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. But the Duke is thinking about the country. His decision to move to the southern territories is also based on his intention to support the Centraren Kingdom and the Royal Family.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Xaus is it? Then what do you want to say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I would like to ask you again to protect Lady Anastasia, daughter of the Duke of Ramslet, as soon as possible, and to punish those who were involved in the theft or forgery of the Jade Seal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A look of anger appeared on the King&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So he&#8217;s aware of what has happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing this, I was convinced. After all, he is the root of all evil.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the fact that he can get angry so easily over something like this shows that he is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a vague idea from what the Duke and Sebastian had told me, but now I&#8217;m sure that he is a fool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why, but I guess this guy is thoroughly protecting and pampering the Crown Prince who has done so much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, because of this, that idiot remains an idiot forever, and the people around him think that it&#8217;s okay, which leads him to become even more irresponsible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I apologize for that. However, I&#8217;d like to take responsibility for what I just said and go fight alone on the front lines. Please order me to do so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A look of confusion appeared on the King&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He would be so. He thought I was going to fight him, but unexpectedly I volunteered for a suicide mission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, if I successfully defeat the imperial army, I would like to be compensated well.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the King grinned and declared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s fine, Allen from Ramslett. Go to the front lines alone and kick the Imperial soldiers to the curb at your leisure. Until then, I will not allow you to return to the royal capital. However, if you bring victory to my Centraren Kingdom through your efforts, the rewards will be as you wish. Gold, treasure, titles, women, whatever you want, I will give it to you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I had heard from the Duke in advance, if you use this kind of method, this fool will not mind saying such a stupid thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hah. I am grateful and happy. So, which battlefield should I bring victory to?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You should capture the fortress city of Cardacia and retake the Bruseni region. If you do that, my country will be victorious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hah. I have received your order.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked him and left the bustling audience hall with a letter of command in my hand that had been written and stamped on the spot by the King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can hear people saying things like, &#8216;What an idiot&#8217;, &#8216;Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s dog&#8217;, but at least I&#8217;ve already consulted the Duke about the current matter. There should be no disadvantage for the Duke in this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I was able to get a 100-point perfect answer out of this stupid and brainless King, which was enough for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only Anna&#8217;s situation was unexpected, but I was prepared for the war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s show the Est Empire the fruits of my labour to the fullest.</span></p>
