<h3>Chapter 57 - Villager A gets Summoned Again.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That afternoon we took off in Buitor and enjoyed the flight to the royal capital in close contact with Anna. It was the last time we could forget our identities, so we savoured the view from the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, the Elf Queen gave Anna an ornament called a fairy hair ornament just before we left. With this, Anna will also be able to go through the lost forest by herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;ll probably never use it, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the item that Amy was originally supposed to get, but I guess it doesn&#8217;t matter. The elven village will not accept Amy and the others because there are no monsters, and if Amy and the others go to the Lost Forest, the Crown Prince and the others will be lost.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? Doesn&#8217;t that seem like it would solve a lot of problems all at once?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, whatever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uh&#8230; Oh, yeah. That pervert changed her behaviour just like a cat for a long time, probably because Anna was able to see him. But when he said in my ear, &#8216;Did you feel better after what you did?&#8217; I almost yelled but managed to hold it back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, that pervert will remain a pervert. But I&#8217;m grateful for that&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Probably referring to the advice.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, since the holy blessing that was supposed to be given to Amy in the game was given to Anna, the route for Amy to become a saint must have been lost. If that&#8217;s the case, I think it&#8217;s no longer possible for Amy, a mere baroness who is not a saint, to reach the goal of reverse-harem in this world where monogamy is the rule.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it bluntly, Amy is already stuck in the water. And I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well. The next day after I sent Anna back to the Duke&#8217;s residence, I was summoned by the Duke as expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Allen. You know why you&#8217;re here, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then explain it. What&#8217;s with the ring? Why is my daughter wearing that ring on her left ring finger?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That is my gift to her.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I said that a look of anger appeared on the Duke&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You fool! Have you forgotten that I gave you my backing during the duel and protected you from the royal family?!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this reaction was within my expectations.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that a mutual thing? Or would you rather that Anastasia-sama had been defeated in such an atrocious manner and the honour of the Duke had been disgraced?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! You&#8217;re a commoner! And my daughter is a noble, moreover the daughter of the Duke of Ramslett! not the daughter of some noble!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s why I gave her that ring.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the Duke looked confused as if he had been caught off guard, and then became angry again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Good, good. This is one of the dozens of patterns I&#8217;ve envisioned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t say stupid things! A Duke&#8217;s daughter wears a ring given to her by a commoner, you say! And on her left ring finger, no less!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This reaction is also as expected. Now, it&#8217;s time to cool it down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Duke, that ring is not just a ring. It&#8217;s the 『Substitute ring』, an ornament of epic grade. It is a special ornament that, if the wearer of the ring is killed, the ring will take her place and save her life once. Besides, I may not always be able to protect Anastasia-sama. That is why I gave her the ring on her left ring finger as a token of my feelings for Anastasia-sama.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Epic grade, you say!? How on earth did you get such a thing? &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke digresses himself when he hears that the ring I gave him is an epic grade ornament that should have been worn by the king.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This pattern is also assumed. If it&#8217;s like this, I can do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m an adventurer. So, I&#8217;ve dived into the famous dungeon of the Wind Mountain and found it myself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? The Dungeon of Wind Mountain? Isn&#8217;t that the most difficult dungeon, with only eight levels yet to be conquered!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I got it from a hidden room in the gimmick floor of the floating islet on the 28th floor of the Wind Mountain Dungeon.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The 28th layer!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. The Wind Mountain Dungeon consists of 30 levels, and the boss of the final level is a Blizzard Phoenix!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Blizzard Phoenix? Don&#8217;t tell me you actually defeated it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. As I said before, I was the one who succeeded in defeating it alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? No, that&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke seemed to be completely taken in by my words, but he still doubted my words themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, as a last resort, I took out the Blizzard Phoenix&#8217;s magic stone, tail feathers, and wing feathers from my bag and presented them to the Duke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;This is the proof. This is Blizzard Phoenix&#8217;s magic stone, tail feather, and wind feather. For me, they are abundant, so please accept them!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Duke fell silent for a moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a long, long silence, he slowly opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you want?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I would like to have a place where I can earn enough military honours to earn a title. And if I am successful enough, I would like the right to stand next to Anastasia-sama and protect her with everything I have for the rest of my life.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke wrinkled his brow and then, after another long silence, replied as if spitting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Three years. I&#8217;ll wait that long. But I will not allow this relationship to go any further.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, sir. Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bowed my head and thanked him. The Duke glared at me and then spat at me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You better be ready. I&#8217;m going to send you into a battlefield so harsh you&#8217;ll wish you were dead.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s what I want. If you want, I&#8217;ll ride into the enemy&#8217;s stronghold, even if it&#8217;s just me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fine.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I dared him to do so and left the Duke&#8217;s residence.</span></p>
