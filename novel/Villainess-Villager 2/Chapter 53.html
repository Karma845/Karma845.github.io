<h3>Chapter 53 - Villager A Arrives at the Elf Village.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the sun was setting over the mountains, the Buitor, with us on board, landed at the airport built in the elven village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, Allen-san! Welcome&#8230;.to&#8230;the&#8230;.eh? Human?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sheryl Laura-sama?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The elves who came to greet us at the airport looked confused when they saw Sheryl Laura-san wrapped up in ropes and Anna with me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahaha, a lot of things happened, and the situation became like this.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I try to deceive them by saying that as I untie Sheryl Laura&#8217;s rope.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;See, Sheryl Laura-san, we&#8217;re already on the ground.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, I don&#8217;t want to hang in the air anymore!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, as expected, hanging in the air was pitiful. That&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t let Anna hang in midair&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked at her, Sheryl Laura-san managed to stand up and walked towards the village by herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, Anna-sama.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lend a hand to Anna to help her stand up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen-san? Who is that human?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She&#8217;s Lady Anastasia, my&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I see, I see. You&#8217;re already at that age, aren&#8217;t you, Allen-san? As expected, humans grow up so quickly. Still, I&#8217;ll get Her Majesty&#8217;s permission, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, he resolved it before I could finish my saying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah, I know. I&#8217;m on my way to Her Majesty&#8217;s place.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, I took the stiff-faced Anna&#8217;s hand, nodded, and led her into the village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Allen!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? There seems to be a stranger with him, see?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is it okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Bringing her to the summer festival, is it that kind of relation?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew all the elves in the village, so they didn&#8217;t say anything when I walked by. But, as expected, they seemed to be wary of Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I greeted them appropriately and walked towards Her Majesty&#8217;s house as the sun set in the village.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, it seems Sheryl has forcibly made a request. I&#8217;m sorry for that. Also, thank you very much for helping her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh no, me too. I&#8217;m sorry for hanging Sheryl Laura-san in the air like that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we had apologized to each other, Her Majesty turned her attention to Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, who&#8217;s this girl?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, let me introduce her. She is lady Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett, my&#8230;&#8230;precious lady.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I said that I heard Anna gulp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, this person is Allen-sama&#8217;s&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The queen looked at Anna unkindly with an evaluating look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna-sama, She is this elf village&#8217;s Queen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am Anastasia, daughter of the Duke of Ramslett. It is an honour to meet you, Your Majesty.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna makes a graceful gesture of ladylike courtesy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu, I see. Anastasia-san is a young lady from a good place. Then, do you understand why the elf village is closed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Then knowing that, why did you decide to come here with Allen-sama, Anastasia-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that is&#8230;.. I&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Anna faced downward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-sama, could you give us a moment, please?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, then Anna-sama, I&#8217;ll be outside.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was told that, I left the room. Immediately after that, the pervert and Miri-chan came towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While saying that, she lunged at me, and I caught her and picked her up. By the way, when I met her four years ago, she was already about three or four years old, and even now, she looks almost exactly the same, only a little bit bigger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, elves grow at the same rate as humans until they are about ten years old, but Miri-chan has barely grown at all. And the reason for that is this pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that because she made a contract with this pervert, Miri-chans&#8217;s existence has become closer to that of the pervert&#8217;s existence, or so I&#8217;ve heard. It is said that because of this her life span as an elf, which is normally 500 to 1,000 years, will be extended to 10,000 to 100,000 years.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure about it, because there were no such facts in the game, but it seems to be a happy thing for the elves. As proof of this, Her Majesty, Sheryl Laura-san, and everyone else in the village was overjoyed and celebrated for Miri-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought, &#8220;What a horrible thing happened,&#8221; but I didn&#8217;t interfere, because I think it wasn&#8217;t right to say anything about the elves based on human values.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as a result of such an extended lifespan, the growth of the body also slows down by that much&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that&#8217;s what this pervert wanted all along.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it okay for the Spirit of Light to be such a lousy and greedy person?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi, long time no see!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re still as perverted as ever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi is also as sarcastic as ever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Not as much as you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oops.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this is how a spirit of light is, then it&#8217;s the end of the world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I heard something about Allen-shi bringing his wife here. What did you like about her?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Hmm, well, personality?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to seeing the little girl with a good personality that Allen-shi admits! Why don&#8217;t you show her soon?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;.If I show her to you, Anna will get tainted.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mmmm, is she such a cute little girl, huh? As expected of Allen-shi, a comrade I recognize.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna is not a little girl. And don&#8217;t you dare treat me like a comrade! I don&#8217;t understand a single bit of your hobby.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be shy! That way of admiring my Miri-tan, no matter what you think, is of a comrade of mine.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No. No matter how you look at it, isn&#8217;t it adorable to spoil a little girl like her?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, hug me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, yes, yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put her down once. But when she asked me to hold her again, I picked her up again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There you go, debunked!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re still annoying as hell.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I experienced the utter humiliation of being smirked at by this pervert.</span></p>
