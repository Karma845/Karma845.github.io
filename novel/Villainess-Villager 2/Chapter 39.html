<h3>Chapter 39 - Villager A Witness the Condemnation Event.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crowd quieted down quickly, and Anastasia, whose name got called by the Crown Prince, stepped forward with a cold expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia, as of this moment, I am breaking off my engagement to you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince declares as he looks down on Anastasia from the stage with the dialogue as the event takes place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, are you serious?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia doesn&#8217;t seem to be upset and confirms that with a plain tone as if she was going through paperwork.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph. You are still a woman with no understanding. Instead of a rotten woman like you, this kind-hearted and healing Amy is the one who deserves to be my fiancée.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Prince says so with an imprudent look and attitude. But Anastasia asks the Prince to confirm without changing her expression at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, are you sure you want a woman who knows nothing about etiquette, nobility, or even what a country is? Your Highness seriously thinks that this woman is fit to be the Queen of this country?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia turns her cold gaze toward Amy without losing her expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, who received the line of sight, shrank with a jerk, and the Crown Prince gently embraced her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous! Her kindness is what this country needs. It doesn&#8217;t need you who tries to find logic in everything. In the first place, we know of the many harassments you&#8217;ve perpetrated against Amy! A woman with characteristics like you is unfit to be the Queen of our country!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Then your Highness will take responsibility for the result, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? Anastasia&#8217;s dialogue is quite different from the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought, Anastasia has already cut her ties with the Crown Prince in her mind. Anastasia doesn&#8217;t have any fragments of regrets when she looks at the Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought what you would say but, this is why I don&#8217;t like the big-headed Ramsletts. That&#8217;s why Ramsletts are bumpkins who can only make wheat forever.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia, who was going to back down easily, protested against this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness. I don&#8217;t care what you say to me, but I can&#8217;t overlook the insults against the Duke of Ramslett. Please take back what you just said.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? I&#8217;m just telling you the facts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s why Anastasia-sama, who is from a provincial family, is disliked by Karl-sama, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Amy saw it as a chance to make Anastasia angry, so she attacked her.  However, Anastasia gave Amy a cold look and sighed a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, are you also going to insult the Ramslett family?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true because Karl-sama said it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s get a formal protest from the Ramslett family against the Brayes family.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s cowardly to use the power of your parent&#8217;s house.&#8221; (T/N- so it&#8217;s not cowardly to gang up on a helpless girl. (</span><span style="font-weight: 400">￣</span><span style="font-weight: 400">m</span><span style="font-weight: 400">￣）</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head started to hurt as I listened to the exchange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s doing it intending to make her angry, but what kind of logic is it that it&#8217;s cowardly to protest as a house after insulting an entire noble family that is supposed to value honour?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Enough of this useless talk. I&#8217;ll leave you to it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia says so and then turns back to leave, but the Crown Prince stops her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait! Amy is right. If you&#8217;re proud of yourself as an aristocrat, solve it yourself before you cry to your parents. Until then, I won&#8217;t allow you to leave this place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, what are you implying?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are your gloves for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At least it&#8217;s not meant to be used lightly in matters like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. The daughter of the Duke of Ramslett can&#8217;t even fight for the pride and honour of the family? It seems that His Excellency the Duke has no talent for raising children.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince snickered at Anastasia after saying that. And some of the guests who saw that were also heard laughing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Does Your Highness ask me to apply for a duel?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Think for yourself. Don&#8217;t you understand, unless I, the Crown Prince, tell you everything? As usual, what an obnoxious woman.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The expression on Anastasia&#8217;s face showed her frustration when she heard that. In short, she was ordered in the name of the Crown Prince to apply for a duel herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia said so and threw her gloves at Amy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh! Um, this is &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy was overly surprised by the glove thrown at her, but she tries to pick them up and return them to Anastasia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How far will you go to make me look like a fool?&#8221;</span></p>

<img="https://i.ibb.co/yB82ZDR/Image00007.jpg" />

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia was not enraged but looked at Amy with cold eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, this means that woman, feeling insulted, has challenged you to a duel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, is that so? I, fighting &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a spoiled voice, Amy asked the Prince so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nonsense. You definitely knew what this meant and deliberately arranged it to make Anastasia fight in a duel to banish her during the condemnation event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll fight this duel on behalf of Amy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As in the game, the Crown Prince applies for the proxy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Your Highness? Ordering a woman to fight a duel and then acting as her opponent&#8217;s representative in the duel, are you insane?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? You asked for a duel on your own. I want to protect Amy, so I&#8217;ll act as the representative, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia quiets down as it is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will also act as a proxy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me also, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, I will fight too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As in the game, all five of the capture targets apply for the proxy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about you? Do you have any representative willing to fight against the five of us?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia looked around, but of course, all the boys in the room looked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, no one wants to fight the Crown Prince and the Prince of a neighbouring country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It looks like you&#8217;re not popular.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince looks down on Anastasia, saying so, but no matter how you see, it&#8217;s a matter of authority.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, it seems that it&#8217;s finally time to fight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After taking a breather, I raise my hand and step forward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will act as a representative.&#8221;</span></p>
