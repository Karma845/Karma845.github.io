<h3>Chapter 42.1 - Amy (3) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Imp-Impossible&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait! Karl-sama! What are you doing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fight back quickly and kill him, kill him!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, eii (T/N:- getting up sound). Don&#8217;t rely on the power of dubious magic tools! Fight openly with swords and magical powers without doing cowardly things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right! That&#8217;s right! So this duel is not valid!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Pfft. Your Highness, what are you talking about? The first rule we agreed on is that anything goes, right? And if I&#8217;m a coward, aren&#8217;t Your Highnesses, and the others cowards, for trying to win with a 5 to 1 advantage?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shut up! Didn&#8217;t you recommend it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Furthermore, what about trying to force Anastasia to admit her false charges by surrounding her with five, no six people, while in a powerful position as the Crown Prince? Anastasia-sama was Your Highness&#8217;s fianc√©e, and because of your status, she couldn&#8217;t go against you. If you don&#8217;t call this cowardice, what can you call it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, shut up, shut up! What the hell is wrong with you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s, she was&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, that&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s her fault. She&#8217;s the villainess, so it&#8217;s her fault, of course!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, he kept saying things that weren&#8217;t manly and being sarcastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, What the hell is wrong with him? That guy!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh. Shut up! You lowly commoner! Shut up!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right! It&#8217;s Karl-sama&#8217;s orders, so shut up!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph. And now you&#8217;re going to use your status as a shield to order me around? Before that, do you remember what you said?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, not again! Listen to Karl-sama&#8217;s orders properly! Isn&#8217;t he the Crown Prince! You, a commoner, can&#8217;t disobey him!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Generally. If you want to be a commoner so badly, why don&#8217;t you elope with Amy-sama? Then you can live as a commoner, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, that is a no! What are you talking about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the scenario, I will become a saint and then a queen. I&#8217;m going to live with the five of them happily!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you can&#8217;t even do that, then Your Highness will be dealing with Anastasia-sama. It may be too late, though.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He said that in an admonishing tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me! Why would the villainess take my Karl-sama!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, shut up! Shut up!  Someone like you! To someone like you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that Karl-sama starts using extreme flame magic!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wow! This was supposed to be something he will learn around the final battle!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right! This is the force of the game! It&#8217;s destined to follow the absolute scenario!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suck it up, shitty nerd!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though he defeated the four of them by cowardly means, in the end, he is destined to lose to Karl-sama!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;To make Amy win, I will! I will!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I&#8217;m so happy!  Karl-sama really loves me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the power of love, you&#8217;re going to take down this mid-boss who wasn&#8217;t supposed to be in the scenario!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I thought!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That is what it should be!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had to be like that!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama&#8217;s magic &#8230; went out of control &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A very large flame was spreading around Karl-sama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the flame spread more and more &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahh, why &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My Karl-sama is &#8230; like that &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind went blank, and my eyes started to blur. &#8230;&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I heard the villainess&#8217;s voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up, she was trying to do something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. This Kingdom will not survive without Karl-sama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hurry up and help him with your ice magic!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that shitty nerd stopped her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you doing! Didn&#8217;t you say that killing is prohibited!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You, liar!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that nerd used wind magic before I knew it and blew all of Karl-sama&#8217;s flames away in no time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s going on? Really what the hell was that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he put his sword to Karl-sama&#8217;s neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noo! Stop!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why don&#8217;t you lose!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he just stared at the judge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His, His Highness Karlheinz is unable to fight. Therefore, it&#8217;s Allen&#8217;s victory.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahhhh &#8230; it&#8217;s over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did this happen?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy smiled at me when I was despairing like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Could it be that he hates me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I&#8217;m the heroine of this world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, for some reason, my knees suddenly gave out, and I slumped to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why? Why?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, where did I make the wrong choice?</span></p>
