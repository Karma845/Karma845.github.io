<h3>Chapter 54 - Villager A Introduces Villainess to Pervert.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna, who finally came out of Her Majesty&#8217;s room, called out to me fearfully, who had been piggybacking Miri-chan after lifting her high to hug.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why does she feel so daunted?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put Miri-chan down and introduced them to Anna.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna-sama, she is the youngest daughter of Her Majesty, Miryl Leura-sama. And, for the time being, that thing there is the Spirit of Light, Rho-sama, who is, for the time being, contracted to her.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pointed at the pervert and said &#8216;for the time being&#8217; twice because it&#8217;s important.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean, &#8216;for the time being&#8217;? How rude?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring the protests of the unfamiliar pervert, I introduce Anna to Miri-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Miri-chan, this person is my precious lady, Anastasia-sama.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Miri-chan then stares at Anna. Anna gracefully greets Miri-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My name is Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett. I am honoured to meet you Miryl Leura-sama and&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna cursorily looks around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen-shi, Is this mature woman your bride? Also, normal people can&#8217;t see spirits. Did Allen-shi forget about that too? Pfft~fufufu.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That pervert is saying all sorts of rude things. It&#8217;s really the end of the world if this is the spirit of light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;(Why can I see you?)&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As the owner of the Elf Amulet, Allen-shi is special. Allen-shi is an honorary elf.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I whispered to the pervert, such an answer came back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It seems you can&#8217;t see the spirits without the help of the elves, but for the time being, he is here. Yes, for the time being.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I point at the pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……I see.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked a little disappointed, and then, as if she couldn&#8217;t see anything, she turned to face the direction I was pointing and gracefully bowed again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Spirit of Light Rho-sama, My name is Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph? Quite obedient despite the fact that you are already mature, aren&#8217;t you? By the way, You&#8217;re quite a BBA …… Hmm? Why do I feel like I&#8217;ve seen you somewhere? ……Oh? Isn&#8217;t Clynel in Ramslett used by the Duke of Ramslett? Oh? Oh?&#8221; (T/N:- I don&#8217;t know what BBA is.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she said this, she flew around Anna and looked her over, taking in every inch of her body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now that I look carefully, she looks like Liza-tan, doesn&#8217;t she? Maybe, this girl, Anastasia, is the daughter of Gerhard and Elisabeth!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;(What, are you acquainted with her?)&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure if I know her or not, but it was me who taught Liza-tan magic when she was just a little girl. That time Liza-tan was like an angel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy. As I thought, It was the correct answer to isolate him here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;ve only met her once since she got married and had a baby. I didn&#8217;t realize that the little girl I saw back then was now this BBA! I must have failed!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-Oh&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was whispering and talking to the pervert all the time, Anna was feeling uncomfortable with Miri-chan staring at her while she remained to bow gracefully. And then, unable to resist, she asks for my help.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-Hey, Allen&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umm, Anna-sama. You don&#8217;t need to perform any courtesy. Oh right. Miri-chan, Anna onee-chan is saying to hug her.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Miri-chan smiled and went over to Anna to give her a hug. Anna picks up Miri-chan clumsily with an awkward expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An incredibly beautiful girl is holding a beautiful young elf girl in her arms. And the beautiful young girl seems to be very happy to be carried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a beautiful scene, like a painting. Except that Anna&#8217;s expression was drawn out stiff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph? My Miri-tan is also getting friendly, as I thought she didn&#8217;t seem to be bad. Hmm? But Allen-shi, weren&#8217;t you a commoner?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;(What&#8217;s wrong with that?)&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, I see. Unexpectedly, Allen-shi likes to play with fire, does he? I see, so what? Whoa?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahhh, annoying. You&#8217;re being annoying, you pervert. Damn it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that. I know I&#8217;m not supposed to like her, and she&#8217;s not supposed to like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna will eventually have to marry for political reasons. Though the man she has to marry will no longer be the Crown Prince, he will surely be someone like a high-ranking noble or foreign royalty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna is a flower that I, a commoner, will never get. I&#8217;m not even allowed to wish for such a thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was to save my mother, before I knew it, there were more people I wanted to protect, and I was wishing for things I shouldn&#8217;t have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn it!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that what that look means? Is Allen-shi serious about that girl? Oops. You&#8217;ve been calling me a pervert for years, and now you fall in love with her. Is this how payback feels? Fufufufufu. Hey, hey, how are you feeling now? NDK? NDK?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gununu, it&#8217;s frustrating, but I can&#8217;t say anything back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, whatever. I&#8217;m not a demon either. It&#8217;s okay because no information will leak outside of this village. You just have to do what you want to do tonight and be refreshed. &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s even worse! Ah&#8230;..I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I apologized to Anna and Miri-chan for shouting so loudly. But, that pervert with a grinning expression, Anna with a suspicious expression, and Miri-chan with a surprised expression stared at me.</span></p>
