<h3>Chapter 66 - Villager A Overruns the Fortified City.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The morning of the fifth day after the fall of the fort had arrived. In the meantime, I went around bombing all the forts and garrisons except the fortress city of Cardassia. The only major stronghold of the Est Empire that remains in the Bruseni region is the fortified city of Cardassia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that Cardassia is already surrounded by our forces from the Centraren Kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, since many civilians were living in the area, we declared to start our indiscriminate attacks five days later, and advised the civilians to evacuate, for which the siege was intentionally lifted only at the east gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first two days, a significant number of people escaped, but by the third day, the number had visibly dwindled to only a few families yesterday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And today is the fifth day, the fateful morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, I&#8217;ve been dealing with soldiers, but today I&#8217;ll be killing those who aren&#8217;t. Of course, I&#8217;m less shocked than everyone fighting ground battles because my job is to bomb from the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, the bombing of urban areas and the attacks on civilians were indeed something to be reckoned with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s too late now. I&#8217;ve killed people for my ego.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m the one who chose that path.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will get Anna back, and I will protect her this time. There&#8217;s nothing more important to me right now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I get on Buitor Rev. and start the wind magic engine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I leave it to you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave a thumbs-up to the captain of the guard, who called out to me. Then increased Buitor Rev.&#8217;s speed and took off into the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t think. Don&#8217;t think about it. They&#8217;re the enemy. They chose to fight instead of heeding our warning.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I told myself this, I reached the sky above the fortified city of Cardassia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then proceeded to dump the bottles of gasoline one after another on a sturdy building in the centre of town. Apparently, this is the mansion of the Lord who protects Cardassia, and also serves as the city hall and barracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, the Imperial Army understood that the recent attacks were done by me, so they pointed at me and tried to shoot me down with arrows from the top of the spire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, none of the attacks reached.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m about 200 meters above the sky. Magic has a range of only a few dozen meters, and even a longbow has an effective range of at most 100 meters. Even if there is an arrow that can fly 200 meters horizontally, it does not mean that it can fly 200 meters upward against gravity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not an expert, so I won&#8217;t go into details, but if there is such a difference in the level of technology in a fight, it should be impossible to win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that in some countries, people tried to drop a bomber flying at an altitude close to the stratosphere with a bamboo spear, but such a thing is impossible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t matter if you&#8217;re led by a great general or not, you&#8217;re not going to be able to lead your team to victory if you go head-to-head with an opponent who is unilaterally hitting you with firepower from a range where your attacks can&#8217;t reach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All they can do is surrender, withdraw, or just hold up inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cleared my heart and dropped gasoline one after another, one of which ignited after several unexploded ordnance and burned with an explosion. Then it also ignites the unexploded gasoline one after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that was left was to spread the fire by dropping the bottles containing gasoline.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that the centre of Cardassia was completely covered in flames, I then dropped bombs on the barracks that the map pointed out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped looking at what the aftermath was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it&#8217;s time to fly over Cardassia and drop the bombs on the enemy soldiers walking in the streets. But I didn&#8217;t see if they hit the target properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I look back and think about it, I&#8217;m sure I won&#8217;t be able to go on if I see civilians dying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result of me killing my heart and tearing the inside to shreds, there was no resistance when allied forces broke through the gate and entered the fortified city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming the fluttering of the Centraren flag in the square in front of the burned-down lord&#8217;s mansion and at the gates, I returned to the fort.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two days later, the captain of the garrison and I entered Cardassia, which had been completely overrun. It was the first time in half a century that Centraren had retaken this part of Cardassia.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, yesterday they had a fierce battle with civilians and defeated soldiers who launched a guerrilla attack. This fierce urban battle, which resulted in a large number of casualties on both sides, ended with a victory for us, the Centraren.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The remaining civilians, with a few exceptions, were expelled and packed into wagons, and sent to the Est Empire. The wounded prisoners were also handed over to the Empire&#8217;s side in wagons along with the civilians.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it was a terrible policy to evict the residents, but I guess they are doing it to avoid a muddy urban war with the residents who have turned into terrorists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, it seems that the Est Empire did the same thing to Centraren when we lost Cardassia before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, the only people left in this fortified city of Cardassia were us, some civilians, and healthy prisoners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, what they make the prisoners do is forced labour. They are forced to do things like ploughing fields and repairing broken buildings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, considering the current level of civilization, it might be something like this, and considering the fact that the residents of the royal capital were massacred in the game, this might be a very lenient response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, for the first time in a while, I was able to sleep in a large room and a soft bed instead of a small fort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at night, the information, which I was dying to know, was finally brought.</span></p>
