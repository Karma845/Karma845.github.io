<h3>Chapter 43 - Villager A Realize his Mother's Affection.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I got back to the dormitory, I grabbed my packed luggage and rushed out of the room to return home where my mother is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I got home, I told my mother, who was waiting for me to return, everything that had happened today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her that I took the side of the duke&#8217;s daughter, who was being treated unreasonably by being forced to accept a duel that was intended to banish her when she loses. And that I have beaten up not only the crown prince but also the prince of a neighbouring country and the heir of some high-ranking nobles while fighting in the duel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure I must have made my mother sad, who would have wanted me to graduate from school and get a good job.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I thought, but when my mother heard my confession, she said something unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah. You did your best. It was great. To help a girl who was in a bad situation, you have grown into a fine man.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she hugged me gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, before something happens, you should run away. If anything happens, your mother will take your place.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No! I did that on my own. &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly. Your mother is fine as long as you&#8217;re safe and healthy. okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, mother &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was told that, I couldn&#8217;t say anything. But though I wanted to save my mother, I ended up sacrificing her!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, go to bed today. Tomorrow I&#8217;ll make you something you like for the first time in a long time.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting urged by my mother to go to bed, I went to my room. Then, I changes into my sleepwear and crawled into bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head was spinning, and I couldn&#8217;t get my thoughts straight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where on earth did I go wrong? In the end, will I be unable to save my mother?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, there was a knock at the door of my room. It was my mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m coming in, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom came in through the door and then sat down on the side of my bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How long has it been since I&#8217;ve seen Allen&#8217;s face in bed like this?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not that young anymore.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I say so because of embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You know what, your mother always wondered why Allen is so brilliant when he&#8217;s the child of that man and me. But, as I thought, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re his son.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mom said sincerely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;After all, you helped a girl who was being bullied, didn&#8217;t you? You are really just like him.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so……&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sure your dead father would have been proud of you, Allen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I wonder if that&#8217;s true……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My father died before I could remember. I&#8217;ve never been told why, but maybe he did something like I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you looking at me like that for? You haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, have you? Then you should be proud of yourself. Besides, if you get punished, whether, by the king or the duke, I&#8217;ll complain.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Uh, mother &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why Allen. You did your best. It was great.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, she gently stroked my head. Though I was too old to be stroked like that, I fell into a deep sleep.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I woke up the next day, my head was much clearer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why I felt so negative and distraught yesterday. But after thinking about it, it&#8217;s as expected so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Intervene in Anastasia&#8217;s condemnation event to prevent her banishment. By doing so, I have prevented the outbreak of civil war and prevented an invasion from the Estonian Empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, I&#8217;ve been able to destroy the fate scenario according to the actions I&#8217;ve taken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has not yet been decided that I will get executed, and since the duke&#8217;s family is still indebted to me, there is a good chance that I will not be if I use it well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I had been through a lot yesterday and had said a lot of outrageous things, so I must have been mentally weak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I left the room and headed for the living room. My mother has already prepared breakfast for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mother, good morning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good morning, Allen. Did you sleep well?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, umm, thank you for yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. More than that, the breakfast is already ready, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat down on a chair and waited for my mother. Then we started eating breakfast together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve been home, and it&#8217;s a very peaceful morning. I don&#8217;t know how long this will last, but I want to cherish these days as much as I can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought so from the bottom of my heart.</span></p>
