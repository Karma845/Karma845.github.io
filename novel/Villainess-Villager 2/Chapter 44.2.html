<h3>Chapter 44.2 - Side - Duke of Ramslet.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The engagement of my daughter to His Royal Highness the Crown Prince was decided at the request of the royal family. This was done in order to strengthen the ties between the royal family and the most fertile land, the Dukedom of Ramslett, in a situation where all countries except the Kingdom of Westerdale to the west are hypothetically enemies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially with the Est Empire to the east and the Kingdom of Xaus to the south constantly messing around near the border, it was the perfect way to show the unity of the royal family and the southern nobility inside and outside the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this thought in mind, I offered my daughter to the royal family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though my daughter and His Highness did not seem to have any affection for each other, both kept a moderate relationship with each other with the awareness of being the future Queen and King of the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, that relationship began to break down rapidly when they entered high school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that an illegitimate child named Amy of the Barony of Brayes has managed to ensnare the Crown Prince, the legitimate sons of promising aristocrats, and even the third prince of the Kingdom of Westerdale, who is studying abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When my subordinate first told me about it, I couldn&#8217;t keep up with his report and had to confirm it three times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I discussed it with His Majesty the King, but the royal family had no intention of breaking up the engagement, and I agreed with them. Besides, my daughter understood the meaning of political marriage and took a mature approach, so we decided to wait and see for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, many of the family heads of other entwined sons and their fiancé&#8217;s homes believed that such play with fire would calm down once they graduated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if not of this level, many of the heads of the school have some familiarity with the situation, and the general rule is that matters within the school should be resolved within the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not good to be overprotective towards the children just before they become adults. (T/N:- Heh, giving favourability to the Crown Prince is not overprotective.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why they aligned themselves with us by looking at the situation as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, considering now, this response may have been a little harsh for my daughter, who has a serious personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if it was because of this or not, but my daughter came in second place in her first final exam after entering school. She was not defeated by the crown prince, but by a scholarship student of common background.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this time, I scolded her so that she has the awareness of being the future Queen, but her reaction was surprising. I was impressed by her positively shining eyes, saying she understood what she had to do. I was expecting her to be more depressed, but she seems to be growing into a strong-willed daughter, which makes me happy as a parent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she conducted the independent research during the summer vacation in collaboration with His Highness &amp; Co. and also involved the commoner&#8217;s scholarship student to whom she lost in the exam. The resulting report was said to be so good that even the experts were impressed, and the reputation of His Royal Highness the Crown Prince was greatly enhanced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it may have been a bad idea to let my daughter out of my sight after this incident. She was expelled from the Crown Prince&#8217;s group at the school festival, and since then they have not spoken to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, there were even rumours of engagement cancellation beginning to flow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I questioned her about it, she said &#8220;This is just a political marriage, and I just need to get married and have children&#8221;, with a frozen expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was busy, and my daughter was also living in the dormitory, so we didn&#8217;t have much time to talk properly. At that time, I received a complaint from my daughter that the son of Viscount Jukes was trying to use violence on her because of her relationship with the illegitimate daughter of the Brayes family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s a big problem, no matter how much it&#8217;s inside the school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the incident occurred just as I was about to dispatch my subordinates to the school to confirm the facts and formally protest to the royal family, Baroness Brayes, and Viscount Jukes, who actually had a hand in the crime, for declaring her a criminal without any evidence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My daughter, who was supposed to come back tomorrow after attending a promotion party, suddenly came back in the middle of the night and knocked on the door of my private room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know why the report from the subordinate I sent to the party hasn&#8217;t come in yet, but it was clearly unusual, so I invited her into the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what she was saying didn&#8217;t make any sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While calming her somehow, I found out that the crown prince had announced the annulment of the engagement and had forced my daughter to challenge her to a duel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth of the matter would soon be known, but given the nature of my daughter, it was probably true. At least, my daughter is not the kind of person who would lose her mind and challenge him to a duel but tends to follow the norms and hierarchical relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. I&#8217;ve been hearing about this for a while now, and I&#8217;ve heard that he has become quite foolish, but I guess he has already reached that point. It&#8217;s going to be hard to keep this engagement going like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her that to reassure her, but she still looked distraught.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My daughter seemed to be very confused, and it was very difficult to understand what she was saying, but I slowly digested it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, five of the most powerful men of her age group had gone out of their way to be representatives against my daughter in a sacred one-on-one duel. And it seems that the man who represented my daughter won the duel by himself against the five of them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So that&#8217;s how it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the moment I caught up with my understanding, I shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He took on all five of them at the same time and won by himself, is that it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. He is a genius that our country cannot afford to lose. Please! Please! I&#8217;ll do whatever I can! So please!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised, but it&#8217;s not a big deal. There are many ways to solve it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told my daughter to calm down and let Sebas brew tea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, calm down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And slowly, I started to ask her about it, but it seemed that the man who had taken over as my agent was a commoner who was a special student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. The more I learned about him, the more he seemed like an unrealistic man out of a story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, it seems that my daughter has been taken care of a lot more than just this one time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, if what my daughter says is true, he could be of considerable use. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to take him in while we can.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking so, I ordered Sebas to bring this Allen to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the next day, Sebas brought back Allen, who had returned to his parent&#8217;s house. From the looks of him, he was an ordinary young man that can be found anywhere, though he still had some innocence left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The young man&#8217;s appearance made me wonder if it was really him. However, according to the reports of my subordinates, this young man had indeed used a mysterious technique to beat those five people to death in public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that the witness was also from our rival faction, and my subordinates all testified that they were delayed in getting out due to their interference on that day. So it would be more natural to think that this was a farce that had been prepared from the beginning and that His Highness the Crown Prince or Marx had a hand in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How dare they quarrel with my duke&#8217;s family, who is a political marriage partner, for such a trivial matter?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this happens, there will be nothing we can do about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I started to probe him a little more and found him to be a very interesting man. He was not intimidated by my appearance or position, but he was not impolite either, and yet he did not say more than I asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt as if I was dealing with the child of a well-educated aristocrat. What kind of education does a child like this need to grow up in a favela?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I listened to him further, he pointed out the possibility that this disturbance, which started from a lover&#8217;s quarrel in the school, would eventually lead to the fall of the royal capital in a war. Furthermore, he said without hesitation that the fire of this will fall onto him and the other commoners, which was a perfect answer like a politician.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How unbelievable!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like my daughter said, he is a genius. There are many perspectives that are lacking, but we cannot afford to lose such a tremendous talent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Convinced of this, I declared that I would be the backer of Allen-kun and promised to protect his mother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After sending Allen-kun home, my daughter, who was supposed to be watching in the surveillance room, was hugged by my wife with her eyes swollen red. It seems she was ashamed of her own ignorance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I announced to my family that I would give my full support to Allen-kun as a duke, and immediately headed for the royal palace.</span></p>
