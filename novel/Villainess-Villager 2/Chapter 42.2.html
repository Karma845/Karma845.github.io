<h3>Chapter 42.2 - Anastasia (2) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t do this. For a talent like you to get destroyed here is unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, despite that! Like this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Rather than that, Anastasia-sama. Please acknowledge me as your representative as soon as possible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Ah, um, I admit.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Allen told me, I admitted it. But soon realizing it, I felt like crying in self-loathing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Allen nonchalantly set the terms of the duel. Allen was monopolizing everything. He asserted that he would win in a one-on-five match and further provoked his five opponents one after another to make them lose their calm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, negotiations had been concluded, and a duel had been scheduled at the training grounds.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, Anastasia-sama. I&#8217;ll go back to the dormitory and get my weapons, so please go to the training grounds first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen&#8217;s words brought me back to my senses, and I tried to convince him to get out of this reckless duel. But, I was easily outdone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen is the youngest C-rank adventurer to ever conquer the Goblin Dungeon. He is also an Orc Slayer and has even defeated the Blizzard Phoenix, an almost legendary monster, by himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, it doesn&#8217;t make sense. Why would such a person be in high school?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So you should relax as you do in a big boat because I&#8217;m sure you will win this duel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen said with a smile and quickly left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I went to the training grounds to wait for Allen. Margaret and Isabella stayed with me, even though they didn’t need to follow me as everything is over for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have good friends, but to stand next to me here is to declare a clear rebellion against His Highness. I&#8217;m very sorry to have dragged such good friends into this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, Allen appeared in the training area. He was dressed very lightly and carried only one weapon, a dagger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why don&#8217;t you bring a more proper weapon!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was going to say that, but the only words that came out of my mouth were his name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Allen responded by saying, &#8220;Good&#8221;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is good, you idiot!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but say that to Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, no. I just thought that Anastasia-sama is well taken care of by her friends.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure I was blushing when he told me that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you thinking? Allen! Even though you&#8217;re in a situation where your life is at stake, you&#8217;re worried about me!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, Anastasia-sama, I will win for you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yes. And, one more thing, Allen. That witness is from a faction that&#8217;s hostile to my family, the Ramslett. Be careful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Thank you very much. But there is no problem. I have no intention of relenting.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen stepped forward in an aloof manner and incited his highnesses to take advantage of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with his highnesses pissed off, a desperate one-on-five duel began.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the end result was a one-sided battle that none of us could have even imagined. No, it was not even a battle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In just a moment, the three of them were down, and the next thing I knew, Markus and His Highness were being lectured by Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Highness&#8217; excuses were especially childish and unbearable to listen to. Allen could have settled the matter immediately, but he secured the upper hand and refuted His Highness in front of the public in a duel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could it be that Allen had been preparing to rebuke His Highness like this from the beginning?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a suspicion like that, but that would be impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who could have imagined that such a duel would happen in the first place?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen, however, seemed to make a mistake at the last moment. His Highness forgot himself and tried to use extreme magic, causing his magic power to run out of control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly began to prepare to use my ice magic to offset the flames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, my ice magic was incompatible with His Highness&#8217; fire magic, so it was highly doubtful that I could suppress it. However, if I don&#8217;t suppress it at this point, not only will His Highness&#8217; safety be at risk, but Allen, Margaret, Isabella, and the crowd will also be in danger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I fail to suppress it, I will be the first to be burned by His Highness&#8217; fire magic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it originally happened because I was not able to hold the reins of His Highness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I have that responsibility.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I prepared myself while thinking this, Allen gestured to me to not worry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he activated the wind magic so quickly that I couldn&#8217;t tell when he was chanting and rolled up all the runaway flames and blew them into the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Alle &#8230; n?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No words came out, as there was too much of a difference in level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. From the beginning, Allen never had a vision of losing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His, His Highness Karlheinz is unable to fight. Therefore, it&#8217;s Allen&#8217;s victory.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen bowed and came to me, then knelt gracefully. Looking at him, I felt my heart flutter strangely and my face heated up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I dedicate this victory to Anastasia-sama.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tha-Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I didn&#8217;t kill anyone. His Highness just used up all his magic power, so he shouldn&#8217;t be in any danger of death. The magic flames that went out of control were all blown upwards by my wind magic, so there should be few injuries. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll wake up after he sleeps for a while and recovers his magic power.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is, is that so.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Good, then Allen won&#8217;t be executed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved, but Allen&#8217;s next words made me feel as if my heart would stop beating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, Anastasia-sama, I&#8217;ll be going now. Thank you very much for everything. And thank you, Margaret-sama and Isabella-sama. It&#8217;s a little regrettable, but I&#8217;ll leave you now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wait, please! Don&#8217;t say goodbye!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called out to Allen, but he didn&#8217;t respond to my call and strode away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn&#8217;t take the option of chasing after him as I had to clean up after this stupid duel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That woman collapsed unconscious and was carried away, so she couldn’t even speak properly. His Highness would probably not wake up for a while due to the effects of exhausting his magic. Markus&#8217;s nose was broken and his face was covered in blood. And Oscar was still suffering from the inability to even open his eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Claude and Leo regained consciousness after a while, but they didn&#8217;t seem to understand what had happened at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even though I was condemned to break off my engagement, there were some fools in the royal court who wanted me to accompany His Highness as part of my fiancee&#8217;s duties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made sure they understood, but they wasted a lot of time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I finally finished cleaning up the mess, I went to Allen&#8217;s dorm room and found that his room was already a hollow shell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Alle &#8230; n &#8230;? Wh &#8230;y &#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
