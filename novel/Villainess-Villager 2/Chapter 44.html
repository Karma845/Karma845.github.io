<h3>Chapter 44 - Villager A got Summoned.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An hour after I thought that I wanted to do my duty to my parents, a messenger came to my house. It was an elderly man who looked like a butler, dressed in a very expensive-looking jacket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re Allen-sama, right? My name is Sebastian, a butler in service to the Duke of Ramslett.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wow! He is a butler, and his name is also Sebastian. Come to think of it, wasn&#8217;t there a character like that in the game?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was not a character that was firmly involved in the story, so my memory of him is fuzzy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The head of our family, Gerhard-sama, would like to speak with you. Would you please accompany me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please wait. My son!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Please be assured. Allen-sama is my Lady&#8217;s benefactor. He will not be harmed. Let me swear by the name of our family, the Dukedom of Ramslett.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mother, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter what, Anastasia&#8217;s parents would not treat me badly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought about it, my mother didn&#8217;t say anything more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, it&#8217;s more important to see how much cooperation I can get here. In order to do that, I need to make sure that the Duke likes me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put on my uniform, dressed up, and then boarded the carriage with Sebastian&#8217;s guidance.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrived at the Duke&#8217;s huge mansion in the aristocratic district, where I was shown around the interior of the mansion, which was as magnificent as its appearance, and was led to a seat on a sofa in the reception room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The maid brewed a cup of tea, from which I took a shaky sip of it and took a deep breath to calm myself down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ve thought of all the possible answers. And if it still doesn&#8217;t work, I can always escape through the sewers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can manage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about this made me relax a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after waiting for a while, a hairy, stern blond gorilla came into the room wearing a very nice suit made for humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah no, it&#8217;s wrong. When I looked closely, I saw that it was a human. I mistook him for a gorilla because of his magnificent beard, chiselled face, and wonderful physique.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the moment I thought about such an unimportant thing, my tension quickly eased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alright, I can do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I kneel and thank my liege.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m Gerhard, the head of the Dukedom of Ramslett. It looks like you&#8217;ve taken care of my daughter. Come on, have a seat.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s nice to meet you. My name is Allen.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was allowed, I said my name and took a seat on the couch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m sorry to call you out of the blue this morning.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No problem at all.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, considering Anastasia&#8217;s personality, it would probably be best not to be too sycophantic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hou, don&#8217;t ask about the business or do unnecessary flattery, is it?&#8221; (T/N:- Duke&#8217;s response to Allen&#8217;s tone.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I was right. I responded to the Duke&#8217;s words with silence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Something like this at that age? No wonder my daughter took interest in you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke&#8217;s expression relaxed as he said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, first of all, I heard that you fought a duel with the Crown Prince and Prince Claude on behalf of my daughter last night. Let me thank you for this. Thank you, Allen-kun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s! I&#8217;m sorry to trouble you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised because I didn&#8217;t expect the Duke to thank me so frankly. However, the Duke looked at me with an impressed look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? What was the element that impressed you now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, can I ask you a few questions?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, anything you want.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered shortly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Umu. I&#8217;m sorry, but I had to look into you. You&#8217;re the youngest C-rank adventurer to ever traverse the Goblin Dungeon and also a slayer of goblins and Orcs. And according to my daughter, you&#8217;ve even defeated a Blizzard Phoenix.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Also, I heard that you skipped a grade in the common school and saved up the money to enter the high school by yourself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then why did you request to be a representative in a duel like that? You&#8217;re not so stupid that you don&#8217;t understand the meaning of it, are you? Surely, you wanted my daughter, isn&#8217;t that the reason?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, It was a question that was bound to come up. I gave him the answer I had prepared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. I was prepared to get expelled from the school. And about Anastasia-sama, I respect her attitude of earnest effort. Of course, I understand that our statuses are different.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then why? As you enrolled in the High School, that means you had dreamt of graduating from it, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke&#8217;s expression did not change. He probably doesn&#8217;t have any ulterior motive for this question and genuinely wants to know because he doesn&#8217;t understand my actions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s right. You may not believe me, but I wanted to protect my mother and the people who took care of me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time, the Duke moved his eyebrows and gave me a dubious look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how much you know, but it&#8217;s clear to everyone that there is no justice in that duel at all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;ve heard it all. I&#8217;ve never heard of a duel as terrible as that one.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke nodded and replied to my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But even such a duel is a duel. If Anastasia-sama had fought the duel herself, she probably would have lost because she would not have been able to hurt His Highness.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m sure she will, given my daughter&#8217;s personality.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In that case, Anastasia-sama would have been expelled from the school for a crime she did not commit because the other party demanded that Anastasia-sama was forbidden to approach His Highnesses.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It would have happened.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke nodded without changing his expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, if the Duke&#8217;s daughter gets unilaterally eliminated in such a manner, the other noble families would not be safe either. What awaits this is the succession struggle between the Crown Prince and the Second Prince. Looking back at the history, this conflict is very dangerous as a lot of blood will be spilled, and the country will be in chaos.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; I understand what you&#8217;re saying. But, what does that have to do with protecting your mother or anyone you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke asked me a question as he deepened the wrinkles between his eyebrows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In a recent newspaper, I noticed something worrisome about the Est Empire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha! What did you say! You! No way!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nod silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so, you have thought that far &#8230; I see. I see. I get it. I&#8217;ll take full responsibility for your case. I can also guarantee your mother&#8217;s safety. You can relax.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said and bowed deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Do not worry. From this moment on, the Duke of Ramslett is your backing. If you have any problems, please contact us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you very much!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this way, I thanked the Duke and came back to my parent&#8217;s house riding their carriage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, I couldn&#8217;t see Anastasia. She said she didn&#8217;t want to see me. I don&#8217;t know why but it felt like she didn&#8217;t like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a strange way to say goodbye, and unfortunately, it can&#8217;t be helped. I guess I should just be happy that I destroyed my fate and still managed to survive.</span></p>
