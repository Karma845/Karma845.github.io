<h3>Chapter 66.1 - Anastasia (7) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw the order handed to me by His Highness and stamped with the royal seal, my blood ran cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett is ordered to marry the Est Imperial Magic Division Commander, Günther Wernherr.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly protested, but His Highness doesn&#8217;t seem to care at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As long as the Jade Seal is affixed, this is a royal order. If you refuse this, you and the Duke of Ramslett will be traitors in the eyes of the world.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gu~tsu.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But how is this possible? Even if you are a member of the royal family, without asking the Duke, how can you marry off a Duke&#8217;s daughter to a man from another country with a completely unbalanced family background?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Highness ordered me to be taken away, and when Allen moved to protect me, I hurriedly stopped him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Allen stood up to him now, he would be a traitor. No matter how much the Duke&#8217;s family supports him, if he openly rebelled against the Crown Prince&#8217;s wilful order and stopped it with his own strength, then the Duke would not be able to protect him.</span></p>
<p>&nbsnbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, Allen! I don&#8217;t think my father would have approved of this. You have to tell him first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, I-I understand.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entrusted the order I had received to Allen, I was surrounded by the knights.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, it&#8217;s to prevent me from running away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? Knights? Are these guys knights?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I saw their appearance and behaviour, such a question came to my mind, but when I saw Allen, who seems to have heard something from that woman, put his hand on his sword, I stopped him in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, I&#8217;m fine. Believe me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Kuh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I was taken to a ruggedly furnished carriage that the knights had prepared for me as if they were escorting a prisoner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The escorts discard all means of protest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I got in, I had a crucial question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A carriage with a rugged interior? Why wouldn&#8217;t a carriage from the royal palace have the royal family crest on it?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh, no way, you guys!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. You&#8217;ve been sold by that Crown Prince. Welcome to the Est Empire.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was too late to react and got quickly seized by several men. They tied me up and gagged me, then put me in a big bag.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dark. Painful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I&#8217;m such an idiot. I was so caught up in the common sense that I didn&#8217;t see anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Help me……!</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I had been secretly taken out of the royal capital through the sewers after changing carriages several times. And now it seems that I&#8217;ve been put on a carriage again, and I&#8217;m being transported somewhere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a feeling that I was floating in the air a few times, which must have been the feeling when they reloaded me as luggage from carriage to carriage. After that, someone carried me away, but at that time, I heard the sound of water with a nose-curling smell for a long time, so this must have been the sewer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But isn&#8217;t it bad for the Est Empire to know about this sewer?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the royal capital gets attacked, the walls would be meaningless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but let out a small laugh when I thought about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why do I care about this country when His Highness, the next king, has treated me like this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking about this, the carriage stopped, and I was lifted up again, carried for a while, and then roughly placed on the ground.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the mouth of the bag was opened and I was able to get out of the bag for the first time in a while. When the gag was removed, I stared at the men in front of me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Haa, haa, you guys, don&#8217;t think you can do this to me and get away with it for free?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The big guy in front of me, probably the guy who has been carrying me. And about ten more men were surrounding me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh, the young Lady from the Ramslett dukedom is scary.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A burly man said this with a grin and a disgusting smile on his face. The other men were looking at me as if they were licking my body from top to bottom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But we&#8217;re free. Because you&#8217;ve been sold by that Crown Prince. And the young Lady&#8217;s family is scheduled to be executed for treason in the near future. They&#8217;ll be traitors if they don&#8217;t cooperate when the kingdom gets attacked by foreign countries, right? Well, it&#8217;s all going according to our plan, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he said that, all the men around me let out a vulgar laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And the one who wanted to buy you was the Magic Division Commander of the Est Empire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to be his wife!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said angrily and strongly, but the reply was unexpected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, it doesn&#8217;t seem like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Huh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know much about it. I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s okay to have a broken heart as long as you&#8217;re physically fit. So from today until we reach the capital of the Est Empire, we&#8217;ll be sexually violating you every night, get along okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh……?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s horrible! Accepting any men other than Allen!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly use my magic to resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh Mana, the source of all things, Mana. Become a spear of ice and shoot my enemies. Ice spear!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the magic that I should have been familiar with would not activate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-Why?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Young Lady, I heard that you can study well, but you seem to be very stupid. The rope that binds you has the effect of sealing magic. It&#8217;s an excellent gift from the Magic Division Commander.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-That&#8217;s&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despair overcame me as I realized that my only means of resistance had already been taken away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, we look forward to working with you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, noo!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped back but soon got cornered by the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ghahaha, so you can make a cute voice too!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, the men reached out their filthy hands to me.</span></p>
