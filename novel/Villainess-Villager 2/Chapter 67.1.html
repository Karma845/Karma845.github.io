<h3>Chapter 67.1 - Anastasia (9) - Side.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s pitch black &#8230; I can&#8217;t see anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no sense of time. How much time has passed, I don&#8217;t even know.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I touched the ring that Allen had given me and the hair ornament that Her Majesty had given me to calm my mind and believe that we would meet again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, when bread and water, the only things that are occasionally offered, the words they say pierce my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your father is dead. He protested against your abduction to the Crown, so it seems they executed your whole family as traitors.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s a lie. There is no way that can happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The war has started because you refused to marry. If you had done your duty as a noblewoman, your people and your soldiers wouldn&#8217;t have died. Now, Bruseni is almost under the control of the Empire.&#8221; (T/N:- in their dreams.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230;I put myself later for my people. But they&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, by the way, I heard the man you love has died in the war? It seems he got stabbed in the stomach with a spear.&##8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No! It&#8217;s a lie! There&#8217;s no way that Allen will end up that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you hadn&#8217;t been in his life, that man wouldn&#8217;t have died. Oh, poor soul.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a lie! It&#8217;s a lie! It&#8217;s a lie!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s your fault, isn&#8217;t it? If it weren&#8217;t for you, that man would still be alive and living happily ever after.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen? It&#8217;s&#8230;.. a lie, isn&#8217;t it? Allen?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ahh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen…….</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, that guy has not come to tell me anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen…….</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How much time has passed now?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s still pitch black. But I feel like there&#8217;s someone out there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that &#8230;.Allen?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought I saw Allen&#8217;s face there, but it quickly disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey. Allen? Don&#8217;t go. Hey, didn&#8217;t you come to protect me? Hey, Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But my voice only echoes in the darkness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. There was no way Allen could be at the center of such an enemy nation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is a hallucination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I touched the precious ring on my left ring finger and thought of Allen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No one, nothing, answers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m&#8230;.alone&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">~Gatan~</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems bread and water were put in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed and touched the usual place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, what touched my hand was not the usual bread or cup but a hard stick-like object.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? What is this?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, something flowed into me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so startled that I hurriedly tried to take my hand away, but my right hand was sucked onto the stick so tightly that I couldn&#8217;t get it off!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I know, it&#8217;s cold, lonely, and I&#8217;m not needed by anyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, such feelings spring up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No! I have a family! And above all! Allen!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at a time like this, what they said comes back to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your father, your mother, and your brother were executed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen was stabbed in the stomach with a spear and died in battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, the scene came to my mind as a real image, and I desperately denied that it was wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it kept coming back to me, and the bad images that popped into my head kept growing and growing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8230;.already&#8230;.from anyone&#8230;?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah &#8230; wrong&#8230; I&#8230;I&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I touch my hair ornament with my free left hand and pray to my precious ring to reject the bad image.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But despite my desperate efforts to resist, my consciousness was slowly being consumed by fear, little by little, until it was filled in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I……refuse…….</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All&#8230;en&#8230;help&#8230;me…</span></p>
