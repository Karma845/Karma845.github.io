<h3>Chapter 65 - Villager A Overruns the Forts.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s been a week since I joined the unit. As expected, I&#8217;m getting better at handling them after so many successful battles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of imperial troops I&#8217;ve wiped out is 10 in battalion size, 31 in company size, and 47 in platoon size, and I can&#8217;t even begin to count the number of smaller squadrons I&#8217;ve wiped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, by annihilation, I mean that the battle was rendered impossible, not that it was confirmed that everyone had been killed. In other words, there is a possibility that the surviving enemy soldiers will return to the base, be reorganized, and sortie as another unit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, how many people can stand on the battlefield again in a situation where a big explosion suddenly occurs around them even though there is no one around them, and when they notice it, their comrades, superiors, and subordinates are lying dead?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would&#8217;ve been traumatized for quite a while, and it would be tough to be told to go to the same place without any precautions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now that I&#8217;ve had such a great battle, it is required to attack a tougher place this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, things are going well so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s why I want Allen to assist in the capture of the fortified city, Cardassia.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. Let&#8217;s leave it to me. How&#8217;s the operation going?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! You! What&#8217;s with that attitude! You&#8217;re an enlisted student soldier! You should know how to treat your superiors!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And, well, of course, there are going to be guys like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I know what you mean.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, you wouldn&#8217;t think that the garrison captain of this fort, whom I first met, would be the general manager of the Bruseni regional army, would you?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it feels strange to return to a more polite tone now, so it looks like this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Besides, Allen is a B-rank adventurer. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve seen the results. Moreover, Allen is a member of the Duke of Ramslett, sent here by the king. He&#8217;s not under our command.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Just shut up. Besides, I&#8217;d like to get this over with before the crazy ones from the royal capital arrive.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that because of the declaration of war, a knight from the royal capital is supposed to come with his troops.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..That&#8217;s certainly&#8230;&#8230;Okay!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The nobles who made the situation worse by rejecting all of our requests might just be a hindrance if he comes.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m off!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said that and started Buitor Rev., and I flew in the direction he told me to go for a while until I saw a huge fortress city.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. The fortified city is protected by three walls and a water moat. Each wall is about 30 meters high, and the width of the water moat is about 10, no, maybe even 20 meters.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, on the west side of the fortified city, there are three more strong forts blocking our Centraren forces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We, the Centraren army, were attacking one of the forts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, they are struggling with the high walls, also the arrows and magic seem to be preventing them from getting close to the battering ram or siege ladder!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, thanks to the struggle, there is no risk of an accidental explosion, so it is easy for me to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I approached from the sky and dropped one bomb after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, all the bombs I dropped fell inside the fort, but the aim is appropriate. They can&#8217;t stand on the ramparts and aim at the attacking enemy soldiers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that the bombing campaign to date was more effective than I had expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Enemy soldiers seemed to panic immediately, and the counterattack from the fort soon lost control. Some of the enemy soldiers even ran for their lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the battering ram reached the gate and the siege ladder attached to the wall. Seeing this, I was convinced that this fort would fall, and I headed for the next fort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The good news is that the friendly forces haven&#8217;t arrived there yet, so I carpet-bombed the place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I probably dropped 200 or even 300 of them. The enemy soldiers outside must have been literally wiped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, the purpose of this bomb is to kill and injure with the blast and fragments, so it cannot make holes or collapse the solid walls. The shock wave may have broken some glass, but the building is still standing as expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Naruhodo, environment-friendly bombing. </span><span style="font-weight: 400">（</span><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span><span style="font-weight: 400">゜ー゜</span><span style="font-weight: 400">*</span><span style="font-weight: 400">）</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I head to the third and final fort. I&#8217;m going to try a different approach here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I processed a different kind of bomb than the one I had just used. It took a lot of magic power, but a chunky glass container was made and dropped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when it hit the building of the fort, it cracked, and as soon as the colourless liquid sealed inside splashed out, it burst into flames at once with an explosion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, this is a kind of incendiary bomb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I was also relieved to see that this kind of incendiary bomb worked well in the actual battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, what I put in the glass was a gasoline-like liquid that burns well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if it can be used to run a car, but it vaporizes at room temperature and burns well. By the way, when you think of gasoline, you probably think of pink or orange, but those are just coloured to make it easier to understand, and this gasoline-like liquid made by refining is colourless and transparent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, instead of the fuze, I used sodium extracted from salt by processing it and water. Sodium ignites rapidly when mixed with water, so I tried using it instead of a fuze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it bluntly, it&#8217;s the kind of amateur work that would be laughed at by a real professional.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I didn&#8217;t have enough knowledge in this area to develop it in time, so I applied my knowledge of chemistry, which I&#8217;m sure everyone knows, to make it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as far as the experiment was concerned, there was a good chance of unexploded ordnance, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s much different from dropping lit torches together and hoping the fire doesn&#8217;t go out during the fall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know the details yet, but it seems that when water and sodium react, or when hydrogen burns, if there is vaporized gasoline there, it will ignite, so there is still room for improvement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, personally, I&#8217;d like to create something with a more proper mechanism instead of this forced mechanism&#8230;&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now. Let&#8217;s get back to the war situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The imperial soldiers, startled by the sudden explosion that set the fort ablaze, rushed to put out the fire. I mercilessly dropped bottles of gasoline-like liquid on them again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the fire is lit, all you have to do is spray the gasoline-like liquid and the place turns into hell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, while throwing a lot of it, the glass material for processing the bottle was exhausted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After confirming that the flames were burning to the point where it seemed impossible to extinguish them, I decided to return. I guess my mission is now complete.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way back, I encountered my allies who had already attacked the first two forts and were marching towards the third one I had burned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The friendlies raised their swords facing me in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. Apparently, they are greeting me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned the plane around once in the air to return the greeting and then went to the camp.</span></p>
