<h3>Chapter 62.1 - Amy (4) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha, it&#8217;s already working so well I can&#8217;t stop laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s only right that the villainess is sold to the Est Empire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s still annoying. She took my fairy hair ornament and made it her own!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I didn&#8217;t think that nerd was a reincarnate like me. So it&#8217;s all his fault that there was no appraisal scroll and that he is such a savage adventurer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You cheated and messed up the whole scenario!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It really pisses me off!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that&#8217;s what you get when I get a little serious. (T/N:- Seriously, Allen was not even serious, you know.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides that nerd, he&#8217;s so creepy that he&#8217;s serving that villainess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bet girls called him creepy in his previous life too. I wonder if he was a virgin?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, boys who play otome games are just plain creepy. Being a virgin, he probably had licked the screen when he saw the villainess with a nice face. (T/N:- Well that&#8217;s plain gross. ( ′</span><span style="font-weight: 400">～‵</span><span style="font-weight: 400">))</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yuck, gross.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m getting goosebumps just thinking about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, but too bad. I&#8217;m sure your favourite villainess is serving the bad men right now. Forcibly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the villainess falling in despair will come back as the last boss.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, serves you right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s really refreshing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I guess the game&#8217;s coercive power is still there when the Est Empire side asks for the villainess. What&#8217;s more, anything is fine as long as the body is safe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What does the Est Empire think of women?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, this time, it doesn&#8217;t matter as she is the villainess. But if they do this to other girls as well, I&#8217;d be disgusted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I&#8217;m the heroine, aren&#8217;t I? I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to happen to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, what flavour of tea should I make today?</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, what? What&#8217;s going on? Why is the Est Empire attacking us so quickly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school festival isn&#8217;t over yet, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rebellion event hasn&#8217;t started yet!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, why!?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, the war report event has already started!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, but it&#8217;s not like we&#8217;re actually going there, so what&#8217;s the big deal?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking that, I found the nerd standing there with a sour face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let&#8217;s get rid of this guy with this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad, isn&#8217;t it? Your precious Anastasia&#8217;s bridal carriage will be attacked by rogues, you know? And after that, she&#8217;ll be cruelly raped and sold. Oh, you poor thing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why do you know that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Haha, he glared at me with a fearsome face. It really feels good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious. She&#8217;s a villainess. So she&#8217;ll be abandoned by her fiancé, cruelly raped and sold, then she&#8217;ll become the dark knight and come for revenge. We&#8217;ll defeat her and have a happy ending, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s supposed to be. You know that, right? You know that, don&#8217;t you? I know that you&#8217;ve been in my way a lot.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Scum.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu. It&#8217;s nice to hear a loser howl. You&#8217;re not even a mob. You, who is not even a character, should leave immediately?!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hahaha. He became silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So pathetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Serves you right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the headmaster started his extremely long speech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, no one is hearing it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I think it&#8217;s time, is it? Let&#8217;s say the heroine line and get it over with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No! It&#8217;s too much! Why can&#8217;t we all get along better? I&#8217;m sure we can understand each other if we talk.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave my best performance with tears in my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Karl-sama and Leo nodded as if they were impressed. Markus and Oscar are not nodding, but they are looking at me with serious expressions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This must be because they are thinking about what to do after this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, it&#8217;s perfect. As expected of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s important to talk about it, but only if the other party is willing to discuss it. Also, I don&#8217;t admit any arbitrary remarks. Is that okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wh-What&#8217;s going on! After this, the headmaster&#8217;s job is to falter, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you saying that he&#8217;s a reincarnated person too? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Lol </span><span style="font-weight: 400">ꉂ</span><span style="font-weight: 400">(´</span><span style="font-weight: 400">∀</span><span style="font-weight: 400">｀</span><span style="font-weight: 400">)ʱªʱªʱª)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And why aren&#8217;t Karl-sama and the others getting up on the stage and giving a speech!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, as you can see from what I have said so far, our country is entering a wartime situation. For the time being, the school will be closed until next spring, so please get ready to go home to your parents!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Closing school? Then what about the rest of the events? Wartime regime?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t catch up with what was going on and my mind went blank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama and the others are comforting me because they think I&#8217;m shocked that we&#8217;re at war, but that&#8217;s not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, by the way, I heard that the nerd has volunteered to become a soldier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;ve already gotten rid of the villainess, and I feel better after not seeing her face today, so I don&#8217;t care anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just go ahead and die. You&#8217;re not a game character anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. You are neither a character nor anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So someone who isn&#8217;t even a mob should quietly die outside of the story, right?</span></p>
