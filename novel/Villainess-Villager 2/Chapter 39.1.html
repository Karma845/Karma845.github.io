<h3>Chapter 39.1 - Anastasia (1) - Side</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The final exam is over, and the grades are posted. I managed to finish without making any mistakes and was able to regain first place. However, Allen also got a perfect score, so we were tied for first place. Next time I would like to take the first place alone and tell him about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And one more thing that made me happy was that Margaret and Isabella&#8217;s grades went up all at once. After the incident at the school festival, I gave up completely and began to spend the time I had been devoting to His Highness trying to improve their grades.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It means that next year Isabella will be in the same class as us. With the three of us, we should be able to improve Allen&#8217;s current situation a little bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I introduced Isabella to Allen with that in mind, but I was a little bothered by the expression on Allen&#8217;s face as if he was regretting something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt uncomfortable, but I didn&#8217;t know what it was. And soon after that, a big incident occurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school holds a dance party at the end of the school year to celebrate promotion and graduation. Here the best student of each year selected by a political decision in the name of diversification is awarded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, no matter what we did, the best student will always be His Highness, but he said something outrageous here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia, as of this moment, I am breaking off my engagement to you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This declaration was too much and made me doubt His Highness&#8217;s sanity. The usual members with that woman in the centre were looking down at me from the stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, are you serious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph. You are still a woman with no understanding. Instead of a rotten woman like you, this kind-hearted and healing Amy is the one who deserves to be my fiancée.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, are you sure you want a woman who knows nothing about etiquette, nobility, or even what a country is? Your Highness seriously thinks that this woman is fit to be the Queen of this country?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I glanced at her, she responded exaggeratedly, and His Highness gently embraced her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous! Her kindness is what this country needs. It doesn&#8217;t need you who tries to find logic in everything. In the first place, we know of the many harassments you&#8217;ve perpetrated against Amy. I know harassment! A woman with characteristics like you is unfit to be the Queen of our country!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Then your Highness will take responsibility for the result, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will confirm his will with this last mercy. However, in response, His Highness uttered words that he should not have said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought about what you would say, but this is why I don&#8217;t like the big-headed Ramslett. That&#8217;s why Ramslett&#8217;s are bumpkins who can only make wheat forever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness. I don&#8217;t care what you say to me, but I can&#8217;t overlook the insults against the Duke of Ramslett. Please take back what you just said.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Insulting the duke&#8217;s family as country bumpkins is just outrageous. You can&#8217;t complain if they start a rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And let me tell you, wheat is the most important grain to feed the people. Without the people, there would be no aristocrats.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my words do not reach His Highness who has been reduced to a fool after being manipulated by that woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? I&#8217;m just telling you the facts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s why Anastasia-sama, who is from a provincial family, is disliked by Karl-sama., you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That woman is accusing me here and there, but her comments are going to choke her only.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, are you also going to insult the Ramslett family?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true because Karl-sama said it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s get a formal protest from the Ramslett family against the Brayes family.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s cowardly to use the power of your parent&#8217;s house.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Enough of this useless talk. I&#8217;ll leave you to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I declare so and try to leave, but His Highness spoke some meaningless words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait! Amy is right. If you&#8217;re proud of yourself as an aristocrat, solve it yourself before you cry to your parents. Until then, I won&#8217;t allow you to leave this place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, what are you trying to say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are your gloves for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At least it&#8217;s not meant to be used lightly in matters like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. The daughter of the Duke of Ramslett can&#8217;t even fight for the pride and honour of the family? It seems that His Excellency the Duke has no talent for raising children.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Highness snickered as he said this, and some of the guests who saw it were also laughing. It looks like they are from the anti-Ramslett faction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Does your Highness ask me to apply for a duel?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Think for yourself. Don&#8217;t you understand, unless I, the Crown Prince, tell you everything? As usual, what an obnoxious woman.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So you&#8217;re using your power as the Crown Prince to order me to challenge her to a duel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he has become this crazy, then there is nothing I can do. So, even though it was a political marriage arranged by my parents, it is my last duty as his fiancé. I guess I have no choice but to admonish him by accepting this foolish duel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s over, isn&#8217;t it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied that then took off the gloves and threw them at that woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh! Um, this is &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, deliberately startled by the glove I threw at her, picks it up and hands it back to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How far will you go to make me look like a fool?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, this means that that woman, feeling insulted, has challenged you to a duel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, is that so? I, fighting &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll fight this duel on behalf of Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was quite unexpected, even I was surprised at this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Your Highness? Ordering a woman to fight a duel and then acting as her opponent&#8217;s proxy in the duel, are you insane?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? You asked for a duel on your own. I want to protect Amy, so I&#8217;ll act as the proxy, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that His Highness is planning to dispose of me right here and now. Whether I win or lose in a duel with His Highness, I will probably end up getting executed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even the four people who had been ensnared by that woman have come forward to represent her. I&#8217;ve never heard of five representatives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where was the sacredness of a duel?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about you? Do you have any representative willing to fight against the five of us?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but look around, but all the students in the room looked away. It was a natural reaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It looks like you&#8217;re not popular.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His Highness said so, but it was no way a matter of popularity. The moment I gave up and prepared myself to fight and die, I heard the voice of the man I didn&#8217;t want to hear the most. (T/N:- she has unknowingly started liking him.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will act as a representative.&#8221;</span></p>
