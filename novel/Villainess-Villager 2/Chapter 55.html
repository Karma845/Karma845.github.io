<h3>Chapter 55 - Villager A Participates in the Summer Festival of the Elves.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning, we decided to take a look around the Elf village, which was in the midst of its once-in-a-decade festival. Yesterday it was too dark to make out much, but the houses in the village were colourfully decorated with many flowers and ornaments, and the atmosphere was very festive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just in case you&#8217;re wondering, I slept in a different room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though that pervert was egging me on, I put up with it and didn&#8217;t crawl out of bed at night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I don&#8217;t want Anna to think badly of me, Maybe she likes me as a person of the opposite sex. Unless, of course, I&#8217;m being conceited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, if I crossed the line, there was no taking it back. I&#8217;m not sure I can stop myself if I go that far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And if you ask me if Anna will leave everything behind and come with me when that happens, the answer is definitely no. Watching Anna so far, I&#8217;m certain about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, from the time she woke up in the morning and was eating breakfast, something was wrong with Anna. She was kind of awkward, or something like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Did something happen?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I walked down the street with Anna, she said whatever she wanted to me, but I just replied appropriately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, is that the girl Allen-san&#8217;s..?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Anna-sama is my precious lady.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s not something I would deny.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, isn&#8217;t she quite beautiful?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, surprisingly, Allen was the type to choose by face.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He didn&#8217;t even look at the elves in the village.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Come on, how about it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t choose her because of her face, but I don&#8217;t think she would believe me if I told her that I fell in love with Anna&#8217;s inner being. Besides, it was a little embarrassing to mention it when Anna was standing next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But then you have to protect the girl. Here, the girl there. Come here.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna looked dubious when she was called, but the young beautiful elf woman &#8211; who must have been over 400 years old &#8211; led her into a building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And soon, she came out with a crown of flowers on her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s? Oh, Anna-sama. It suits you very well.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh, thank you, Allen. And, umm, this is?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That, you see, is the requirement for a man and a woman to be together at this festival. The boy desperately protects the girl he falls in love with, and the girl who gets protected and keeps the crown intact until the end gives it to the boy she loves in front of the spirits, who will then bless the girl with their blessing and the boy and girl will be married.&#8221; (T/N:- Finally, the trap of the festival.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey! I didn&#8217;t know there was an event like that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There are five couples participating this year. By the way, don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;ll only throw fruit at you. Now, get to the central square!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that, Allen. Will you protect me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s! Of course.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was completely fooled. No one told me it was such an event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even fruits can lead to injuries, depending on where it hits. If I were to leave Anna with a swollen face, it would be a serious matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I made up my mind.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when we got to the central square, the other four groups had already gathered. As typical of elves, beautiful male and female were gathered there. They seemed to be couples, regardless of age, ranging from 40 years old at the bottom to 500 years old at the top.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the beautiful music reverberated, and we danced to it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if it&#8217;s called dancing, I just moved my feet as Anna told me to, so I guess I wasn&#8217;t really dancing, but I guess I looked like I was trying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the thought of Anna in my arms, and the soft, pleasant smell of Anna that I suddenly felt, made my heart race.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do you know how I feel right now, can I protect Anna from fruits? The event began. If I can protect Anna for one hour, we will win.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the gongs rang and signalled the start of the attack, the other four groups suddenly started running at high speed using magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a yelp of surprise, but immediately fruit came flying from Anna&#8217;s blind spot at a tremendous speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna-sama! Excuse me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly knocked it off, and in a panic, I picked Anna up by her side and ran off at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen! This is!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna, looking flustered, protests in my arms, but I&#8217;m in no position to say anything about that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna-sama! We have to run.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, this time, water spears came flying at us, blocking our way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey! Wait! I thought fruit was the only thing you threw at us!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;As long as you don&#8217;t get hurt or break things, anything goes!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The elf who seemed to have thrown the water magic told me so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, I will also!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I created a smokescreen and started running before it disappeared. Then I ran through the village and hid behind a building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ha~a ha~a ha~a, did we manage to shake them off?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh. That, Allen&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my arms, Anna is staring at me, blushing in embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ugh, so cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stared at Anna like that and froze at her foul cuteness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-Hey, Allen? Well, umm, I-I can walk on my own.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, I-I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said that, I hurriedly set Anna down and let her stand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And, umm, thank you. F-For saving me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, me too, that, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, umm, well, sorry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s, w-wasn&#8217;t I heavy?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna says something like that to me with her face turning bright red. (T/N:- cuteness overdosed.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Were you aiming for that? Could it be that Anna is doing that in order to destroy my reason?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was so destructive that such an impossible thought passed through my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a deep breath to calm myself down and resisted the urge to push her down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, Anna-sama, Anna-sama is so light that it&#8217;s okay for hours.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-How many hours will you!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Anna panicked and shouted out. I looked around to see if her voice had caught any attention.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, out of the corner of my eye, there was the figure of the pervert with a grin and a nasty smile on his face. And for some reason, the other spirits are gathering one after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No-No way?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Whoa, whoa, whoa! I heard that. I heard that!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he said that, that pervert suddenly gestured and made fun of me by imitating us while acting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8221; &#8216;Honey, wasn&#8217;t I heavy?&#8217; &#8216;Oh, my angel, you&#8217;re so light. I could take you like this and keep running for 100 years!&#8217; &#8216;Oh, honey, that&#8217;s wonderful.&#8217; &#8220;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the countless spirits that had gathered around the pervert imitated his gestures and performed the action in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-That!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;H-Hey, Allen! The elves are!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was told by Anna and looked around, I saw a group of grinning elves approaching us with the fruit of their choice in their hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s run away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled Anna&#8217;s hand and rushed away from the spot.</span></p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
