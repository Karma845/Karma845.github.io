<h3>Chapter 67 - Villager A Infiltrates the Imperial Capital.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man who kidnapped Anna has escaped to the imperial capital. Melissa-chan was the one who informed me of this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At night, when I saw Melissa-chan&#8217;s face in the window of my room in the fort where I was sleeping, my heart almost stopped for a moment, but I soon realized that it was about Anna and calmed down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I thanked Melissa-chan, I went outside, took out my Buitor Rev., and soared into the sky in a vertical takeoff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, what are you going to do?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No matter what, I&#8217;ll bring her back!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh, good grief. Okay. We&#8217;ll help you too.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan, who was able to keep up with the speed of the Buitor Rev., said so without hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? But you&#8217;ve helped me enough already.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Allen-san is kind of in a hurry right now, so I can&#8217;t leave you alone. Generally, Allen-san always thinks about others. You could have left Jerry alone. Also, you didn&#8217;t have to tell us about the weird pink girl&#8217;s attack, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So, the fact that she was so weak even when Allen-san went out of his way to say so might be because that pink girl was someone you know and was weak because you had a hand in it, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, I can&#8217;t say I had anything to do with it. There&#8217;s no doubt that a lot of things went wrong because I won that duel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s just the way it turned out, apart from me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, jeez. Just let me help you. In the first place, I want all those people who took away Allen-san&#8217;s partner to be destroyed!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Thank you, but don&#8217;t overdo it, okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Melissa-chan&#8217;s expression turned into a smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A, a, a, Allen-san!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Jerome flew up to me at a very fast speed and came alongside us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I, I-I&#8217;ve heard it. Leave it to me! Empire? No, I&#8217;ll destroy it!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m saying. If we attack indiscriminately, we might hit Anna, so no. We&#8217;ll have to sneak in and gather information first.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, then if it doesn&#8217;t hit her, is it okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, if it&#8217;s never gonna hit, then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. Leave it to me!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He waves his tail as he flies. This habit of Jerome&#8217;s has not changed even now. Jerome, who was such a slacker back then, seems so reliable now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In the meantime, I&#8217;ll sneak in and look for her. Melissa-chan and Jerome, you&#8217;ll be my diversion during the escape.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Leave it to me. Also, Allen-san&#8217;s partner is in the biggest building in the middle of the Imperial City.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How can you tell?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it obvious? We&#8217;re Sky Dragons. We&#8217;ve smelled and remembered her scent, you know? So, we can tell where she is right away.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu. What do you think? Aren&#8217;t you glad we&#8217;re in this together?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, yes, thank you very much!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, with my two trusty companions, I continued to fly toward the imperial capital of the Est Empire, relying on the starlight.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so we arrived in the skies above the Imperial City under the cover of darkness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to reach this point in the dark without Melissa-chan and Jerome&#8217;s guidance.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Really, I&#8217;ve been blessed with good friends.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, looking down, the streetlights on the main street are lit even at night, and the lights are leaking from the windows of the palace and large buildings in the centre of town.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it&#8217;s quite prosperous.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m gonna give it a shot.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I process a bottle of gasoline and drop it indiscriminately near the palace. And this time, the fire came out in one shot. The sudden explosion and blaze near the palace have created a beehive-like commotion in the area.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I think we&#8217;re good to go, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I land in the backyard of the palace, where security is thin. Then I buried Buitor Rev. under the ground using </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Alchemy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> and hid it from view.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, good luck with that! The scent of your beloved girl is coming from that building. But even though it&#8217;s so close, it&#8217;s so weak that it might be deep inside the building.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand, thank you!&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I Immediately used </span><span style="font-weight: 400">【</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Concealment</span><span style="font-weight: 400">】</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> to hide and ran to the building that Melissa-chan pointed to.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After watching me, Melissa-chan flew to the sky.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I entered the building and looked for the entrance to the basement, but I couldn&#8217;t find anything that looked like it.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I&#8217;m looking for the entrance to the basement is that I guessed it from what Melissa-chan said.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, Melissa-chan said that she senses by &#8216;scent&#8217;.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it should not be possible to tell where we are just by the scent we think of.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how sensitive your nose is, there&#8217;s no way you can tell immediately from tens of kilometres away, considering the wind and other scents mixed in.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I recall, even the elephant, which was famous for having the best nose, had a level of a few kilometres when the wind was favourable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess that the Sky Dragon calls something else &#8216;scent&#8217;, not what we humans call scent, such as magical power. And using their nose to detect it, they chased after Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the fact that the &#8216;scent&#8217; fades when you are in the back of the building means that it is separated by thick stones like this palace.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because, as you can see from what happened in Cardassia, I was sleeping in a stone room, and I was discovered in one shot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, a single pane of glass won&#8217;t dampen the &#8216;scent&#8217;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, these buildings usually have windows in the rooms, and as far as I could see from the sky, this building has a courtyard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that case, there is no other choice than the basement, where the ceiling and all four walls are surrounded by thick stone or earth, and there are no windows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna, please be safe!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While praying, I continued to search hard.</span></p>
