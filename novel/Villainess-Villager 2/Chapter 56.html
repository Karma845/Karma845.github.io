<h3>Chapter 56 - Villager A with Villainess&#8230;&#8230; </h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, the elf village was in turmoil from top to bottom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Spirit of Light blessed a human woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the once-in-a-decade summer festival, which is celebrated by all the villagers, there was not a soul who didn&#8217;t know what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this one case, Anna was completely recognized and accepted by the elves of the village. That much was good, but &#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Congratulations to Allen-sama and Anastasia-san.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her Majesty congratulates us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm, hmm, nevertheless, you&#8217;re a good couple, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san, too. We&#8217;re not married, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;Congratulations!&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, as you can see, Anna and I are now fully treated as husband and wife. I found out later that the event was, in essence, like an elf wedding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Congratulations, Ｏ(≧▽≦)Ｏ)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, elves do not have the same concept of marriage as humans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If they get along with each other, they become partners and form a couple-like relationship, then if they don&#8217;t get along, they simply part ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it is said that this is not the case after the summer festival event and that participating in this event is an indication of one&#8217;s desire to have a child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I asked what those guys meant by mourning? It seems that the elves are having fun by deciding on such roles.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I heard that one of them has a partner and a child.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And since we jumped in and overcame such an event, the elves naturally thought we were very close.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when it comes to humans having children, it means married, thinking that we&#8217;re married, they are congratulating us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But let me say a few words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s so important, say it first!!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna spoke to me, who is like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen. I really like this village. The elves and the spirits all seem to be happy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;There is no royalty or nobility collecting taxes from the people and using the money to live a life of luxury for nothing. Everyone is equal.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why can&#8217;t humans be like this&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s expression looked terribly sad as she said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lively music rang around the bonfire as the elves and spirits danced and sang happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sheryl Laura-san, who is supposed to be the princess of the elven village, was dancing happily in the circle with others. There was no such thing as a status barrier you could find there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is simply one elf named Sheryl Laura.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What exactly is a king, and what exactly is an aristocrat?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is also a queen in the village of the elves. However, she doesn&#8217;t seem to make any decisions forcefully but rather acts as a mediator when something troublesome happens, or does something when an external enemy appears, which is rare.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is no such thing as a crown prince who uses his status to give orders.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But I suppose it&#8217;s still impossible for humans.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna mumbled sadly and rested her head against mine. I hold her shoulders and gently support her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen. Can I be just Anastasia here and not the Duchess of Ramslett?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feeling of loving, cherishing, and protection comes from my heart.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, will Allen be just Allen, not the commoner Allen?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna looks at me with moist eyes as if she is clinging to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but cover her lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That time seemed like an eternity. So&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">・</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Night falls in the village of Elves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is deep in a lost forest that humans can never enter. Once every 10 years, joyful music and dance are played to celebrate the birth of a new couple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that night, I and Anna &#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Ko tsukuri.)</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I woke up, I couldn&#8217;t feel anything in my left arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, that&#8217;s right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I think about the important existence, who is also the cause. She sleeps peacefully with my left arm as a pillow, and I feel two conflicting emotions: the desire to look at her forever and the feeling that it&#8217;s too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was struggling with this, and wondering if I should wake her up, Anna woke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment her eyes met mine, she turned bright red and then tended to look down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good morning, Anna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;G-Good morning, Allen&#8230;.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After she replied, Anna fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Um, Anna. Wake up?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, umm, yeah, I need to get dressed.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- best wishes to the future life. （ ^_^）o自自o（^_^ ）)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Anna got up from the bed and slowly walked towards her luggage with an awkward gait as if she was protecting something that was not typical of Anna.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I came with Anna to a beautiful fountain on the outskirts of the village.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the fountain filled with clear water, various flowers are in full bloom, and the spirits are flying around it, creating a very mysterious atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of all this, I muster up the courage to open my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, you see?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, you know, about yesterday.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I said that vermillion bled into Anna&#8217;s face at once.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha? Don&#8217;t apologize to me now, okay? I&#8230;.I&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shake my head and kneel down to Anna, who says this in a panicked manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna. I don&#8217;t know when it&#8217;s going to happen, but I&#8217;m going to make sure that I&#8217;m recognized by the Duke so that I can come to pick up Anna. And I will protect you forever. So, please marry me, even though the order is reversed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said so and held out the『Substitute ring』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna alternately looked at my face and the ring I offered her, and then she started to shed tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Yes!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she said that, I gently slipped the 『Substitute ring』 on her left ring finger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Yesssss, Allen is fully determined, Now the world will see his true strength.)</span></p>
