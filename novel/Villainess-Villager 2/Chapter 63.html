<h3>Chapter 63 - Villager A Asks for Help.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back to my mother&#8217;s home in my military uniform and explained what had happened. This was the first time I explained to my mother about my relationship with Anna, and she gave me a response I hadn&#8217;t expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I knew it. It was the beginning of summer vacation, wasn&#8217;t it? You seemed more mature or softer, something like that. I don&#8217;t really want Allen to go to war, but the girl you like is a Duchess. It can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mother then gave me a lonely and happy, complex look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about your mother, do your best to fulfil your promise with Anastasia. Never make a mistake in the order thinking &#8216;who&#8217;s important,&#8217; okay?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, she sent me on my way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Don&#8217;t get the order wrong. Those words pierced my heart deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I can&#8217;t stop thinking about my mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that&#8217;s why I couldn&#8217;t tell her. I couldn&#8217;t tell her that Anna had been kidnapped and was missing.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I came to the Valley of the Flying Dragon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? Allen-san, you came again. What&#8217;s the matter? Hmm? What happened to your beloved girl today?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Actually……&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I explained to Melissa-chan and Jerome what had happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What the hell is that? I can&#8217;t forgive him! Then I should just kill that Crown Prince guy, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, no, no, Melissa-chan. We have to kill every single person in that place called the royal capital.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, you shouldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The suggestion to slay the Crown Prince is slightly heartening, but not so much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it because my family lives in the royal capital. And if you attack both the royal capital and the crown prince, there will be a bounty on your head, and I will have to fight you, so no! Instead, I want you to find Anna.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Well, I don&#8217;t like the idea of fighting you either. So we&#8217;ll just find your beloved girl, is that it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, please. I&#8217;m going straight to the war.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Melissa-chan said as if she was amazed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good grief. Don&#8217;t people usually need our help in that war?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;T-Th-Tha-That&#8217;s what I like about you, Allen-san.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;War should be done by us human beings who are stupid.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said this self-deprecatingly, but Melissa-chan and Jerome looked at me curiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;All right. Leave your beloved girl to us. I remember her smell. Come on, Jerry, let&#8217;s go, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Yeah. A-Allen-san. Leave it to me. D-Don&#8217;t feel like you&#8217;re on a mud boat, okay.&#8221; (T/N:- Here mud boat means it&#8217;s made of mud. It&#8217;s a reference to the folk legend called Kachikachiyama.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, oh.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How goofy, I thought, but was it better to plunge into a large ship?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s thinking.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was thinking this, both Melissa and Jerome soared into the sky to fulfil their promise to me and soon disappeared from sight.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I flew at full speed to Bruseni. It&#8217;s a basin surrounded by mountains on all sides. Even though it is a basin, it is quite large and fertile, with lakes and rivers running through.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Centraren Kingdom and the Est Empire have been fighting over this fertile land, and before this war began, they had been sharing it equally. However, while the Est Empire was well-prepared, our Centraren Kingdom was always on the back foot, so we were unable to respond to the sudden declaration of war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You might think, &#8216;What is the military doing guarding the borders of a war zone?&#8217; But to be honest, I think it would be cruel to ask them to take responsibility for that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, the enemy had taken their time to prepare, had increased their rations, weapons, and manpower, and then declared war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Sebastian-san told me that the border patrol had repeatedly warned and requested reinforcements from the top brass.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite this, the leaders of the royal capital only warned the Est Empire and did not allow the troops to increase themselves or even renew their equipment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, they did not take it easy on the other party&#8217;s provocation but took a mature approach and resolved the issue through discussion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I thought, &#8216;That sounds like the Japan of the past,&#8217; but history is full of examples of such responses leading to war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, war is only one of the means of diplomacy. If it is in the best interest of your country to talk, you talk. If it is in the best interest of your country to go to war, you go to war.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s just that it&#8217;s fundamentally wrong to assume from the start that you won&#8217;t be attacked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? When I think about it, I&#8217;m not sure why I&#8217;m so obsessed with this country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, well, for now, let&#8217;s do our best to fulfil my promise with Anna and end this war with a victory, to prevent the destruction of the royal capital.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I landed near a fort with the flag of the Centraren Kingdom, then pulled Buitor by the rope to the front of the fort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The flag of the Duke of Ramslett? Who the hell are you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soldier guarding the fort stops me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My name is Allen. I&#8217;m a B-rank adventurer under the protection of the Duke of Ramslett. And I have been ordered by the King to destroy the Est army here in Bruseni.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In order to avoid being lambasted, I dared to speak roughly and showed him the order. The order contains all the words that I extracted from the King at that time, and of course, the Jade Seal is stamped on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Th-This is His Majesty&#8217;s! And after all, the Duke of Ramslett hasn&#8217;t abandoned Centraren!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It would be reassuring if the Duke of Ramslett would also fight for Centraren!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m here on the Duke&#8217;s orders, but it seems that they&#8217;re relieved to know that the Duke of Ramslett is on their side.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, the Duchy of Ramsaret is the largest wheat-producing region in the country, and naturally has a great influence on its distribution.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the Duke of Ramslett turns his back on them in this situation, it means that food will be much harder to come by.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the bigwigs in the capital can afford to pay high prices so they don&#8217;t starve, but it goes without saying that the poorer you are, the harder it gets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you think about it, that may be the reason why the royal capital was so easily attacked and overthrown in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, what would have happened if the chaos caused by the idiots who tried to execute the Duke of Ramslett en masse and fish for their concessions, led to the unsatisfactory supply of food to the military?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Doesn&#8217;t that explain a lot?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- probably the strategy of the Est Empire)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it doesn&#8217;t matter now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, I&#8217;m going to boost the morale. Tell me where to clean off.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, the man on guard shook his face.</span></p>
