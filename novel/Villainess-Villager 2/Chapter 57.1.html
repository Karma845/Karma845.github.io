<h3>Chapter 57.1 - Anastasia (6) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is this a dream?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been taught manners and etiquette since I was eight years old, and had been raised to be a Queen. So it was impossible for me to fall in love. No matter how much I dislike it, no matter how much I am ostracized, I have lived on the blood of my people, and I have a duty to devote myself to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I never dreamed that I would have any feelings of love in me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s how it was, that I could be like this with the man I fell in love with!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s really, really like a dream&#8230;&#8230;!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ex-excuse me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, I was really surprised that Allen was so well accepted by the elves, who were supposed to be very wary of humans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How far did he go to earn this much trust?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, Her Highness herself had come to the dangerous world of humans to invite Allen to the once-in-a-decade summer festival of the elves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure the elves want Allen to settle in this village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure Her Highness also&#8230;..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, forgive me for being Allen&#8217;s partner in such an important ceremony, and Allen also did a great job protecting me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, not only did the spirits bless me, but I was also blessed with the holy blessing by the spirit of light, Rho-sama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my surprise, the spirit of light, Rho-sama, is connected to that selfless sage, Loringus-sama.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking of Loringus-sama, he was a great sage who gave up his personal fortune to establish many orphanages for young children. He was also famous for being one of the world&#8217;s foremost experts in magic, having mastered all kinds of magic and being able to cast spells without chanting. Even today, many people adore and respect Loringus-sama. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was one of those people, and when I read the biography of Loringus-sama, I was moved by his noble deeds and wished I could be like him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, I have met Loringus-sama, who was my mother&#8217;s magic teacher, only once when I was young, and I can still recall that moment vividly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Loringus-sama watched over me as a young child with his kind and warm eyes. His gaze, in particular, was very, very strong and left a lasting impression on me. (T/N:- No Anna-san, that is a pervert ogling you.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps Rho-sama is a spirit born from the earnest wish of Loringus-sama, trapped in the Lost Forest, to save the children. (T/N:- Nope, that&#8217;s a pervert unable to leave behind its desire.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Rho-sama blessed my love for Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I will stop killing myself from now on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To me, the village of the elves seemed like an ideal society. The people who live in the village cooperate with each other and do what they can to help. There was no such thing as nobility or status. Every one of them is here as a simple elf.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to build such a future with Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I can&#8217;t think of that happening now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be impossible to do so unless we were to leave everything behind and elope to the elf village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, there is no doubt that my value as a pawn in a political marriage has been greatly diminished since I broke off my engagement to His Highness the Crown Prince. Since I had broken off the engagement that had lasted for so long, even if I had not been at fault, it would be quite difficult for me to marry as a queen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For this reason, my father would probably expect me to marry into a noble family that is lower in rank but more powerful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, if Allen and I were to elope together, I don&#8217;t know what my father would do, and I&#8217;m sure Allen also wouldn&#8217;t want that either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, Allen had promised me. He said he would come for me, no matter how long it&#8217;ll take.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t my role as his, umm, wi-wife, to wait for him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But such a happy time will come to an end when I return to the royal capital. I feel as if the time I&#8217;ve spent so far is like a dream, and I&#8217;m being pulled back to boring reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is frustrating, but I understood just a little bit how the crown prince felt when he fell for that woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then after Allen drove me back to the royal residence, I was strongly reprimanded by my father. I was only chided for the fairy hair ornament that the Queen of Elves had given me, but I was scolded heavily for the ring on my left hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I would never take off this ring, no matter what anyone says. This was partly because Allen had told me that I didn&#8217;t need to take it off, but also because it was my will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, even my foolish mind can see that it would have been easier to hide it from unnecessary scrutiny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was the ring that the man I loved had put on my left ring finger with the most beautiful proposal. I just couldn&#8217;t bring myself to remove this precious token.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, as expected, Allen was summoned by my father. I don&#8217;t know what his intentions were, but my mother told me to watch the discussion from a hidden room, and she took me into the hidden room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What I had expected to be a one-sided condemnation turned out to be something completely different from what I had imagined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the beginning, Allen was being scolded unilaterally by my father, but halfway through, the flow of the wind changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was especially surprised when I learned that this ring I was given was an epic-grade magic tool from the Wind Mountain Dungeon and that it was something that royalty and nobility, fearing assassination, sought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it bluntly, it&#8217;s extraordinary. It&#8217;s the kind of thing that might get you a knighthood just for offering this ring.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How far did Allen envision?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this short time, the man I love has forced my father to grant almost all of his requests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears streamed down my cheeks, and my mother hugged me gently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mother, I&#8217;m already&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, my mother hugged me kindly and tightly.</span></p>
