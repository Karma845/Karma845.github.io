<h3>Chapter 42 - Villager A Dedicates a Victory.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Imp-Impossible&#8230;!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince&#8217;s eyes widened as if he could not understand what was happening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, when he managed to get back up, he complained to me about something that made no sense to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, eii (T/N:- getting up sound). Don&#8217;t rely on the power of dubious magic tools! Fight openly with swords and magical powers without doing cowardly things.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Pfft. Your Highness, what are you talking about? The first rule we agreed on is that anything goes, right? And if I&#8217;m a coward, aren&#8217;t Your Highnesses, and the others cowards, for trying to win with a 5 to 1 advantage?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said 5 to 1, the Crown Prince bit his lips with regret.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Furthermore, what about trying to force Anastasia to admit her false charges by surrounding her with five, no six people, while in a powerful position as the Crown Prince? Anastasia-sama was Your Highness&#8217;s fianc√©e, and because of your status, she couldn&#8217;t go against you. If you don&#8217;t call this cowardice, what can you call it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s, she was&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince mumbled, apparently realizing that he was wrong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;She was? What did Anastasia-sama do? She didn&#8217;t do anything, did she? These are all accusations with no evidence! If you&#8217;re going to say that, what about the fact that you kicked out Anastasia-sama, who had made so many things for you people at the last minute, the day before the festival? Besides, there was so much difference in the content and quality of the displays that it was obvious how much of it was Anastasia-sama&#8217;s work, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That woman! To Amy!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince raised his voice when I berated him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, not again. Please don&#8217;t give me any unsightly excuses. Anastasia-sama didn&#8217;t harass Amy-sama. She was just giving her a legitimate complaint! Moreover, Anastasia-sama, the duchess, took the trouble to lecture Amy-sama, the baroness.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince glared at me in frustration as I said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You know what? If you, the next king, is like this, the Kingdom will get destroyed. The first to be killed will be us, commoners! You, the Crown Prince, should know what it means to marry Anastasia-sama!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Sh-Shut up!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you turned away the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s support, then a civil war would only wait for us. Even though it was an engagement to prevent that from happening, you went on poking your head over one girl!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The crown prince turned red and looked down, then looked up and glared at me as if he had made up his mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! What would a mere commoner with no responsibility know! As a royal family! As a Crown Prince! I was always expected to do my part! No one ever saw me for who I was! It&#8217;s the same with that woman. I am always being forced to be the Crown Prince, the next king, and so on!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh, is that so? It was hard.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave him a barbed answer. However, the Crown Prince didn&#8217;t seem to mind and continued to spout his reasoning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But Amy was different. She saw me for who I was, even though I hadn&#8217;t said a word! She told me that it was okay to be me, that it was okay to be who I was! She smiled at me! What I liked, what food I liked, where I liked to go as if she knew it all! She was thinking the same thing even though I hadn&#8217;t said anything! That&#8217;s right. She&#8217;s the one! That&#8217;s why! That&#8217;s why!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. Amy, who is familiar with the setting of the crown prince, has played accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why he blindly fell in love with Amy, who affirmed him unconditionally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you know what? Isn&#8217;t that what you want from a mother, not from a lover?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, Okay. But did you know how much Anastasia has killed herself and done everything for you? And yet you&#8217;re so selfish and self-centered like a little kid who thinks he&#8217;s saying something good but has nothing to say!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! I!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince&#8217;s face turned bright red, and he yelled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What is it?  Did it stab so badly that you can&#8217;t even argue?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Shut up! What do you know when you&#8217;re a commoner with no responsibilities! I didn&#8217;t want to be born into the royal family!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? So you&#8217;re saying you wish you were born a commoner?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It must be so much easier to live like a commoner, protected and guided by us royalty. And you get to be with the woman you love!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I got pissed off from this outburst. I&#8217;m aware that I&#8217;ve said some pretty outrageous things until now, but I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore, and without thinking about breaking it down, I just said it back out of emotion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s bullshit! What makes being a commoner easy! Can you work every day from the age of eight years old? Hard physical labour, covered in filth and stench! And what you earn is only 1,000 cents a day doing it! Do you have any idea how we feel when we&#8217;re starving on a few scraggly vegetables, a handful of dried meat, and a bit of blanched, hard, unchewable bread? Don&#8217;t be so naive!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh. Shut up! You lowly commoner! Shut up!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph. And now you&#8217;re going to use your status as a shield to order me around? Before that, do you remember what you said?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I say that back to him, he glares at me with hateful eyes with a bright red face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Generally. If you want to be a commoner so badly, why don&#8217;t you elope with Amy-sama? Then you can live as a commoner, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha! Do something like that!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that the Crown Prince broke down. Apparently, he was not prepared to go that far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is so spoiled that it&#8217;s repulsive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed deeply and said in an admonishing tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you can&#8217;t even do that, then Your Highness will be dealing with Anastasia-sama. It may be too late, though.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the Crown Prince&#8217;s face turned red, and he shouted, tears welling up in his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, shut up! Shut up!  Someone like you! To someone like you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the crown prince chanted oversized flame magic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is probably the extreme flame magic that the Crown Prince used at the end of the game to cleave the whole area together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has helped me a lot in the game, but it&#8217;s not the kind of magic one should use in a place like this. If he uses this kind of magic here, it would cause a lot of damage to the judges and the audience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems the Crown Prince is so fixated on winning that he has forgotten about such things. In the first place, at the current level, the crown prince should not be able to use it yet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Y-Your Highness! That magic is still too much for His Highness!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The teachers, who were watching the duel, tried to stop him, but the Crown Prince didn&#8217;t seem to listen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;To make Amy win, I will! I will!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that&#8217;s not what I was talking about, I was the one who went off topic and gave a lecture, but the purpose of this was to ask you to apologize to the Duke of Ramslett in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked at him with that in mind, the Crown Prince&#8217;s flame magic went out of control as expected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His Highness!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia hurriedly tried to deploy her ice magic, but I stopped her with a gesture. Then, I cast the wind magic without chanting and blew up the flame magic of His Highness into the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Phew, thank God this training ground is outdoors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the crown prince then passed out due to the depletion of his magical power.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Alle &#8230; n?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear Anastasia&#8217;s confused voice, but instead of answering her, I put my dagger to the crown prince&#8217;s neck and stare at the witness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;His, His Highness Karlheinz is unable to fight. Therefore, it&#8217;s Allen&#8217;s victory.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I bowed and grinned at Amy. She gave me a wry look and then fell to her knees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned back and walked over to Anastasia, then knelt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I dedicate this victory to Anastasia-sama.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tha-Thank you, but more than that.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia glanced over at the crown prince with a worried expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I didn&#8217;t kill anyone. His Highness just used up all his magic power, so he shouldn&#8217;t be in any danger of death. The magic flames that went out of control were all blown upwards by my wind magic, so there should be few injuries. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll wake up after he sleeps for a while and recovers his magic power.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is, is that so.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia looked relieved when she heard that. Even at a time like this she couldn‚Äôt help but think about her kingdom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But how did that stupid Crown Prince fall for that woman when he had such a wonderful fianc√©e?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see. Because he was an idiot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But this would be the end of what I could do. Now that I&#8217;ve beaten the Crown Prince in a duel, the powerful nobles won&#8217;t leave me alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, I lost my temper and lashed out at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d like them to at least forgive me from execution &#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, Anastasia-sama, I&#8217;ll be going now. Thank you very much for everything. And thank you, Margaret-sama and Isabella-sama. It&#8217;s a little regrettable, but I&#8217;ll leave you now.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Allen!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said goodbye, I headed back to my room in the dorm.</span></p>
