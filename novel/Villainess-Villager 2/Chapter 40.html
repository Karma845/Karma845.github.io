<h3>Chapter 40 - Villager A Becomes the Representative.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the buzzing banquet hall, the guests reacted in different ways: some looked at me curiously, some raised their eyebrows, and some were whispering to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, the students and teachers looked on in stunned amazement at the sudden engagement cancellation and duelling application.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You are &#8230; the commoner from that time, right?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of all this, Anastasia and the Crown Prince react, respectively. Anastasia looks surprised like a pigeon that got hit by a peashooter, but isn&#8217;t the Crown Prince&#8217;s dubious face and those lines too much?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good grief, I&#8217;m still in the same class as His Highness, though. Rather than that, Anastasia-sama, please acknowledge me as your representative.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Ah, um, I acknowledge it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Anastasia was surprised, I quickly got her to acknowledge it and swiftly moved on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And? What do you demand of each other in this duel? What about you, Anastasia-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-I have decided already. Take back the insult to the Ramslett family and apologize.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay, then what about Amy-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Umm&#8230; Don&#8217;t come near us anymore.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, that is the exact same line of the game. Jeez. (T/N:- Does she believe that if she does the same things everything will be on track?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Okay. Then, if Anastasia-sama wins, Amy-sama and the others will admit that their earlier remarks about the Ramslett family were insulting and will formally apologize. And, if Amy-sama wins, (T/N:-&#8216;which will not happen&#8217; is what Allen is thinking.) Anastasia-sama will stay away from Amy-sama, is that correct?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not it. You will stay away from Amy and the five of us.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I understand. Then let&#8217;s do it that way.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the time being, let&#8217;s finish the condition confirmation in a clerical manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about the format of the duel?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;ve got one. Get me four more proxies. If you can&#8217;t, we can match it one-on-one every day, and you have to win five matches in a row.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince looks down on me, or rather us, as he says this. It seems that he doesn&#8217;t feel like lynching us five to one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, maybe he is just making fun of us, thinking himself to be the superior one here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, that will be a bother, so can I have all five of you come at me at once? How about one against five, and anything goes except killing?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Claude reacts to those words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oi, oi, oi, you think you can fight us and win? You, with your mediocre swordsmanship and magic?&#8221; (T/N:- Listening to this, somehow I get the feeling that the role of bandit will suit him more than that of a prince.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So that&#8217;s how you react. Then it&#8217;s just right. Since it will be the last time anyway, let&#8217;s stir things up as hard as I can.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The angrier they are, the easier it is for me to do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Your Highness Claude. By any chance, are you scared of me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, Claude&#8217;s tone intensified. If it were manga or anime, there would probably be an anger mark on his forehead. (T/N:- Well, it&#8217;s a web novel though.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, please calm down. But Prince Claude is right, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While conciliating Claude, Markus began to admonish me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You are no match for me or His Highness in magic, and also in swordsmanship, Leo, His Highness, or Prince Claude are superior to you. In addition, we also have Oscar, who is an expert archer. You have no chance against us. I admire your courage in coming forward to duel, but you&#8217;ve done enough. We won&#8217;t say anything bad, so back off.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, if you didn&#8217;t know me properly, you would probably come to that conclusion, and at first glance, it seems like a good argument, but this is a terrible way of phrasing it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;ll get angry. What is necessary now is to have the other party lose their composure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want to avoid any unnecessary interventions that will mess it up. So before that happens, I have to end the duel quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why even though I have nothing against Markus, I&#8217;m going to provoke him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? I can&#8217;t be persuaded by someone who keeps losing to a commoner like me, in studies, can I? Markus-sama?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! Even though I was thinking of your own good!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stirred him up, I got a funny reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does he have a low tolerance for agitation, to begin with, or is it that he can&#8217;t stand being agitated by an entity that looks down on him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Either way, this low boiling point will probably disqualify him from being the future prime minister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You&#8217;re not smart, are you? As expected, if you&#8217;re a commoner, you can&#8217;t help but be savage, can you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Do aristocrats only have honours? Ah, but many nobles don&#8217;t have it, so Oscar-sama and the others are in which group? Also, I think it&#8217;s more barbaric to surround a woman and neglect her as a fianc√©e. Isn&#8217;t it? In addition, when it comes to men flocking around one woman, I believe bees are also like that, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oscar distorted his stunning face. Then Leonardo came at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Such foolish talk is unbearable to hear. Behave properly.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Even if you say so. You&#8217;re the ones who are making accusations. And the last time I saw you, you surrounded a woman and tried to force her to admit she was wrong. Even though you are the son of the knight captain, which one of us is stupid here? Leonardo-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow when I pressed their anger switch, they started reacting funnily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This may be interesting, but I feel that if I find enjoyment in this, it will be outrageously bad for my character, and I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll fall into self-loathing later, so let&#8217;s finish the story before I open any strange doors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Your Highness Crown Prince Karlheinz. Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re going to run away, even though it&#8217;s a very favourable condition of 1 to 5?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What!? You, argh&#8230;I understand. Okay. Don&#8217;t regret it if you die by mistake.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh? Are you declaring that you&#8217;re going to break the rule that forbids killing now?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230; Don&#8217;t you run away! Come to the training ground, now! Hey, someone witness this duel!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then I will do it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the Crown Prince said so, a middle-aged man stood up from the guest table. He was one of the men who had just laughed at Anastasia along with the Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Are you trying to cheat in the judgement also?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, okay. In that case, it&#8217;s just a matter of getting these guys back on track.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll wait for you at the training grounds first. Don&#8217;t run away!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Amy, the Crown Prince &amp; Co., and the middle-aged man strode away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, Anastasia-sama. I&#8217;ll go back to the dormitory and get my weapons, so please go to the training grounds first.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tell this to Anastasia, who is stunned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, by the way, the reason I don&#8217;t have weapons right now is that swords are not allowed inside the royal castle and the school is just a stone&#8217;s throw away from here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anastasia came to her senses at the sound of my voice and came at me with a menacing look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- Below is the most amusing conversation of this event. Really worth it!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;W-What foolish things are you saying! It&#8217;s not too late. I&#8217;m declining you as a representative. In this situation, no one will blame you. Besides, if anything happens to you in the duel, it will be treated as just an accident. I can&#8217;t let a man as talented as you die in a place like this!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? Are you worried about me by any chance? It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m not going to die. Or rather, if it&#8217;s an opponent like that, no matter how many people come, I&#8217;ll win no matter what.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha!? Allen &#8230;?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Have you heard? There is an adventurer in this royal capital who holds the record for the youngest C rank.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? Ah, hmm, I&#8217;ve heard that &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s me, you know. I&#8217;m the youngest C-rank adventurer who has traversed Goblin Dungeon with Goblin Slayer and Orcs Slayer achievements. I&#8217;ve also succeeded in defeating Blizzard Phoenix alone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221; </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the second time today, I could see Anastasia&#8217;s puzzled and dumbfounded expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt lonely when I realized that this was probably the last time I would see it. But I&#8217;ve prepared for this. I will give it everything I have and win this battle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So you should relax as you do in a big boat because I&#8217;m sure you will win this duel.&#8221;</span></p>
