<h3>Chapter 53.1 - Anastasia (4) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For our independent research, we decided to make a theme related to adventurers because Allen is also an adventurer and I want to improve his impression. But I didn&#8217;t expect that what was supposed to be just a visit to the adventurers guild would turn out to be this important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way to the adventurers guild, I thought, what His Highnesses and that woman are doing here when I saw them surrounding a person and threatening her. But, who would have thought, that person would be an acquaintance of Allen and the princess of an elf village?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Sheryl Laura-san suddenly hugged Allen, I was irresistibly angry and became aggressive, and for some reason, I felt terribly sad when Allen defended her from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, if other people found out that she was an elf, there would have been a huge commotion, and my action of suddenly trying to take off her hood in a fit of rage was definitely rude. So Allen&#8217;s action was right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, but! Even though I knew it was right, what is this feeling that makes me feel uncomfortable?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I can&#8217;t believe Allen was familiar with the elves. Isn&#8217;t he the only human in the world, let alone in this country who knew them? And what would happen to Allen if this were to become known?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, the wisest thing for me to do would be to pretend I hadn&#8217;t seen anything. That way, Allen and she could go on with their lives as before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I thought about ignoring it, Why did I say that I would go with him?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should&#8217;ve known that Allen won&#8217;t be able to refuse If I say so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, that&#8217;s right. The answer is simple.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thought that she knew secrets about Allen that I didn&#8217;t, it made me jealous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I thought that she would make memories again with the Allen I don&#8217;t know, for some reason, I couldn&#8217;t stay calm, and I wished that she would take me with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew it would be a nuisance to Allen if I said something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m the worst woman. Forcing him to submit by power, that&#8217;s exactly how I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Allen was able to fulfill my conceited selfishness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He took me out with a plausible reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, she called me his fiancée.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know it&#8217;s an expedient solution, but it&#8217;s still very embarrassing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to remember my engagement as much as possible because I have only painful memories of it. However, when I think of what it would have been like to be with Allen, why do I feel warm and fuzzy? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- (❁´◡`❁))</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, when I, who forced Allen, followed him, I ended up discovering more of his secrets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen had created a strange place deep in the forest northeast of the royal capital. And there, he used his mysterious skills to pull out a vehicle from the ground that looked like a cart, or a bird, or some other indescribably strange shape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And my body was tied to the vehicle so that it would stick to Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My chest was hitting Allen&#8217;s butts, and his waist was right in front of my face, which was extremely embarrassing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, those feelings got instantly blown away when this ride started moving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen used some kind of magic, and to my surprise, the vehicle floated up with a tremendous wind!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The vehicle was gaining altitude and accelerating, soaring high into the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amazing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The royal capital and the castle looked so small.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A-Allen! Amazing! It&#8217;s amazing! And fast! What on earth is happening?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was as excited as a child, but I suppose that can&#8217;t be helped, can it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve never heard of people flying in the sky. In fact, it is physically impossible for something so heavy to fly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heavy things go down, that&#8217;s common sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, here I am, actually flying!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking this, the castle was quickly moving away. Apparently, it would take about four hours to reach the elf village.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Travelling at this speed for four hours, perhaps we could cross the mountains to the north and get close to the border?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see, as I thought you are amazing, Allen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I lean back into Allen&#8217;s body and take a deep, slow breath. The smell of Allen filled the air, and for some reason, it made me feel very peaceful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the same time, a strange feeling came over me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I definitely don&#8217;t want to give this place away to another woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel bad for her, hanging by a rope, but if there&#8217;s another woman in this place, just the thought of it breaks my heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I see. For a long time, I have been&#8230;..</span></p>
