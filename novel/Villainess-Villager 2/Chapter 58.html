<h3>Chapter 58 - Villager A Revisits the Valley of Flying Dragons.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m enjoying my flight with Anna. Today, with only two days left of summer vacation, we are heading to the Valley of the Flying Dragons, the first time in a long time for me and the first for Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of things, but I&#8217;m still in the same relationship with Anna as before. It seems that the Duke has not found out that I crossed the line, and although I feel a twinge of guilt, no further problems have arisen so far.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way,&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to ask her a question that had been bothering me for a while, as it had become normal for us to not use honorifics when we were alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why is Anna&#8217;s tone like that? Somehow, the wording is different from that of a normal noble lady.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard Anna gasp behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;..so?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was told in a small voice, but I couldn&#8217;t hear it, so I asked back. Then, unexpected words came back to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Does Allen-sama prefer women who speak politely?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, what should I do? This still makes me feel very nervous, but even if she changes it now, it doesn&#8217;t feel strange.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No, I want to be easygoing with Anna, and I&#8217;m fine with the way she&#8217;s most comfortable talking. If you&#8217;re comfortable talking the way you normally talk, that&#8217;s fine, and if you&#8217;re comfortable talking the way you&#8217;re talking now, that&#8217;s fine too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;……Really?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna&#8217;s tone returned to normal. After all, the polite tone means that she is being cautious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like it or anything. It&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m wondering why you talked like that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, that is because I was engaged to his highness, wasn&#8217;t I? At that time, I had lived in the castle for a while as an apprentice. But for some reason, in addition to being an apprentice, I was also trained as a knight along with his highness.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? Why is that so?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, it has helped me hone my sword skills, and that in itself is not a problem. But His Highness wasn&#8217;t giving the necessary orders to the knights and maidservants in his service. So I had to clean up the mess and give orders on his behalf, but before I knew it, I had become their superior, and this way of speaking was completely ingrained in me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How? I have no idea what could have happened to make the situation like that, but it seems that Anna&#8217;s tone was originally caused by that Crown Prince.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? Perhaps, the Crown Prince&#8217;s character was fostered because he was spoiled like that?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah, but that&#8217;s not good if I become a mother with this tone, right?&#8221; (T/N: (⊙ˍ⊙))</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She told me something very terrifying. But if Anna thinks that way, maybe it&#8217;s simply a matter of having a chance.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, then. Let&#8217;s change things up a little bit after you marry me.&#8221;</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said that, Anna gulped and was silent for a moment. I can&#8217;t see her face, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s bright red.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Anna replied with a small &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and changed the subject.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;By the way, I&#8217;ve heard that the Valley of the Flying Dragons is a terrifying place with wyverns flying around. Are you sure it&#8217;s safe?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I have an acquaintance, so I think it&#8217;s okay, probably.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I answered that, Anna put her head on my waist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I trust you.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is such a sign from Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The wyverns looked a little surprised to see us on the Buitor, but they didn&#8217;t seem to be attacking us at all. If we were about to be attacked, I would do my best to turn around and switch to the land route, but it seems that they remember me properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As it is, I landed Buitor in front of the Temple of the Winds, in the square where Jerome had been sleeping before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I took Anna&#8217;s hand and escorted her into the Temple of the Winds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There they were, Jerome and Melissa, with their slightly, or maybe much, changed appearance. The colour of their scales and eyes hadn&#8217;t changed, but their bodies were much larger, and they looked much more fearless and cool. But she didn&#8217;t have a child as she did in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wha! That is a Sky Dragon!?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Jerome-kun, Melissa-chan.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To Anna&#8217;s surprise, I called out from the entrance, and Jerome came running toward me. Jerome, now a giant black sky dragon with a pair of wings, bowed to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A, a, a, Allen-san! I-It&#8217;s been a long time!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a sense of nostalgia and relief when I saw Jerome, who, unlike his cool new look, was still surprisingly low-key, but Anna&#8217;s eyes were wide with surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? Allen-san? It&#8217;s been a long time. What happened? Did you need any help?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike Jerome, Melissa, a beautiful white dragon with the appearance of a queen of the sky, moved her long neck and looked at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, I guess it&#8217;s a 50/50 thing. One, I came to see how you were doing. Did anyone attack you or anything?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm? Oh, by the way, I heard from the wyverns in the valley that a strange pink woman and her cronies attacked us while saying something incomprehensible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Was there any damage?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Somehow, I heard it was very weak. It only took a blow from the tail. Well, I had a recommendation from Allen-san. So I went on a little trip with my Jerry. It was fun.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. That&#8217;s good to know.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So what is it that you need help with? &#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not right now, though. I was just hoping you could help me in the future when she&#8217;s in some kind of crisis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa brought her face close to Anna&#8217;s, and Anna let out a small squeal and clung to my arm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Are you saying that this girl is Allen-san&#8217;s chosen one?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh. That&#8217;s right. I haven&#8217;t gotten her parent&#8217;s approval yet, but I&#8217;m gonna make sure I do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, dear, that&#8217;s good.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan said so with a grin. However, Jerome started saying mysterious things.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I-If it is A-Allen-san&#8217;s request&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan glared at Jerome.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You can&#8217;t just kill this girl&#8217;s parents or something, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh? If they don&#8217;t approve &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re still no good. You&#8217;re not ready to be a father yet, are you?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;u, un.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hmm? I don&#8217;t know how it happened, but it seems that Jerome has become very radicalized after not seeing him for a while. What on earth could have happened to him?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seems that even now and in the past he is still completely laid on Melissa&#8217;s back, so I am very relieved for some reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But from the way you&#8217;re talking now, does that mean that Jerome-kun is still a kid?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel sorry for you for that&#8230;&#8230;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s okay. Then, let me smell you to remember your scent.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, Melissa-chan brings her face closer and sniffs Anna. Jerome also sniffs Anna as if to imitate her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I understand. It&#8217;s none other than Allen-san&#8217;s request. I&#8217;ll help you protect your important person.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you. That&#8217;s very helpful, Melissa-chan.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufu, that&#8217;s okay. If you want to thank me, can you bring me some beef?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d say that, so I brought you some.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, I took out the beef and oak meat that I kept in my magic bag and handed it to Melissa-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh! As expected of Allen-san! You&#8217;re so thoughtful!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, Melissa-chan swallows the meat one after another deliciously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa-chan looked at me to which I nodded, and she quickly devoured the meat I had given her while Jerome looked on greedily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If you like it so much, I&#8217;ll bring more, whenever that may be.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh? Really? I&#8217;ll be waiting for you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Melissa replied happily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Jerome looks at me with greedy eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, Jerome-kun. You&#8217;re gonna do your best to hunt fresh prey and feed Melissa-chan so that she can have a baby with peace of mind, right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of you won&#8217;t be able to hunt while the eggs are warming up, isn&#8217;t that right?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or rather, if you want it, say it properly?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that in mind, I took out the meat I had prepared for Jerome from another magic bag and offered it to him. Jerome&#8217;s tail wagged as usual, and he happily took a bite of the meat.</span></p>
