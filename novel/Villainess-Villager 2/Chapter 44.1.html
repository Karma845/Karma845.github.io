<h3>Chapter 44.1 - Anastasia (3) - Side.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was upset that Allen had disappeared from the dormitory, so I hurried out with a carriage to the royal capital, even though it was already late at night. I wanted to see my father and ask him to help me find Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t accept a farewell like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And it should be me who should be responsible for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I arrived at our residence in the royal capital, I hurriedly ran to my father&#8217;s room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Father! Father! It&#8217;s Anastasia. Please! Please listen to me!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no courtesy. Such behaviour was disqualifying for a duchess. But I was in such a hurry that I didn&#8217;t care about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I was going to lose Allen, and I would never see him again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t stand the thought of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, what&#8217;s wrong? At a time like this. Weren&#8217;t you coming back tomorrow.?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was confused but somehow managed to explain what had happened today. And when he heard that I was forced to sign up for a duel, my father opened his mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. I&#8217;ve been hearing about this for a while now, and I&#8217;ve heard that he has become quite foolish, but I guess he has already reached that point. It&#8217;s going to be hard to keep this engagement going like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My father is still worried about the country, but it&#8217;s not about that. It&#8217;s about Allen now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not that! A classmate fought on my behalf, with the Crown Prince, Prince Claude, Markus, Oscar, and Leonardo! And&#8230; and won by defeating all of them! Oh, please, please save his life!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was silence for a few moments, and then my father made a surprised voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What! He won against 5 of them alone, did he?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. He is a genius that our country cannot afford to lose. Please! Please! I&#8217;ll do whatever I can! So please!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anna, calm down.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ah &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, my father calmed me down, and Sebas brought me some tea. It was the usual Earl Grey, my favourite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s not like Anna to be this distraught. Who in the world could have beaten those five? Aren&#8217;t they the five strongest people in that grade? There must have been no such man even in the upperclassmen, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That is a man named Allen, a scholarship student.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen? I see. So that&#8217;s who he is. If I remember, isn&#8217;t he a commoner adventurer?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. Sebas, what kind of a man is this Allen kid?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Allen is a boy who grew up in a mother-only family from here in the royal capital &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew he was looking into it. Sebas was revealing secrets about Allen that I didn&#8217;t know, one after another. I felt like I&#8217;m exposing his secrets, and it made me feel really bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. The youngest C-ranked adventurer in history, a Dungeon Traverser, and a Slayer of goblins and Orcs. That&#8217;s pretty impressive. On top of that, he&#8217;s not only the best student of the class but also the most gifted genius since the beginning of the school system.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right! And he has a serious and likeable personality. A-Allen was also hiding his abilities, it seems, as he was such a good magician who erases His Highness&#8217;s out-of-control magic with wind magic!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I actively appeal to my father about the good points of Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Indeed. With this, will Anna stop laughing at His Highness?&#8221; (T/N:- I didn&#8217;t get this one.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t understand what he meant and asked him back, but he just shook his head vaguely and didn&#8217;t answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, he asked me about my days in detail without giving me an answer and sent me back to my room. I was told that Sebas would visit him at his home tomorrow morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure Sebas will find Allen for me. I prayed as I fell asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the next day, Allen came to our residence in the royal capital with Sebas. I was told that the talk would not go calmly with me there, so I had to monitor the situation from the surveillance room with my mother and brother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved to see that Allen was all right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the meeting between Allen and my father begins with a bland talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even then, Allen was amazing. Usually, people would have shrunk under the weight of my father&#8217;s power and become a sycophant, but he didn&#8217;t seem to falter at all. Even when my father thanked him for fighting on my behalf, he didn&#8217;t say anything unnecessary.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s Allen, I&#8217;m sure my father will also like him very much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then my father cut into the main topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the words that came out of Allen&#8217;s mouth at that moment could only be described as shocking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, yesterday&#8217;s farewell was because he was prepared for getting expelled. But I would never admit that. There is no way I will accept it!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, I couldn&#8217;t help but smile when he told me that he respected me as a person for my dedication and hard work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I thought it was very typical of Allen to say that his status was different from mine, but at the same time, I felt disappointed, though I didn&#8217;t know why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the problem was beyond that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Allen tried to point out the possibility that if I lost and got expelled from the academy, there would be a struggle for the succession to the throne, and the Est Empire in the east would take advantage of the chaos to invade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a mess! How foolish I have been!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I marvelled at how reckless Allen was and felt ashamed of my narrow-mindedness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Originally, I should not have thrown the glove, no matter what His Highness had said. As a result, I have made Allen clean up my mess and ruined the future of this genius.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As an aristocrat, I was talking about big things, but in the end, I was not able to do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t laugh at His Highness. Those words that my father said to me last night pierced my heart deeply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tears flowed incessantly from my deeply regretful eyes, staining the skirt of my dress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the meeting ended with the Ramslett family promising to become the backer of Allen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was asked if I wanted to see Allen, but there was no way I could see him with such a swollen, tear-stained, and miserable face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother gently hugged me, as I shook my head slightly.</span></p>
