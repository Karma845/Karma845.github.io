<h3>Chapter 39.2 - Amy (1) - Side</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought that the final exam was surprisingly difficult and had a hard time completing it, but how did it become like this!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s okay that the nerd got a perfect score, but how did the villainess also get a perfect score?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was the villainess of the game, she should have dropped even more than the second place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, in the 3rd and 4th place there are Margaret and Isabella. Aren&#8217;t both of them the villainess&#8217;s entourage!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, Isabella is the idiot from class B, isn&#8217;t she? How can she be above me!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, damn it! This is the worst!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s okay. Today after this, the fun condemnation event will occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess acting as she pleases will come to an end today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come on. Today is your last!</span></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, as expected, Karl-sama is wonderful. Not only did he get awarded as the best student of the year, but also to call everyone on the stage and thank them one by one is amazing!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure he is the only one who can do this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used to play with his character in the game, but as expected this Karl-sama is really nice. I&#8217;ve fallen in love with him all over again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, He even called me to the stage and said, &#8216;I want you to stay by my side from now on&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I will die from this happiness.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;And there&#8217;s one more thing to declare here.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh? What is it? Will he propose to me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett, come forward.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah. That&#8217;s right. I was so happy that I got all excited, but, yes, that&#8217;s right. It seems the fun, fun, fun event of condemning the villainess is going to start.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Karl-sama said that, the villainess came out with her usual Noh mask-like expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, she really is pathetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia, as of this moment, I am breaking off my engagement to you!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, Karl-sama! You&#8217;re really cool. The Karl-sama I saw in this scene on the screen of my smartphone was cool. But in real life, he&#8217;s many times, no, hundreds of times cooler.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, are you serious?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Huh? Hey, why don&#8217;t you look so frustrated! Lately, you always had a Noh mask-like expression on your face, but you in the game always looked more frustrated and angry!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now get angry and rant like a fool!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmph. You are still a woman with no understanding. Instead of a rotten woman like you, this kind-hearted and healing Amy is the one who deserves to be my fiancée.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, are you sure you want a woman who knows nothing about etiquette, nobility, or even what a country is? Your Highness seriously thinks that this woman is fit to be the Queen of this country?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What the hell are you doing! You&#8217;re looking at me like you&#8217;re going to stab me! What&#8217;s wrong with you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Karl-sama gently hugged me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu, that&#8217;s right. After all, my superiority is absolute!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be ridiculous! Her kindness is what this country needs. It doesn&#8217;t need you who tries to find logic in everything. In the first place, we know of the many harassments you&#8217;ve perpetrated against Amy. I know harassment! A woman with characteristics like you is unfit to be the Queen of our country!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Then your Highness will take responsibility for the result, right?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey! What is with those dialogues! Your lines were not like this, you know!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shouldn&#8217;t you be more angry?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come on! Now rant quickly!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you know what? Karl-sama still did a great job of denouncing the villainess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I thought about what you would say, but this is why I don&#8217;t like the big-headed Ramslett. That&#8217;s why Ramslett&#8217;s are bumpkins who can only make wheat forever.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness. I don&#8217;t care what you say to me, but I can&#8217;t overlook the insults against the Duke of Ramslett. Please take back what you just said.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? I&#8217;m just telling you the facts.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh my? Did she get angry?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is my chance. The parents of the villainess will get sentenced to death anyway, so it doesn&#8217;t matter what I say here, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s why Anastasia-sama, who is from a provincial family, is disliked by Karl-sama, you know?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then the villainess looked at me with her usual eyes and even sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hey, what the hell is wrong with you!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why are you looking down on me when you&#8217;re a villainess!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, are you also going to insult the Ramslett family?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s true because Karl-sama said it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Let&#8217;s get a formal protest from the Ramslett family against the Brayes family.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s cowardly to use the power of your parent&#8217;s house.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Enough of this useless talk. I&#8217;ll leave you to it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? Why are you trying to leave? You should get mad and throw your gloves here, aren&#8217;t you? Isn&#8217;t this that kind of event!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Karl-sama knew exactly what I was thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait! Amy is right. If you&#8217;re proud of yourself as an aristocrat, solve it yourself before you cry to your parents. Until then, I won&#8217;t allow you to leave this place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, what are you trying to say?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are your gloves for?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes yes! That&#8217;s right! You should throw your gloves here!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At least it&#8217;s not meant to be used lightly in matters like this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nooo! You&#8217;re wearing those gloves to throw here like an idiot after getting angry!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. The daughter of the Duke of Ramslett can&#8217;t even fight for the pride and honour of the family? It seems that His Excellency the Duke has no talent for raising children.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karl-sama is snickering to ridicule her, and some of the big shots, who are here, are laughing too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s nice. Villainess, you&#8217;re a complete laughingstock, you know?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Does your Highness ask me to apply for a duel?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Think for yourself. Don&#8217;t you understand, unless I, the Crown Prince, tell you everything? As usual, what an obnoxious woman.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahaha, she looks regrettable. That&#8217;s right. You will challenge me to a duel of your own volition and lose ungracefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, she threw her gloves at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh! Um, this is &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I have to do now is to act according to the scenario. Here, let me give you back your gloves, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;How far will you go to make me look like a fool?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What? Why aren&#8217;t you mad at me? In the game, you got angry and slapped me on the cheek!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why are you looking at me with those cold eyes! I&#8217;m not a bug!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy, this means that that woman, feeling insulted, has challenged you to a duel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, is that so? I, fighting &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ll fight this duel on behalf of Amy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What? Your Highness? Ordering a woman to fight a duel and then acting as her opponent&#8217;s proxy in the duel, are you insane?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fufu. The lines are different, but that&#8217;s right. I wanted to see that panicked face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? You asked for a duel on your own. I want to protect Amy, so I&#8217;ll act as the proxy, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh my? Did you quiet down? Serves you right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will also act as a proxy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it too&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Me also, let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course, I will fight too.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone too! Thank you! I knew it. The reverse harem route is the best!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What about you? Do you have any representative willing to fight against the five of us?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The villainess is looking around. But there&#8217;s no way anyone here would be stupid enough to act as a proxy when they know they will be dealing with Karl-sama, the Crown Prince of this country, and Claude-sama, the prince of a neighbouring country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It looks like you&#8217;re not popular.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh, I can&#8217;t help but giggle. But not yet. It&#8217;s too early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Your ex-fiancée is going to beat the crap out of you! Villainess!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Serves you right!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I will act as a representative.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;&#8230; What? </span></p>
