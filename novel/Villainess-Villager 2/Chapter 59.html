<h3>Chapter 59 - Villager A Attends School in thr New Semester.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The summer vacation went well, except for the secret that Anna and I couldn&#8217;t tell anyone about. We ended up submitting a report that discussed the relationship between adventurers and the country from multiple perspectives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time as well, Anna will help us to listen to the opinions of many people involved, including domestic experts and the guild master of the adventurer&#8217;s guild, and it was good to be able to clarify their positions and report on the conflicts of interest that arose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To put it simply, the country and the nobility would like to incorporate the money earned from the dungeon into their finances. But the adventurer&#8217;s guild would not allow it because it would cause many adventurers to be in the red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the country is to incorporate the money earned from the dungeon into its finances, it needs to hire adventurers with the same treatment as the knights, but it is in a dilemma because it does not have the money to do so. If I were to be more precise, I would say that they don&#8217;t want to pay them because it would be a waste of money. As expected, it can&#8217;t work that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in Margaret&#8217;s Altmunt, a good relationship has been established, with the Knights and adventurers conducting a joint operation to ensure stable hunting of Orcs. I concluded this report by advocating a new relationship with adventurers based on the results in Altmunt, but I wonder how it will be received.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Incidentally, after writing this report, Anna and I traversed the Wind Mountain dungeon together. Due to this, we were the youngest adventurers to be upgraded to B-rank adventurers, which is a bit of a compliment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there is a reason for this. Though it served as proof to the Duke that I am not lying, the most important purpose was to improve Anna&#8217;s level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think there is any more of the game&#8217;s scenario where the entire family of the Duke of Ramslett gets executed in a civil war after Anna&#8217;s banishment, and Anna comes back as a dark knight. From what I&#8217;ve heard, the southern aristocrats centred around the Duke of Ramslett are now firmly united as a monolith.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Harming them without reason would surely lead to civil war, and no matter how anti-Ramslett the opponent is, no one would be foolish enough to support them under the current circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If we keep the balance as it is, we may be able to avoid the destruction of the royal capital. However, as long as we are still surrounded by enemies on three sides, we cannot let our guard down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, with two blessings that are particularly rare in this world, Anna&#8217;s level up will not only make her powerful, but also the entire army of the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s domain stronger. (T/N:- probably morale.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, in the event of an emergency, she will say that she will take the lead in fighting, so it also serves as insurance for when that happens.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Oh yeah, after we conquered the Wind Mountain dungeon, I talked about the treasure. When I showed her the 『Sky Knight sword』, Anna&#8217;s eyes lit up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I promised to give it to Anna on her upcoming birthday.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This 『Sky Knight sword』 is a legendary weapon, but it&#8217;s meaningless because I don&#8217;t have the blessing of a〖Knight〗. Besides, even if I get the〖Knight〗blessing from somewhere, I don&#8217;t need the skill of 【Wind Magic】, which it provides, because there is the blessing of〖Wind God〗. In that case, it makes more sense for Anna to use it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, I couldn&#8217;t even celebrate her birthday last year because of my position and status. So I&#8217;m really looking forward to Anna&#8217;s birthday, which will come after the cultural festival.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Anna stubbornly refused to take off the 『Substitute ring』 I had given her and the fairy hair ornament the Elven Queen had given her. Although there were many rumours about the ring, in particular, Anna never said who gave it to her and continued to dodge it with a smile like a noblewoman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it seemed that Margaret and Isabella knew about it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, this was not the case with the fairy hair ornament.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was because there was a still in the game, and Amy knew what it looked like, so when Amy found out that Anna had the fairy hair ornament on her head, she was naturally furious and made a scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, why are you wearing the hair ornament I was supposed to get? Give it back!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the first day of the new semester, Amy prodded Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What the hell are you talking about? This is a precious treasure that I was given by a certain nobleman. It doesn&#8217;t belong to you, and I can&#8217;t give it to you no matter who says.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna refuses, as a matter of course. And no matter how you look at it, you can see that Amy&#8217;s argument is wrong, but the Crown Prince took Amy&#8217;s word for it without question and ordered Anna.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What are you talking about? The hair ornament exists for Amy&#8217;s sake. Stop talking nonsense and give the hair ornament back to Amy.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Crown Prince says so and orders Anna to return the hair ornament.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For my part, I was hoping he&#8217;d recover and be decent, but this might not be the best idea.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness. Do you really understand what you are saying?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course! So hurry up and give her back that hair ornament.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna flinched at the lack of understanding, and at that moment Leonardo reached out to take the hair ornament by force.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, light shined from the hair ornament, and Leonardo was flung away, slamming hard against the wall of the auditorium, where the opening ceremony had just ended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then countless voices can be heard from Anna&#8217;s hair ornament.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Punish those who take the tokens from those who are recognized by the spirits.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Punishment&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;Punishment&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;Punishment&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;Punishment&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(T/N:- reminds me of the novel &#8216;The White Cat That Swore Vengeance Was Just Lazing on the Dragon King&#8217;s Lap&#8217;)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was like a chorus, one voice after another, and then more and more voices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Who harms the spirit&#8217;s beloved child?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Who&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;Who&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;Who&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;Who&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the auditorium erupts in a state of panic, and the students start running out of the auditorium in droves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy is looking at Anna with a frightened expression, while the Crown Prince and his friends are looking at Anna in a dumbfounded way as if their understanding has not caught up with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stand in front of Anna as if to protect her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Your Highness, there is no doubt that this hair ornament was given to Anastasia-sama by a nobleman. And as you can see, if you try to take it by force, you will be punished. So, do you still think it belongs to Amy-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Gu~tsu, but..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From the look on his face, he seems to understand that he is being arrogant. If that is the case, why is he doing this?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, Amy glared at me as if she wanted to curse me to death.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yeah! It&#8217;s him! He&#8217;s the one who made everything go wrong! I have to become a saint! Otherwise, this country is doomed!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think Amy is in her right mind either. I&#8217;ve heard from Melissa that she was blown away by a single blow from a regular wyvern in the Valley of the Flying Dragons, so I think it&#8217;s better to remove her from her delusions as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey! Say something!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, oblivious to her disgusting behaviour, continued to complain to us. But I couldn&#8217;t take it anymore and said something I shouldn&#8217;t have said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Amy-sama, no matter what you say, this hair ornament belongs to Anastasia-sama. Please wake up now. I don&#8217;t know what kind of dream you&#8217;re dreaming about, but this is reality. Please look at the people who are living in front of you right now. There are no heroines in this world. Anastasia-sama, His Highness, Markus-sama, Oscar-sama, Leonardo-sama, and even Amy-sama are not characters that move according to the scenario. They are all human beings, and there are many more people beyond that, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is not the game world, and you&#8217;re not the only one who knows the game and acts accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a former Japanese, if you had any common sense, you should understand that much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amy, who seemed to have understood the meaning of the words I had said, widened her eyes and nodded her head, then slowly left the auditorium.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, I thought that this would stop Amy from intervening. I was sure she would reflect on it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I would later realize that this was just wishful thinking.</span></p>
