<h3>Chapter 49 - Villager A Sense a Disturbing Sign.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my surprise, I&#8217;ve been living a normal school life lately. I wake up in the morning, eat breakfast in the dormitory, and go to class as usual. After school, I study in the library with Anna, Margaret, and Isabella. Then after eating dinner, I return to my room in the dormitory and spend the rest of the time freely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since then, neither Amy nor any of the reverse-harem members have messed with us, and I feel as if last year when I couldn&#8217;t talk to anyone, was a lie, a dream-like school life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One day, while I was resting in my room in the dormitory, Sebastian-san came to visit me and took me out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good evening, Allen-sama. After that, how was your school life?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Thanks to Anna-sama, Margaret-sama, and Isabella-sama, it is fulfilling.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? Then that&#8217;s good. By the way, how are things going at school? It took a long time for my lady&#8217;s series of incidents to come to light, so I was wondering if you could tell me anything you&#8217;ve noticed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see. So that&#8217;s how it was.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, the purpose of his visit to me was to gather information. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s talking to people other than me, but in short, as a member of the Duke of Ramslett&#8217;s family, he&#8217;s expecting me to gather information about the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for me, I don&#8217;t want to become a useful tool and get used completely. But now he is my backer, and I want Anna to smile. For that reason, I need to make sure that the Duke of Ramslett remains alive and not executed like in the game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Of course. I owe a debt of gratitude to both the Duke and Anna-sama, so I will cooperate to the extent I can. In return, if you don&#8217;t mind, can you tell me what&#8217;s going on in the royal palace?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;In the royal palace, is it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. As I said to the Duke, I am worried about the national crisis from the struggle for succession.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I say that, Sebastian-san seems as if he&#8217;s thinking long and hard about something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What do you envision in the current situation, Allen-sama?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;To be honest, I haven&#8217;t been able to see through it yet. I&#8217;m especially curious about Prince Claude.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I see.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sebastian-san didn&#8217;t change his expression, but I could see that he was a little upset. So I tried to change the subject a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Right now, I&#8217;m in a position to support the prince, who supports the duke.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, if it were possible, I would really like them to decide either to banish the Crown Prince or to not accept him as a Crown Prince in the future.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;So you&#8217;re saying you&#8217;re worried about the west?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s what I meant. It&#8217;s just that I have too little information to be sure.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Is that so? That&#8217;s right. I see. I understand. I&#8217;ll invite you to the Duke&#8217;s residence later.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, I was invited back to the Duke&#8217;s residence.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Welcome, I hope you&#8217;re enjoying your time at school.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I arrived at the drawing-room of the Duke&#8217;s residence, the Duke called out to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Anna-sama has been very good to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well then, As her &#8216;friend&#8217;, help Anna when she needs it.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why he emphasized the word &#8216;friend&#8217; again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Of course. I&#8217;m a &#8216;commoner&#8217;, so if I can be of any help to Anna-sama, I&#8217;ll be satisfied.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I now emphasize the word &#8216;commoner&#8217; to show my willingness to follow the status system.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; All right. Passed.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duke grinned and cut to the chase.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Now, Allen-kun. No, Allen, you say you&#8217;re concerned about the west. What did you assume from the information you just gave me?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I heard that Prince Claude was expelled from school at the request of the Westerdale Kingdom. From that, I have a hypothesis that the Westerdale Kingdom may have made some kind of deal with the Est Empire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hou.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The duke looks at me with an interested expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Perhaps the general view is that this expulsion is a reprimand and punishment for the disgrace Prince Claude has shown.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s how it&#8217;s generally perceived.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;However, considering Prince Claude&#8217;s mentality, I think he would choose to be next to Amy-sama, even if it means putting himself to shame.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What makes you think that?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Prince Claude was blindly in love with Amy-sama. That should be obvious from that crazy duel.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then why did Prince Claude agree to leave school?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s in Amy-sama&#8217;s best interest that he is not at the academy.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hou. You mean?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. Isn&#8217;t Prince Claude expecting Amy-sama to have to leave our country? This is where the confusion from the succession dispute comes into play. And if it&#8217;s just a succession dispute, it&#8217;s inconceivable that Amy-sama, who is favoured by the legitimate son of such a powerful nobleman, would flee the country. In other words, doesn&#8217;t Prince Claude think that there is a reasonable possibility of devastation caused by war?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, there is also the possibility that the Crown Prince&#8217;s side will lose and Amy and her family will be forced to leave the country, so there is no denying that the theory is a bit far-fetched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But when the Duke heard my opinion, he was silent for a while, pondering, and then he smiled and opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting reasoning. However, the Westerdale Kingdom is a friend of our country and an ally against the United Kingdom of Norsane in the north. It also relies heavily on imports of food and resources from our country. Why would the Westerdale Kingdom make such a deal with the Est Empire?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s just a possibility. However, this year&#8217;s freshman list at the school did not include the name of the Westerdale princess who is one year younger than Prince Claude.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with that? I heard that she was originally planning to enroll in a school in her own country.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;No. If it is such an important neighbouring country, I think they would have sent another person here. Or, it wouldn&#8217;t be strange if there was talk of a political marriage, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At least the Westerdale Kingdom is not allied with the Est Empire or the Kingdom of Xaus. Besides, if the United Kingdom of Norsane and the Westerdale Kingdom make peace, our country will be surrounded by enemies. Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to assume the worst here?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even after saying this much, I believe that expulsion is a punishment in more ways than one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the other hand, there is no guarantee that the Westerdale Kingdom will lend a hand when the Est Empire invades.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, in the game, the Westerdale Kingdom did not betray us but lent us a hand. But the reason why the Westerdale Kingdom helped the Crown Prince, Amy, and the others was because Prince Claude, who fell for her, witnessed the moment Amy awakened as a saint and used it to persuade his home country.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There may be some opportunism due to the fact that it was a game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Prince Claude, who was supposed to persuade, has dropped out of school. It is unlikely that Prince Claude will be present at the moment of Amy&#8217;s awakening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Besides, in the first place, I doubt very much that Amy can be a saint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As long as that pervert is doing whatever he wants as the spirit of light, the Elf Village rescue event will not occur. If that&#8217;s the case, she won&#8217;t be able to reach the elf village. And if that happens, the event of receiving the blessing of the Spirit of Light itself will not occur.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Furthermore, even if she did manage to reach the elf village, the spirit of light is that pervert.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wouldn&#8217;t Amy have to be about ten years younger to do something for nothing in return?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when that happens, it&#8217;s hard to believe that they will lend forces to recapture the country to the illegitimate daughter of a Baron who is no saint and the Crown Prince who lost disgracefully to a commoner. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be clear, there is no reason not to think that it would be better to join hands with the Est Empire to share the territory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hmm. That&#8217;s good. I&#8217;m surprised you thought that far ahead with so little information. It is true that the relationship with Westerdale is not perfect. But as the Duke of Ramslett, I can&#8217;t move from the royal family in the current situation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s because of what happened, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the Duke was silent for a moment, and then slowly opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Allen, Friedrich is back in the territory now. Do you know why?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eh? The next head of the family has returned to the estate?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Duchy of Ramslett is the southern breadbasket. And in the south is the Kingdom of Xaus. Also, the Kingdom of Xaus is an ally of the Est Empire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me Est and Xaus are moving at the same time?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The duke smirked at my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Fufufu, not bad, Allen. But the army can&#8217;t make any sudden moves. It won&#8217;t be until summer, when the winter wheat harvest is over, that they&#8217;ll make a move. You got my daughter&#8217;s handkerchief, didn&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m counting on you.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that things are far beyond my expectations.</span></p>
