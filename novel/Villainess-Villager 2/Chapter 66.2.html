<h3>Chapter 66.2 - Anastasia (8) - Side.</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the mouth of the bag was opened, and I was allowed to take my head out, I frowned at the difference in brightness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The place was as glittering as a court, with gorgeous chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. The surrounding area was lined with luxurious furnishings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia Clynel von Ramslett. Welcome to the Est Empire. How was your journey?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked back in the direction of the voice, I saw the Emperor of the Est Empire, the Crown Prince, and the Chief Magician of the Empire. Also next to me was that guy who had brought me here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Adolf, Emperor of the Est Empire.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8221; &#8216;Your Majesty’ is missing?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I glare at Adolph, who says that to me like I&#8217;m an idiot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Your Majesty. My wife will get disciplined from now on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What do you mean by wife when you forcibly kidnapped me! I will never be the wife of someone like you!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said strongly and glared at Günther.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But, he&#8217;s right, you know?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Crown Prince Igor who made fun of my anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good grief, my wife isn&#8217;t obedient. How about it? Your Highness Igor, why don&#8217;t you join us in educating her?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Igor smirked and gave a low laugh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, I know. But not when it&#8217;s dirty like this. I don&#8217;t even want to hold her because of the smell.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s true.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I blushed and got angry when he said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, since I was kidnapped, I have not taken a bath or had my hair done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you&#8217;re the ones who forced me into this state!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stare at them with that thought, Günter asks the man who brought me here as if to question him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Why, in the first place, does she have so much energy left to resist? Didn&#8217;t you people violate her every day?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Tha-that&#8217;s, well, actually, a mysterious power&#8230;..&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy smiled with a friendly laugh while making a troubled gesture as he said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mysterious power? She shouldn&#8217;t be able to use magic if you restrain her with the magic sealing rope.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;But when I tried to violate this woman, she blew me away with an unbelievable force. Even if I did try to do it with three people, we were all blown away and couldn&#8217;t move, so it was impossible.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What the hell is that? Alright, then do it now.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Günther said that to that guy, that guy looked blatantly uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter? You don&#8217;t want your head?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;O-okay, I get it!&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then that guy reached out to take off my clothes, but at that moment he got blown away and slammed against the wall of the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Ugh, that&#8217;s why.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy staggered to his feet and leaned against the wall to support himself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, despite all that has happened, my chastity is still intact. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s thanks to Rho-sama, the spirits, and the Elf Queen. (T/N:- I don&#8217;t think anything other than &#8216;chastity&#8217; will feel right here.)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s why the reward is &#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s half the price. I told you to violate her every day and break her heart. Just bringing her here is half the deal.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Günther tells that guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Wait, wait a minute! I didn&#8217;t hear any of this! We even got chased by a sky dragon at the end, you know? So, at least do as promised&#8211;&#8220;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;What, are you dissatisfied?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That guy closed his mouth as Günther glared at him, then bowed before exiting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, all right.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Günther said this, Emperor Adolf asked Günther a question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hey, Günther. Will it be okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, no problem. There are plenty of other ways to break her heart, you see.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Good. Then I leave the rest to you, Günther. And Igor, don&#8217;t play too much, okay?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Hah!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I know, father.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Emperor Adolf also left the room. The Crown Prince and Günther reverently saw him off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Günther turned to me and said in a clerical manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Anastasia. You will be a loyal warrior of the Est empire, but for now, let&#8217;s have you take a bath. That&#8217;s because you stink too much.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who would want to be a soldier of the Est Empire!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an annoying thing to say, but I was grateful to be allowed to take a bath. So, I kept my mouth shut and decided to take a bath honestly for the time being.</span></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><span style="font-weight: 400">＊＊＊＊</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I refused all the help from the maids that came over, and for the first time in two weeks, I was able to cleanse myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I refused the help of the maids, partly because I couldn&#8217;t trust them, but also because they could&#8217;ve been blown away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also the first time in two weeks that I had been released from the restraints. I had been tied up for so long that I couldn&#8217;t feel my arms, but the joy of being able to move my arms and legs freely for the first time in a while was irreplaceable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, instead of being released from the magic sealing rope, I was given a magic sealing collar. It is a rugged collar made of hard metal that needs a key so that I can not remove it by myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I am still a prisoner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The brief moment of relaxation passed in a blink of an eye. When I got out of the bath, there were obscene clothes ready for me, as if they were my underwear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damn, are you telling me to wear such shameless things? This is like&#8230;..</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I can&#8217;t just stay naked. I have no choice but to put on the clothes that are prepared for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it covers a small area of my body and emphasizes my breasts and body lines in an unpleasant way, as if I am inviting a man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s embarrassing!</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrapped a bath towel over it and left the bathroom. The maid tried to take the bath towel from me, but I firmly refused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it would be difficult for me to escape if I&#8217;m dressed like this and my magic is sealed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The place where I was taken was a dungeon. It&#8217;s extravagant for a dungeon, but there were no windows and the door was locked from the outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bed was a king-sized bed of high quality, and next to it were clothes like the ones I was forced to wear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, this is such a place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I am sure that Rho-sama, the spirits, and the Queen will protect me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Believing this, I resolve to endure no matter how long it takes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, despite my determination, the door was closed and locked from the outside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the door&#8217;s peephole was opened and Günther&#8217;s voice came from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Then, let&#8217;s meet in another year. I hope you can live on bread and water until then.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the peephole was closed, the lights that had illuminated the room were extinguished, and the room was enveloped in complete darkness.</span></p>
