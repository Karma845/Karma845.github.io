<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Witch Trial</h3>

<p><strong>Part 1 &#8211; Pleasure in Private</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">On the south side of the Auerbach castle in Kurz.&nbsp;As I walked down the corridor called the “mirror corridor” to head to the King’s “Golden Room”, a young guard in front of the door readied his spear and made a surprised face when he looked at me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey you!&nbsp;This is the king’s chamber!&nbsp;Unauthorized entry is&mdash;&ndash;!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Stop!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The man who was standing on the left side of the door stopped him.&nbsp;He was nervous and in a cold sweat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This person is a special case!&nbsp;It can happen at any time!&nbsp;I’m very sorry, Raul-sama… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh?&nbsp;Raul-sama?&nbsp;Don’t tell me he’s that…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Unlike the nervous man, it seems that the other one is a newcomer.&nbsp;Apparently, most of the guards who originally worked for the royal palace have been replaced due to my purge, and it seems they haven’t done much work.&nbsp;Also, if they don’t know my face, they may have come from the country side in response to the news of a recruitment of soldiers.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I-I’m so sorry, Raul-sama!&nbsp;Forgive me.. M-my life!&nbsp;Please…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The newcomer also changed his tone very quickly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Okay, okay.&nbsp;It can’t be helped if you are new on the job]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I smiled cheerfully, and tapped his shoulder so he wouldn’t worry.&nbsp;As I passed the two guards who are still shaking, I entered the golden room.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Your majesty, I am back ~.&nbsp;The false hero, the merchant Allingham, the great wizard Wendell and his men have been eliminated ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He’s still hooked up to a large number of pipes, and he’s still staring at the ceiling with a face of not knowing if he’s dead or alive.&nbsp;The king, who only moved his yellow eyes to confirm my presence, laughed his nose.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’ve been waiting for your report.&nbsp;Well, tell me the details]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Allingham was suffocated after being castrated by demons.&nbsp;The great wizard Wendell suffered a mental breakdown after seeing illusions being eternally murdered, but after all, he still died by being butchered by demons]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The king looked at me like a child insisting on more details, so I sat in the chair at the side of the bed and talked about the funniest thing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you want to see the show, I can send it to your brain at any time.&nbsp;I used my magic to record the whole process.&nbsp;There is no reason to be in a hurry.&nbsp;After all, you have a lot of free time, don’t you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ohh, that sounds great!&nbsp;So what happened to the captive demons?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, about that]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I crossed my legs and put a sneaky smile on my face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahaha.&nbsp;I burned them together with the whole installation]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What?&nbsp;Innocent demons… ..!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I didn’t want to kill anyone except my revenge targets, so I thought I’d let them go.&nbsp;But, they said that I was the enemy of the demon lord, and it would have been troublesome if a rebellion had formed in the future]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s fine.&nbsp;After all, demons are no different from monsters.&nbsp;They just look like humans, and they can even talk, all of that makes my stomach turn]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well that’s true ~.&nbsp;But, king, is it okay to say that?&nbsp;You never know where there might be demons]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Silly stuff.&nbsp;Now that the demon lord is dead, there is nothing to fear]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ha ha.&nbsp;true!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I laughed brilliantly and adapted the story appropriately.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[First of all, the magic of darkness does not work on you, king.&nbsp;That’s why I can’t kill you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmph.&nbsp;Is there a reason for you to kill me?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Isn’t there?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Our words collided, and they searched for intentions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, you have many reasons why you want to kill me right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hoo, for example?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The case of Victoria]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I don’t want to hear that stupid daughter’s name!&nbsp;Uhh… .. Coff… ..agahh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The servants waiting in the corner of the room rushed in.&nbsp;Ahh, dear.&nbsp;This happens to you for getting too excited, old man.&nbsp;I just had to wait quietly where he was while the servants treated him with sedatives and administered other things.&nbsp;Yes, it is difficult to care for the elderly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, have you calmed down yet?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haa… ..Haa ……………… ..no problem.&nbsp;Well, let’s get back to the topic.&nbsp;I would like to resume the trial that was stopped, what do you think?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oh.&nbsp;That seems fine to me.&nbsp;So how is that witch doing?&nbsp;is she okay?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I think it would be better if you saw it with your own eyes than I tell you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes that’s correct]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I guess I should go say hi to her before the trial.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After leaving the king’s chamber, I made my way to the dungeon where Christiana was being held.&nbsp;Looking towards the spiraling stone stairs, a strange voice echoed out of the darkness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[…… Huh …… Haa …… Hmm… ..Ahh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Uwaa… ..I held my head like being tired.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even in this place she …… looks like an animal in heat]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I went downstairs hearing an unpleasant voice, there was the sight I was waiting for.&nbsp;Christiana, who could be said to be naked, was leaning against the bars of her cell.&nbsp;Her white hands that reached out from the bars held the arm of a soldier in front of her.&nbsp;I couldn’t see what the soldier’s hand was doing between Christiana’s legs due to the shadow of her prison uniform, but I can imagine it from the voice of pleasure and the waist movements.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh!&nbsp;Yes!&nbsp;Plus!&nbsp;Please, harder… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There are three soldiers.&nbsp;Everyone is blushing and breathing deeply as they look at Christiana’s shameless appearance.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[S-Saint-sama… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Still not enough!&nbsp;My body is going to go crazy from being in such a place all the time… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She spread her hands further through the bars as needed.&nbsp;The soldiers released an excited voice like a beast, touching the saint’s body and rubbing her breasts.&nbsp;The other prisoners looked at that scene in surprise.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I beg of you, put it in… ..!&nbsp;Please, I want you to put it inside me… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At Christiana’s temptation, the soldiers looked at each other.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[H-Hey, what do we do?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[She’s all excited.&nbsp;I don’t think she can escape even if we open the cell.&nbsp;Besides, we can’t hold on anymore]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hehe… ..it’s true.&nbsp;You have to open it… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The soldiers consulted each other with nasty smiles.&nbsp;When I appeared from behind them, I put my hand on their shoulder.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Good good.&nbsp;can I join your conversation?&nbsp;I see you guys still have a long way to go if you fall so easily into the temptation of this woman]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I spoke to them, the soldiers screamed and ran away from Christiana.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[R-Raul-sama!&nbsp;This is… ..the saint-sama was… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I looked at Christiana, she had a bright face with watery eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul… ..!&nbsp;I’m glad you came… ..!&nbsp;I was very scared… .. I had no choice but to do what they asked me… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana looks at me with a naked upper body.&nbsp;When I looked back at her with cold eyes, she pretended to be embarrassed and covered her breasts with both hands.&nbsp;Her flowing hair waved along the delicate line of her body.&nbsp;Perhaps it was due to her large, sensual lips, as that was often said to be bewitching and made her look innocent.&nbsp;In other words, it is the expression of “holding on to the weak” to captivate men.&nbsp;Although I am not interested at all.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I-I’m sorry… ..for showing you this appearance… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah yes yes.&nbsp;I don’t care about that little game of yours]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After kicking out the soldiers, I stood in front of Christiana’s cell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You haven’t changed at all, Christiana.&nbsp;You were very calm when the king abandoned Victoria, but you can see that you cannot bear it at all.&nbsp;You are always spreading your legs to everyone]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You are very cruel, Raul… ..but, the king was much more cruel.&nbsp;Suddenly he said to me “You are not a saint!&nbsp;You’re a witch!”.&nbsp;Then they suddenly arrested me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yep, I know.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Because that’s what we agreed on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[By the way, could you cover those nasty breasts of yours?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Usually a person’s clothes are taken off to rob them of their dignity, but the situation today is different.&nbsp;I don’t want to see the naked body of this dirty woman.&nbsp;My eyes will rot.&nbsp;First of all, in this case, even if she’s naked, it will not harm her mentally.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do it at once]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If it is okay.&nbsp;I’ll put my clothes on… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As Christiana looked at me as if looking for something, she began to button slowly.&nbsp;She’s probably looking for a chance knowing she can’t tempt me.&nbsp;It doesn’t really change in that regard.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, Raul.&nbsp;My fingers are shaking and I can’t do it right… .. Could you help me?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahaha.&nbsp;I’m not going to put a single finger on you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Always such a joker.&nbsp;If you hug me, this shaking could stop]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Her hands have come to a complete stop.&nbsp;It stopped only at the bottom, so those nasty things that are still visible.&nbsp;First of all, who buttons their clothes from below?&nbsp;I couldn’t allow it to continue in this way, so I took out a huge sack with magic and put it over Christiana.&nbsp;From head to toe.&nbsp;Well, now I don’t have to see anything I don’t want to see.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul, do you like this kind of thing?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..You really are someone very difficult to deal with]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Keeping my hand on my waist, I sighed heavily.&nbsp;Compared to this woman, I am glad that Victoria was easier to understand.&nbsp;Well, when it comes to “no matter what they do to them,” they both have great mental strength, so Victoria and Christiana are exactly the same on that.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Men are completely useless compared to these two poisonous women.&nbsp;They always start crying right away.&nbsp;I leaned against the prison wall, remembering Wendell who I had punished.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, Christiana.&nbsp;Looks like your trial will start tomorrow]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Seriously?&nbsp;But, I am not afraid.&nbsp;With this life, I will take on everyone’s sins and punishment.&nbsp;Also your sins, Raul]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What are you saying?&nbsp;With a big sigh, I spoke to Christiana in a way that reminds me of a little child.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Listen carefully, you will be punished for your own sins.&nbsp;You are not a sacrifice for people as an envoy of God.&nbsp;You’re just ruthless, so you have to take responsibility]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I remembered the acts that this saint once claimed as “acts of goodwill.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[How cruel ~.&nbsp;Even though I did many things for you, Raul]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Many things?&nbsp;About giving Victoria unnecessary ideas?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm&nbsp;Ahaha.&nbsp;How did you know?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I saw it with past vision magic]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This was before defeating the demon lord.&nbsp;Victoria, who was starting to build up her irritation against me by not responding to her the way she wanted.&nbsp;Smelling that smell, it was Christiana who got into it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Hey, Victoria.&nbsp;You care about your love for Raul, right?&nbsp;I can give you an advice』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Wow, that’s very considerate of the saint.&nbsp;But, I don’t need anyone’s advice.&nbsp;If you make fun of me, you will be executed even if you are the saint 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Eh ~, how scary.&nbsp;I thought we were friends, Victoria 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Know your place… .. Christiana-dono, you are being rude to Her Highness!』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana did not back down, despite Sandra’s roar.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『You see, I heard the voice of the Lord.&nbsp;So I wanted to tell you about that, Victoria 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Do you think God can influence my life?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『But, god said Victoria and Raul are destined to be together.&nbsp;Only you can save Raul 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Wow …… give me the details』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Why do women like the word destiny so much?&nbsp;Anyway, the gullible Victoria fell to the witch’s sweet words.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Raul is working hard to save people, and there is a lot of support for this.&nbsp;But, now it’s very dangerous.&nbsp;It’s like he’s trying to replace god 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Well, that’s true.&nbsp;Raul is now a great hero 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『But, Raul is a hero, not a god.&nbsp;I want Raul to remember that he is just a normal boy.&nbsp;That will help you too.&nbsp;That’s why Victoria.&nbsp;That’s where your affection comes in! 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Explain it more specifically』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『With your affection, you have to be more direct with Raul.&nbsp;Expose your true nature.&nbsp;That way, Raul won’t be able to live without you 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Victoria was originally a woman with cruel thoughts.&nbsp;But due to her ambition to obtain the throne, she had been hiding it.&nbsp;Christiana’s sweet words began to melt her irrational reason.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『… ..Hmph, it’s not a bad idea.&nbsp;Until now I just wanted to get Raul.&nbsp;But it’s true.&nbsp;Dirty him, take away his title as the hero and turn him into my dog, sounds very attractive.&nbsp;I’m getting excited just imagining it… .. 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Victoria smiled and called Sandra.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Sandra.&nbsp;I came up with something very good.&nbsp;Immediately gather information about the people Raul is friends with 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In that way, a series of tragedies began.&nbsp;Victoria took action, but it was Christiana who prompted her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gosh, you really put unnecessary advice into her head]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ehh ~, we were just talking about love]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana tilted her head while smiling.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You are very calm even though I am in front of you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s because no matter what you do to me, I’m not afraid.&nbsp;My role as the saint is to die for the sins of the people.&nbsp;So I am not afraid]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It is true that she is not afraid of death.&nbsp;It is as if she is looking into another place, and believes in herself that she is an envoy of God.&nbsp;It was always like this since we were in the Party.&nbsp;“I am in charge of saving people in the name of God”, that was her habit, and when she opened hisller mouth, she began her speech on “God” and “Salvation”.&nbsp;I couldn’t keep up with her words.&nbsp;Anyway, I thought she was a kind girl who wanted to save the kingdom and the people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Unlike me who was stupid, Christiana was smart.&nbsp;She knew exactly who should be saved and led to the right path, and she would say, “Simple hedonism is so easy to misinterpret.”&nbsp;That is why Christiana at that time was nothing more than an exemplary and innocent saint in front of my eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Your way of thinking will not change even if you die]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The feeling is different from that of an ordinary human, so cornering her will not affect Christiana at all.&nbsp;Of course, I planned something knowing that, so no problem.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana, I will take care of awakening your distorted thoughts and clouded mind.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2 &#8211; Time of Sentence</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">That day, the court was full of people with a lot of commotion.&nbsp;The audience seats are all taken, and the rest just decided to stand the place is jam packed to the walls, stairs, and corridors on the second floor.&nbsp;Still, they couldn’t all fit, so people were gathering outside the court.&nbsp;The young personnel had a hard time closing the front door.&nbsp;On the bench was the judge dressed as such, the jury were on the left side, and the officials on the right side.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">By the way, I am enjoying the show from the second floor seats while blending with the people with my magic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The Christiana Alcott trial, also known as the “Alcott Witch Trial,” which began the day after I returned to the royal capital, finally comes to a close and the sentencing is today.&nbsp;This is why the court is so crowded.&nbsp;Citizens, who long admired Christiana for being a saint, began to condemn her attitude as soon as she was accused of being a witch.&nbsp;It was an enjoying  festival~.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Die, you damn demon!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You fooled us all!&nbsp;Go to hell!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You’re no saint!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The moment Christiana, who was tied by the hands with a rope, entered, people lunged at her.&nbsp;Christiana is not a woman who is affected by that.&nbsp;First of all, she was unlikely to pay attention to it.&nbsp;She straighten her back, and looked somewhere with a faint gaze.&nbsp;She had her usual smile on her mouth, she seemed to be indifferent and it was creepy.&nbsp;Because of it she have bought even more contempt of the people.&nbsp;The noise in the place grew louder.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you laughing at, damn !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do you know what you did, bitch !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Order, order]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The judge called the guards to calm the crowd.&nbsp;The spectators who raised their fists, sat somewhat restless, and finally the place was silent.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We are now going to present some charges committed by the defendant Christiana Alcott to begin the trial.&nbsp;First witness, go ahead]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-Yes]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They called a woman who was Christiana’s aunt.&nbsp;She kept her gaze on Christiana, and went to the place to testify.&nbsp;Before making her aunt began her statement, Christiana started fixing her hair and was doing meaningless poses before the judge, so I exhaled in exhaustion.&nbsp;Can’t you stop even for a second without trying to seduce someone?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">【Witness 1, Christiana Alcott’s aunt】</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[My niece Christiana is a scary girl.&nbsp;She brainwashed my younger sister and her husband, that is, her own parents, and drove them to suicide.&nbsp;She said it was a way to save their souls… ..!&nbsp;Since she was a child, she was always good with words, and manipulated those around her at will.&nbsp;She’s completely fooled me too.&nbsp;She’s just a witch who doesn’t feel guilty about cornering others!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">【Witness 2, soldier】</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[My friends were seduced by that woman!&nbsp;When that woman sees a man, she talks to him and then… .. Eh?&nbsp;What about me?&nbsp;I am a serious person.&nbsp;I guess she didn’t talk to me thinking she wasn’t going to be able seduce me.&nbsp;But it’s true!&nbsp;Even if she spoke to me, I would have ignored her!&nbsp;I knew it was strange from the beginning.&nbsp;I couldn’t report her until now because i was afraid of committing blasphemy against god for suspecting someone with the position of saint.&nbsp;I’m sure everyone here thinks the same!&nbsp;Isn’t that right, guys?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">【Witness 3, priest】</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That woman is a demon.&nbsp;Ahh, it’s scary.&nbsp;Even with the power I possess, I was no match for that demon.&nbsp;The women incited by Christiana went astray, their hearts sank into darkness, and they committed suicide having children without even knowing who the father was]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The summoned witnesses were replaced one after another revealing the evils of Christiana.&nbsp;Christiana was originally arrested for giving Victoria terrible advice and for bringing a crisis to the kingdom.&nbsp;However, by uncovering the lid, more and more sins come out.&nbsp;That was the saint behind various terrible acts.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana has led hundreds of people to their deaths while in the hero’s party.&nbsp;Without even staining her own hands.&nbsp;Unfortunately, as in the case of Allingham and Wendell, I cannot kill this woman with my bare hands.&nbsp;But in the same way as Wendell, there are many who hate Christiana and have a reason for wanting to kill her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">All of the witnesses, even though they hadn’t been asked, were very eager to talk about “All the reasons they haven’t been able to report Christiana so far.” It’s as if they were convinced that if they did they could eliminate the fact that they once worshiped her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There must be some who still worship Christiana as the saint, but say nothing for fear of the king and me.&nbsp;The truth is, I don’t care who supports Christiana.&nbsp;As I thought about it, my name was called as the fourth and last witness of the day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hero Raul Evans]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Saying my name, the crowd got rowdy.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes Yes.&nbsp;It’s my turn.&nbsp;Hop]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I mentioned earlier, the stairs are packed with spectators.&nbsp;I jumped over the second-story railing and landed at the witness site.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hero Raul Evans.&nbsp;Please say the oath]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I declare.&nbsp;I swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, without hiding anything or lying]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[So please testify about defendant Christiana Alcott’s behavior when she was in your group]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Let’s see, she was kind and innocent.&nbsp;She was very popular no matter where she was, because she acted like a holy and pure Saint.&nbsp;I think she healed the wounds of the wounded.&nbsp;But behind the scenes, she took advantage of the recovered soldiers and among themselves they fought over Christiana’s body.&nbsp;Regarding that matter, the second witness spoke about it, didn’t he?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..Fufu]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At that moment, Christiana, who hadn’t changed her expression no matter who testified, moved her gaze for the first time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why is everyone so angry?&nbsp;It’s as if all of you don’t understand what salvation means]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana put her hands to her mouth making a big smile.&nbsp;Even though she always speaks like a little girl with a sweet voice, when she goes into saint mode, she becomes an actress who possesses great wisdom.&nbsp;Also, the effect is huge.&nbsp;It was just a lovely voice, but the judge and the others were alert.&nbsp;It’s a big deal because it’s so much more effective than a lousy charm magic.&nbsp;I applauded a couple of times praising Christiana’s trick.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[As expected.&nbsp;When you start acting like a god sent with that face, men fall so easily.&nbsp;Are there any objections, Christiana?&nbsp;“Well, judge.”&nbsp;Since it’s a good opportunity, could you listen to the words of the accused?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It is more interesting to corner her after letting her speak freely.&nbsp;The judge nodded and allowed Christiana to speak.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m so happy for you, Christiana.&nbsp;You were allowed to speak.&nbsp;Well, what did were you saying again?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even if all the people gathered here are enemies, Christiana began to sing without hesitation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Everything the witnesses have said is true.&nbsp;But why does everyone think that my actions are bad?&nbsp;I find it very strange]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Accused.&nbsp;What does it mean?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When the judge asked, Christiana crossed her hands in front of her chest and screamed loudly, looking up at the sky.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[My duty is the salvation of people!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Interestingly, at that moment, light came in from outside the window, shining softly on Christiana’s white cheeks.&nbsp;I could notice that many took a deep breath.&nbsp;It seemed as if people’s hearts were bowing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Hm?&nbsp;are these people too stupid?&nbsp;Yup, I totally agree.&nbsp;But that’s the way it is.&nbsp;So are humans.&nbsp;They wander between good and evil, and with just one event, they easily direct hostility at you.&nbsp;They direct hatred to bad actions by letting themselves be carried away by their emotions of that moment, raise their hands to evil, raise their sense of justice or are indifferent.&nbsp;If I weren’t here, everyone would roll up like this, and they would surely release this witch outside again.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">However, it’s a shame, Christiana.&nbsp;I’m here.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Many have died for that salvation you mention, haven’t they?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I said that, the viewers were in awe.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[T-That’s true.&nbsp;We were about to be fooled into that witch’s tricks again!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[She really is a terrifying woman… ..!&nbsp;Why did we call her a saint in the first place?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Darling, you were head over heels to that woman right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-You’re wrong!&nbsp;Who would be fooled by that witch’s tricks… ..!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The protests and jeers dispersed, and Christiana hugged her body with a sad face.&nbsp;Even with such a charming attitude, no one was confused at all.&nbsp;Because your shoulders aren’t shaking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I am the saint.&nbsp;The most sacred existence on this land that was chosen by the lord.&nbsp;And you are all stupid sinners who live and continue to sin.&nbsp;Sinners have been purified and saved by connecting with me, the saint]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The spectators raised a commotion and looked at each other..</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[My parents committed suicide.&nbsp;In this way, their souls were purified and they went to the kingdom of God.&nbsp;In the same way, the women who committed suicide traveled together to paradise, without having their beloved fetuses contaminated with the sins of this world.&nbsp;All the men who passed over my body were able to eliminate their sins by having contact with the saint.&nbsp;Is that something you should judge me by?&nbsp;Everyone’s soul has been taken by the devil and their eyes are clouded]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What an insane theory.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Frighteningly, Christiana’s eyes haven’t even flinched in such a situation.&nbsp;She really believes in her own delusions.&nbsp;Ahh, how scary.&nbsp;Such  heresy are far worse than simple scammers.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana’s expression, tone, gestures and absolute confidence overflow from her entire body.&nbsp;People who are shown that intense feeling of “I am an apostle of God” are usually swallowed up and brainwashed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In addition, Christiana surrenders her body proclaiming salvation and offers various pleasures.&nbsp;Those who tried it said “It has given me a pleasure that is unlikely to belong to this world.”&nbsp;That way they drown in her “sweet words” and “great pleasure.”&nbsp;It does not surprise me that those who have had contact with the saint went astray.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">However, in this case, it seems like the men and women around her are gazing at her.&nbsp;It is seen that this time the charm of Christiana is not brainwashing them.&nbsp;It’s more like you’re leaving some obnoxious signs on others.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What is that demon saying !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[She is just a witch who justifies her actions… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Order!&nbsp;Order!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The insults doesn’t upset Christiana at all.&nbsp;She looked around the place with compassionate eyes and spread her arms.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[People with a weak soul cannot be saved.&nbsp;But, the lord is looking at them.&nbsp;The Lord has said that he wants to save them despite their stupidity, that’s why I decided to save them too]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Silence!&nbsp;Shut up!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Fuck you! give me my husband back!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Order!&nbsp;Order!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The uproar didn’t stop.&nbsp;The sound of the hammer resounded particularly loud.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Now I will give my verdict!&nbsp;The court has confirmed Christiana Alcott as a witch.&nbsp;Therefore, she will be sentenced to the stake!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At that moment, much applause resounded in the court.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kill her!&nbsp;Kill her!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Despite the frenzy of the people, I was watching the festival in a cold mood.&nbsp;No matter how happy all of you are, Christiana’s heart will not move at all.&nbsp;Because she really believes in God, and also that her death can save them from their sins.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In other words, this is not revenge.&nbsp;Why are they so satisfied to kill someone who is not afraid of death?&nbsp;Destroying your beliefs is true revenge.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A few days later.&nbsp;Christiana, is being tied up and was dragged out of the prison to the place of execution.&nbsp;The gathered people never stopped for a moment since she was released from prison, but Christiana continued to smile with an enlightened expression.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kill her!&nbsp;Kill her!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kill her at once!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The momentum of the people is tremendous.&nbsp;Unlike the courthouse which had limited places, there were many more people on the execution site.&nbsp;This brings back memories.&nbsp;I think that’s how it was when I was executed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Isn’t it time for the execution yet !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t be in such a hurry!&nbsp;She is the first sinner to be burned in years!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While listening to that, I looked back at the gallows.&nbsp;There was firewood, leaves, and a solid pillar.&nbsp;The method of execution for heretics is specified that they should be burned, so I did not say anything, but I don’t like this method very much.&nbsp;Because there is not much pain compared to everything she has done.&nbsp;After all, she will only burn out, pass out, and die.&nbsp;The time from being set on fire to death is very fast.&nbsp;I wonder why do we use such a boring way of execution.&nbsp;As I bowed my head, Christiana, wearing a white prison suit, appeared on the gallows.&nbsp;As expected, she looked around and smiled.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Sorry everyone.&nbsp;The truth is that I would have liked to give the pleasure of salvation to your bodies… ..but, this is all I can do.&nbsp;But everyone’s sin of “being alive” will be atoned for with my death.&nbsp;For all the sinful, stupid and dirty people!&nbsp;Have a nice day!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It’s a boring development.&nbsp;But it is a necessary step to get to my revenge, so I will be patient.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The executioners put Christiana to the pillar and staked her limbs.&nbsp;The audience rejoices saying “Wow!”&nbsp;every time the mallet swung.&nbsp;But, quickly the atmosphere turned strange.&nbsp;Christiana, who has been labelled as a witch, wore an expression of pleasure and leaked out sweet moans whenever she received pain.&nbsp;The men were stunned with red faces with open mouths, the women were shocked by that, and began to hit the one next to them.&nbsp;I just laughed and watched the human comedy unfold.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While all of this was going on, Christiana was just talking to God.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, My lord!&nbsp;… ..Finally I can go to your kingdom.&nbsp;Can you see it?&nbsp;Now I am trying to fulfill the duty you entrusted to me… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They set the leaves on fire.&nbsp;The burning flames are intensified by the dry wind.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, I love the fire that burns my body.&nbsp;I love the smoke.&nbsp;All this pain is wonderful… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana continues to raise her voice to heaven, crying happily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahhh, more… ..more!&nbsp;Burn me more!&nbsp;All my body…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why does she have a satisfied face?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Suffer!&nbsp;Suffer and die!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Fufufu… ..fufufufufufu!&nbsp;Ahahahahahaha!&nbsp;Ahh, yes, it feels good, it feels very good… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even as being engulfed in flames, Christiana had an ecstatic expression&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<img src="https://i.ibb.co/x626DNf/000067.png" height="500" width="350"></img>


<p class="has-text-align-center">&ndash;After a few hours.&nbsp;Christiana’s body, placed on an iron table, was all charred and it was no longer possible to tell if she was a man or a woman.&nbsp;Few onlookers gaped at the corpse staring at the sky.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After stretching my neck, I went to retrieve Christiana’s body.&nbsp;Haa, the execution is finally over.&nbsp;It was a very long preparation.&nbsp;Of course, revenge is not over with this.&nbsp;Since it’s as if the saint has won and escaped.&nbsp;Christiana, you have to properly confront your sins.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&mdash;&mdash; Look forward to it.&nbsp;Because I will chase you to the depths of hell.</p>

<p><strong>End of Chapter 2 Intermission : The Death of Hero Raul</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Hearing the news that Saint Christiana was executed, Theodor made her way to a hill outside the royal capital.&nbsp;That hill is an unusually dreadful place where the hero Raul “exhibits” the corpses and remains of the people who he took vengeance on.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(If the saint died, then he will definitely appear in this place… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor had been waiting for this moment ever since she secretly entered the royal capital half a month ago.&nbsp;Following the destruction of the slave facility, Theodor, who left with the demons, did her best to revive the demon race without giving up her revenge against Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Come on, come at once, hero. This time I’ll make sure to stop your breath)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">However, this time is different than when i got carried away by my emotions.&nbsp;I had a chance this time.&nbsp;Theodor looked at the trump card lurking on the other side of the hill, and a slight smile appeared on her mouth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After several hours waiting for Raul, had appeared as expected.&nbsp;Theodor saw a charred body on his back and frowned secretly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(His bad taste doesn’t change)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul was humming a song while arranging his display.&nbsp;Now was the time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor took out a hand mirror and reflected the light and sent a bright signal over the hill.&nbsp;Immediately afterwards, a buzzing of the wind was heard and an arrow pierced Raul’s back which was full of openings.&nbsp;Holy water created by the magic of light was coated on the tip of the arrow.&nbsp;Holy water is a deadly poison for those who have been swallowed and devoured in the power of darkness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-What… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul bent down lazily and collapsed in that place while muttering in a soft voice.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(As I thought, it did have an effect… ..!)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor restrained the urge to shout for joy and ran to Raul.&nbsp;But, it wasn’t over yet.&nbsp;She still couldn’t rejoice.&nbsp;Her only wish is to see the moment when this man’s life completely disappears.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul remained on the ground like a corpse.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m surprised that i defeated him so easily]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was too good to be true that she managed to defeat this powerful man so easily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You let your guard down, hero! Not only your fingers, but you can’t even move your eyes, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She told Raul while he was convulsing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I saw that you only used dark magic all the time, so I thought that would be a possibility.&nbsp;As I thought, your body being consumed by the power of darkness makes you weak before the magic of light]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She grabbed him by the chest and lifted him up hard, noting that Raul’s eyes were cloudy and his purple lips were trembling.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahaha!&nbsp;What’s up, hero?&nbsp;How pathetic!&nbsp;It was a good idea to put you to sleep.&nbsp;So I don’t have to listen to your stupid things]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She violently released Raul and stepped on his back when he fell.&nbsp;Still, Raul couldn’t resist, so he just received it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She finally got it.&nbsp;The body and life of her hated enemy are on her hands.&nbsp;As soon as she realized that, a great emotion emerged from Theodor’s heart.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I can finally kill you… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Finally the moment had come.&nbsp;On the other hand, various factors have caused Theodor to go missing.&nbsp;One is the fact that Raul helped her free the slaves.&nbsp;The other is the concern is that if she could really do something to manage to kill Raul.&nbsp;Even so, she had no choice but to move forward.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You said it yourself that because you received the blessings of the gods you can’t die in a normal way right?&nbsp;That is why I investigated the way that would lead you to death.&nbsp;I will use the method that Princess Victoria used when she killed you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The man who shot the arrow was paid in advance, and told he could leave when the job was done.&nbsp;Therefore, the work from now on will be done by her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was a difficult work to put a cross on the hill and crucify Raul.&nbsp;But, this was her revenge.&nbsp;It wouldn’t make sense if she didn’t do it alone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Now time to attract some beasts with the scent of blood to devour you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She grabbed a dagger that she pulled from her chest.&nbsp;She had repeatedly failed to attempt to take Raul’s life with this dagger.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This has also received a blessing from light magic.&nbsp;I’m sure it will hurt you a lot]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This dagger with holy power is a terrifying thing for a demon like Theodor.&nbsp;The mage who lent him his power warned him “Being a demon, just holding this dagger endangers your life.”&nbsp;However, ironically, Theodor despite having royal family blood, was very weak in the power of darkness.&nbsp;The greater the power of darkness, the greater the damage from light magic.&nbsp;That also applied to the other way around.&nbsp;Unlike Raul who was immobilized at the time the arrow was shot, Theodor was able to grasp the dagger while feeling pain in the palm of her hand.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s very ironic.&nbsp;I am a failure as a demon.&nbsp;There was only one magic i could learn.&nbsp;However, it is for that reason that I can kill you with this dagger]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She feels like the palm of her hand holding the dagger is tearing apart.&nbsp;Still, not caring about that, Theodor held the handle tight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’ve always been dreaming of my sister since that day when you walked into the castle and took everything.&nbsp;In my dream my sister continues to suffer.&nbsp;I want to carry out this revenge so that she can finally rest in peace… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That’s how it is.&nbsp;There was no time to hesitate.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[When you attacked the castle, you were saying that humans were good and demons were bad, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor look Raul in the eyes and then stabbed him into chest with the dagger.&nbsp;The sound of meat crunching rang out, it was a solid response.&nbsp;But it was not enough.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You were wrong.&nbsp;You should have known if you were taking revenge on true evil, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She stabbed Raul’s body over and over as she asked him.&nbsp;Raul didn’t even cry out in pain, he just looked at Theodor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[My sister only protected the country and its people!&nbsp;Everyone just wanted to live normally!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She began to say things that even she no longer understood.&nbsp;Se screamed as she stabbed the hero’s flesh dozens of times.&nbsp;With each stab, blood splattered and unpleasant sounds rose at him.&nbsp;Even if the stomach opened and the internal organs popped out, Theodor didn’t stop as if possessed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haa… ..Haa… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Now the beasts should come.&nbsp;Immediately the crows came and began to eat Raul’s intestines.&nbsp;Despite the fact that his entire body was covered in blood and his intestines had been removed, Raul was still alive and breathing painfully.&nbsp;From here on, it will surely be necessary to wait five days for you to reach your pathetic end.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I will watch you until you die]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor declared that without taking her eyes off Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&mdash;&ndash; Five days have passed since then.&nbsp;Theodor stood up in amazement, watching as Raul’s eyeballs stopped.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She always wanted this man’s death.&nbsp;Although that wish finally came true, why did a single thought sprout in her heart?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She assumed that her revenge had been achieved with the death of Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even if she asked, no one could answer her.&nbsp;Raul’s corpse just hung there, and his soul has traveled far from Theodor’s reach.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When she took revenge on Allingham on behalf of the Charles family, she had that feeling of excitement, but why doesn’t she have the feeling of satisfaction in killings him?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She didn’t think of leaving this place.&nbsp;Because what face should I make while feeling like this?&nbsp;She had believed that by killing the hero and achieving her revenge she would be freed from all suffering.&nbsp;The shadows covering Theodor’s heart still remained fixed, nothing has changed before or after the hero’s death.&nbsp;In that case, for what reason did i killed him?&nbsp;The lost feelings, the suffering, everything remained the same.&nbsp;Even though she no longer has anyone else to kill. Theodor then collapsed in that place.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">For the first time she knew there was more darkness waiting for her beyond revenge.&nbsp;Ironically, this suffering was something she couldn’t understand without revenge&mdash;&ndash;</p>
