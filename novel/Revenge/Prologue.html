︎<p><strong>Part 1 &#8211; The Avenger, Decorating his Favorite Collection</strong></p>


<p><strong>(Dragging) SFX</strong></p>



<p>[I won&#8217;t let you die ~.&nbsp;I won&#8217;t ~&nbsp;I won&#8217;t let you die so easy ~]</p>



<p>This is a desert that extends to the west just outside the walls of the royal capital.</p>



<p>Above me, the icy crescent moon shone.</p>



<p>I came to this place with a cross on my back to punish the sinner, and I was carrying other luggage in my hands.</p>



<p>[But, yes it is cold]</p>



<p>When I stopped my humming, I dropped my luggage and covered myself with my black cloak.</p>



<p>In this desert, when the sun shines the heat is scorching, and when it is night, it is cold enough to freeze your body.</p>



<p>As a result, the vegetation did not grow well, and only dried and dead grass could be seen.</p>



<p>What could be seen were hungry coyotes looking for prey.&nbsp;It is a place called &#8220;The Valley of Death.&#8221;</p>



<p>The inhabitants of the capital rarely approached this place.</p>



<p>And if you wonder why I&#8217;m here—–</p>



<p>[I have chosen a good place for you.&nbsp;Look.&nbsp;It&#8217;s on that hill.&nbsp;It can also be enjoyed watching from a distance, and maybe one day the place can become a tourist spot]</p>



<p>[Ughhhh… ..fuu… ..uhh]</p>



<p>[Come on, Victoria.&nbsp;Just try a little harder ~]</p>



<p>I grabbed her white legs that extend from the hem of her dress with both hands, dragging Victoria&#8217;s body as before.</p>



<p>[Uhh… ..auhh… ..]</p>



<p>Victoria with her hands stretched out on her back on the ground, moaned weakly.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been dragging her from the capital, so her back is probably in pain.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t seem to have the energy to scream, and she&#8217;s silent since I cut out her tongue.</p>



<p>Looking at her face for a moment, I saw that her eyes were so full of despair.</p>



<p>[—–Well, we arrived]</p>



<p>I lowered the cross I was carrying, and nailed it firmly to the ground.</p>



<p>[I won&#8217;t let you die ~.&nbsp;I won&#8217;t ~&nbsp;I won&#8217;t let you die so easy ~&nbsp;Fufufufu ~!]</p>



<p>[Uh… ..uguh… ..]</p>



<p>Victoria was trembling.&nbsp;She is natural, she is dressed lightly, and she is also losing blood.</p>



<p>But because I moved around happily, the cold no longer bothered me.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s because I was very excited about this job.</p>



<p>Being in a good mood, I hummed a song and tied Victoria&#8217;s body to the cross.</p>



<p>I tied her limbs with several ropes to prevent her from falling.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s complete!!]</p>



<p>I stepped back a bit and looked at Victoria&#8217;s entire body again.</p>



<p>Her wounds are not closed.</p>



<p>Her dress was dyed red, and having been dragged by me, her clothes are a complete mess.</p>



<p>Hmm.&nbsp;Should I make it a little more painful to recreate &#8220;that day&#8221;?&nbsp;But unlike me, she is a weak princess.</p>



<p>It wouldn&#8217;t make sense for her to die just for overdoing it a bit.</p>



<p>[I guess that&#8217;s fine.&nbsp;I think I&#8217;ll call it &#8220;The Princess Crucified in the Moonlight.&#8221;&nbsp;Pff.&nbsp;Haha!&nbsp;Oh, wow.&nbsp;Am I a romanticist?]</p>



<p>[Uhh… .. Uhh… ..?]</p>



<p>Victoria moaned as if wondering.</p>



<p>[Hm~?&nbsp;Why am I doing something like this?&nbsp;Hey, hey, did you forget?]</p>



<p>That time when you crucified me.&nbsp;You didn&#8217;t even give me the right to die, I only received suffering.</p>



<p>Victoria spent five days with me slowly tormenting me because couldn&#8217;t die so easily due to the divine protection.</p>



<p>[I thought about letting you taste that suffering]</p>



<p>I casted magic on her and applied the &#8220;Curse not to die&#8221; to Victoria again.</p>



<p>This way, it doesn&#8217;t matter if the coyotes devour your flesh or the crows gouge out your eyes, you won&#8217;t die.</p>



<p>[Guhhhh]</p>



<p>[Hm~?&nbsp;Don&#8217;t worry you are not alone.&nbsp;Look closely]</p>



<p>At the point where I pointed, there were the bodies of Dr. Rine Beneke and Sandra.</p>



<p>Their corpses were mummified so they would not rot, and like Victoria, they were crucified.</p>



<p>[Hey?&nbsp;Would be good if there are other people crucified alive?&nbsp;Also do not worry.&nbsp;I&#8217;ll come see you.&nbsp;If I feel like it]</p>



<p>[Uhhh… ..]</p>



<p>[I won&#8217;t let you die unlike what you did to me though]</p>



<p>[Hmm… ..hiiiiiii… ..!]</p>



<p>It&#8217;s the first time Victoria has struggled to resist since I brought her here.&nbsp;It&#8217;s impossible to escape you know</p>



<p>[You must be happy, Victoria.&nbsp;I&#8217;ll give you a special place on my collection shelf]</p>



<p>I stuffed General Ernst&#8217;s remains in a glass jar, and set it to decorate the shelf, so I moved it slightly to make Victoria the center of attention.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t just the general.&nbsp;There were also his subordinates, children, wife and servants.</p>



<p>Items recovered from their bodies are also on display.</p>



<p>I put up a powerful barrier to prevent theft.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m planning to build a museum of revenge here just for me.&nbsp;I can&#8217;t wait to complete it.&nbsp;You also think the same right?]</p>



<p>[Guohh!]</p>



<p>This hill still has enough space.</p>



<p>I licked my dry lips and looked back at the capital.</p>



<p>Well, who will be next to join my collection—-</p>

︎
<p>Hero, about that cruelty</p>



<p>The demon territory, Horrorbarch, had been occupied by the Kurtz&#8217;s kingdom since the demon king was defeated by Raul.</p>



<p>The King of Kurtz, who had pulled all the strings from the shadows, made the innocent demons look evil and invaded Horrorbach.</p>



<p>The demons that are the citizens of the of Horrorbach, received horrible treatment from the kingdom after losing the war.&nbsp;Torture, abuse, slave trade.</p>



<p>Today also in the town near the western border, demon hunting is carried out to obtain goods called slaves.</p>



<p>The captured demons are taken to the slave market, and there they are traded.</p>



<p>[Nooooo… ..!&nbsp;Let go…..!]</p>



<p>A demon girl was forcibly dragged from a house.&nbsp;Such a scene has become common since the defeat.</p>



<p>This is the third time this small town has encountered demon hunting.&nbsp;As the result of the men and women being taken away, even the children&#8217;s fall into the dirty hands of slave traders.</p>



<p>[Stop…..!&nbsp;Please don&#8217;t take my granddaughter!]</p>



<p>[Let me go!&nbsp;Grandmother!&nbsp;Grandma, help me!]</p>



<p>The girl grabbed the door asking her grandmother for help.</p>



<p>The old woman desperately clung to the slave trader, begging him not to take her granddaughter.</p>



<p>The merchant kicked that body of the old woman mercilessly.</p>



<p>[Ahh, Grandma… ..!]</p>



<p>[Shut up!]</p>



<p>[Ah!]</p>



<p>At that moment, someone hold the shoulder of the man who was pulling the girl from behind.</p>



<p>[Hey, don&#8217;t overdo it.&nbsp;There are customers who get noisy because they found injuries and stuff, so treat her with care]</p>



<p>The slave trader who looked back, looked at the figure of a young man who had spoke and took a deep breath.</p>



<p>[Hero-sama!]</p>



<p>The slave trader bowed his head as he held the girl aside.</p>



<p>That young man smiled as he waved his jet black cloak.</p>



<p>The man they called a hero looked around with a haunting smile.</p>



<p>[How many have been caught?]</p>



<p>[Yes.&nbsp;There are 6 women and 4 men]</p>



<p>[Hmm.&nbsp;I guess it&#8217;s fine for a desert town.&nbsp;Only old men and women remain.&nbsp;So we&#8217;re done here, we&#8217;re going]</p>



<p>At that moment, the old vampire whose granddaughter had been taken blocked their way.</p>



<p>[Hero… ..sama… ..Hero-sama, please!]</p>



<p>[Hey, old lady!&nbsp;Don&#8217;t go near Raul-sama!]</p>



<p>The girl&#8217;s grandmother clung to Raul&#8217;s leg in a desperate way, without listening to the slave trader.</p>



<p>[I don&#8217;t care what happens to me… ..!&nbsp;Please don&#8217;t take my granddaughter!&nbsp;She&#8217;s only six years old!&nbsp;She being turn into a slave is something… ..]</p>



<p>[You said it doesn&#8217;t matter what happens to you right?]</p>



<p>The hero stared at the old woman.</p>



<p>[Hahaha!&nbsp;Do not make me laugh!&nbsp;Instead of making money, it will only make me lose it!]</p>



<p>[Gyahahaha!&nbsp;It&#8217;s just like Raul-sama says!]</p>



<p>[You are too arrogant to think you could achieve that!&nbsp;You are not a woman, but a monster!]</p>



<p>The hero who laughed out loud, when he looked at her, he kicked the old woman&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>[Auhh… ..]</p>



<p>[Grandmother!]</p>



<p>The attack did not end with that blow.&nbsp;She was kicked several times, and blood overflowed from the old woman&#8217;s nose and mouth.</p>



<p>[Aguhh!&nbsp;Ugah!]</p>



<p>The old woman quickly became covered in blood and couldn&#8217;t stand up from the ground.</p>



<p>The girl seeing that, tried to stop him while she was very pale.</p>



<p>[Grandmother…..!&nbsp;Stop, I&#8217;ll go… ..!&nbsp;Please don&#8217;t punish my grandmother… ..!]</p>



<p>[Haa?&nbsp;Why is a demon giving me orders !?]</p>



<p>The hero laughed with an even worse face and ordered the slave traders.</p>



<p>[Hey, make her understand a bit.&nbsp;Don&#8217;t kill her]</p>



<p>[Hahaha!&nbsp;Understood!]</p>



<p>[N-Noooooo… ..!]</p>



<p>[Fuhahahahaha!&nbsp;It&#8217;s what you get for opposing humans!]</p>



<p>This time the girl was a victim of violence.</p>



<p>The old woman cried like a beast while on the ground.</p>



<p>Every time the slave traders heard a sound of despair, they laughed happier.</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>——At the same time, in the colosseum in the capital.</p>



<p>Now I am sitting in the special seat of the king, waiting for the beginning of the show that was prepared for me.</p>



<p>The king&#8217;s chair is very comfortable.</p>



<p>As I sank deep into the soft cushion and relaxed, beautiful women brought trays of drinks and fruits.</p>



<p>[This time the execution is in the colosseum at the suggestion of Raul-sama, His Majesty was very satisfied that he said &#8220;Yes, something really interesting occurred to him&#8221;]</p>



<p>While looking at the food, the king&#8217;s Retinue said it firmly.</p>



<p>Enjoying some sweet grapes, I spoke to him to kill time.</p>



<p>[It must be very boring to do the execution in the same place, right?&nbsp;First of all, that plaza has no steps, so it would be disrespectful to the audience behind.&nbsp;If you want to show an execution, the colosseum is the right place]</p>



<p>In the colosseum the audience seats are elevated, so it has a perfect place for everyone to see the show.</p>



<p>[But is it okay for me to have the king&#8217;s seat?]</p>



<p>[Yes.&nbsp;His majesty allowed it]</p>



<p>[Hmm.&nbsp;Good thank you]</p>



<p>As i licked my grape juice covered fingers, the retinue spoke.</p>



<p>[Raul-sama is our savior!&nbsp;The king also praised his great merit.&nbsp;Raul-sama is ours—–]</p>



<p>I slowly looked at the retinue.</p>



<p>[The what?&nbsp;I am your “thing”, something like that, right?]</p>



<p>[Hii… ..]</p>



<p>As i laughed and asked, the retinue turned pale.</p>



<p>[Well?&nbsp;Keep going]</p>



<p>[N-No… ..well… ..]</p>



<p>What are you scared of?</p>



<p>At that moment, the announcement of the beginning of the show was heard.</p>



<p>Thinking that it had finally started, several men being tied from behind were being dragged towards the colosseum.</p>



<p>There are approximately more than one hundred people.&nbsp;Everyone was shivering while their well-trained upper body was exposed.</p>



<p>They are the &#8220;Heroes&#8221; who burned several villages together with the general, but now they ended up that way.</p>



<p>And it&#8217;s funny to see that they are treated like sinners.</p>



<p>[&#8211;Good.&nbsp;I hope there are some great deaths.&nbsp;I want to see a lot of blood everywhere]</p>



<p>I had to drop my prey so I hope it&#8217;s exciting.</p>



<p>Supporting my cheek with my arm on the armrest of the chair, I was very excited about the beginning of the performance.</p>

<p><strong>The Hero, Meeting the King</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">&mdash;&ndash; An hour after the execution.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I went to the king to convey my impressions of today’s show.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The king is currently staying in a corner in a separate field on the south side of Auerbach Castle.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He was always there, and he didn’t move.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I arrived to the king’s room, the guards guarding the door became very nervous.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They don’t have to be so tense, I don’t intend to eat them.&nbsp;For now.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul-sama… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The guards bowed their heads with frightened faces.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The king has called me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes!&nbsp;We are informed of that!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The guards opened the double door and announced my visit.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The hero Raul Evans-sama has arrived]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There is a huge bed in the center of the spacious room.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Putting my hands in my pockets, I casually walked in.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The first thing you notice is the large magic tool that surrounds the bed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A light blue liquid flows into the clear glass container, and several tubes from there are connected to the king’s body.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What is sent into his body is a potion of the highest grade created by the court magicians.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even if he is someone they call the king of kings, he is still a human.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The disease that is devouring his body has already spread all over, so if the potion does not continue to be administered, he will not last five minutes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The innumerable snake-like tubes that extend from the magic tool are the lifelines for the king.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"></p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What did you think, hero?&nbsp;Did you enjoy the show I made for you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The bedridden king asked me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The helpers who were close by for anything, read the atmosphere and backed away.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I stood in the space open to me and looked at the king.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Despite being ill for years, the king’s eyes were still full ambitions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He doesn’t even to try to hide his greedy nature.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Although he is a wrinkled old man, he still believes that the world is his and that everything moves as he expects.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I looked at the poor old man, and opened my mouth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’ll say it wasn’t too bad.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hoo.&nbsp;Those trash that I thought wasn’t useful anymore manage to entertain you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[At first it was rather boring.&nbsp;But when they followed my instructions, it became something than could entertain me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">General Ernst’s subordinates were sentenced to be executed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In that case, their expressions should be more entertaining.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Still, it seems the executioners thought it would be okay if they just killed them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It seems they don’t have enough imagination.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That’s why I ordered them skinned one by one while they were still alive.&nbsp;Then they sewed the skins to make suits.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Those who were skinned while feeling severe pain, were made to wear clothing made of human skin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was amazing to see how they rolled on the ground in a rampage while screaming in pain.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was like a dance of death.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The executioners who were hesitant at first became more enthusiastic by the smell of blood and the cheerings of the spectators.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In the end, let’s say I was able to enjoy that bloody sight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The assembled spectators were happy with what they saw, and I think they were screaming with joy.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[To enjoy the execution of someone they don’t even hold a grudge against, the people of this kingdom are amazing]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Fuhahaha! If you say so.&nbsp;But not as much as you!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I smiled, the king spoke after a little thought.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The evil to commit unimaginable cruelties.&nbsp;You think you are the only one right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The king muttered in a serious tone looking at the ceiling.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What do you mean?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[&mdash;&ndash;Information came that a person calling himself a hero is hunting demons near the border]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hee~&nbsp;I am having fun every day in the capital.&nbsp;Do you think I did it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Taking an arrogant attitude, the king fell silent to think in less than a second.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The man who is hunting demons has been investigated as an imposter.&nbsp;But, it seems that he looks very similar to you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm.&nbsp;That’s a very interesting story]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yes of course.&nbsp;I knew that a long time ago.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But I pretended it’s the first time I’ve heard of it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Still, does he really look similar to me?&nbsp;Although the information I received from a clone that I sent for monitoring said it was like a very degraded version.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At that moment, one of the ministers who is always with the king, said something unnecessary.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If I may, Your Majesty… ..I think it is too early to determine if that demon hunter is an imposter… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Minister Alcott.&nbsp;Who the hell asked for your opinion?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The king was pressuring the minister for what he had done.&nbsp;Wait wait.&nbsp;I don’t want that boring development.&nbsp;So&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ohh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">By snapping my fingers, I activated my dark magic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[…… ..?&nbsp;Ah… .. Agahhahhhahh… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As soon as the minister bent his body, little by little he began to dry out.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And a mummy was completed in no time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">By showing him how the minister died, the king was impressed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Of course, the king himself did not complain to me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[R-Raul-sama?&nbsp;How can you do something like that in front of His Majesty… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I saw the other ministers getting noisy, I shrugged.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, I was wondering if he really was an imposter.&nbsp;It is suspected that I am hunting demons right?&nbsp;How cruel it is to think that a man as kind as me can do that]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I started to laugh, the ministers answered me with pale faces.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Such ruthless behavior… ..!&nbsp;Our king will not be silent!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right!&nbsp;Even Princess Victoria was punished as a result of the same behavior&mdash;&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s okay]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-what?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At the king’s words, the weaklings were confused.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Your Majesty…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Certainly Minister Alcott’s behavior was disrespectful.&nbsp;I apologize on his behalf]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Everyone in the room took a deep breath except me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haha.&nbsp;Don’t worry I don’t mind]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I looked around with an arrogant attitude.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The pale-faced ministers looked away hastily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I don’t understand why they are so confused.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Why did they think the king would punish me?&nbsp;Victoria was abandoned for killing the ministers?&nbsp;It was just a treatment of her as the princess.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This king is not stupid enough to treat me the same way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I moved my line of sight, the king after giggling a little, spoke.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Let’s go back to the main topic.&nbsp;On the case of the impostor… ..apparently, he’s working with the great wizard Wendell, who was your partner.&nbsp;Wendell is now with a merchant named Cameron Allingham, who has a large import business in a port city]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hee~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I had a face that said “This is the an information I didn’t know.”&nbsp;Of course, I already knew everything.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell and Allingham both are in my  list.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It is impossible that i didn’t have information about them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It seems they are making huge profits by selling demons as slaves]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Are they really allowed to do those kinds of things without the king’s permission in this kingdom?&nbsp;Or do you considered them as criminals &mdash;&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right.&nbsp;I can’t allow them to do what they want.&nbsp;If that’s true, they must be crushed, together with the impostor]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The king muttered as he looked at the ceiling.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even if it is a decision to save or kill others, his words were more like an empty tone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Now that the war is over, perhaps he lost interest in Allingham which was not very helpful.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But is that okay with you?&nbsp;He’s a merchant who helped you during the war]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if he was useful during the war, he is now useless when the war ended]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Oh, I understand that very well.&nbsp;Because they treated me exactly the same way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Anyone can carry out the Allingham murder.&nbsp;The problem is the great wizard Wendell.&nbsp;It seems to be difficult to get rid of that.&nbsp;Because he is the best magician in the kingdom.&nbsp;Only someone like you could match him.&nbsp;I think you understand what I mean even if I don’t order it right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The king looked at me with sharp eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yes Yes.&nbsp;You want me to kill them, don’t you?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I mean, I don’t need any requests.&nbsp;No matter who tells me, they are my prey.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t get the wrong idea, king.&nbsp;Don’t add unnecessary things either]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I’ve been thinking about how to cook them in the best way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I tapped his shoulders, and after the king stiffened, he gave a huge laugh.</p>
