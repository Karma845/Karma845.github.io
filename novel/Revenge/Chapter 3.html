<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; After the Saint! ~ A Tour in Hell</h3>

<p><strong>Part 1 &#8211; The Goddess, her Advent</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Well, that’s what happened.&nbsp;I was killed by Theodor.&nbsp;Now I am dead and I am a soul in a fluffy place.&nbsp;This is my third visit to this empty space.&nbsp;I’m getting used to dying.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I had to die again to get revenge on Christiana, but there is a reason why I thought it would be better if Theodor killed me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What will be left when you get your revenge?&nbsp;I wanted to show her that once.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I am very kind to people who seek revenge.&nbsp;So this time I didn’t do it for the fun of it.&nbsp;From my perspective as a senpai, there may or may not be people who are good at revenge.&nbsp;That reckless girl is definitely the latter.&nbsp;I think she must have understood it herself this time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The truth is that I would have liked to explain my feelings verbally, but it was a scenario in which I could not speak.&nbsp;Theodor was completely fooled.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Did she really believe that I would be immobilized by just that?&nbsp;That’s impossible.&nbsp;If I were that weak, i would already be dead from the start.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She was just a little princess pampered and protected by the demon lord.&nbsp;If light magic was my weakness, why can I still use healing magic?&nbsp;She really is a very silly girl.&nbsp;You make that kind of mistake by being too engrossed in revenge.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I don’t want to be misunderstood, I don’t hate Theodor.&nbsp;That is why i could not overlook her half-hearted revenge.&nbsp;To remind her that if she couldn’t break someone, she shouldn’t go to the trouble of revenge.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Is it because that silly attitude resembled me in the past?&nbsp;Maybe because I feel responsible for the death of the demon lord?&nbsp;Or was it some kind of sentiment that I just carry because it was a convenient piece this time?&nbsp;Well, what will be the correct answer?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When he murmured in a space where no one was, a familiar presence approached.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oh I guess she’s finally here?&nbsp;I wonder why she took so long this time to show up?&nbsp;Thanks to that, I’ve been thinking about unnecessary things]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I looked back while complaining.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh!&nbsp;Raul… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The wet-eyed goddess rushed towards me with an ecstatic face, as always.&nbsp;She clung to me without hesitation.&nbsp;But, unlike before, she doesn’t have a left arm.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What happened to your arm?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I offered it as payment to resurrect you.&nbsp;Violating the laws of the divine world requires that something be offered in return.&nbsp;Voice, hair, or part of the body]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul, I will offer anything for you… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The goddess’s cheeks turned red as she held onto me.&nbsp;And in that way, I also hugged her shoulder.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[As I thought, you are a very useful woman]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul!&nbsp;Are you recognizing me !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Sure.&nbsp;If you do me a favor, I may be able to believe a little in love]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What can I make you feel love, Raul… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, I’m hurt because the demon lord’s younger sister betrayed me.&nbsp;Even with your love, it seems quite difficult to heal me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That can’t be…..!&nbsp;What can I do to make you feel better?&nbsp;I’ll do anything!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haha, anything?&nbsp;In that case, there is one more thing I want you to grant me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The corners of my mouth rose naturally.&nbsp;Then immediately I looked away as if in regret.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, well… ..I think it would be asking too much]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s not true!&nbsp;Only when you trust me can I feel my true meaning.&nbsp;Nothing changes the fact that I am an existence just for you.&nbsp;My happiness is everything you want.&nbsp;Now tell me what you want… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Really?&nbsp;This time it’s something quite difficult too]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s okay!&nbsp;Let me offer you my whole body… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Really?&nbsp;…..then]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I brought my lips close to the goddess’s ear.&nbsp;The goddess’s face turned red and I noticed that her temperature had risen.&nbsp;When I told hee my wish, as expected, her body shook.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[S-Something like that is… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I closed her mouth with my hand before the goddess could say anything.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……….]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see that you don’t have the ability to learn.&nbsp;It’s not about whether you can do it or not.&nbsp;Be quiet]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The goddess’s body trembled.&nbsp;It came to this after all.&nbsp;Instead of asking this masochist for something, she is more pleased to forced to do something, so nothing can be done about it.&nbsp;I pulled my hand away from the mouth of the goddess whose gone weak.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul, if it is to help you, I will fulfill your wish by offering my eye as payment!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The goddess pulled out a dagger with magic and looked at me happily, then pierced her right eye herself.</p>



<img src="https://i.ibb.co/985Hqjh/000017.png" height="500" width="350"></img>


<p class="has-text-align-center">I coldly observed that, thinking only of achieving my goal.&nbsp;What a shame for this woman to be supporting someone like me.&nbsp;But, that helps me a lot.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Aauhh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Holding down her crushed right eye as she screamed in pain, the goddess screamed to heaven for me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Chariot that takes the dead to hell, I invoke you!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The neighing of a horse echoed from above, and a chariot engulfed in blue flames descended.&nbsp;A shinigami dressed in black is sitting in the driver’s seat, holding the reins.&nbsp;I could push this guy and take the reins myself, but I decided to leave it to him, and enjoy the carriage ride in style.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I sat in the passenger seat and ordered the driver to the next destination.&nbsp;The shinigami nodded with rattling teeth.&nbsp;It’s funny since even though it has a skull on its head, we can communicate.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[See you, goddess]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Are you leaving now… ..!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[&ndash;Yes.&nbsp;By the way, your face has become more beautiful.&nbsp;That squashed eye makes you stand out, making you more attractive than ever]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She sacrificed herself for me, so I said a few words of praise instead of thanking her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, Raul… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While being dismissed by the goddess, the carriage departed.&nbsp;The next destination is the door of judgment.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2 &#8211; Hellhound Hill</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">As we passed through the gate leading to hell and steadily descended into the lower layers, the purple haze began to disperse little by little.&nbsp;But on the contrary, a stagnant air like that of a cemetery that had drifted from the moment we walked through the door, thickened.&nbsp;Faint clouds float overhead, giving a suffocating and oppressive feeling.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haa.&nbsp;It really feels like hell]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ugh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana, who was sitting next to me, covered her mouth with her hands and puffed out her cheeks.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you doing?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I don’t want to breathe the air of hell as much as possible!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Are you stupid.&nbsp;As if you could avoid it just by putting your hands in your mouth]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s the thought that counts!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ohh.&nbsp;We finally arrived at our first destination after a silly conversation]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I stopped the carriage along some dead trees and lowered Christiana.&nbsp;We climbed a hill while i was forcing Christiana forward, to take her to a special place called “Hellhound’s Hill.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“Uhhhhhhhhh… ..ahh… ..ahhhh… ..uhhhhhhh… ..”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-What’s that creepy voice… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana body shook when she heard a moan out of nowhere.&nbsp;Yeah yeah, good job acting like you’re scared of hell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, Christiana.&nbsp;This forest is a slaughterhouse for those who drowned in lust.&nbsp;I hope the guys you enjoyed a lot are not there ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ohh.&nbsp;I wonder if she has forgotten nah if I remember she has good memory.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I don’t know who you are talking about]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I’m talking about some young mercenaries who worked in the hero’s party when it was formed.&nbsp;They were mercenaries that I had gathered, and originally they were pure and sincere young men.&nbsp;But, this saint seduced and corrupted them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“Yes, that was when I just started the demon king subjugation.”&nbsp;Back then when only Wendell was the only member of my group.&nbsp;I was looking for people to fight together in the towns and cities, and I came across a group of young men in a corner of a tavern.&nbsp;They were talking with frustrated faces while holding drinks.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[They say that the hero’s party sent by the king is recruiting mercenaries?&nbsp;Hmph.&nbsp;Anyway, there is no way it can be us… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if it is to protect the kingdom, it will surely be people who have high status and origin.&nbsp;Haa… ..I wonder if there will be any work out there… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Certainly, the soldiers recruited by the kingdom were, as they said, selected based on their status and origin.&nbsp;But, he was not looking for that in mercenaries.&nbsp;“I want to save the kingdom.”&nbsp;“I want to work for the good of the country.”&nbsp;I wanted to give the opportunity to those who wanted that.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I spoke to them, they wondered who i was, and then I invited them to fight together.&nbsp;They had their eyes wide open, and I think they didn’t respond so easily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, ahhhhh, are you the hero Raul… ..?&nbsp;To think that such a person would speak to us personally… ..but, you heard him right?&nbsp;We have no education or status… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The fact that you are motivated is enough for me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We are just losers who fight a lot.&nbsp;Is that okay with you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I nodded saying “Of course” and smiled.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m from the countryside too.&nbsp;So we are partners]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[R-Really… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes.&nbsp;Rather, this place is quite urban compared to my village.&nbsp;Also, if you say you guys fight a lot, that means you are skilled right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I said that and hit their shoulders, they smiled brightly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes, we are very confident in that!&nbsp;We will work seriously!&nbsp;It will be a pleasure!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We just didn’t have a chance to really want to do something for people]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They got up and we shook hands hard.&nbsp;Actually, they worked pretty seriously.&nbsp;Until Christiana joined the group after three months.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They lost their ambitions for daily duties, and one by one they began to disappear without saying anything.&nbsp;I tried to ask them individually, but instead of answering me, all the mercenaries gradually began to avoid me.&nbsp;In the end, the twenty mercenaries left my side.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At the time, I always thought that I had done something for them to leave, so I didn’t realize what Christiana was doing behind the scenes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Christiana.&nbsp;Tell me, what did you do to them?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What did I do to them?&nbsp;Of course.&nbsp;I gave them pleasure.&nbsp;They always complained about their origin and status, right?&nbsp;Complaining is very sinful, even though the Lord has given them life.&nbsp;So I did it to all of them and purified their dirty souls]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana explained clearly without even feeling guilty at all.&nbsp;If I had asked you back then, would you have answered me honestly?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, when I had already saved them, it was very difficult to deal with it again as they tried to monopolize me.&nbsp;I had to do it with as many people as possible to save their dirty souls.&nbsp;So when I did it with people, I told them “If you love me, then die for me and go to the Lord.”&nbsp;That way they all died, so surely there must be a lot of people I saved in the god realm.&nbsp;Like those mercenaries]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hee.&nbsp;But, it is strange.&nbsp;Christiana, can you tell me what that is?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana looked in the direction I pointed.&nbsp;As we climbed the hill, You could see the punishment in the dead forest.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-What is that… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It seems that not even Christiana could smile naturally.&nbsp;She raised a different voice than usual because she seemed to be surprised, so I laughed a bit.&nbsp;Later, I also observed that unusual sight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Naked humans tries to escaped in the dead forest desperately.&nbsp;What’s tormenting them was the infernal hound of hell, Cerberus.&nbsp;The three heads protruding from its torso that had sharp fangs, kept exhaling fire from its mouth.&nbsp;No matter how desperately you flee, there is no way to escape a huge unknown territory.&nbsp;If they are hit by those thick legs and fall to the ground, it will be the end.&nbsp;Cerberus tore humans apart as he roared.&nbsp;It scattered various parts of it’s victim when it shook its three heads.&nbsp;It seems that that beast thinks that sinful people are completely a toy.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The hellhound seemed to be more excited when the toys screamed, and began to do so more painfully.&nbsp;That’s how it is.&nbsp;Even if you die and become a soul, all your senses will be as they were when you were alive.&nbsp;Of course, pain is also felt.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In the forest, the demons who are the slaughterhouse guards were celebrating when they saw the figures of sinners.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahahahah.&nbsp;Very good!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Scream more!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Use your bodies to entertain us now that you can’t die!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons said that while they were drinking drinks while laughing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That looks good.&nbsp;I will try to imitate them in the next revenge]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, Raul.&nbsp;Let’s go, I don’t want to keep seeing this… ..it’s disgusting]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana tugged on my arm and said it desperately.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm?&nbsp;Are you saying it because of those demons?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That too, but those people… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She slowly pointed her finger at the humans being eaten by the hellhound.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[They are sinners who went against the Lord and did not receive salvation, right?&nbsp;That is why they fell into hell.&nbsp;I don’t want to see that!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmph.&nbsp;Tell me, haven’t you realized who they are?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Look closely.&nbsp;You may remember.&nbsp;As I said before, this is the slaughterhouse for those who drowned in lust.&nbsp;Doesn’t that sound familiar to you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-What do you mean… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh.&nbsp;As I thought, you have forgotten them after doing it with them.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In front of Christiana, I casted a spell a video was then played.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh!&nbsp;More!&nbsp;More…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Immediately, a female voice rang out.&nbsp;In the magically projected video, the “saint” being on top of a man was shaking her hips while her hair was ruffled.&nbsp;In a simple cabin, there were several other men with no garment at all rubbing Christiana’s naked body with an ecstatic expression.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No, this is not enough… ..!&nbsp;In order for everyone to go to the kingdom of God, you have to earn more and more merits… ..Ahh… ..Ahh ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">With a heavy breath and flushed cheeks, Christiana firmly grasped the head of a man who was licking her private part.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Everyone look at body!&nbsp;The body of the saint!&nbsp;That way you can go to heaven… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, holy-sama… .. Even now we are in heaven… ..!&nbsp;Please offer us more of your blessing… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I will, of course I will… ..!&nbsp;So make it harder!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Amid a somewhat strange loud moan, I looked at Christiana.&nbsp;She was smiling calmly even in this situation.&nbsp;I suppose she is worthy of respect for not being disturbed despite showing her ugliness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haha, it seems like you were so crazy about having pleasure that you didn’t care about people’s faces.&nbsp;Well, leaving the others aside, take a close look at your surroundings.&nbsp;Remember their faces well and compare, them to those guys]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I grabbed the saint’s chin and forced her again to look at the sinners.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Look closely.&nbsp;I think you should understand by now]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">There’s no way she’s not getting it.&nbsp;Because the ones who are being tormented by the dog and the demons, are the mercenaries with whom Christiana was having an orgy.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[A lie… ..it’s a lie… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you really saved them, why were they thrown into hell out of lust?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I-It’s impossible… ..!&nbsp;Because that was a holy act!&nbsp;Is it they lusted to the envoy of God?&nbsp;Is that why they went to hell?&nbsp;No, no, it’s not true… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, more, much more… ..that’s right, pleasure is everything… .. Pleasure is salvation!&nbsp;Ahh ~!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana in the video is screaming with joy as she pressed the man’s nose and mouth to her crotch.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uah… ..ohh… ..uhhhhhh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, yes, more, lick more!&nbsp;It feels good…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Being excited, Christiana put her hands on the man’s neck.&nbsp;Christiana’s voice louder as the man found it difficult to breathe.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You killed a lot of people in the same way right?&nbsp;Was it really for salvation?&nbsp;I only see that you satisfied your own pleasure]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-You’re wrong!&nbsp;Surely they did bad things without my knowing!&nbsp;I didn’t know them well, because they are people I only saw once!&nbsp;Even I can’t give salvation up to that point!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Despite her impatience, Christiana desperately argues.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They are people you did not know well, huh?&nbsp;All right, in that case, let’s go to a place where there are people you know very well.</p>

<p><strong>Part 3 &#8211; The Sin of Holy Christiana</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">As we climb back into the carriage, we descend further into the abyss of hell.&nbsp;Christiana was screaming as we passed through the various slaughterhouses where several screams are heard.&nbsp;A slaughterhouse where the legs of traitors are turned into trees, and their body continue to be cut by ice blades.&nbsp;A slaughterhouse where demons cut liars’ tongues in two.&nbsp;A slaughterhouse where mothers who have killed their children were shoved a stone statue of a baby from their crotches to their bellies while screaming in pain.&nbsp;I kept showing Christiana that as the tour of hell continued.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She who was next to me was clearly pale, unlike at first.&nbsp;It was because in every slaughterhouse the people Christiana was supposed to have taken to heaven were being punished.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And when we finally reached our destination, I stopped the carriage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Look closely.&nbsp;This is the slaughterhouse for heretics.&nbsp;I’m sure you know who is there right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ahh, it’s strange.&nbsp;Seeing Christiana screaming, I couldn’t help but laugh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The concept of salvation that Christiana has claimed completely vanished.&nbsp;Seeing that on Christiana face, it felt really good.&nbsp;With eyes wide open, she who seemed to have forgotten how to blink, stared at the scene in front of her eyes.&nbsp;Then, she was quick to deny the fear that came to her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I-It can’t be… ..they can’t be here… ..it’s fake, it’s definitely fake… ..yes, that’s it… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She said it desperately to try to cover it up, but it’s useless.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey.&nbsp;Don’t look away]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I forcibly grab Christiana’s head with both hands toward the slaughterhouse.&nbsp;In this slaughterhouse there is a mountain like a volcano.&nbsp;Between the valleys there is a bridge made of trees that never rot, and it continues to burn in a great endless fire.&nbsp;Even though we are some distance away, you can feel the heat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Those who come here have to cross that burning bridge.&nbsp;But that is not all.&nbsp;Look closely]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The dead are suffering being roasted on the bridge.&nbsp;I pointed to a man and a woman between them.&nbsp;Just when the demons that control this slaughterhouse are closing in on them.&nbsp;A demon was holding an iron bar and began to push the man and woman onto the burning bridge.&nbsp;Naturally, the two of them drown in fire.&nbsp;Uwaa, how cruel.&nbsp;The skin was ripping quickly and began to melt.&nbsp;And due to the intense pain, the two of them fell off the bridge.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Things got worse from there.&nbsp;Beneath the bridge was a pool of boiling blood.&nbsp;After being boiled with boiling blood, they suffer and sink into the pond, in the next moment, the same man and woman appeared intact on the bridge.&nbsp;And they were ordered to cross the burning bridge again.&nbsp;Christiana must know very well who are these men and women who suffer in eternal torture.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t go saying things like they’re imposters.&nbsp;They are definitely your parents]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No, it’s a lie… ..it is a lieeeeee!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana screamed scratching her hair.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why are my father and mother here… ..!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That’s right, that tormented man and woman are Christiana’s parents, whom she is supposed to have sent into the kingdom of God.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahahaha.&nbsp;Do you really need to ask why?&nbsp;Don’t you know that either?&nbsp;It’s because they worshiped a heretic and killed several people]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Heretic…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Of course, I mean you.&nbsp;Your parents killed all the people who were in your way according to your orders, didn’t they?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-You’re wrong… ..that was not killing, but salvation… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You really not listening aren’t you?&nbsp;In that case, why are your parents in hell?&nbsp;What happened to a happy life in the kingdom of God?&nbsp;Is this suffering more painful than death in hell the happy life you talked about so much?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..ahhhh… ..ahh… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana’s face begun to turn pale.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Father! Mother!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana then jumped out of the carriage.&nbsp;And she rushed towards without hesitation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Lie… ..it’s a lie… ..it’s not real… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Seeing Christiana shivering and crouching, the two fighting in the blood bog screamed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahhhhhhhhh!&nbsp;Y-Youuuuuuuuu!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiii]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Christiana… ..because of you… ..it was all because you lied on us… ..we…]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana’s father coming out of the blood bog grabbed his daughter’s ankle.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Noooo!&nbsp;No, stop!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It was because you told us to disposed what was in the way!&nbsp;You said it was for the family and humanity to be happy!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There is no god!&nbsp;We are here because of you!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Noooooooo!&nbsp;Stop it, your melted skin is disgusting!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana raised her little leg and kicked her own father’s hand.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Guahhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The father screamed and fell, and at the same time collided with his wife, causing both of them to sink deep into the swamp of blood.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..ahhh… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana with a silly face sat up on the spot.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey hey, you shouldn’t kick your parents]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No… ..they are not my parents!&nbsp;They are not if they are in hell!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But you know, it was you who sent them to hell]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You’re wrong!&nbsp;My father and mother went to the kingdom of God!&nbsp;That’s how it is!&nbsp;I don’t know those guys!&nbsp;It’s disgusting that they touched my body!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have saved many sinners with that body right?&nbsp;So, you should let them touch you and in that way give them salvation]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No way!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana started screaming nonsense while shaking her hair.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m the one who decides who to save and who not to!&nbsp;Those who have not been chosen by me fall to hell, like you and them!&nbsp;The people I chose are happy!&nbsp;My real parents are being blessed by the goddess in the realm of god!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahahahahahaha!&nbsp;The blessing of the goddess?&nbsp;Oh wow, that’s amazing]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I would have liked to see her face if she knew that that goddess is a total masochist who is obsessed with me.&nbsp;After having laughed a lot, I put my hand on Christiana’s shoulder.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I did laugh a lot, but everything you’ve said goes against your position as the saint, doesn’t it?&nbsp;You are very cruel to abandon those who seek salvation.&nbsp;You have to take responsibility to the end.&nbsp;Look, they are asking you to save them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I grabbed Christiana’s hair, I pulled her down, dragging her to the edge of the swamp.&nbsp;Being on the ground, she looked at the swamp of blood.&nbsp;Right in front of her eyes, bubbles gushed out of the swamp.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gob, gob… ..gob… ..hot, hot!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Look.&nbsp;Your parents have returned to see their cute daughter ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana’s parents who melting in the swamp are trying to crawl out of that place.&nbsp;But, it wasn’t just them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Saint… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Christiana… ..you lied on me… ..you said we would be together.&nbsp;You said that we would be happy… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The dead who fell to hell began to emerge one after another from the swamp.&nbsp;They are trying to stretch their melted arms and drag Christiana with them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Nooooooooooooooo!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Christiana backed away as she screamed loudly.&nbsp;I heard a splashing sound, it seems like she peed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, what a waste.&nbsp;That’s the holy water that you gave your followers to drink, right?&nbsp;Is it okay to spill it like that?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul, help me!&nbsp;Bring the carriage!&nbsp;Take me back to where we started!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m going to the kingdom of God!&nbsp;The lord will come to pick me up!&nbsp;Absolutely!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What the hell is she saying?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It looks like you are an idiot.&nbsp;If you were someone who is destined to the kingdom of god, then you would not have been able to cross the gate of hell]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-What…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The moment you entered this world, it was decided that you would go to hell.&nbsp;Even if you receive the judgment, that won’t change]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[T-Thay can’t be…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have corrupted so many people in the name of salvation.&nbsp;It was the most obvious outcome right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… …..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Listen well, Christiana.&nbsp;You were wrong.&nbsp;You are not a saint.&nbsp;You are just a witch drowning in her own greed.&nbsp;It was no one but the same god you believed in who concluded that.&nbsp;That’s why you’re in hell like this.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While Christiana was stunned, the hands of the dead that came out of the swamp and grabbed her feet.&nbsp;Now you can’t kick this time.&nbsp;Because they are not just one or two.&nbsp;Dozens of dead are coming out of the pool of blood to drag you with them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No… ..no… .. Let go of me… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Little by little Christiana’s body sinks into the pool of blood.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!]</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Hearing that great sincere scream, I smiled widely.&nbsp;It was a scream that I couldn’t hear when she was burned to death.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yes, this is it, this is what I was looking for.&nbsp;Ahh.&nbsp;It feels so good!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">All right, this is the end of my revenge against Christiana.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She drowns in the swamp of blood, from where she returns to the burning bridge, and she falls to the swamp once again.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That suffering will repeat itself for all eternity.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You will continue to receive the pleasure of drowning in the bloody swamp of Hell as you burn.&nbsp;This would be a fruitful retribution]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I turned my back on the slaughterhouse listening to the screams of the dead and the roars of the demons.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">All right, now who’s next &mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I thought about the figure of the king being connected to those tubes, I licked my lips&mdash;&ndash;</p>
