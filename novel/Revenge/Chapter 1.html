<h3> Chapter 1&#8211; Slave Demon Rebellion</h3>

<p><strong>Part 1 &#8211; The Nature of the Allingham Merchant</strong></p>



<p>Horrorbach was once the territory of the demon king, but is now an occupied territory of Kurtz&#8217;s empire.</p>



<p>Most of the captured demons were sent to the port city of Trout near the border with Kurtz.</p>



<p>To the west of Trout there is a concentration camp built to contain the demons, who are prisoners of war.</p>



<p>After the war, merchant Cameron Allingham personally purchased the concentration camp, turning it into a facility for managing the merchandise called &#8220;slaves.&#8221;</p>



<p>The captured demons are forced to do hard labor at the facility until they get a buyer.</p>



<p>Aristocrats and wealthy merchants come to the facility every day in search of demon slaves.</p>



<p>There were several reasons why they wanted demon slaves.&nbsp;For one thing, the price was cheap.</p>



<p>For example, if you buy a human slave of the same age and sex, you must pay almost ten times more than a demon slave.</p>



<p>Also, once they are purchased, and if they are sick, no returns can be made.</p>



<p>There is also a &#8220;trial period&#8221; for demon slaves.</p>



<p>Since demon slaves can be chosen between two options, rent or buy, there are many aristocrats who decide to rent.</p>



<p>And if for some reason they end up breaking them, insurance will apply.</p>



<p>Also, because they are not human, but inferior demons, they will not feel guilty even if they are treated badly.</p>



<p>They could break them like they were throwing away cheap, replaceable tools.</p>



<p>Due to such advantages, demon slaves are useful as disposable items, and they have been successful as an auxiliary business.</p>



<p>And again today, several carriages arrived at the facility with dim light and strange smell that were transporting the captured demons.</p>



<p>Only the carriage in front was luxurious, and the others following it were carriages in very bad shape.&nbsp;The demons were shackled on their hands and feet.</p>



<p>As the coachman pulled on the reins, the carriage, which did not slow down due to the weight, slowly came to a screeching halt.</p>



<p>The demons being worried, they looked around in fear.&nbsp;But, they did not try to escape.</p>



<p>On the way here, those who tried to escape were brutally murdered and it was shown over and over again as a warning of what would happen if the same were attempted.</p>



<p>The demons all gasped and stared, a man in a black cloak appeared from the front carriage.</p>



<p>[All right]</p>



<p>The man who came down with agile steps —– is the false hero whose existence has already been made known in the royal capital.</p>



<p>As he stretched, the Allingham merchant ran over to him.</p>



<p>Every time the false hero saw that way of running with excessive sway, it irritated him a lot.</p>



<p>Of course, he did not say such sentiments, and he waved his hand gently.</p>



<p>That man with a shaved beard, painted lips and you could tell that he used makeup even for his eyes.</p>



<p>He blinked continuously with eyes with long lashes, and he always wore a heavy perfume that made his head ache.</p>



<p>That expensive silk suit he was wearing gave off a dazzling, vulgar sheen.&nbsp;So is.&nbsp;When describing this man, there is no better word than &#8220;vulgar.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Welcome back, hero-chan.&nbsp;How was the harvest this time?]</p>



<p>[Yes.&nbsp;There are many girls]</p>



<p>[Wow!&nbsp;That sounds great!&nbsp;I&#8217;ll take care to educate them strictly later!]</p>



<p>[Heavens, I really can&#8217;t understand that nature of yours at all]</p>



<p>Allingham laughed suspiciously through a distorted mouth.</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s great to see an innocent child cry with a terrified face.&nbsp;Lick those tears, suck them, fufufufu ~]</p>



<p>[Just make sure to do it moderately.&nbsp;I don&#8217;t want the value of the product to be reduced]</p>



<p>[I know ~.&nbsp;I&#8217;ll just taste it a little ~.&nbsp;I won&#8217;t eat it all to the end ~]</p>



<p>Behind such conversation, the demons in the carriage are beaten with whips and thrown to the ground.</p>



<p>The poor demons all bet gathered their scared faces and closed their eyes to endure the difficult moments.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, their suffering has only just begun.</p>



<p>From now on, all their belongings will be confiscated, leaving them naked.</p>



<p>Those who tried to resist were beaten mercilessly with sledgehammers, and some were beaten to death.</p>



<p>Those who are killed are those who are sick, weak when transported, or of low commercial value.</p>



<p>By killing only a few, many demons can be made to quietly obey, making it quite effective.</p>



<p>It was business, but Allingham enjoyed the act itself.&nbsp;Also, the prey that Allingham likes is a bit special.</p>



<p>He was still searching while licking his lips.&nbsp;Right after that, his favorite development happened.</p>



<p>A girl who was peeing from fear.&nbsp;It was a girl with many freckles who sat shivering.&nbsp;Looking at her, the fake hero just thought &#8220;Ahh.&#8221;</p>



<p>In this Allingham controlled facility, he controlled their destiny.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, that girl&#8217;s fate has been exhausted.</p>



<p>In Allingham&#8217;s case, he always likes to kill children so he can show off.</p>



<p>Even if it looks better, it&#8217;s just the taste of another hell, so I might be happier to die here.</p>



<p>[She&#8217;s urinating, gross!]</p>



<p>A supervisor who noticed the appearance of the girl, went to her with an irritated face.</p>



<p>The man held a mallet covered in blood.&nbsp;The man grabbed the girl&#8217;s hair, lifted her, and swings his mallet.</p>



<p>Immediately after, the girl&#8217;s body fell to the ground with a thud.</p>



<p>[Huh!]</p>



<p>[It is not over yet!]</p>



<p>[Ahh… ..!&nbsp;D-Stop… ..!&nbsp;It hurt…..!]</p>



<p>As she screamed, the mallet hit her several times.&nbsp;However, he was holding back so that she would not die easily.</p>



<p>Killing to show off is more effective as it takes longer.&nbsp;So it is done slowly until it is killed.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a young man who escaped from the group of slaves jumped up, covering the beaten girl.</p>



<p>He looked a lot like the girl, as well as in hair color and face.&nbsp;It&#8217;s probably her brother.</p>



<p>A disgusting laugh leaked from Allingham&#8217;s mouth, who was watching everything.</p>



<p>[Fufu.&nbsp;This kind of development is more than welcome]</p>



<p>Allingham was even more excited when someone came out like this.</p>



<p>If he kills them, the sense of despair that spreads among the slaves will increase even more.&nbsp;His eyes glowed brightly.</p>



<p>Even the brother was still a child.&nbsp;Not caring about that, he taught them the ruthless power of an adult.&nbsp;It tore at their skin, the reddish flesh was visible.</p>



<p>In the end, the brother and sister died in full suffering.&nbsp;They were lying on the ground, they could only cry, but afterwards, nothing was heard.</p>



<p>From the frightened eyes of demons, hope is completely lost.</p>



<p>After all, killing children is the best way to break their spirits.</p>



<p>[Hmm.&nbsp;It&#8217;s a show as spectacular as ever]</p>



<p>Allingham went to the trouble to crouch down next to brother and sister, put his hand on those wrists that were only skin and bones, and confirmed that they were completely dead.</p>



<p>Then he wiped the blood from his fingers with a handkerchief, and looked back at the false hero.</p>



<p>The naked demons are cleaned in a room and then transferred to a room called the &#8220;testing room&#8221; in the facility where they are priced based on their age, gender, and appearance.</p>



<p>Allingham and the false hero also went to the testing room to participate.</p>



<p>[Will Wendell also participate in this?]</p>



<p>[Wendell-chan is here!]</p>



<p>In the stone corridor leading to the evaluation room, screams and anger could be heard both day and night.&nbsp;That was absolutely necessary.</p>



<p>[However, to think that they would catch the saint.&nbsp;They will surely give you a witch trial.&nbsp;I am surprised that such an innocent girl as her is a witch]</p>



<p>[Yes.&nbsp;Christiana.&nbsp;That king is very perceptive.&nbsp;No matter what evils you do behind the shadows, they will eventually catch you</p>



<p>[Truth be told, when I first heard the story, I thought you were caught out of revenge]</p>



<p>[Why do you think so]</p>



<p>The false hero laughed and told Allingham all knowledge about the true hero.</p>



<p>[I am an avenger.&nbsp;I have my own rule of returning everything they did in the same way.&nbsp;The game is more exciting if you create restrictions]</p>



<p>[Give back everything they did huh?&nbsp;So Wendell-chan is your target for revenge right?]</p>



<p>Apparently, Allingham seems to know what happened between &#8220;The hero and the great wizard Wendell.&#8221;</p>



<p>When the fake hero nodded while laughing weakly, he lightened his shoulders as if he was relieved.</p>



<p>[Wow.&nbsp;I&#8217;m paying him to be my escort, so I&#8217;ll be in trouble if he disappears.&nbsp;I can&#8217;t find a substitute for the strongest magician]</p>



<p>[Yes, he is strong.&nbsp;Even I would have problems]</p>



<p>[Will she not be caught by the king?]</p>



<p>[It must be nice.&nbsp;Christiana had a great influence on the public.&nbsp;There were many devout followers.&nbsp;So she couldn&#8217;t be set free, but Wendell is a plain and boring man who likes wealth and fame.&nbsp;It is more convenient for the king to let him dance in the palm of his hand than to eliminate it]</p>



<p>[Ahaha.&nbsp;That&#8217;s true ~]</p>



<p>Allingham laughed in a high-pitched voice.</p>



<p>[Hey, tell me something.&nbsp;When you were executed, Wendell-chan, the saint and Princess Victoria were there, right? Don&#8217;t you hate them?]</p>



<p>[Not really.&nbsp;It was because of the situation.&nbsp;They had no choice but to obey the princess.&nbsp;First of all, if I hated them, I couldn&#8217;t do business like now]</p>



<p>[I get it.&nbsp;I was surprised that you were interested in business]</p>



<p>[I want money too.&nbsp;Revenge costs money you know]</p>



<p>[I see!]</p>



<p>Allingham seems to be convinced after hearing it.</p>



<p>[But, to think that the hero and the great wizard who overcame the difficulties to save the kingdom and defeated the demon king, are now selling slaves.&nbsp;Haha, what a laugh]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s because I knew about the stupidity of living in innocence]</p>



<p>The false hero suddenly looked at Allingham&#8217;s chest.</p>



<p>[What is that?]</p>



<p>[Eh?&nbsp;What?]</p>



<p>[That over there]</p>



<p>The fake hero pointed to the chest pocket of Allingham&#8217;s suit.</p>



<p>In that area, there is a red spot.</p>



<p>[Ahaha, this?&nbsp;You&#8217;ll see]</p>



<p>When Allingham&#8217;s cheeks turned red and he began to move back and forth a little, he pulled out what was inside.</p>



<p>[I took the little finger of the little girl from earlier.&nbsp;Isn&#8217;t it small and cute?&nbsp;She was very unpleasant, but this finger is very good.&nbsp;I&#8217;ll dip it later in a preservation solution and use it to decorate my room]</p>



<p>The fake hero&#8217;s movements stopped for a moment with a smile on his face.</p>



<p>When Allingham was in doubt about what was going on, shortly after, a few sighs came out of the false hero&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>[Hero-chan?]</p>



<p>[Damn, that&#8217;s being too depraved.&nbsp;It even gave me some chills]</p>



<p>It seems that Allingham took it as a compliment, he moved his waist as if dancing.</p>



<p>[I guess now we will do the usual]</p>



<p>[Yes of course]</p>



<p>[Well, I&#8217;ll go to the bathroom for a bit. You go ahead]</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s okay ~.&nbsp;Wendell-chan is here already, so don&#8217;t be late]</p>



<p>[I know]</p>



<p>After saying goodbye, he turned leftm</p>



<p>Although the false hero walked slowly and calmly, his pace gradually increased.</p>



<p>(Damn. Calm down… ..! You have to calm down!)</p>



<p>When he finally opened the bathroom door and walked in, his face was pale and his forehead was sweating.</p>



<p>He couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.&nbsp;He got down on his knees, and vomited into the toilet.</p>



<p>[Oeh!&nbsp;Oehhhhhh!]</p>



<p>An unpleasant, yellow substance dispersed.&nbsp;Physiological tears spilled out unintentionally.</p>



<p>[Uhh… ..kuh… ..oehhh… ..]</p>



<p>While vomiting many times, the false hero expelled everything in his stomach.</p>



<p>His face was covered in vomit and tears.</p>



<p>When he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand, the false hero leaned against the wall, breathing heavily.</p>



<p>A sour smell drifted in the surroundings mixed with the smell of urine taped to the wall.</p>



<p>[Shit…..]</p>



<p>That Allingham who smiled at having picked up the girl&#8217;s finger.&nbsp;As soon as he remembered those ecstatic eyes and that infamous smile, he began to feel nauseous again.</p>

︎<p><strong>Part 2 &#8211; The False Hero vs The Real Hero</strong></strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Even if he expelled everything in his stomach, the constant intense beating of his heart did not stop.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haa… ..Haa… .. What am I doing… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This cannot go on.&nbsp;In the unlikely event that he vomits in front of Allingham or Wendell, and they discover that he is an imposter, his plan would be ruined.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I have to stick with them until they can attract the real hero]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He had to avoid the situation where they discover his true identity due to his weakness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The fake hero took a deep breath, and hit himself around the chest.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Hate your weak heart.&nbsp;Until you meet your goal, no matter what happens, no matter what they show you, you won’t back down.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[How pathetic I am.&nbsp;Anyway, I must calm down… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He closed his eyes and exhaled slowly.&nbsp;This is no time to think useless things.&nbsp;While saying that to himself, he somehow put on the mask of the “ruthless hero” again.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When he spat out the remaining sour saliva, he rinsed his mouth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And then, when trying to get out of the bathroom&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hi there.&nbsp;Are you feeling a little more refreshed already?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Suddenly, a voice was heard from behind, and he looked back reflexively.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As soon as he saw a person in his field of vision, the false hero widened his eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Black hair, with a fervent face.&nbsp;A look that grants and pierces all despair &mdash;&ndash; that man was the true hero Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He cannot be mistaken.&nbsp;Because he’s seen that face in the mirror every day since he started using replication magic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s my pleasure too meet you, fake me.&nbsp;You seem to be doing various things impersonating me.&nbsp;Those rumors have  even reached the capital]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The true hero Raul was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have a good face.&nbsp;But, you have a long way to go before you can imitate me.&nbsp;For example, preparation and mental strength]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He was hearing the words of insult that seemed to see everything, and his head got so hot that it was like he was on fire.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He wondered how long has he’s been here, but there was no time think of that he has been waiting for this man.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He put his hand in his pocket.&nbsp;The tip of his finger touched the handle of a dagger.&nbsp;Those movements were instantaneous.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He gripped the dagger firmly, and attacked Raul.&nbsp;I’m going to kill you.&nbsp;He thought so instinctively.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Why is the hero Raul in this place?&nbsp;Even that no longer mattered to him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(There’s no way I can beat him… .. Still!)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He couldn’t stop the feelings of hatred from arising.&nbsp;But, driven by a single wish, he attacked like a beast.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">However, just before the tip of the blade reached Raul’s skin, his body solidified like ice and he was unable to move at all.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, it was a big change.&nbsp;It’s the same face of being filled with revenge and the feeling  of ending this cursed world]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(He blocked my movements with dark magic… ..? At what moment did he activate it !?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It wasn’t just that.&nbsp;He wasn’t even able to speak.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Did he cast the magic at the same time without reciting the incantation… ..?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was magic that restricts movement and magic that makes him silence.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He has never met a human who can activate both at the same time and without reciting the incantation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(I can’t believe it… ..this man, even though he uses dark magic, shows no killing intent)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That is why it is terrifying.&nbsp;The fact that there is no need to get carried away by emotions means that he was the same as darkness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(There is no way I can win… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The heart of the false hero that was filled by hatred is crushed.&nbsp;No matter how much strength he put in, his arms wouldn’t stop shaking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The body of the false hero was moving against his will and handed his dagger to Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Huh?&nbsp;That’s it? Is that magic just to change appearance?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kuh… .. Let go of me… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The fake hero screamed with his throat being squeezed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you really could have copied my skills, it would have been interesting as a me vs me.&nbsp;Can’t you use magic to that point?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The real Raul showed a smile while enjoying it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m not a monster like you.&nbsp;There is no way I can do such a thing… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You treat me like a monster huh?&nbsp;I like it!&nbsp;Doesn’t sound bad at all!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul was playing with the knife he got from the impostor, but he suddenly pointed it at him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A crisp sensation touches the fake hero’s white neck.&nbsp;His body was terrified.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Will he slit my next.&nbsp;He suddenly realized the big mistake he has made.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Why was he such a fool?&nbsp;How many hundreds of lives was lost because of his error of judgment?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While immersed in despair, Raul laughed merrily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What’s up with that face?&nbsp;What you don’t want to die?&nbsp;So try to persuade me a bit]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Persuade…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Beg me to spare your life]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul, who was turning the knife in his hand with skill, released the magic that he had put on the false hero.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Apparently, Raul left him alive on a whim.&nbsp;Even if I could convince him, I don’t think there was any way to get to the heart of this man.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Depending on how he handle things, he could take away the opportunity that was given to him, and it would not be strange if he killed him at any moment.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">How should I get out of this?&nbsp;&mdash;&ndash; Should act as idiot or something?&nbsp;It seems this man didn’t mind humiliation as long as he can survive.&nbsp;The fake hero who took a deep breath, got on his knees in front of Raul and bowed his head.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m soooooo sorry!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was easy to stir emotions and shed tears.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If you fail here again, everything will really end.&nbsp;Thinking about that, his tears came out.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The false hero sniffled, cried, and repeatedly apologized.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m sorry!&nbsp;I wanted money!&nbsp;I wanted to earn money!&nbsp;I pretended to be the hero and threatened so I could join the ranks of Allingham and Wendell!&nbsp;D-Don’t kill me!&nbsp;I will do anything!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Should I lick your shoes?&nbsp;If it’s so you can forgive me, then… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul felt chills and looked at him with cold eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It that does not work…..&nbsp;Then…..!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He really wanted to show that he could do it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When he opened his mouth, the hero began to laugh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Pff!&nbsp;Ahahahahahahaha!&nbsp;That’s right that method.&nbsp;What are you supposed to do with someone else’s face !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..ahhhh… .. I’m sorry!&nbsp;I’m sorry!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No, no, well, it doesn’t matter.&nbsp;The prostration was quite funny]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[So, will you forgive me… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, for now, get up]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul had a friendly smile and slapped the fake hero’s shoulders.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I want to correct something first, I am not a mass murderer.&nbsp;It’s not that just kill anyone because i wants to.&nbsp;Certainly your existence is quite ridiculous and irritating.&nbsp;Because you have prostrated yourself using my face]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-Yes… ..it’s like you say… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He apologized while being scolded.&nbsp;He had a miserable appearance and demeanor, it really seems like that’s his personality.&nbsp;But, that was more convincing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Now I will tell you something very important, so remember it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-Yes!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I just give back what they did.&nbsp;I am imposing that rule to myself to do nothing else.&nbsp;Because if not, it would not be revenge, it would be simple murder.&nbsp;But, I am not satisfied at all.&nbsp;Do you understand?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Do twisted ones have their own twisted way of acting?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What nonsense.&nbsp;I do not care about that.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But on the outside, he only nodded multiple times.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Actually, I’m having trouble dealing with damn traitors when I follow that rule]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul continued in a light tone that didn’t seem to be in trouble at all.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There are some who have pulled strings from the shadows and caused tragedies.&nbsp;They are involved in a massacre, they make a profit, they look forward to the death of a person with great joy, but despite that, those bastards didn’t do much of a thing]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">With a hauntingly radiant smile, Raúl put his hand on the false hero’s shoulder.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You see, I have a little request to make to you.&nbsp;Fake hero-kun]</p>

︎<p><strong>Part 3 &#8211; Dark Demon</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">(A request?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While his shoulder was being held, he turned his gaze towards the hero, and gave a nervous laugh.&nbsp;His legs were shaking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The fake hero was thinking desperately as he continued his miserable victim performance.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(He said something about “Deal with those traitorous bastards”)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That means this man has not forgiven the great wizard Wendell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell is the guy who went to the princess’s side and created the plan that made it possible to capture the hero.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even when they were in a group, it seems that he had betrayed Raul several times behind the scenes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While investigating the relationship between the two, there were so many acts of vulgar betrayal.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And thinking that such trash was in the Heroes Party made him laugh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm?&nbsp;Hey, Are you listening to me?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah.&nbsp;Y-Yes!&nbsp;Of course!&nbsp;If you promise to spare my life, I’ll listen to whatever you want… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see, I see.&nbsp;Glad to hear that answer.&nbsp;So, I’ll start with the concrete explanation]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul continued speaking while still holding onto the false hero’s shoulder.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I will do my best to make your revenge perfect.&nbsp;So, let me see the stage in the front row]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh?&nbsp;Revenge…..?&nbsp;W-What is he talking about?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">His mouth contracted involuntarily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul narrowed his eyes, and smiling like a demon, he brought his face closer.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I think you already know that.&nbsp;You can’t keep repeating the same thing over and over.&nbsp;I get bored easily.&nbsp;Or did you think that you could do it all with words alone without taking action?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When this man’s eyes catch you, the words won’t come out as expected.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The false hero felt cold sweat run down his back.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Not yet… ..not yet… ..no… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If you accept it easily, it will be a lie.&nbsp;You must not let yourself be enveloped by this man’s aura.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(I must resist. I must pretend to be an idiot who wants to hide the truth)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Saying that to his heart, the false hero broke his expression.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Please, hero-sama, I’m just someone who has some confidence in his replication magic.&nbsp;Even if they hold a grudge against me, I don’t have that kind of feeling.&nbsp;Well, certainly looking at the rich and arrogant nobles makes me want to curse them, but&mdash;&ndash; !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Suddenly, his mouth was sealed and the fake hero was confused.&nbsp;This must also be from magic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Because the mouth is not closed, saliva constantly falls from both ends of the lips.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was too humiliating that his head was heating up.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This is completely different than when he leaned over and try to licked his shoe.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Because that was a performance)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But, this shame was obligatorily given.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul smiled and looked at the fake hero.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As he watched that scene, it made him excited.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, how about you talk honestly?&nbsp;We hate the same enemy after all]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Dripping saliva stained his clothes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Also, you’ve tried to draw me in because you couldn’t defeat Allingham and Wendell alone, right?&nbsp;You went to the trouble of disguising yourself as me, and spread information that an imposter was hunting demons.&nbsp;You carefully let the witnesses escape.&nbsp;In that way, you thought the real one would come out when angry right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Agah… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After all, it seems that he thoroughly investigated the motives of the “false hero”.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, I’m not angry at all.&nbsp;I have always been a very kind person]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The fake hero was shocked as he heard those words.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(You call this being nice?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">His words and his attitude are very different.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haha.&nbsp;Don’t look at me with those eyes.&nbsp;I’m very sane, I’m not kidding.&nbsp;I am admitting that you are someone with the same tastes]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… .. Ah!&nbsp;Agah… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, I know, I know.&nbsp;I think it is better to sit down and speak calmly]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul released his magic by returning his mouth to normal.&nbsp;Quickly, the fake hero wiped his saliva-covered mouth with the back of his hand.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After confirming the appearance of the false hero, and nodding satisfactorily, Raul looked around.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if I said that, there are only toilets that can serve as chairs.&nbsp;You knelt a little while ago, but I got past that.&nbsp;So&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Raul snapped his fingers, an enormous amount of magical power surged out along with the smoke.&nbsp;Nothing could be seen in an instant.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(What is he doing this time?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As he got a little cautious, the smoke was beginning to disperse.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Looking at what appeared after the smoke cleared, the fake hero took a deep breath.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They were supposed to be in a dirty bathroom, but it had suddenly become a refreshing little room.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Come on, sit down]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul showed a round table in the center of the room.&nbsp;Even if you try to resist, you will be forced to obey due to magic.&nbsp;While smiling in that space, he sat down on the chair.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Raul snapped his fingers again, a tea set appeared on the table.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It wasn’t something that could fit the situation.&nbsp;But, not caring about that, Raul happily started making tea.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait a minute.&nbsp;It will soon be ready]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He was strangely good at it.&nbsp;Raul, who was humming a song in good spirits, raised his face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I learned it from my sister.&nbsp;The tea she prepared was very delicious]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Are you talking about your murdered sister?&nbsp;If so, there is information about it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul’s expression was surprisingly gentle as he was remembering his sister who died unfortunately.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Although for the false hero, even that attitude that was reflected was somewhat creepy… ..</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I can’t say it tastes that good, but I’m not as bad as it sounds either.&nbsp;Here]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A cup of tea was placed in front of the false hero.&nbsp;He may be poisoned.&nbsp;Being cautious, Raul took a sip of the same tea.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It seems that the result was satisfactory, Raul spoke after crossing his legs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[First, I’ll let you choose.&nbsp;Will you reveal your identity and admit your revenge or do you want me to do it for you?&nbsp;Decide.&nbsp;Ahh, yes, that appearance]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Before he could respond, Raul raised his hand.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Thinking about what he was doing, the false hero’s entire body was covered in his magic power.&nbsp;Then, the magic surrounds his body was forcibly undone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(You must be kidding… .. Can this man also cancel the magic that others use?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I was totally convinced.&nbsp;The hero Raul is definitely the strongest in the world.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And to think that such an existence became an avenger who lost his heart&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Surely Raul would find it easy to destroy the world if he wanted to.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The false hero was trembling at that overwhelming power.&nbsp;He really craved the power to achieve his goal.&nbsp;However, he may have picked the wrong person.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(What I have called is a demon with a terrifying evil power… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The dark demon immediately laughed after easily canceling the false hero’s magic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Alright, now introduce yourself again &mdash;&ndash; miss]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Saying the word “miss”, Raul made a slight smile.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Looking at herself in the mirror in the corner of the room, a girl with a simple face had a complex expression.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The transformation magic is completely canceled.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She had brown hair, with freckles scattered across her white cheeks.&nbsp;Small eyes somewhat distant and short.&nbsp;An ordinary looking country girl, Ada Taylor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That was the true name of the girl reflected in the mirror.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Now how about we begin, Ada?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Calling her that before she could introduce herself, Ada shrugged.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, I’ll ask you to drop that attitude from before, also that performance.&nbsp;I’m bored already]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The girl was caught by the cold gaze that Raul showed for a moment.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It would really all end if he lost interest.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If you’ve already gotten bored with my boot-licking attitude, all that’s left is to do the opposite.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She breathed slowly and braced herself.&nbsp;Her next role is “a girl who has been seen through, her tricks and her true identity revealed.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see you knew it all along.&nbsp;How did you discover my identity?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There is a limited number of magic replication users.&nbsp;I checked out a list of those who could use it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In this kingdom, permission is required to use advanced magic.&nbsp;When you learn magic of S-Rank or higher, you are obliged to go to the specialized national institution and register it.&nbsp;If advanced magic that is not registered is used, the magic detectors installed in various places will react immediately and the person responsible will be caught immediately as a serious crime, and when if is an ordinary person with no intention of attempting against the country, he or she will not be exempt. Of course, Ada signed up too.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I am very sure that the information in the records of the national institution is not available to ordinary people]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It seems that being a “friend of the king” I am not considered someone ordinary]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Befriending the person who treated his daughter cruelly.&nbsp;His majesty is out of his mind]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haha!&nbsp;Talking to the king like that.&nbsp;Interesting!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada sighed while Raul laughed happily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul did not change his mood, even if he took a cold attitude.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At the moment, the attitude she is taking does not seem to be the wrong one.&nbsp;She made that judgment while looking at him somewhat distantly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if you investigated it in the logs, you still shouldn’t know it’s me.&nbsp;How did you identify me?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Among the registrants of the replication magic, I looked for who had a grudge against Allingham and Wendell.&nbsp;I investigated them one by one.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That behavior was practically obsessive, and he said it like it was nothing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After all, Ada thought that this man has really lost his mind.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But wait a minute.&nbsp;How did you decide that the one with a grudge against Allingham and Wendell would dress up as the hero?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do you want to hear my reasoning?&nbsp;Haha.&nbsp;Very well&mdash;&ndash; Why would you pretend to be me?&nbsp;For some kind of benefit?&nbsp;No, that is wrong.&nbsp;You often let captured demons escape so that information could be leaked, right?&nbsp;If you were pretending to be me just to make a profit, then you wouldn’t have done that.&nbsp;Since if the real one, that is, me, were to find out about that it would be very bad]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[………….]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What would be the purpose for which you would disguise yourself as the hero and try to make your position known in this port city?&nbsp;If you think about it, the answer is obvious.&nbsp;Because you wanted to catch my attention anyway, didn’t you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yes, it is exactly as Raul said.&nbsp;Ada was pretending to be Raul and doing horrible things with Allingham because she thought it would eventually reach Raul’s ears.&nbsp;If you think about it normally, even a person impersonating you should be unsightly.&nbsp;And what if it became known that this impersonator is working with his hated enemies?&nbsp;There’s no way a man hungry for revenge would ignore it.&nbsp;Ada understood that, and set up a trap that would surely attract Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In fact, the hero Raul is now in front of Ada.&nbsp;However, it was unexpected that he understood her intentions perfectly and investigated her past.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I knew immediately that you wanted me to go to this city.&nbsp;The benefits of pretending to be me were limited after all.&nbsp;The next question was, for what reason?&nbsp;Well, I understood it so soon from the information the king gave me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Information…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The buying and selling of slaves and repeated child abuse for entertainment, profit and pleasure.&nbsp;It was easy to understand that it was irritation for Allingham and Wendell.&nbsp;You were trying to take advantage of my anger and vengeance to full fill your goal.&nbsp;You chose many complicated methods, but your goal is very simple.&nbsp;You called me to kill Allingham and Wendell, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was frustrating, but it’s exactly like Raul said.&nbsp;Ada didn’t care about the benefits she got from Allingham and Wendell by pretending to be Raul.&nbsp;I only wanted one thing.&nbsp;And that is the fate of a cruel death for those two.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[So I started looking for people with a grudge towards Allingham and Wendell]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, I sympathize with you.&nbsp;It seems you have also had difficulties]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Huh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul put a hand on Ada’s head with a thoughtful attitude.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have a strong heart.&nbsp;I respect you, yeah.&nbsp;Even if it is for revenge, there are not many who can laugh along with those who killed their family]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Speaking words that stab her heart like an arrow, for a moment, she forgot how to breathe.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Those horrible memories that she has never forgotten since that day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada was drowning in the vortex of those “unpleasant memories” as if she were daydreaming.</p>

︎<p><strong>Part 4 &#8211; Horror in the Basement</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada Taylor’s father, Charles Taylor, served as Allingham’s subordinate and had been a dedicated accountant for him for more than a decade.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Charles was an ordinary father to his family, he loved his wife and daughters.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">However, he was not exactly a saint.&nbsp;He has been involved selling the demons for money and has overlooked violence committed within the premises.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He couldn’t choose another job if he wanted to support his family.&nbsp;Furthermore, the demons lost the war.&nbsp;The loser is destined to be enslaved by the victor.&nbsp;This is war.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Still, Charles had a modest conscience for others.&nbsp;And that wasn’t a very good thing being an Allingham employee.&nbsp;Ironically, because of that awareness, Charles would have a horrific end.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was a full moon night where the flow of fate suddenly began to die.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That day, Charles kept the accounting records in the office until late.&nbsp;When his work was finally finished, the hand on the clock had passed the date.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Goodness.&nbsp;I stayed up again… if I don’t take a rest now, tomorrow will be very hard day]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He got up from the chair, raised his arms and stretched.&nbsp;He looked out the window.&nbsp;Thanks to the bright moon, he could see the outline of the facility building even at midnight.&nbsp;Then, he found something strange.&nbsp;A man holding a lamp was walking rapidly through the pass between the fields.&nbsp;That elegant suit lit by the moonlight was familiar.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Allingham-san?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham disappeared beyond the gate of the third camp.&nbsp;The third camp is a building used to classify demons.&nbsp;There is unlikely to be a reason to come and go at this time.&nbsp;He tilted his head strangely, but didn’t think so deeply about it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But after that, every time he worked overtime, he began to find the light from the lamp behind the window.&nbsp;At first he wondered if that was why, but after a few days he became increasingly suspicious.&nbsp;He’s also curious about what’s he’s doing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">One night when the full moon returned, Charles finally decided to follow Allingham.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After confirming that Allingham had disappeared behind the gate, he went to the third camp.&nbsp;The door was not locked.&nbsp;He opened it carefully without pressing, and managed to enter.&nbsp;The light from the Allingham lamp could be seen at the back of the hall.&nbsp;Beyond are the stairs that lead to the basement.&nbsp;Charles followed him while holding his breath.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I felt a kind of chills.&nbsp;What does Allingham do by coming here every day?&nbsp;It was said that the basement will be left unopened for use as a warehouse in the future.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Should I go back? But… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If he had returned at this time, Charles probably would have had a different fate.&nbsp;At least he wouldn’t have died that way.&nbsp;But, he kept moving forward.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Was it curiosity that prompted Charles, or was it a feeling that something was wrong?&nbsp;Either way, he thought it’s too late to go back anymore.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He gently descended the stone stairs and descended to the basement.&nbsp;He immediately realized that the door at the end of the hall was open.&nbsp;A strange sound like that of an animal leaked out.&nbsp;Charles walked to the door as his heart began to beat rapidly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Unbelievably, the interior of the room, unlike the other rooms in this camp, was decorated with luxurious furniture.&nbsp;Red carpet, sofas and bedding that are probably from abroad.&nbsp;It gave the impression of a brothel.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But Charles’s shortness of breath and tension were not due to the tacky interior.&nbsp;It was because several girls were lying naked in bed, on the sofa, and on the floor.&nbsp;They are all chained and tied by the bed.&nbsp;Allingham used violence cheerfully as he walked among those girls.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even Charles, who was used to seeing the punishment of slaves, couldn’t help but be shocked.&nbsp;Allingham seems to feel sexual arousal while hurting the girls.&nbsp;Charles thought he was used to seeing scenes of humans mistreating demon slaves.&nbsp;However, he felt nauseous at the sight in front of him.&nbsp;He know his also not decent man at this point, but he couldn’t control the chills at remembering his own daughters.&nbsp;But, he couldn’t move his feet due to fear from that cruel sight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(If I go out will I be able to face Allingham alone?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">No, compared to himself, Allingham has a weapon to attack.&nbsp;Charles, who was the secretary, was unfortunately in poor health, and has never resorted to violence since he was born.&nbsp;Charles stood at that scene, being swallowed up by the slight sense of justice, the sympathy for girls who overlapped with their daughters, and the fear of it all.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While Charles was upset, Allingham would step on the girls’ heads and remove their nails.&nbsp;Some had their arms bent in strange directions, others bleeding all over their bodies, and others had broken wine bottles between their legs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Charles took a deep breath with wide eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(T-They are dead… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The worst part was that Allingham kept doing his thing in such a situation.&nbsp;Don’t tell me… .. Allingham stripped off his clothes as if confirming his concern.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I think you already know, if I bite it you will die on the spot.&nbsp;If you don’t want to end up like the girls from yesterday, so be obedient]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Intense sound leaked from a girl’s clogged throat.&nbsp;Maybe it hit the bottom of her throat, the girl kept saying she couldn’t take it.&nbsp;But not caring about that, Allingham carelessly held the girl’s head with both hands and began to move at a brutal and ruthless pace.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haa, that feels good… ..it’s narrow and tight, it’s the best.&nbsp;Ahh, it’s nice to see you with tears and a runny nose… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham played with that young girls body.&nbsp;All the while deliberately showing that sight to the others who had terrified faces.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, take a closer look.&nbsp;Make sure you learn it correctly, because you will be next… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Uhh, moaning a little, Allingham shook his body.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haa… Haa… I really would like to do this during the day, but it will be a trust issue if customers find out that I’m having fun with  merchandise.&nbsp;Fufufu… ..well, then who’s next&mdash;&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham pulled his thing off the girl and reached out to the crying girl beside him.&nbsp;Unlike the previous one, this girl looks like she was 5 or 6 years old.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Fufu, it will hurt at first because because it’s too tight, but the pain gradually becomes more and more addictive.&nbsp;Here we go]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham spread the girl’s legs.&nbsp;The girl didn’t understand what was happening, she just looked at Allingham with scared eyes.&nbsp;Allingham caressed the girl’s cheeks with his fingertips and smiled creepily.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Not wanting to know what happen next, Charles covered his ears and closed his eyes.&nbsp;Even so, a loud scream rang out that couldn’t be hidden.&nbsp;Sadly, Charles was simply shaking and could only keep muttering apologies in his heart.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham continued to assault the girls until dawn.&nbsp;The girls were trampled, ripped apart, until they could no longer move.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I got carried away again.&nbsp;I’m tired.&nbsp;I’ll take care of the corpses tomorrow night]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Charles hastily hid behind the door.&nbsp;After Allingham left, he ran over to the abandoned girls, desperately checking to see if there were any still breathing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Two are alive!)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Charles carried the two survivors and ran to the town doctor.&nbsp;The doctor seemed confused that I was bringing demons to him, but still reluctantly agreed.&nbsp;While waiting for the doctor’s attention, Charles remembered his daughters when they were young, and he became terribly depressed.&nbsp;Those girls must also have parents.&nbsp;He couldn’t think of anything else considering the feelings of a father.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(What Allingham was doing is out of the ordinary… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Despite the violence used against slaves, Allingham was hurting girls to satisfy his sexual desire.&nbsp;Most of the time, Allingham himself must have known that this was wrong, so he did it secretly.&nbsp;Allingham is a man in charge of running a slave camp.&nbsp;What would Director Da Costa, a slave trade broker, think if he knew that girls are treated cruelly for his own pleasure?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The doctor was taking care of the girls seriously during that time, but their expressions were getting worse and worse.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Both girls are very injured that their internal organs are in bad shape.&nbsp;The wounds could be closed with healing magic, but the weakness is severe.&nbsp;The rest will depend on them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Can’t you do something!?&nbsp;Please save them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Charles’s request was useless, and an hour later, one of the girls died.&nbsp;She suffered to the end, with seizures, harsh breathing, and died.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At least the other one can.&nbsp;When he thought about it, an alarm suddenly sounded.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(That’s the camp siren… ..!)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He raised his head and looked out the window.&nbsp;He saw several lights on in the camp.&nbsp;At this moment, he remembered that he was in such a hurry that he had left the door to the third camp open.&nbsp;After seeing the change in Charles’s expression, the doctor also seemed to notice.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Please leave]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The doctor wrapped the dead girl’s body in a blanket and gave it to Charles.&nbsp;It seems like it would be a problem for you to stay here.&nbsp;What the doctor said was reasonable, but the other girl in the emergency bed was still breathing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Please!&nbsp;She is still alive, keep her hidden, I beg you!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Fine.&nbsp;I’ll take care of her until she dies.&nbsp;Just remember she will die in a matter of time]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Thank you!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As he left the clinic, Charles ran holding the dead girl.&nbsp;What he was looking for was his own home, which he had never returned to except on vacation.&nbsp;He couldn’t stay here anymore.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He banged violently on the door, waking his wife, and it seems she noticed the problem immediately.&nbsp;He told his two daughters not to leave the room and offered Charles a drink.&nbsp;When Charles finally calmed down, he spoke to his wife about Allingham’s sins.&nbsp;His wife started crying in the middle of the conversation.&nbsp;Girls younger than their daughters have been brutally murdered.&nbsp;That is the work of a devil not a hunan.&nbsp;They both had the same feelings for Allingham.&nbsp;Surely this was the first time in their lives that they had such a dislike for someone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It really is unforgivable… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes darling.&nbsp;But now that you know, you can’t pretend not to]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I would also be charged for being involved in human trafficking.&nbsp;Even so]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We will be ready]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Being prompted by his wife, Charles began to prepared the horse.&nbsp;To report details to officials.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I entrust you to our daughters]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Be careful.&nbsp;We will be waiting for your return]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Saying goodbye, Charles left the house.&nbsp;Looking back, his daughters were looking at him worriedly from the room on the second floor.&nbsp;Smiling and waving their hand happily, Charles was prepared to leave.&nbsp;At that moment.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Guah?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Several men appeared out of the darkness and attacked him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You are…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They all had familiar faces.&nbsp;Charles desperately resisted, but his limbs were tied in front of his wife and daughters, and he was gagged.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uhhh!&nbsp;Guh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Damn pervert!&nbsp;You won’t get out of this by messing with the product!&nbsp;We will take you back]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He immediately realized that Allingham had passed the balme on him. Even if he tried to yell that they were wrong, the gag prevented him. Charles, of course, realized that the men had been bought by Allingham to avoid being overheard.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, wait, wait.&nbsp;The order was to tie him with a rope to the horse and drag him]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What?&nbsp;There’s a reasonable distance from here to the facility, you know.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahaha!&nbsp;For that very reason.&nbsp;He wanted him to be dragged along the ground until the bones were visible]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Terrible conversation could be heard.&nbsp;The men agreed, and they took Charles that way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uhh… ..Kugghhh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A careless sound rose, and the feeling of burning began to be felt.&nbsp;The clothes he was wearing were quickly shredded, and Charles was dragged across the ground at tremendous speed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">His back was on fire.&nbsp;The pebbles on the road were spread out everywhere.&nbsp;The ground played the role of grater, cutting meat and muscle.&nbsp;It was severe pain.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ohhhhhh… Wow]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The men did not slow the horses, even if the bones were sticking out of the skin.&nbsp;What awaited Charles when he arrived at the facility was an even worse hell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Charles’s limbs were severed and shattered while he was alive by demons on Allingham’s orders, and he died.&nbsp;Charles’s body was packed in a wooden box and delivered to his family the next day.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Only death awaits traitors』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That was written in Charles’s blood.&nbsp;And to top it off, the handwriting was his.</p>

︎<p><strong>Part 5 &#8211; A Sweet Invitation from the Hero</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">The box was inadvertently placed in front of Ada’s house.&nbsp;Ada’s mother found the box, and the moment she saw the bloody handwriting written on the box, she screamed sand passed out.&nbsp;I remembered that I was very scared.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Then, along with her younger sister, they managed to get their mother to bed somehow.&nbsp;Honestly, I didn’t want to go back to the door.&nbsp;What was in the box?&nbsp;She thought of the worst and her body trembled.&nbsp;Ada knew her imagination was not wrong.&nbsp;But no matter how scary it was, she just couldn’t leave it like that.&nbsp;Especially if what she imagined was inside.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada left her ten-year-old sister with her mother and returned to the door alone.&nbsp;She bent down and gently touched the wooden box.&nbsp;A thick smell of blood hung in the clear morning air.&nbsp;The box was heavy and I couldn’t lift it.&nbsp;She could feel blood from inside.&nbsp;Tears flowed unintentionally.&nbsp;She began to sob.&nbsp;Her body was trembling intensely.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Why did this happen?&nbsp;While cursing god, Ada spread her hands.&nbsp;When she opened the box, She saw her father’s head that was shedding tears of blood&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[All my memories of my father were rewritten with what happened that day.&nbsp;My father was nothing more than a head staring at me with cloudy glass-like eyes]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, that’s something unforgivable.&nbsp;I get it.&nbsp;I understand it really good.&nbsp;A cruel event is etched deep within your being.&nbsp;There is no way there is room for little memories of happiness.&nbsp;Since then, you swore revenge right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul spoke with an enthusiastic attitude as if he had found a partner.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I would like you to stop enjoying someone else’s misery.&nbsp;First of all, you are crazy.&nbsp;How can you be so excited?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see you don’t understand.&nbsp;Revenge is fun.&nbsp;I mean it from your senpai’s point of view.&nbsp;Revenge is pointless.&nbsp;Nothing is born ”they say it often, right?&nbsp;It is not something to produce]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Certainly some said the same to Ada.&nbsp;But apparently Raul’s opinion is different.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Listen, that’s a lie.&nbsp;Revenge is created.&nbsp;Inside my heart, lies a comforting joy, and an irresistible ecstasy!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul spread his arms with a cheerful smile.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Is he taking revenge for his own joy? I don’t think so… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada take a step back as if in disgust.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I think my family would have also wanted it, so I want revenge.&nbsp;Revenge is not something to enjoy.&nbsp;I despise that]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I think that way of thinking is wrong]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What do you mean?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, you will have to discover the answer yourself.&nbsp;The problem now is that if you can do it yourself.&nbsp;What are you saying, don’t you need my help?&nbsp;If so, I’ll just be watching]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Hitting her on a sore spot.&nbsp;Ada doesn’t have the power to fight.&nbsp;Most S-rated users can often use special magic as a one-point specialized talent.&nbsp;Ada was exactly that type, and no talents blossomed into abilities other than replication magic.&nbsp;That’s why she planned to use him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(She was going to make Raul kill Allingham and the others)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This man says he will help her.&nbsp;He argued that intervening with Allingham and others with his bare hands was against the rules he had set, but could she really accept those words?&nbsp;First of all, does this man really offer cooperation?&nbsp;It was so creepy the way this was unfolding.&nbsp;She feels like it’s some sort of trap.&nbsp;But what kind?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(&mdash;&ndash; It cannot be that this man is aware of everything… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Such a possibility suddenly came to mind, and she felt some chills.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(No. I have to calm down)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She is too focus on doubting him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(What’s wrong with this being a convenient development for me?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As long as she achieved her goal, she didn’t care what happened.&nbsp;In the unlikely event that she fell for Raul’s trap, well, there was no reason to do that, but it would still be stupid to decline this offer.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Certainly I don’t have the power to take revenge]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see.&nbsp;It’s kind of easy.&nbsp;Just take my hand]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul shortened the distance when Ada had backed off earlier and held out his hand.&nbsp;Ada stared at him.&nbsp;If you want revenge or save your loved ones, you must take the hand of this demon.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She did not look up.&nbsp;As she reached out hes hand, she fearfully touched Raul’s hand.&nbsp;The fingers of Ada’s hand were as cold as a dead man’s.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes.&nbsp;Very well.&nbsp;It is not true hatred if you seem to choose your own means of revenge]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Smiling, the demon whispered in her ear.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We are partners for a while now.&nbsp;Let’s get along]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada nodded.&nbsp;There’s no turning back.</p>

<p><strong>Part 6 &#8211; Will you Lend me your Power?</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">[So what exactly will you do to help me?&nbsp;I have no way to beat them.&nbsp;The only thing I can use with my abilities is my replication magic.&nbsp;They have strong escorts and above all, the great wizard Wendell is just too strong]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, those escorts are weaklings, I can immobilize them with my magic.&nbsp;Allingham strength is below standards in the first place.&nbsp;In fact, it will be a battle with Wendell.&nbsp;But, he is not an opponent for you either]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait, what do you mean?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He says it very easily without knowing the people.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You must know how strong Wendell is, right?&nbsp;More than being able to manipulate some of the high-level magics, he can even fire them continuously.&nbsp;The rumors say that his magic has no limits]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, if not, I wouldn’t have been part of the hero’s party]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You are very confident.&nbsp;Certainly the hero’s party was the strongest]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Hearing that, Raul made a surprised face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Really.&nbsp;Was that group the strongest?&nbsp;Don’t make me laugh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, you were strong enough to defeat the demon king weren’t you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No, that’s a dark story.&nbsp;So much so that you will hurt my heart if you keep poking more]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul put his hand on his chest and had an expression as if he had been hurt.&nbsp;It was the usual joking attitude.&nbsp;But thanks to this man’s previous antics, Ada no longer felt annoyed.&nbsp;I had to be grateful for that point.&nbsp;Otherwise, Raul’s comments would have riled her up again.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why do you deny the strength of the hero party?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada dared to ask that question because she wanted to prove the fact that she had not lost her cool.&nbsp;Raul raised his eyebrows in an unusual and unexpected way.&nbsp;However, it was only a moment that he showed such a reaction, and he quickly returned to his usual expression.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s not about that.&nbsp;If I were to face the former hero party now, I would definitely kill them in an instant]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul continued speaking with a tone as if confirming a simple truth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The leader was full of weaknesses.&nbsp;Such a group is easy to break]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He pushed his old self like he was someone else.&nbsp;Ada continued to pretend to be excited seeing that Raul seemed to be enjoying himself.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The hero’s weaknesses?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[He had a low ability to collect information.&nbsp;He did not know how to judge people.&nbsp;He had no space to think for himself, he only had the purpose of protecting others and the kingdom.&nbsp;And above all, his mentality was weak.&nbsp;Just by confusing it a bit, it generated a gap and could easily fall into any trap]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul opened his bloodshot eyes without blinking, and said it excitedly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I feel sorry for the demon king who was defeated by that guy]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, we are derailed.&nbsp;I’ll talk about the demon king later.&nbsp;Let’s get back to the topic.&nbsp;Like the hero, Wendell has his weaknesses]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wendell’s weaknesses?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul returned to the table, and sat on the chair.&nbsp;And when he put his hand on her cheek, Ada’s curiosity was shaken.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Give me a detailed explanation!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haha!&nbsp;All right, I’ll tell you.&nbsp;He has a very weak mentality.&nbsp;Leave too much self-evaluation to others.&nbsp;It is weak to the cause.&nbsp;He does not know how to judge people.&nbsp;He cannot think of things with his own head]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait a minute.&nbsp;You’re saying the same thing you mentioned earlier about the hero’s shortcomings]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right.&nbsp;Interestingly, when I was the hero, Wendell and I had similar deficiencies]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Raul said that, he gave Ada real examples.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This is a story when I went to a certain village.&nbsp;When the villagers trusted him, Raul said that he couldn’t leave them alone.&nbsp;Wendell agreed, saying that they would stay in the village for a while.&nbsp;It was something that had nothing to do with the extermination of demons]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As a result of the two’s enthusiasm their journey took much longer, and the people in the city that they originally had to protect were tormented by demons for a longer time.&nbsp;At that point, they both got depressed and pondered, but in the end, every time something similar happened, they made the same mistake.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We were both prone to being childish.&nbsp;Just the fact that the people look up to us.&nbsp;Also, We said that fire magic is more powerful than water magic to sound cool.&nbsp;How childish right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They received a lot of money from the king, so they were both very picky about their appearance and dressed in the fashionable outfits.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Every time fancy equipment appeared on the street, we both got very excited]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada leaked a small groan of surprise.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[How to put it… it was not only the deficiencies, both of you also had the same tastes and hobbies right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes it is.&nbsp;I was often unaware that we were taking the same poses, and the others in the party would tell me.&nbsp;The saint said something like “Surely you are soul twins.”&nbsp;Wendell also said we were the same, and it made me very happy.&nbsp;I might as well call him my best friend]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A sharp light lingered in Raul’s eyes as he laughed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What a stupid thing.&nbsp;I didn’t know it back then.&nbsp;The concept of emotions.&nbsp;In some cases it is familiar because the one and the other are similar]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But Wendell wasn’t like that?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul nodded.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yup, he said he hated it himself.&nbsp;Wow, it really hurt me at the time]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Did he say so himself?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s Right.&nbsp;It was after I was captured by Victoria because of Wendell’s tricks]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Were you killed by that Wendell?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wrong.&nbsp;I said I had just been betrayed right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[So, who do you&mdash;&ndash;?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That is something that does not concern you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Huh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What was this terrible feeling anger?&nbsp;Before Ada could think about it, her instincts rang out in intense alarm.&nbsp;He said “If you want to live, don’t contradict him.”&nbsp;Raul just changed his expression.&nbsp;However&mdash;&ndash;?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(This demon… ..)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada who kept her hand on her chest with a racing heartbeat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[&mdash;&ndash;Ah, we got off track again.&nbsp;Anyway, on how to get back at Wendell, I think it would be better to use magic to launch a mental attack on him]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I can’t launch an attack with replication magic.&nbsp;How should I do it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Simple]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Suddenly Railul extended his hand to Ada.&nbsp;There was no time to scream.&nbsp;When she took a deep breath, it had subdued her.&nbsp;Being attacked by primal fear, Ada fought with all her might without understanding what was happening.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Kuh… .. Why can’t I move… ..?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I hated having a weak body, but the opponent is a man.&nbsp;She couldn’t move.&nbsp;She tried to retreat, but he put a hand on the back of her head and didn’t allow her to look away.&nbsp;When she looked at Raul who was reciting an incantation, a strange power flowed out.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiii..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In his heart, a dark feeling overflows.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[N-Noooooooo!&nbsp;W-What is this !?&nbsp;Ahhhhhh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada screamed in fear of that mysterious power that had entered.&nbsp;Although she tried to escape by struggling, she was held back.&nbsp;At the end of the enchantment, Ada’s consciousness slowly melted away.&nbsp;Its outline is vaguely blurred.&nbsp;Without having any strength, Ada collapsed on the spot&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A few seconds later.&nbsp;When Ada regained consciousness, her body was surprisingly lying in front of her..</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What is this…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She muttered under her breath.&nbsp;Feeling uncomfortable, she held her throat with both hands in a hurry.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What’s going on…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It has completely changed to Raul’s voice.&nbsp;For an instant, she had the illusion that she had returned to the states he was in when her replication magic was applied.&nbsp;But that was not possible.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(Because he undid that magic. Besides, my body is in front of me!)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Fearfully she lowered her gaze.&nbsp;She was wearing the hero Raul’s clothes.&nbsp;Now she looked at both hands.&nbsp;They were long, slender fingers, but they were definitely male.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(D-Did… my consciousness was put into Raul’s body… ..?)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Realizing that, Ada was stunned.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Well, did you now understand the situation?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kyaaa!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Suddenly, a voice was heard in her head and she screamed in surprise.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Hey hey.&nbsp;Don’t scream like a girl having my appearance.&nbsp;It’s disgusting you know? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I-I hear a voice in my head]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Well of course.&nbsp;Because I’m also in this body 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Is it because of the magic you cast on me, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Exactly”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Apparently, Raul’s dark magic dragged Ada’s soul into his body.&nbsp;In other words, now the soul of Raul and Ada coexist in one body.&nbsp;Ada felt physiological disgust.&nbsp;However, if she said that, she would be making fun of Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(I don’t want to expose my weakness to a man like him…)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She told herself that she had to be as calm as possible.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『I grabbed your body before it fell and laid it down, so don’t worry.&nbsp;If you hit your head and die, there will be no place to return your soul.&nbsp;Well, your sleeping on the bathroom floor.&nbsp;But you already prostrated yourself a long time ago, so I don’t think there are problems 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[More important than that!&nbsp;I’ve never seen this magic before!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『The magic of darkness is very interesting you know.&nbsp;Well in this time it seems to be difficult so I think they treat this like a legend.&nbsp;It was written that it was even suspected if it even existed 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The body suddenly began to move on its own.&nbsp;It is probably due to the will of Raul.&nbsp;When he activated his magic without reciting the incantation, he pulled out a dictionary of magic that appeared in the air.&nbsp;And he explained as he turned the pages.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This was something I obtained from the demon king’s treasury a long time ago.&nbsp;Look at this.&nbsp;It is written on this page.&nbsp;“Magic to share souls”]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『SSS degree of difficulty!?&nbsp;That can not be!&nbsp;It’s not something that a single person can activate in the world! 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What am I amazing?&nbsp;I know.&nbsp;If you are in a hurry, your understanding will be slower, could you calm down?&nbsp;I really don’t want to have to wait until you call down]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada took a deep breath and nodded slowly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『But why did you do this?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It can’t be helped as you don’t have the power to take revenge.&nbsp;So I thought I’d lend you my powerful magic]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Will you lend it to me?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right so you can take revenge on them, you can use this body at ease]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”What…..!?”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Borrow the power of the hero Raul.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">(This is very scary if you think about it!)</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Raul’s proposal was really attractive.&nbsp;However, this devilish man is unlikely to help with good intentions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『You will ask me for something in return right?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada asked cautiously.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Naturally.&nbsp;But, I won’t ask for anything exaggerated.&nbsp;I am also in this body, so I will give you advice when needed.&nbsp;However, revenge will be done at your will.&nbsp;What are you saying, it’s not a bad deal is it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”…..Well that’s true”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She has already decided to take Raul’s hand.&nbsp;She had no intention of escaping, even if something unreasonable was asked of her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Did you understand what I said?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When asked, she nodded quickly.&nbsp;It didn’t matter what Raul tried to do.&nbsp;If it is for revenge, she will use the power of the devil.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I don’t dislike women with good understanding]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『So how can I use magic?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’ll show you in practice.&nbsp;Well, shall we go?&nbsp;To destroy those greedy monsters&mdash;&ndash;]</p>

<p><strong>Part 7 &#8211; First Revenge</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">&mdash;Very good, things turned out as expected.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It is the first time for me to experience the state of having two souls in one body.&nbsp;In a generalized way, I can’t feel Ada’s presence.&nbsp;This situation is quite interesting.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[So, Ada, how are you?&nbsp;Do you feel like you are shrinking into a corner of the brain?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『I’m sorry, but I don’t feel anything from borrowing someone else’s body』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Having a conversation like this is interesting as the answer comes from deep in your head.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『I still feel like I have a body.&nbsp;Although it is uncomfortable for your body to move against your will 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hee~, really?&nbsp;In the case of this magic, as long as you transfer control, you can move at will.&nbsp;It’s more of a symbiosis than a loan]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Hey?&nbsp;Can I try moving the body?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm.&nbsp;Try it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I quickly relaxed my body, and gave up control like an image of being drifting through the waves.&nbsp;At first, Ada open and close her hands.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Waa!&nbsp;It is true!&nbsp;It move!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The words that come out of my mouth have also changed from mine to what Ada said.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Pff, you are so excited like a little child』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Huh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It must have been because of that innocent reaction.&nbsp;When I pointed that out, Ada coughed as if to make up for it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Hahahaha.&nbsp;You have finally shown your usual attitude.&nbsp;We are sharing the same fate for a while, so be careful with that 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Shut up! I don’t want to get used to a madman like you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Who are you calling a madman?&nbsp;I thought about asking that, but I couldn’t keep playing here forever.&nbsp;After saying “Good” I got on the subject.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『So where are Allingham and Wendell?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As soon as I said their names, Ada stiffened.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Her expression became like that of a doll in a moment.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[They are in the innermost hall of the building.&nbsp;Today the newly brought demons will be appraised into that room]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Hm, it’s good that the main course is waiting in the deepest part』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This is a revenge play, so I want the best excitement for the climax.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Well, we’ll go there too』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『I’ll let you take control of the body for a while』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Okay]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada nodded, opened the door, and stepped out into the facility corridor.&nbsp;Then, her lips pursed, she looked ahead and walked through the building.&nbsp;A scream came out of nowhere.&nbsp;And each time she advanced, an unusual smell stuck to her nose.&nbsp;This smell is from large numbers of people who have died miserably.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Goodness.&nbsp;This slave camp, the general’s castle, and Dr. Rine Beneke’s lab all have the similar feeling.&nbsp;Which of those could be the worst place?&nbsp;As I remembered the faces on those rubbish, I watched Ada’s behavior.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As we approached the corridor that connected the buildings, in the distance a very simple one-story building could be seen.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Hey, what’s that?”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s an old camp.&nbsp;It is where the slaves sleep]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Eh?&nbsp;But, there are quite a few slaves right? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes.&nbsp;Almost 700 people should be housed now]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Even if they are sold and reduced, they cannot all fit in that building』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Slaves without a job or with a low price are sent to a place called the “shared room.”&nbsp;Every day they are told to sleep while standing.&nbsp;They are in a packaged state, and cannot be moved.&nbsp;There is no way you can rest in that situation.&nbsp;It’s like hell for those who are weak, sick and die from it, or some who go crazy and commit suicide &mdash;&ndash; look at that]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada pointed further east of the old camp.&nbsp;When I looked in that direction, I noticed a large hole.&nbsp;Uwaa, came out of my mouth.&nbsp;I remembered that the general ordered the servants to throw the corpses into the holes dug in the garden.&nbsp;The usage is probably the same.&nbsp;However, the size of the hole is completely different.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There are a huge number of deaths every day, so filling that hole is not enough.&nbsp;Once every three days, a fire is set to burn the corpses in that hole]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Having hateful eyes, Ada says it like vomiting.&nbsp;Interestingly, when Ada got angry, her emotions carried her away, and my feelings stirred.&nbsp;Is the soul of the two affected by being in the same body?&nbsp;But, it’s not bad at all.&nbsp;The fuels that fuel revenge in more than welcome.&nbsp;After all, it was a good idea to choose her as my partner.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I thought about continuing to accompany Ada’s anger for a while. But she denied it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you have time to stop, it would be better to move… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As she muttered that, she looked away from the great hole and advanced.&nbsp;The building that follows the crossing corridor is also made of stone, the cold and dark corridors continued in a sinuous way.&nbsp;There are iron gates that appear to be extraordinarily strong in some places that are not covered by walls.&nbsp;The echoes of screaming and crying continued as always.&nbsp;As the level went down, the voices got louder.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This floor is where the slaves work.&nbsp;There are a total of ten rooms in which they carry out various jobs]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『I don’t think they’re just waiting for the day they’re sold right?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Allingham often said this to the demons.&nbsp;“You are not products until they are sold.&nbsp;You are my property.&nbsp;Only after a noble purchases you will you be able to be called as a product.&nbsp;Until then, you will have to work like mules ”]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She answered out loud.&nbsp;When I asked “You’re not just using them for that, aren’t you?” Ada nodded.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The main purpose is not to make them work.&nbsp;It is harassing slaves to death… ..!&nbsp;It’s really unforgivable… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada clenched her fists as she trembled with anger.&nbsp;It has been a long time since I heard my angry voice.&nbsp;Although, in a feminine way… ..</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『You better try to speak like me when in front of others.&nbsp;And also, if you’re so angry, why don’t you save the slaves? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada blinked repeatedly.&nbsp;She has shocked face, She never thought of having so much power in the first place.&nbsp;Well now you have it.&nbsp;Because I am supporting you.&nbsp;Well, it will have to give her some confidence.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Before we go with Allingham and the others, we can go through all the rooms where the slaves are and free them.&nbsp;It is an easy thing to do.&nbsp;You just have to kill all the guards 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I can do that?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『If revenge is your motivation, then I’ll let you do anything』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It seems that Ada is excited, her heartbeat begins to pound.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That’s right.&nbsp;You have to be honest with your wishes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada first gently pushed the door of the first room to open it.&nbsp;We could just blow it up.&nbsp;Well, I’ll let her do what she wants.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The moment the door was opened, an unpleasant smell was felt, Ada moaned a little and closed her mouth.&nbsp;Uwaa, this is… ..it is filled with a peculiar smell that overflows from rotting corpses.&nbsp;In the smelly room, boys and girls were working while being whipped.&nbsp;The “work” done in this room is the removal of corpses.&nbsp;Apparently the corpses are cut up here before being carried into the large hole outside.&nbsp;Certainly, that way even the children could carry the corpses to the great hole.&nbsp;Stacked in the back of the room are numerous corpses of demons that have surely died in this facility.&nbsp;They have no arms or legs, their heads are sunken, their eyes are hollow.&nbsp;How to put it, there is no decent corpse.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The women and children in chains are in groups of five, it seems that if one fails, they will be punished all together.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And at this moment, the scene of suffering was unfolding in front of me.&nbsp;When a trembling woman saw a rotten corpse and vomited, a guard holding a whip smiled and said “You can choose between being all flogged or having the other members flog this woman.”</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons looked at each other as if hesitating.&nbsp;For a moment, but then the remaining four gripped the whip with dry fingers.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiiii!!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Good.&nbsp;you will whip her with your own hands]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Pleaae Forgive me please… ..I beg you.&nbsp;Ahh, stop… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The sound of the whip mixed with the scream.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You should already know what will happen if you laze at work]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When threatened, the remaining four had no choice but to nod.&nbsp;But, at that moment&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, who said you could stop?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The guard raised the smaller woman’s arm.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You guys whip this woman now!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait…..! Please!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The whip taken from the woman was given to the woman who was being whipped earlier.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey you.&nbsp;Give back what she did to you.&nbsp;If you do a good job, I’ll forget what happened earlier.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[U-understood!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Instead of hesitating, the woman began to whip with sparkles in her eyes.&nbsp;There was a strong will to not miss the chance to survive.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh.&nbsp;Dont Stop…!&nbsp;Uh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The screams diminished rapidly, with the sound of leather slicing through the wind and ripping through skin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Ahh.&nbsp;she will surely die 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As he murmured, Ada’s shoulders shook.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I wont allow it…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Good.&nbsp;Let’s take action now.&nbsp;Let the revenge begin 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Revenge…  against them… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After gulping, the corners of her lips naturally lifted.&nbsp;You must be very excited.&nbsp;I like that she is honest.&nbsp;Although, I see it somewhat superficial.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Ah.&nbsp;The guards were also your targets for revenge? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I asked her remembering that point.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[………!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada was immediately surprised.&nbsp;Well, very good.&nbsp;I’ll pretend I didn’t see anything.&nbsp;You are still an important piece to me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Certainly, I don’t think only Allingham killed your father.』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[T-That’s right.&nbsp;There must be guards among the people who tortured my father]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Then kill them and carry out your revenge!』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Instead of answering, Ada clenched her fist.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Now I will teach you a magic spell to be able to instantly shatter the heads of the guards.&nbsp;You just need to cast that magic.&nbsp;That way you will achieve goal.&nbsp;And you can save all the slaves in this room 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Smash… ..their heads… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”What’s the matter?&nbsp;Do not tell me that you are hesitating?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada was somewhat shocked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-Well… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Could it be because she has never killed a person?&nbsp;Or maybe she think that the life of the guards is also valuable?&nbsp;Well, I don’t care why you’re hesitating.&nbsp;Originally, I didn’t expect Ada to make the first move without hesitation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It’s okay.&nbsp;Do not worry.&nbsp;I’ll help you get started.&nbsp;You should be able to do it.&nbsp;Because you are currently “Me” after all!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『First, look around you again.&nbsp;For example, how about the one that was hit by the whip earlier? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A woman lying on the ground covered in cuts looked like a worn rag.&nbsp;If she wasn’t convulsing little by little, you wouldn’t know if she was alive.&nbsp;The whole body has turned purple due to internal bleeding, and at the place where the laceration was made, the flesh could be seen.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『In that condition, she will die if he does not receive recovery magic immediately.&nbsp;But, for that you need to kill the guards right? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada, who opened her eyes wide, was caught with a direct look at the fallen woman.&nbsp;When her eyes trembled, I could feel some conflict.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”What will you do?&nbsp;Will you let her die?&nbsp;Will you give up your revenge on the weaklings and go and kill Allingham and Wendell?&nbsp;I have no problems if that’s what you prefer.』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-You’re wrong… ..I… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if the guards are doing that, they do it under the order of Allingham right?&nbsp;There must be some that they threatened to make them obedient]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『It is not like that.&nbsp;The guards don’t do it because they were ordered to.&nbsp;They have fun doing such cruel acts themselves.』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Little by little, the balance of the mind leans towards darkness.&nbsp;Let’s add more weight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ummm]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Could it be that you really don’t want to kill them?&nbsp;So your revenge was just that.&nbsp;hahahaha”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait.&nbsp;If a commotion is made here, we may not get to the real enemy, Allingham and Wendell.&nbsp;We have to be careful&mdash;&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Stop pretending that you are thinking and buy time.&nbsp;I don’t want excuses anymore.&nbsp;This is your last chance.&nbsp;What are you going to do?”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada looked around her again with trembling eyes.&nbsp;I, who share the same body, of course, can see the landscape in front of me.&nbsp;Empty demons.&nbsp;Skinny and full of wounds.&nbsp;The guards are happily harassing the demons.&nbsp;In this disastrous situation, is there someone who has the power to handle it, but does nothing?&nbsp;For a decent person, he surely wouldn’t do that.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I just waited silently for Ada’s words.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’ll kill them too… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Good, Ada.&nbsp;I like it.&nbsp;It shows that you are my partner.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do I really just need to cast the spell you said earlier?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Yes』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Okay]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After it was determined, Ada had no more hesitation.&nbsp;As expected, the body is shaking, but surely it is from the thrill of killing people.&nbsp;I taught her the spell while feeling Ada’s determination.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Okay, launch it』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">She took a quick breath and looked straight ahead.&nbsp;Ada cast the spell in a low voice.&nbsp;At that moment, the heads of the guards in the room exploded.&nbsp;The blood flowed from the headless bodies.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh… .. K-Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons drenched in blood screamed without knowing what was happening.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Haha.&nbsp;No matter how many inhuman acts they have done, their blood is still red!』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The headless bodies fell to the floor, and the room was filled with confusion.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What!?&nbsp;What happened!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Help me!&nbsp;N-Nooooooo!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Let’s go.&nbsp;You have to explain the situation to them.&nbsp;Proclaim freedom 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Although I said that, Ada was kind of in a silent mode.&nbsp;she appears to be in shock from her first mass murder.&nbsp;Oh my, she really is very delicate.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What a drag.&nbsp;I guess I’ll take on that role]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Regaining control of my body, I headed to the center of the room amidst the confusion.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I’m not going to scream.&nbsp;Because I don’t want to get tired without meaning.&nbsp;Having decided that, I blew up a nearby stone pillar with magic.&nbsp;Hearing that roar, the demon slaves’ eyes quickly snapped together.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiii… ..!&nbsp;The hero Raul… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Everyone’s faces turn pale in an instant.&nbsp;The demons look at me as the scariest thing in the world.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait, wait.&nbsp;I am an ally.&nbsp;Ah HAHAHA.&nbsp;Hey, hey, stop looking at me like you don’t believe me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I spoke very slowly and calmed the demons.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Listen.&nbsp;Think about it calmly.&nbsp;The ones who killed them were the guards, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The frightened slaves looked again at the corpses scattered around.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Thats true… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, the hero Raul is a friend of Allingham right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Looking at the restless demons, I clapped my hands a few times.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’ve become the hero for a reason, but I’m an ally who came to save you!&nbsp;And as a test, I used magic to kill the guards]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Then are we saved?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We can’t trust you… .. surely you are deceiving us to enjoy our joy of being saved.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even so, all the guards are dead]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They seem to see me as a wolf in sheep’s clothing.&nbsp;I can understand that they cannot trust a person so easily in this situation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Right now, I’m going to kill the guards in every room and free all the slaves.&nbsp;Eventually, I will slaughter the main culprits, Allingham and the great wizard Wendell, so those who want to join can come]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I snapped my fingers as I explained, and destroyed the chains of the slaves with magic.&nbsp;I also used recovery magic.&nbsp;Of course, it was not for good intention.&nbsp;The goal is to capture Ada’s heart and win the trust of the slaves.&nbsp;Without that reason, it wouldn’t have helped them.&nbsp;Of course, the slaves who did not know my true nature, began to shout with joy.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes-We are free… .. That person freed us… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[He is our savior… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right!&nbsp;He saved us from this hell… .. Thank you very much!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons that until a moment ago looked at me with suspicion, approached me and knelt to show their gratitude.&nbsp;I could hear Ada mutter “Incredible …” in my head.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『It’s really amazing that you were able to easily beat the confused demons… ..it’s frustrating, but I didn’t expect less』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[All this I do for you, you know?&nbsp;Instead of praising me, thank me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Ada was silent, I looked back at the demons.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, comrades.&nbsp;What do you want to do?&nbsp;You hate humans right?&nbsp;You want to kill Allingham and his people, don’t you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Revenge is not a bad thing.&nbsp;Because you will only returning what they did to you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s true!&nbsp;They have tormented us in many ways… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">My sweet words are transmitted and entangled in each of the hearts of the demons.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[My son was killed by him… .. blood came out all over his body when he was stabbed]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[My sister’s body became food for stray dogs… .. I want to kill him!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The fire of hatred grew and spread steadily.&nbsp;Hearing the word “kill”, I slowly closed my eyes. Recalling my memories.&nbsp;It was exactly that feeling when I was executed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Very well, comrades.&nbsp;We are leaving?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This is not the only preparation for revenge.&nbsp;The festival is more fun with more people.&nbsp;I guess I can act like a hero, touring places and recruiting people.</p>

<p><strong>Part 8 &#8211; Meet the Hero!</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">After that, we did the same in the rest of the rooms.&nbsp;At first, Ada, who couldn’t hide her surprise taking someone’s life, but after a few times she no longer hesitated.&nbsp;Killing is the same as doing something bad.&nbsp;The more you stain your hands, the more you get used to it.&nbsp;In a good way, and in a bad way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada, who given up of protecting her heart, and her eyes were so muddy when she saw the blood of the guards, she sometimes looked like she had an expression like being in a trance.&nbsp;The demons we rescued repeatedly wept and thanked, praising her.&nbsp;Did that feel good?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Drowning in the sense of justice by protecting the lives of the weak, instead of feeling guilty for taking the lives of the wicked.&nbsp;It’s like I’m seeing myself in the old days.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It is a dangerous act to seek external reasons for revenge, I once advised Ada that.&nbsp;But, that was a problem of the person himself, it would be a nuisance if I had to stop her here, so I saw Ada’s revenge with a straight face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Behind us are the demons that have been released and healed by recovery magic.&nbsp;We made sure to give the demons a choice “Do you want to join in revenge or would you rather escape?” from the elderly to the children raised their fists with determination to follow us.&nbsp;How much hatred is in your hearts?&nbsp;It seemed that I had seen a certain charm of revenge, and it felt great.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Punishment for humans!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Free the demons!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Let’s take back our stolen dignity!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uohhhhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The group of vengeful demons marched with angry eyes, spreading words of hatred.&nbsp;The steps overlapped, creating a background sound.&nbsp;This comforting chorus may have reached their ears.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&mdash;&ndash;And finally, we got to the deepest part of the facility.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Allingham and Wendell are behind that door]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Ahh, we finally arrived.&nbsp;Just when it was getting fun 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You really have bad taste]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I spoke with Ada, raising expectations.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Now we’ll head to climax from here ~』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Ada seemed to purse her lips, she opened the last door with both hands.&nbsp;The hall was quite large, capable of accommodating hundreds of slaves at a time.&nbsp;Allingham, Wendell and their complex facility executives line up there.&nbsp;In front of Allingham, two hundred demons were lined up like a wall.&nbsp;Apparently he was waiting in this room with the demons as a shield to face us.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well well well.&nbsp;I see you really came here while releasing all the demons]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham spoke with a calm demeanor, but couldn’t hide his displeasure.&nbsp;His gaze pointed to the group of demons behind us several times.&nbsp;Having this amount of demons as an army gives a great impact.&nbsp;Although I do not intend to make them fight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Then, hero-chan.&nbsp;What do you want?&nbsp;You’re not going to have fun with those slaves are you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I won’t let you treat them like toys anymore]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you saying?&nbsp;It will be a problem if you do what you want, hero-chan]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada glared at Allingham and pointed her finger at him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Shut up!&nbsp;Your evil deeds are over!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Uwaa… ..</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">How to put it, blurting out that line while putting a hand on my waist ……. It even makes me want to hold my own head.&nbsp;I don’t hate the playful attitude.&nbsp;But if you’re going to do it, do it in a smarter and more interesting way.&nbsp;This is more like a comedy act.&nbsp;Allingham looks scared, but Wendell at his side is laughing with his hand over his mouth.&nbsp;Yup, I don’t feel enough tension.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Listen well, Allingham.&nbsp;I killed the guards by smashing their heads.&nbsp;You will also share the same fate]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you said so… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s time for my revenge.&nbsp;I will kill you all]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[H-Hmph!&nbsp;I see that you are very confident!&nbsp;But here we have the great wizard!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Loosening his cheeks, Allingham looked at Wendell at his side.&nbsp;Wendell ignored Allingham’s gaze, and exploded as if he couldn’t bear it.&nbsp;Ada directed her gaze towards Wendell, her figure also reflected in my sight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Dark skin with short light brown hair.&nbsp;Although he wears a white robe, you could see the muscles around him.&nbsp;That expression and confident demeanor, and thanks to his good facial features, he was very popular with women wherever he went.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahahahah!&nbsp;This is a masterpiece!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After laughing and squinting happily, Wendel looked at Ada.&nbsp;I know that expression well.&nbsp;That is what it shows when you are immersed with your thoughts.&nbsp;Then, strangely, nostalgia entered my chest.&nbsp;Well, Wendell didn’t change at all.&nbsp;I haven’t seen his figure since I was executed, but he made me feel like it was yesterday.&nbsp;It’s strange.&nbsp;The Wendell I saw in the royal capital was an illusion created by him, so it really has been a long time since I saw his real body.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But, this is a bit tricky.&nbsp;Rather than reconnect with Wendell, it reminds me of what happened to my old self.&nbsp;Ahh, I feel so ashamed that I want to roll on the floor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Because I was convinced that garbage was my best friend.&nbsp;And unilaterally.&nbsp;Uwaa, I feel chills.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada, who doesn’t know about my inner conflict, gave Wendell an unpleasant look.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you laughing at, Wendell?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, it’s very funny to see how you get too carried away, Raul &mdash;&ndash; no, would it be better to call you Raul’s imposter?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I-Imposter !?&nbsp;What does this mean!?&nbsp;Explain it correctly!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham who yelled, grabbed onto Wendell’s arm.&nbsp;Wendel gently pushed Allingham’s body away with a disgusted face.&nbsp;Why are those two flirting?&nbsp;Come on, Ada.&nbsp;They are underestimating you, you need to scare them more.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I was expecting this from the beginning.&nbsp;I am the great magician you know?&nbsp;There’s no way I didn’t realize he was an imposter.&nbsp;Goodness, you really underestimate.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Seeing Wendel laugh, I felt nostalgic.&nbsp;Yes, that’s how that man is.&nbsp;That habit of mingling with every conversation doesn’t change.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I don’t care, just kill him at once!&nbsp;First of all, it’s your fault!&nbsp;You left him like nothing even knowing he was an impostor!&nbsp;You said there was a plan right?&nbsp;Then take responsibility!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes Yes.&nbsp;Okay, so stop yelling.&nbsp;Also, it was a lot of fun]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This is not the time to be smiling!&nbsp;That guy plans to kill us!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[So what?&nbsp;I only take care of that guy.&nbsp;I couldn’t say the same if it was the real one, but he’s Raul’s imposter after all]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As Wendell spoke, I taught Ada an attack spell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Good.&nbsp;Raise your palm towards Wendell and cast the magic immediately 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada nodded strongly, and according to my orders, she released the high-level magic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell could barely dodge it, with a smile that was still on his face.&nbsp;And because Wendell dodged it, the heads of the others exploded in return.&nbsp;But, that was no longer to cause a ruckus.&nbsp;Although Allingham was screaming.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">For Ada it was a magic she can’t get used to, but don’t worry I already know that he could survive that.&nbsp;I mean, it would be a problem if he died with such an attack.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait.&nbsp;What was that attack now?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell takes a step ahead of Allingham’s screams.&nbsp;It seems like he couldn’t keep laughing anymore.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You shouldn’t have that magic power… ..!&nbsp;In order to unleash a magic attack like this, it’s like you’re the real one&mdash;&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Good, Ada.&nbsp;It is time to reveal our true identity 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada looked up quickly, and with a triumphant face, spoke the words Wendell feared most.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right.&nbsp;I am not an impostor.&nbsp;What is in front of your eyes is the real hero Raul]</p>

<p><strong> Part 9 &#8211; Puppet</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">[The real Raul?&nbsp;T-That’s impossible… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell, who was all confident a few moments ago, began to feel anxious.&nbsp;When people became like this, it’s really pathetic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You should already know that I am traveling to different places in order to exact my revenge right?&nbsp;So it’s not surprising for me to come to see you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I took a step, Wendell was silent.&nbsp;His eyes and mine meet.&nbsp;Looking at Wendell’s face, memories of the tragedy in Macquarie village revived.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&mdash;&mdash;After defeating the demon king, I will definitely come to see them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I had made a promise with some children in Macquarie village, so after the problems disappeared, I decided to visit that village first.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Truth be told, I was away from the king and my companions.&nbsp;The princess sent me many letters saying “I want to give you a reward” “I would like to meet and talk”, but did not intend to reply.&nbsp;At that time, it was still pure, and it was being dragged away when the demon king was defeated.&nbsp;Also, he didn’t feel like talking about the death of the demon king.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I just didn’t want to break my promise to the little ones in Macquarie village.&nbsp;I really liked that Village.&nbsp;That small rustic village with the gentle people who welcomed us with open arms, reminded me of my home village that no longer exists.&nbsp;And the children were always by our side during our stay, they treated us as if we were their older brothers.&nbsp;The older brothers of the boys left the village as young soldiers, so they surely felt alone.&nbsp;Nature and affection flowed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That was the Macquarie village that i had a special feeling for.&nbsp;But, what I saw in the village that I revisited was hell like a battlefield.&nbsp;Children whose stomachs were open with their intestines out.&nbsp;The bodies of women who were abused and discarded like dirty laundry.&nbsp;All the men were cut into pieces and turned into pieces of meat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No ..… it couldn’t be… .. Why… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I couldn’t easily accept the scene in front of me, I just stood there stunned.&nbsp;Being attacked by a fierce feeling, my vision turned dark.&nbsp;I no longer knew what was happening, and I rubbed my eyes hastily.&nbsp;My breathing stopped before I knew it there was a sound like air flowing from my throat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">You know?&nbsp;When humans are faced with a reality that they don’t want to accept, the first thing they do is laugh.&nbsp;That’s a lie, right, god?&nbsp;Wait, I’m addressing a presence that I don’t even know exists.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I entered the village while shaking and wearing a creepy smile.&nbsp;I thought there might still be someone alive.&nbsp;But, that hope was crushed the moment I saw the young man with whom I had a close friendship, he had a big hole in his stomach.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh shit… .. Why did this happen… ..!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I knelt in front of the boy and lifted his little body.&nbsp;My tears broke out and spilled over the boy.&nbsp;At that moment, I realized that the hole in his stomach was not due to a magical attack.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The boy’s stomach had been cut with a sharp knife.&nbsp;In addition, all the internal organs had been removed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What does this mean…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I laid the boy’s body down carefully and watched the other villagers.&nbsp;Everything was removed from the stomachs of young women, children and men.&nbsp;I have seen many villages burned so far.&nbsp;I couldn’t help but remember what happened to my home village each time, but this time it’s not just something similar.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s exactly the same thing that happened to my village… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I do not get it.&nbsp;They told me that my home village was attacked and annihilated by monsters released by the demon king.&nbsp;But now that the demon king has been defeated and the demons are completely defeated, it is impossible to send monsters like at that time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[In that case, who did this… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He was perplexed looking at the fresh corpses.&nbsp;I started to go pale.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&mdash;&ndash; Have I made a serious mistake?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Around the same time, I heard a few unique footsteps of military shoes throughout the forest.&nbsp;The overlapping steps are of considerable number.&nbsp;I immediately held my sword and braced myself.&nbsp;Coming out of the green brush, there was a unit led by Sandra.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Sandra… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Is it a rescue force of the royal army?&nbsp;As I lowered my sword and tried to go towards them, I noticed that the unit was bringing children from the village.&nbsp;The children had pale and scared faces.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Have you taken the children for protection !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I though I was very unfortunate, but fortunate for now, I thought&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, bring him up]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Sandra raised her voice with a stern face, her subordinates brought Wendell over.&nbsp;He had some shackles, he was thrown and rolled in front of us.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wendell !?&nbsp;What happened!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[We were looking for you, Raul-dono.&nbsp;You suddenly disappeared after defeating the demon king.&nbsp;It’s a bit cruel that you didn’t reply to our letters]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Answer my questions, please!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I said that, Sandra put her hand on her waist and shook her head as if to say “Oh wow”.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The great magician was captured because he was suspected of being your accomplice]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… .. Accomplice?&nbsp;What are you talking about?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Sandra who was frowning, looked at me like something unpleasant.&nbsp;Then, I turned my gaze to the village behind.&nbsp;Following her gaze naturally, I took a deep breath.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait!&nbsp;Do you think I attacked Macquarie village?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[All people have been killed.&nbsp;Only a person with great magical powers can accomplish such a terrible act in a fraction of the time]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That doesn’t mean I could do this!&nbsp;It doesn’t matter how much power you have.&nbsp;Such cruel acts, it’s not something a human would do!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you have something to appeal, then speak in front of the princess, please&mdash;&ndash; Capture him!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I hastily held my sword and backed away slowly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This is not the time to do this.&nbsp;The culprit must still be around.&nbsp;Let me look it up!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Be cautious.&nbsp;He is the man who defeated the demon king, if we are careless, we will be killed instantly]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Stop.&nbsp;If you get any closer… ..I will have to defeat you by force]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">My mind right now was filled with having to find the real culprit.&nbsp;I didn’t even realize that my actions, sense of justice, and behavior were increasingly cornering me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I thought Sandra was getting it wrong.&nbsp;Because I knew I wasn’t the culprit.&nbsp;I really believed that everything would work out.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ha!&nbsp;I see you don’t understand the situation.&nbsp;Don’t you care what happens to him?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Saying that, Sandra kicked Wendell’s stomach.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Guhh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell’s spitting blood splattered on the floor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[S-stop!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I tried to stop her, Sandra put a dagger to Wendell’s neck.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t move]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Sandra herself has quite high combat power, and it would be difficult to attack with magic without harming children.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The magic that blocks the movement of the opponent’s body belongs to the magic of darkness.&nbsp;At that time, I couldn’t fight Sandra in that way, because my dark magic abilities were sealed by the saint.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Sorry, Raul… .. It was all due to my carelessness… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wendell.&nbsp;And your magic !?&nbsp;Can’t you use your magic to free yourself !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell has great abilities to call himself the great wizard.&nbsp;He can fight even his caught.&nbsp;But, he shook his head in frustration at my words.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I can’t do it… .. These guys are sealing the magic… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kuh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It is true.&nbsp;Because before speaking, I decided to give it a try.&nbsp;Wendell was arrested because resistance was futile.&nbsp;But how did they manage to capture a wizard like Wendell… ..?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Aren’t you going to save your partner?&nbsp;You are the “hero of salvation” right?&nbsp;You can save him &mdash;&ndash; okay, give me your sword]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Sandra’s provocative expression caused her to extend her hand.&nbsp;I couldn’t contradict her words, and tried to give her my sword for the sake of my only best friend.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t do it, Raul!&nbsp;Forget about me, and run!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There is no way I can do that… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ever since the hero party was formed, Wendell was someone I was closest more than anyone.&nbsp;I don’t know how many times the ridiculous conversations, He also had saved me  multiple times along our journey.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendel, who had been entrusted to the royal palace since childhood as a genius-candidate magician, accomplished many things and behaved like a nobleman.&nbsp;Being from the kingdom, he seemed to me someone worthy, and from the moment I met him, I had an emotion close to longing.&nbsp;It wasn’t long after I learned that he was a very kind and gluttonous guy.&nbsp;Every time we visited a new city or village, he would invite me to find something delicious and drag me around.&nbsp;Thanks to that, I was able to make many memories.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">We talked a lot during the trip.&nbsp;About the future, the feelings towards the family, the hope of the other.&nbsp;And also what happened that night.&nbsp;It was the day before entering the castle of the demon king, Wendell and I talked alone looking at the stars.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Are those young soldiers doing well on the battlefield?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『You really care for them a lot huh, Raul?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Well that’s true.&nbsp;It’s like I have younger siblings, so I can’t leave them alone.&nbsp;I wonder if it will be like this when my sister’s son grows up 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Claire-san’s child will be born next month right?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”Yes.&nbsp;My sister got married, I have a brother-in-law, and my nephew will be born soon… ..it’s like a dream.&nbsp;It’s like my family is increasing.&nbsp;It’s because my sister and I have always been alone 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I said that, Wendell shrugged wildly somewhat in disgust.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Hey, hey, don’t leave me out!&nbsp;We are like a family right? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Wendell… ..』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Hey, don’t make that kind voice』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As my hair tousled, I laughed.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">“Clear!&nbsp;Take it for granted! 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Raul.&nbsp;We will definitely defeat the demon king 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I cannot abandon a friend with whom I ate from the same pot and we went through the same difficulties.&nbsp;At the time, I really thought about it like that.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Goodness, the old me is a parade of embarrassing anecdotes.&nbsp;They just pushed me onto the stage and I happily performed the act according to the prepared script.&nbsp;Everything was happening without knowing it.&nbsp;Even if was stupid… ..even if I regret it, I can’t go back in time.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Well, let’s go back to the story.&nbsp;It seems she saw my determination by not letting go of my sword, so Sandra moved on to her next strategy.&nbsp;When she commanded a magic knight standing next to her, he quickly cast a spell.&nbsp;Immediately after that, the children around Sandra began to move slowly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Help!&nbsp;My body is moving by itself… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m scared…..!&nbsp;Help us, Raul-onii-chan… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You guys…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I knew immediately that the children were being manipulated.&nbsp;Their small hands held a dagger.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, what will you do now, hero-dono?&nbsp;The children are being controlled to kill each other.&nbsp;If I snap my fingers again, the little children’s blood will flow.&nbsp;It won’t be canceled unless you give up]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What the hell is this?&nbsp;For Sandra, children should be protected, but now they use them as tools to capture me.&nbsp;I came to the conclusion that I did not want to think and was surprised.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t tell me that… .. Did you attack the village?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In response to my question, Sandra did not deny or affirm anything, but simply pressured me to decide.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, what will you do?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Fine.&nbsp;I will give up]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I have no time to hesitate.&nbsp;This time when I actually dropped my sword, Sandra looked at me blankly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It will be a problem that this conclusion was reached so easily.&nbsp;That person will not be satisfied with this development]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you saying…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Sandra snapped her fingers, ignoring my question.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Immediately after that signal, the children began to stab each.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gahh… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Jets of blood came out of the mouth of the injured children.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No!&nbsp;I do not want!&nbsp;I don’t want to!&nbsp;Ahhhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While crying, the children stabbed each other with daggers several times.&nbsp;Turning pale, I screamed loudly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Stop!&nbsp;Stop…..!&nbsp;I did what you asked me!&nbsp;Please…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s okay.&nbsp;So stop them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Sandra gestured to the magic knight and the children fell to the ground.&nbsp;They have lost a lot of blood, they man not be saved.&nbsp;Thinking about that, I spoke.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Sandra!&nbsp;Treat the children!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Capture the hero]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Shit…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">They were no longer moving.&nbsp;The surviving children held the bloodstained daggers like empty shells.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Without knowing what happened to the children, they sent me to the royal capital and forced me to spend my days in prison.&nbsp;I was still unaware of Wendell’s betrayal even after I was taken to Victoria and heard from her that Macquarie villagers were massacred to put that crime on me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I was imprisoned in a castle, all my weapons were confiscated, and they performed multiple sealing spells to prevent me from using magic.&nbsp;I thought about not resisting to protect my friends, so I reluctantly accepted the seal.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In the darkness of the prison, completely in a state of confinement, my tears couldn’t stop as I remembered my miserably murdered sister and the villagers of Macquarie.&nbsp;At this point.&nbsp;I was more concerned about my friends than about Victoria’s actions.&nbsp;Ahh, what a laugh.&nbsp;Will Wendell, Christiana and the mercenaries who supported me be okay?&nbsp;I seriously thought about it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Victoria visited the jail many times a day.&nbsp;She would whip me hysterically with a whip, step on my crotch with her long heels, and the next time she came, she had a softer expression than before.&nbsp;This princess attacked the Macquarie village.&nbsp;When I look seriously at Victoria, it seems she didn’t like that.&nbsp;She got angry by grinding her teeth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even though your sister was murdered, are you still sane?&nbsp;Should I use the fetus that was taken from that woman to decorate this prison?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..Go ahead, just try to harass my companions.&nbsp;No matter what your excuse, I will kill you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What a fool you are, Raul.&nbsp;I don’t want us to kill each other.&nbsp;You just have to give me your body and soul]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, there is plenty of time to try various things.&nbsp;Let’s have fun together, Raul]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What have you said…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Being in a good mood, Victoria clapped her hands a few times.&nbsp;In response to that signal, I felt a presence moving deep within.&nbsp;Another person appears to have descended the spiral staircase that leads to this prison.&nbsp;The one standing strangely dressed was Wendell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……….!&nbsp;Wendell!&nbsp;Are You alright!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I was relieved to see Wendell’s face, and for a moment I forgot everything and ran to the iron bars.&nbsp;When I met his eyes, Wendell distorted his expression and lowered his head.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’ll give you some alone time]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Victoria who said that with a creepy and gentle voice, raised the hem of her skirt a little and left.&nbsp;Being distracted by Wendell’s presence, i wasn’t able to think anything.&nbsp;Until Victoria was completely gone, Wendell kept his head down.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m sorry.&nbsp;Raul… ..because of me you… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do not worry!&nbsp;You’re fine!?&nbsp;Didn’t they do something horrible to you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Looking at him, Wendell didn’t appear to be hurt.&nbsp;That was a enough for me.&nbsp;I didn’t know what Victoria could do.&nbsp;It wouldn’t be strange if she tormented the people I cherished.&nbsp;As it was with my sister.&nbsp;As I was thinking about that, I asked Wendell about the situation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Actually, I’m being threatened by Victoria.&nbsp;She will forgive me if I can persuade you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Persuade?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul.&nbsp;If you become the servant of Princess Victoria, she will free us]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That cannot be…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I was stunned.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Is that what Victoria really wants?&nbsp;Did she do that to my sister and the villagers just for that… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I hated Victoria so much that I bit my lips until blood came out.&nbsp;I can’t forgive that woman.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..Please, Raul.&nbsp;Become the princess’s slave… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell dropped his shoulders and begged me with a stubborn face.&nbsp;His eyes tremble with concern and shook with a slight noise.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t be afraid, Wendell.&nbsp;Everything is fine.&nbsp;If that helps everyone, I will gladly accept it.&nbsp;So…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Do not worry.&nbsp;When he was about to say that, Wendell suddenly looked up.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, hey, give me a break, Raul]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendel suddenly changed his attitude and looked at me somewhat disgusted.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Will you really get to that point?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wendell?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You really are a fool!&nbsp;For that reason they used you!&nbsp;You are not the strongest hero in the world, but the biggest idiot in the world!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Wendell screamed, he began to laugh holding his stomach.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you talking about?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What you still don’t get it?&nbsp;All was a lie!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[A lie?&nbsp;What do you mean…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[To get started.&nbsp;Did you really think those weak knights could capture me?&nbsp;It bothers me a lot that you underestimate my abilities]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I didn’t understand what Wendell was saying, I was just flabbergasted.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you become that princess’s dog, really think about keeping yourself without killing yourself.&nbsp;But it wouldn’t be interesting that way.&nbsp;So you had to reject it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wendell… .. What are you… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I want you to die.&nbsp;You have always been a nuisance]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell said it with a smile.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[First of all, Princess Victoria doesn’t understand.&nbsp;I should have killed your sister in the end.&nbsp;To be more precise, until the baby was born, that way it would be the baby and then the sister.&nbsp;She discarded her trump card to convince you early on.&nbsp;It seems that she does not know anything]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..It’s a lie, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if she tormented you, that won’t affect you.&nbsp;That is why an important person has to be used.&nbsp;Upon learning of the betrayal, the number of pawns that can be used in this way will decrease drastically]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… .. Who betrayed whom… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell grasped the iron bars and opened his bloodshot eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[US!&nbsp;We betray you ~!&nbsp;Me, Christiana, the general, Sandra, the soldiers, everyone&mdash;&ndash;!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……….!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Your strength is too dangerous.&nbsp;A traitor like me cannot sleep easy while you are alive.&nbsp;That’s why I wanted you to die]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No It can’t be… ..Victoria is threatening you right?&nbsp;Wendell… ..please say it’s a lie… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Just believe me once.&nbsp;The conversation will not proceed otherwise.&nbsp;Oh by the way, we received a mansion from the royal palace, and we are living comfortably]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">His laughing voice echoes through the prison.&nbsp;My head has been hurting for a long time, it must be from too much confusion.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oh it’s true.&nbsp;I revealed the home where your sister live]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What… ..my sister… .. Why… ..?&nbsp;If you tell them where that place is in this situation, you should know that… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You really are an idiot!&nbsp;For that reason I did it!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">My mind was blank at Wendell’s words.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I thought your spirit would be shattered if your sister and the baby in her womb were killed.&nbsp;Seeing you suffer, my heart that has always been boiling would finally calm down.&nbsp;But, you are still in a state of mind where you can have a conversation normally.&nbsp;I thought you were a fucking siscon with everything you said, was it a performance?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wendell… ..you to my sister… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[First of all, your sister pissed me off.&nbsp;Even when I was proposed to her, she refused, and married that boring craftsman!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I knew Wendell was interested in my sister.&nbsp;That is why I thought he was a good guy when he blessed her marriage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Although when I looked at her belly, I felt better]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A voice like that of a beast was about to overflow from my mouth, so I desperately bit my lips.&nbsp;The taste of blood spreads in my mouth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why…..?&nbsp;Do you hate me so much… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I was finally able to control myself, Wendell spat in disgust.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hate?&nbsp;There’s no way I can make such an important decision in my life with that ridiculous kind of emotion]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Then why…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[The demon king was defeated.&nbsp;We have been raised to defeat the demon king, but now that he is dead, we are worth nothing.&nbsp;Both you and the others, it was natural to find another job, right?&nbsp;I decided to choose the princess who has the greatest power in the kingdom, and support her as a wizard.&nbsp;That’s it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">In the face of despair, my eyes dim.&nbsp;Is he really Wendell?&nbsp;Is he the man i considered an important friend?&nbsp;It may be a mind trick that Victoria prepared.&nbsp;I wanted to believe that.&nbsp;But, unfortunately mind trick don’t work for me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Also, Wendell is resistant to the magic of brainwashing.&nbsp;In other words, this Wendell standing in front of me is the real one, and he’s saying those words of his own free will.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I never thought of you as a companion.&nbsp;You were more like a  &mdash;&ndash;  just a stepping stone]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Those kids caught by Sandra.&nbsp;The magic that was cast to manipulate them was Wendell’s doing, he said it himself as if having fun.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Does Christiana think the same as you… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do not say that.&nbsp;She is not as vulgar as I am.&nbsp;Tomorrow is her turn to visit you.&nbsp;Then, you will hear her sermon]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That cannot be…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have a face of being betrayed.&nbsp;But, I despised you from the beginning!&nbsp;You were always imitating me!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Imitating… ..?&nbsp;You’re wrong.&nbsp;It was not an imitation… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if it wasn’t, I was already tired of it!&nbsp;Because of you it didn’t stand out!&nbsp;You always, always, always, always attracted more attention than me!&nbsp;Were was done!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell got up and turned away from me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[See you, Raul.&nbsp;By the way, Princess Victoria left you a message “If you don’t intend to become my dog, then you better be executed”]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">My screams at being betrayed continued to echo through the prison even after Wendell left&mdash;&ndash;</p>

<p><strong>Part 10 &#8211; Vengeance Amphitheater</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you are the real Raul, you will never kill me, will you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Being immersed in nostalgic memories, I was brought back to reality by Wendell’s voice.&nbsp;It seems that Wendell has accepted me as the real one directly, unlike Victoria who only treated me as an impostor.&nbsp;And for that reason, I think he has regained his calm.&nbsp;As he smiled, he scoffed.&nbsp;Even at a time like this, it’s typical of him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Hey, Ada.&nbsp;Could you let me deal with Wendell here? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But he said you can’t kill him… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『That’s why I have an idea』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[An idea?&nbsp;Okay.&nbsp;You are the one who best knows how to use this power ruthlessly.&nbsp;In return, I won’t forgive you if you’re soft]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『So, you want to compete with me for who can get a more ruthless revenge?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I replaced Ada and regained control of my body.&nbsp;Looking at me, Wendell frowned.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, how much are you mumbling?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Nothing really.&nbsp;Well now what did you say?&nbsp;That i can’t I kill you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes.&nbsp;I’ve heard all about your revenge.&nbsp;You’re taking revenge according to a rule, aren’t you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Something like that]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell laughed and put his right hand on his waist.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I know you very well.&nbsp;You hate doing things that are against the rules right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Because it was like he said, I laughed and nodded.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Hey, wait a minute.&nbsp;Even now, we are laughing the same way.&nbsp;Oh my, realizing that, I couldn’t help but laugh more.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul.&nbsp;I certainly betrayed you.&nbsp;Because of me, you were captured and finally executed.&nbsp;But, it wasn’t me who killed you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes.&nbsp;That’s true]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It was that crazy princess who ordered it, the soldiers and knights tortured you.&nbsp;I didn’t kill anyone important to you.&nbsp;I just betrayed you a little, didn’t I?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You are right]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s why you won’t kill me.&nbsp;No you can’t kill me]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Good that’s true]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I answered, the look of joy spread across Wendell’s face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Huh.&nbsp;Hahahahahahahahahahaha!&nbsp;Good!&nbsp;I did it!&nbsp;I will not die!&nbsp;I am safe!&nbsp;Ha ha ha ha ha ha!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ahh, I see that you are very happy.&nbsp;When Wendell was trying to cast transfer magic, I immediately countered him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oh.&nbsp;There is no reason to be in such a hurry.&nbsp;The show has just begun.&nbsp;So stay and enjoy it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[A show…..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I snapped my fingers as usual and activated the magic of darkness.&nbsp;The space was distorted and changed to another landscape.&nbsp;In just a few seconds, the spacious room was turned into an amphitheater.&nbsp;All right, it’s done.&nbsp;When I clapped a bit and looked back, Wendell blinked repeatedly in a daze.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What is this?&nbsp;… .. Is it the amphitheater of the royal capital?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell muttered looking at the audience seats built into the establishment in a circular fashion.&nbsp;The demons sitting in the audience seats were also confused.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What did you do?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I already told you.&nbsp;We are going to put on a show.&nbsp;But, the room from before was too small for everyone to attend.&nbsp;So I decided to took us all to a magical space recreated the amphitheater in the royal capital]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell was shocked to see the demons filling the stands, and the amphitheater that is produced in detail.&nbsp;I suppose he’s surprised that magic affected the others as well.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Is this the power of dark magic?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, my friend.&nbsp;I’ll let you see it in a special seat]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I magically manipulated Wendell and forced him to sit in the king’s seat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This is…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s nostalgic isn’t it?&nbsp;It is a magic that deprives the body of freedom and manipulates it.&nbsp;The dark wizard you hired used it on the children of Macquarie village]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kuh… .. What are you planning to do?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">What an idiot.&nbsp;It would be boring to tell you.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, I’m an actor on stage.&nbsp;Although I am still a presenter on stage to drag them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I smiled.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I hope you enjoy it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I took a big leap and landed in the center of the amphitheater.&nbsp;Then, I turned my gaze towards Allingham who was shaking.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[PPP-Please spare my life!&nbsp;I’ll give you all the money you want… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You rich people always say that first everytime.&nbsp;When I began my revenge, an equally vulgar priest who prostate on the ground and said something similar.&nbsp;Do you want to know what happened to him?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham shook his head while trembling.&nbsp;How not?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You really want to know, right?&nbsp;&mdash;You see, after killing him with the torment of water, I burned him along with a whole church]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiiii]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But, unfortunately I can’t kill you.&nbsp;Because I have not received damage directly from you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wendell said it a while ago.&nbsp;I have a rule of only returning what they did.&nbsp;You have invested a considerable amount of funds in Director Da Costa’s research facilities to earn money and the backing of the aristocracy.&nbsp;Certainly as a result, my companions were used as tools for experiments, but you have not made direct contact]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-Yes-It’s true!&nbsp;It is true!&nbsp;That’s right!&nbsp;Hahaha…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham stroked his chest as if relieved.&nbsp;No, no, why do you have hope in this situation?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[For that reason, I decided to leave the revenge against you to others]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ehh?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There are many here who want revenge on you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I turned my neck slowly, and indicated the audience seats with my chin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I will entertain myself in a special seat watching how you suffer]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Saying that, I closed my eyes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Now it’s your turn, Ada.&nbsp;Have fun”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes thanks]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It’s a shame, Allingham.&nbsp;This girl hates you much more than I do.</p>

<p><strong>Part 11 &#8211; I Will Take that Weapon</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham was scared.&nbsp;Well, it’s natural, I don’t think there is anyone who can stay calm in this situation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Guards!&nbsp;Guards!&nbsp;Shit!&nbsp;Has no one really survived?&nbsp;Where is Wendell?&nbsp;Help me!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[All guards are dead.&nbsp;Wendell is around]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham screamed when he saw Wendell sitting in the honorary seat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why won’t you help me!?&nbsp;Are you going to betray me !?&nbsp;Wendeeeeeeeell!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You must know that treason is his specialty.&nbsp;You can curse the fact that you trusted him.&nbsp;Well, I came up with the idea of ​​putting you through the same thing you did to all the slaves you brought to these facilities]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I see.&nbsp;That’s a very interesting strategy!&nbsp;They would watch an exciting show.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Remember what you did, Allingham]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiiiiiiiii!&nbsp;Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossibleeeee!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Allingham raised a pathetic voice, he tried to crawl away.&nbsp;It’s useless.&nbsp;Ada dragged Alingham’s foot back and looked out into the audience.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Is there anyone who wants to help with revenge towards this guy ~?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The interior of the place became silent.&nbsp;But it was a moment, then the demons raised their hands screaming loudly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uohhhhhhhh!&nbsp;I will do it!&nbsp;Let me do it!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Let me do it!&nbsp;That guy is my sister’s enemy!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmph.&nbsp;Almost every?&nbsp;However, if there are too many, it will be difficult to see what they are doing, so you will take turns.&nbsp;First it will be that person, that person, that person.&nbsp;Then&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When the nominees were pointed out, they made a victory pose and shouted with joy.&nbsp;Ada floated them in the air with the magic I taught her, and threw them into the amphitheater.&nbsp;Everyone is thirsty for revenge.&nbsp;Yeah, they have some good expressions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[First listen to the explanation.&nbsp;I want them to give back everything they did to them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Can we do what we want?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What do you want to do specifically?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, uh, well, hit it or kick it]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Ada sighed, she looked directly at him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hit?&nbsp;Kick?&nbsp;Hasn’t this guy done worse to you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">That seems to have reminded them.&nbsp;The faces of the selected demons were distorted with frustration and anger.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[…..It is true.&nbsp;It is true.&nbsp;They gouged out my father’s eyes and poured wine into his sockets… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do you understand now?&nbsp;It will be much more satisfying to give back what they did to them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes!&nbsp;That’s true!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada nodded smiling at the demons who saw her.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[So could you start?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s okay.&nbsp;Leave it to us.&nbsp;Hey, let’s get him undressed first!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ohhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When the demons raised their voices, they all jumped towards Allingham and began ripping up his clothes.&nbsp;When Allingham’s poor nakedness was exposed, the demons pointed it out and laughed at it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Pff!&nbsp;Hahahahaha!&nbsp;Look at this guy’s body!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiii… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham, who was naked, hid his body as if curled up.&nbsp;But, he was quickly held back by the demons on both sides and forced to stand.&nbsp;Its limbs are all thin.&nbsp;For that reason, only your stomach stores fat and rebounds.&nbsp;Beneath that flesh, his crotch seems to have shrunk from so much fear, that tiny thing swayed miserably.&nbsp;Red-faced, Allingham tried to hide his crotch with his thighs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Now what’s next?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even the filthy demons were splashed and washed so savagely that their bodies turned red!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At Ada’s words, the demons screamed in response.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Ada, I’ll teach you a spell.&nbsp;Recite it as I say 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Okay]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Ada recited the spell I taught her, a large bucket of water appeared.&nbsp;On top of that, there were deck brushes for each person.&nbsp;When Ada handed over the deck brushes, the demons squeezed the handle and glared at Allingham.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Let’s go!&nbsp;Clean it up properly!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ohhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiii… .. Stop &mdash;&ndash; ahhh!&nbsp;Gah… .. I-It hurts… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The water in the bucket was applied mercilessly, and Allingham screamed.&nbsp;Of course, no one has ever heard of the word stop.&nbsp;Immediately, the sound of skin brushing against the brush could be heard.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[H-It hurts… ..!&nbsp;S-Stop… ..gyaaa.&nbsp;It’s cold… it hurts, it hurts]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">His flabby skin quickly turned red and in places began to bleed.&nbsp;Cheers were heard from the audience seats.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes!&nbsp;More!&nbsp;Much more!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Let’s let him know what he deserves!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons kept scrubbing their brushes.&nbsp;They are surely remembering what they did to them.&nbsp;The screams increase and the excitement grows.&nbsp;Along with that, the violence towards Allingham grew worse.&nbsp;When they pressed the brushes to his face, it caused him to lose his balance and fall, taking advantage of that, he was hit many times with the handles of the brushes.&nbsp;After having given him that violent assault, and when the demons were out of breath, Ada raised her voice.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I guess it was like that]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Giii… .d-hurts… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham who was rolling on the ground, was shaking with bloody tears.&nbsp;Ada looked at Allingham as if she was looking at disgusting garbage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii… .Hii….]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After a short rest, Allingham took a desperate breath.&nbsp;Of course, this break is to amplify the pain.&nbsp;Ada knelt next to Allingham, and whispered slowly to him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, this isn’t over yet]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham’s shoulders jumped.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Okay everyone.&nbsp;After cleaning, what’s next now ~?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Ada asked the audience, the demons who were happy watching the show raised their voices in great encouragement.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Castration!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Castration!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Banish it!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A petition for castration began.&nbsp;Ada clapped her hands and smiled saying “Ah, that’s true.”&nbsp;I like it.&nbsp;The role of the presenter is to follow the audience.&nbsp;It’s a huge difference from when shee was hesitant to kill the guards or performed that unconventional performance with an awkward attitude.&nbsp;Are you finally determined or are you excited for the demons’ revenge?&nbsp;Either way, I want to welcome Ada’s change.&nbsp;Because revenge is fun after all.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I could remember thanks to everyone.&nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;All men should be castrated right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiiiiiiii.&nbsp;Stop…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham clung to Ada’s feet.&nbsp;He was desperately begging with tears, blood, a runny nose and a drooling face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Please!&nbsp;Everything but that… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh?&nbsp;Why?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada placed her hand on her lips with a deliberately sharp face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s being a hypocrite for someone who hurt a lot of young children.&nbsp;Even such a disgusting thing can be a terrible weapon for children, both physically and mentally.&nbsp;Don’t you think?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada kicked Allingham’s crotch as she asked him emotionally.&nbsp;Uwaa, that must hurt ~.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Agahhhhh …….!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Laughter was heard from inside the place looking at the sore Allingham.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have outraged and killed countless girls, right?&nbsp;You didn’t hear them even though they screamed for help.&nbsp;You broke their bodies with that disgusting thing, didn’t you?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It hurts, it hurts]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[For the girls who died it was much more painful!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When Ada declared that, she pulled on Allingham’s thing and began to squeeze it with brute force.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gyaaaaa!&nbsp;It hurt!&nbsp;It hurt]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What hurts?&nbsp;Do not lie.&nbsp;You’re getting hard.&nbsp;I see you like pain]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You’re wrong, that’s… .. Gyaaaaa!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That nasty.&nbsp;This guy is a complete pervert]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">And that you say it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Good, Ada.&nbsp;The next spell&mdash;&ndash; 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After teaching her a new magic effect and how to use it, a smile spread across Ada’s face.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That method of revenge is the best]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada gladly recited the spell and cast the magic I taught her.&nbsp;A ring of light tangled in Allingham’s crotch that Ada manifested, and she squeezed the base of it tightly.&nbsp;Then what appeared next was an ice blade.&nbsp;Ada used that blade towards Allingham’s bound crotch.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gyaaaaaaa!&nbsp;Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Hahahaha!&nbsp;I like that scream!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Suffer.&nbsp;Rot.&nbsp;Suffers]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Saying that, Ada stepped on the severed crotch several times.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiii… ..that cruel… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham was trying to stop the bleeding as he cried.&nbsp;His hands were stained with blood from all that blood overflowing.&nbsp;What he used to have fun to many children no longer exists.&nbsp;Seeing that, the slave men walked up to him and patted him on the shoulders.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Welcome to our world]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham’s face went pale.&nbsp;As a price for committing cruel acts towards children, it was no longer possible for him to do what he liked best.&nbsp;Unable to accept that fact, Allingham screamed desperately throughout the amphitheater.</p>

<p><strong>Part 12 &#8211; You're the Next One</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">Thanks to Ada, who learned the recovery magic I taught her and used it regularly, Allingham was able to follow the “Time of Punishment” without dying early.&nbsp;Those who took part in the revenge went on a rotating basis, and I made sure that as many demons as possible could punished him with their bare hands.&nbsp;Those who were beaten with whips did the same, those who had an iron bar pressed into their skin did the same to Allingham.&nbsp;I didn’t force them to take my revenge rule, but the method of giving back everything they did to them, they seem to like it.&nbsp;It is as Ada said at the beginning, the atrocities done by Allingham towards the slaves are very promising.&nbsp;For example, amputating a person’s limbs until they cannot move, gouging out the eyes of the undernourished who could no longer see well.&nbsp;When some were tired, he would place them on a burning iron plate and cheerfully clap his hands saying “What’s wrong?&nbsp;You are well enough to dance. ”&nbsp;The testimonies of such acts went on and on.&nbsp;I think it would have been a lot of work to come up with a better revenge method than that, so it wasn’t bad this way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&ndash;Well.&nbsp;After a long revenge play, in the middle of the amphitheater was Allingham with hollow eyes and just a simple torso on the ground.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes… ..we finally did it!&nbsp;We kill him!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ha ha ha ha ha ha!&nbsp;You deserve that!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Allingham was already dead, but the cheers throughout the amphitheater continued to resound.&nbsp;By the way, the final cause of his death was suffocation caused by a girl who filled her mouth with a large amount of mud.&nbsp;All the avengers wore ecstatic expressions.&nbsp;It is said that revenge only brings a void inside, but I wonder if the same could be said when looking at this scene.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Very good, Ada.&nbsp;Now it’s Wendell’s turn 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada, who was used to it, withdrew and gave me control of my body.&nbsp;In this short time, we have become a good combination.&nbsp;I went straight to Wendel, who was tied up in the guest seat.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well then.&nbsp;Did you enjoy the show?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell shook his head tiredly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm? it wasn’t to your liking?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul.&nbsp;Don’t you look more like that princess than me?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I was surprised when he said something unexpected to me.&nbsp;Do we look alike?&nbsp;Victoria and me?&nbsp;I started thinking with my arms crossed.&nbsp;I guess we look alike.&nbsp;When I thought about that, I couldn’t help but laugh.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[…… Pff.&nbsp;Ahahahahahaha!&nbsp;Oh, wow!&nbsp;It certainly seems so!&nbsp;Cruel behaviors, being prone to getting excited when seeing someone hurt.&nbsp;It certainly sounds like Victoria.&nbsp;Hahaha.&nbsp;Haha ~.&nbsp;My tears come out.&nbsp;I’ll talk to her when I get home!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Are you living with the princess?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I replied with a smile to Wendell who had an expression of not understanding anything.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Everyone is there.&nbsp;Victoria, Sandra, the general.&nbsp;Well the general fell apart after turning into a zombie, so I put his remains in an urn to decorate the place]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-What are you saying… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell’s lips were tight.&nbsp;I like that face.&nbsp;I want to make the traitor’s miserable face stand out more.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, it doesn’t matter.&nbsp;Raul, could you free me at once?&nbsp;I already accompanied you a lot with this farce, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh~?&nbsp;What are you talking about?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">This guy really has a very shallow head.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Now is your turn]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[HA, you can’t get back at me, can you?&nbsp;Because I didn’t do anything to you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell was impatient for a moment, but immediately pretended to be calm.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Anyway, I’m leaving now.&nbsp;This is unpleasant]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He tried to rush down the stairs from the audience seats.&nbsp;But, when I looked down at him, I showed a big smile.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You are a fool]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I can not help smiling.&nbsp;Because it’s so, so, so fun.&nbsp;This is much more interesting than when we talk under the stars!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do you really think that I will not break the rule that I have decided?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What?!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I am not an ally of justice.&nbsp;I am a lunatic avenger.&nbsp;Did you really think that someone like that wouldn’t break the rules?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell’s face twisted.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Raul.&nbsp;You…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ahh, this is the best.&nbsp;That is the face I was looking for.&nbsp;It must be that.&nbsp;It is the pathetic expression of a man who was betrayed.</p>

<p><strong>Part 13 &#8211; Suffering Beyond Death</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">He must have realized that I was not joking when he saw my eyes.&nbsp;Wendell was pale and stiff.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s a lie… .. What happened to revenge according to the rule… ..!?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ha ha.&nbsp;About that?&nbsp;You see, it was a lie to fool a traitor like you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……….!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">He currently showing the same face that I have when he told me “You really naive and stupid Raul?”.&nbsp;I looked into Wendell’s eyes very closely, unable to control my feelings of amusement.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, tell me.&nbsp;Now that you know you were cheated, how do you feel?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kuh.&nbsp;Damned.&nbsp;You’re just stupid… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Can’t you forgive someone like me putting you through something humiliating?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I get it, I get it.&nbsp;It’s very frustrating isn’t it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Frustrated…..?&nbsp;I?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have a “It’s so frustrating I could die” face.&nbsp;It is a feeling that I wanted to give you.&nbsp;I understand it really good]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t screw me… ..!&nbsp;Don’t compare me to you!&nbsp;I am a chosen person called a “prodigy”!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yes Yes.&nbsp;I don’t care about those arguments.&nbsp;I’ve heard it so many times in the past that my hates bled.&nbsp;Although in the past I did not realize that all that was for showing off.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I was able to trick the traitor back.&nbsp;So from now on, we will enter the “Time of Retaliation” that goes beyond revenge]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What do you mean?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I grabbed Wendell by the chest and forced him to stand up.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you doing!?&nbsp;Stop!&nbsp;Stop!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Stop screaming and start walking]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I pushed Wendell from behind.&nbsp;Losing his balance, he fell down the stairs of the amphitheater in a ridiculous way.&nbsp;He hit himself as he fell, and reached the end of the audience seats.&nbsp;I immediately floated Wendell’s body in the air.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Guh… .. W-What’s wrong !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Of course, it was my magic.&nbsp;There was nothing to notice, and I threw Wendell into the center of the amphitheater.&nbsp;Don’t forget to drop it on a cushion so it doesn’t fall to the floor.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Turning his neck to see what he had fallen into, Wendell raised a cry.&nbsp;After all, it was on Allingham’s naked corpse.&nbsp;For my part, I wouldn’t want to be on top of that disgusting thing.&nbsp;Wendell backed away hastily and got into position toward me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oh, are you finally motivated?&nbsp;That’s the spirit]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I thought it would be better to get out of this game if I had a chance.&nbsp;But… ..in this situation, it seems that I will have to fight]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do you think you can beat me?&nbsp;Back then, you were the second in the hero party, remember?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[S-Shut up… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Making an expression as if a wound had been touched, Wendell yelled out a spell.&nbsp;How fast.&nbsp;A fire serpent appeared along with the sound of an explosion and coiled in the amphitheater.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiii!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[N-No It will burn us… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons screamed in fear at that huge snake that covered the amphitheater.&nbsp;To cast fire magic of the highest class, Wendell is seen to be acknowledging my abilities.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Take this!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The snake with a harsh noise came towards me.&nbsp;I tried to activate protection magic, but the barrier was breaking quickly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Hey, can you avoid this… ..!?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada’s worried voice echoed in my head.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh.&nbsp;Maybe it’s difficult]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”That can’t be…..”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I spoke to Ada, the barrier shattering along with a great sound, and my body was engulfed in fire in an instant.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Kyaaaaa!』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I could feel the anguished Ada very closely.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Haha, hahahaha… .. You’ve seen it!&nbsp;I am incredible!&nbsp;A wonder!&nbsp;I am very different from you!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">My whole body is eroded by a sensation that I don’t know if it’s from the heat or the pain.&nbsp;It was an explosion that shook me to the core.&nbsp;But&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, you certainly are amazing]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s I-impossible… .. Why didn’t you die !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Amid the burning flames, I started laughing.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm ~?&nbsp;The reason is simple.&nbsp;Because I have decided that I still cannot die]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-What are you saying… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It is up to me to live or die.&nbsp;I won’t let anyone else decide my ending.&nbsp;That’s why I got this great power]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A mysterious black swirl emerged from the palm of my hand.&nbsp;As the whirlpool grew out of the ground, it swallowed up the flame serpent, replacing it with a dragon that was larger than flames than Wendell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Time to extinguish your little flame]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Y-You must be kidding… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell was surprised to see me with my arms outstretched.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I wish you had mastered the magic of darkness]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t talk nonsense… ..that magic cannot be used unless you exchange your soul with the devil.&nbsp;No kidding the devil will do whatever it want with your soul after you die… ..in the first place, you cannot say that it is your own strength if you are depending on that power… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No matter the reason, anyone would accept it if it is to obtain power, right?&nbsp;As a result of denying that, you are now in trouble.&nbsp;Well now it’s my turn]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I extended my hand to Wendell, I activated a spell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uguu… .. Uohhhhhhhhhh!&nbsp;My magic power… ..my magic power is being absorbed… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Geh.&nbsp;What is this?&nbsp;Your magic power is very unpleasant]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh… ..Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Eh~?&nbsp;your already empty]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Hmm.&nbsp;Surprisingly it was very little.&nbsp;No, I wonder if the power I obtained is inexhaustible.&nbsp;Ha ha~.&nbsp;Wendell, whose magic power ran out, sat down on the ground.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You can no longer cast magic now.&nbsp;What should I call the great wizard who cannot use magic?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..ahh… ..ah… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell’s eyes widened.&nbsp;When they are completely cornered, all the garbage always put that face.&nbsp;This expression is my favorite.&nbsp;A burning joy was emerging from the bottom of my stomach.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yes!&nbsp;This is the thrill that revenge gives me!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I sighed in ecstasy and stood in front of Wendell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Although, I was somewhat doubtful.&nbsp;You just betrayed me, so I started to think about how to make you suffer.&nbsp;It was always easy as I only gave back to them what they did.&nbsp;But, this time it wasn’t like that, was it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Then you would have done the same this time too… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, I don’t think it’s too much for the traitor to be betrayed]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Oh it’s true.&nbsp;I accidentally hit the palm of my hand.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I came up with something very good!&nbsp;Allingham got a lot of revenge right?&nbsp;So I’ll imitate that]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[D-Don’t fuck with me!&nbsp;I didn’t do any of that!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes, but you supported it.&nbsp;Nobody went against him.&nbsp;For which you have part of the responsibility]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That reason is crazy!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I don’t care.&nbsp;I just want you to suffer]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I got out in front of Wendell, he looked at me pitifully.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Why should I go through such miserable treatment !?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well~&nbsp;It was Allingham who came up with all of that, so if you want to complain, do it with him.&nbsp;Ah, but too bad he’s already dead.&nbsp;Ahahaha!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You have to know how to choose who to work with.&nbsp;This is what happens when you only think about profit and loss &mdash;&ndash; alright, I think the first was stripping and washing]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uwaaa]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I tore up Wendell’s clothes the same way the demons did.&nbsp;He has a trained body so he’s not as bad as Allingham’s.&nbsp;I also know that he was doing bad things a bit while we were traveling using his good facial features and his body.&nbsp;Now that I think about it, with hints of that, why did my old self think he was a nice guy?&nbsp;His body and heart are rotten after all.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, I’ll clean you up.&nbsp;Ah, but using the same deck brush that was used at Allingham would be boring.&nbsp;So I’ll add something of my own selection]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Along with a sound, a large deck brush appeared in my hand.&nbsp;Watching the brush part glow silver, Wendell was shocked.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[How about this brush?&nbsp;I did it with several large needles.&nbsp;It may hurt.&nbsp;Okay, let the cleaning begin ~]</p>



<img src="https://i.ibb.co/pj0tb5g/000050.png" height="500" width="350"></img>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As my memories of Wendell flashed through my head, I began to rub his skin.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiii, it hurts, it hurts, stop it!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell’s skin was bloody in an instant.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahh, it’s getting blood stained just as I’m cleaning.&nbsp;I’ll have to go over that part again]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahhhhhhhhhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[By the way, you really are stupid.&nbsp;Unlike the saint, your real body was not in the royal capital, so you were lucky not to get caught.&nbsp;But, you ran away thinking that I wouldn’t kill you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Agahhhhhh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, it didn’t matter where you had hidden, I would definitely have found you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell raised a cry when i rubbed the brush on his face.&nbsp;Ahh, his beautiful face is ruined.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Speaking of which, it seems that there were some slaves who while they were being washed, they put their faces in a bucket full of water and died.&nbsp;Is there anyone who witnessed it ~?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Dozens of demons raised their hands at my words.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, it will have to be done the same way.&nbsp;But, I think just water won’t be enough]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I activated my magic, I collected Allingham’s scattered blood and urine.&nbsp;But that was not enough, so I brought Allingham’s body, cut him up, and squeezed out all the blood that was left in his body.&nbsp;That was about half a cube.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[This must be enough to drown you, Wendell]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Agah]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I grabbed his hair, lifted his bloody face, and put it inside the red bucket with force.&nbsp;Wendell is struggling desperately.&nbsp;It must be painful.&nbsp;Also, it’s not just blood, there’s urine mixed in too, so it’s gross.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Come on, come on, I’ll let you breathe a little, so push yourself]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wow, augg, stop….!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahahahahaha!&nbsp;Yes, that face is the best!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ugohh, huh, it hurts… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well that true.&nbsp;The slaves also thought the same right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I raised his face several times, and I enjoyed his expression, but I got tired since it was the same reaction every time.&nbsp;This form of suffering is not very funny.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well then it’s looks like it’s time to kill you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I froze the surface of the cube with Wendell’s face inside.&nbsp;Wendell, whose face is fixed on the thick ice due to magic, could not escape the blood and was struggling desperately.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Bubbles are created under the ice.&nbsp;You are trying to lift your face by holding the cube with both hands, but it is useless.&nbsp;Immediately, the bubbling momentum subsided and finally disappeared completely.&nbsp;His hands and feet were no longer moving.&nbsp;On the large bulletin board in the amphitheater, the words 【Kill Counter &ndash; 1】 were displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Part 14 &#8211; Hell Continues even when Waking up from a Dream</strong></p>


<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oi ~ Hey, wake up.&nbsp;There is no time to be dead all the time]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After pouring cold water on him, Wendell slowly woke up.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Coff, Coff… ..huh… .eh… .. Why… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell looked around him as if puzzled while on the ground.&nbsp;Instead of not understanding what was going on, he had a face that he couldn’t believe.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m supposed to be dead… ..no, Did i just lost consciousness… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Tell me, Wendell.&nbsp;What was it like to be suffocated?&nbsp;Was it painful?&nbsp;I’m sure it is ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I crouched in front of Wendell and asked him since he didn’t seem to understand.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What does this mean…..?&nbsp;Did I die once and then revive… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes, and also no.&nbsp;But that is not important.&nbsp;The only important thing is that I can still have fun with you]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..W-what]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Eyes wide, Wendell said nothing.&nbsp;It seems that he was stunned because he could not believe it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, Wendell.&nbsp;You still listening?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I grabbed his hair and forced him to look up.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii… .. L-Let go of me!&nbsp;D-Demon… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That sounds good to me.&nbsp;Well here we go]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While smiling, I pulled out a large magic scissors.&nbsp;Of course, it is one that has very rusty blades.&nbsp;That way, it wouldn’t be possible to cut very well.&nbsp;I’m not as nice as Ada, so I won’t castrate him in an instant.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, Wendell.&nbsp;I think you already know what will happen now right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiiiii!!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Because it’s a little rusty, it might be a little more painful]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gy… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gy?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gyaaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell tried to escape while screaming like a beast.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I won’t let you do what you want!&nbsp;I … I am the great magician called “prodigy”!&nbsp;I am the one with a clearer and more successful life than anyone else!&nbsp;Me…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell screamed and began to cast a spell at tremendous speed.&nbsp;However, he soon realized that he had lost all his magic, and gasped.&nbsp;That’s right, you don’t even have the power to resist anymore.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Just give up.&nbsp;You can never escape my hands again]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I prevented Wendell’s escape with just the movement of my fingers, and slowly approached from behind.&nbsp;And in that way, I hugged his trembling body.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You don’t need to be afraid ~.&nbsp;I’ll do it gently ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[S-stop!&nbsp;Please…..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[No matter how much fuss you make, it’s useless ~.&nbsp;Okay now show me that dangling thing ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hiiii!&nbsp;Noooooooooooo!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell, who screamed in tears, was so funny I couldn’t help but laugh.&nbsp;Taking advantage of that gap, Wendell started running again.&nbsp;This time he seems to be running towards the exit of the amphitheater.&nbsp;After having fun watching it, and just before Wendell made it to the exit, I showed infront of him with transfer magic.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahaha ~.&nbsp;I told you right?&nbsp;You can no longer escape from my hands]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[D-Don’t come near… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There is nowhere to escape]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I squatted in front of Wendell as i moved the scissors.&nbsp;At the same time I kept my gaze on that thing between his legs.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Nooooooooo]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendel, hiding his open crotch with both hands, continued to recite as many magical attacks as he could.&nbsp;Oh jesus.&nbsp;I thought he understood that he could no longer use magic, but his brain seems to be deteriorating from fear.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[W-Why… ..?&nbsp;Why can’t I use magic!!!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While lamenting, he kept reciting spells.&nbsp;It is like a man repeating prayers in front of God knowing he is cornered and about to die.&nbsp;I felt that time was passing and I moved the scissors gently.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Snip&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell raised a wild cry and shook his body in great pain.&nbsp;Ah, it’s as expected.&nbsp;Being very rusty, it couldn’t cut very well.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahaha.&nbsp;As I thought, I couldn’t cut it at all.&nbsp;Looks like I’ll have to do it quickly.&nbsp;Well here we go again]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Higyaaaaaa!&nbsp;Ahhhhhhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah, I finally cut the skin.&nbsp;What if I put a little more effort into doing it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The screams echo even over the audience.&nbsp;The blood is scattering, but it still doesn’t seem to cut completely.&nbsp;After that, I repeated it a few dozen times, but everything failed.&nbsp;It’s more like I’m tearing it apart than cutting it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey hey I’m really getting tired of cutting that thing too much.]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I snapped my fingers, along with a sound, the scissors were replaced with new ones.&nbsp;It glowed silver.&nbsp;The brightness of the blade is reliable.&nbsp;This bad boy will definitely meet my expectations.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Wait.&nbsp;Stop, stop… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Here I go ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I smiled, I moved the big scissors with both hands.&nbsp;Immediately after that.&nbsp;SNIP.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA… .. !!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes!&nbsp;You did it, Raul !!&nbsp;You finally managed to win the battle against Wendell’s crotch!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Blood splatters from the cut part.&nbsp;It is like the statue of the little man who urinates.&nbsp;Although it is not water that is coming out, but blood.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahhhhhhhhhhh.&nbsp;The blood, the blood!&nbsp;I will die… .. it hurts… .. Stop it!</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ahahahahahahaha!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Yes!!&nbsp;More!!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">My laughter, the excitement of the audience, was swept away by Wendell’s screams.&nbsp;Being fussed over, Wendell seems to have lost his ability to move his fingers.&nbsp;Unable to do anything about the intense pain, he just lay down.&nbsp;And died.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">No, it is still too early to die.&nbsp;I poured water on him, and woke Wendell up.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hii?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Shortly after waking up, Wendell grabbed his crotch.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It doesn’t hurt… .. Ah !?&nbsp;M-my… .. how… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After muttering, he looked at me scared.&nbsp;A color of confusion arose in his eyes, but then they were filled with dark despair.&nbsp;Apparently, it seems that he finally understands what is happening.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[NNNN-Don’t tell me that… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right.&nbsp;The pain, suffering and death that you have experienced were illusions that I showed you with my illusory magic]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Are you surprised?&nbsp;Welcome to hell where you cannot die!&nbsp;Let’s have fun with some!&nbsp;Ahahahahahahahaha!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa !!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Tears begin to overflow from Wendell’s eyes who was screaming.&nbsp;I really wanted to play this way with you.&nbsp;Glad to hear that you are as excited as I am.&nbsp;Well, we have to experience death together until we get bored.</p>

<p><strong>Part 15 &#8211; Always Together in an Illusion</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">By killing him over and over and over and then reviving him, I continued to give Wendell endless suffering for hours.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Please… ..guh… ..aguhhh… ..forgive me… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well ~, even if you apologize ~.&nbsp;Why should i ~?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I-I’m begging you!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As I made fun of him, the spectators in the audience seats raised their fists and started making noise.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Let us join the fun!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, were ready to give you a hand!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The excited demons rose from the spectator seats and stormed into the amphitheater.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kill!!&nbsp;Kill!!&nbsp;Lets kill him!!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uwaaaaa!&nbsp;Raul!&nbsp;Rauuul!&nbsp;Please help meeeee… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oh my~.&nbsp;This turned into quite a riot.&nbsp;I don’t think I can stop them]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I decided to levitate myself then dropped Wendell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Uwaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&nbsp;Stop Help me!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons were attacking Wendell like hungry beasts.&nbsp;Being surrounded by hundreds of demons, Wendell raised his hand to the sky desperately seeking help.&nbsp;There is no way that i will help you though.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kill!&nbsp;Kill!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, let me do it too!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t monopolize him!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When the demons grabbed Wendell’s limbs, they began a frantic fight.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[S-Stop… ..Agahh… .. Waaaaa… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It’s boring not being part of the action.&nbsp;I pulled out a baton with magic, and I guided this whole crowd.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, for those who want to be part of the fun, you all you have to do is just have to team up together.&nbsp;Now then One, Two, Three]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kill him!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Kill him!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Gihi, hiii!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">From Wendell there was a strange sound being made comming from his arms, legs, head, ears, fingers and hair with tremendous force.&nbsp;Yep, this is the sound of flash tearing.&nbsp;This time the demons competed with each other to obtain his arms and legs for them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Ughh… ..』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada leaked a little moan into my head, probably due to this nasty scene.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Wendell, having his limbs ripped off, convulsed and then his eyes turned white.&nbsp;Immediately afterwards, his head made strange sounds, and it was ripped off.&nbsp;Yep, he’s dead ~.&nbsp;When I took a look briefly, the number of deaths displayed on the bulletin board was 【66】.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Well, Wendell was on his knees drooling with a pale face.&nbsp;His vacant eyes weren’t moving at all.&nbsp;From his dry lips, he muttering something.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm ~?&nbsp;What did you say?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I squatted next to him and placed a hand on my ear to hear better.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t kill me… ..please… .. don’t kill me anymore… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I began laughing hard, a confused voice echoed in my head.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『This guy suddenly became strange.&nbsp;W-What happened?&nbsp;You did something right? 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Yes, that is correct.&nbsp;After laughing a bit, I explained what was going on in Wendell’s brain.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[He has been killed several times within the illusion that I applied to him.&nbsp;You saw that I didn’t put a finger on him, right?&nbsp;This guy is in an illusion of “The hero Raul deceived him and is receiving his cruel revenge” and also, I gave him the illusion of “Experiencing countless ways of being killed”]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『”What….!?&nbsp;Are you making him see an illusion within another illusion….?&nbsp;That’s possible?”』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I shrugged instead of answering.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If you make an illusion appear multiple times in the real world, The time will pass.&nbsp;That is why I decided to repeat the illusion and perform my actions in the illusion]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Even if it’s only been a few seconds in the real world, is this guy still being killed over and over again in an illusion?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Right ~.&nbsp;He may have died more than a million times.&nbsp;Although within those illusion, of course]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I smiled and pushed Wendell’s stunned forehead with the tip of my finger.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[If I follow the rule of giving back everything they did, the only thing I can do is “cheat” him.&nbsp;I tricked him into getting caught in a death loop.&nbsp;Hahahaha]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Seriously… ..you’re very crazy ……』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After stretching, I looked around.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, this revenge has been fulfilled.&nbsp;I’ll get out of here with Wendell.&nbsp;I have to think about how to decorate him.&nbsp;I have to take into account many things  ~]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, what’s going on?&nbsp;Won’t you let us kill that wizard… ..?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s a good chance to show him hell… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons who don’t know what is happening in the illusion are making a fuss over Wendell.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, hey.&nbsp;Your targets for revenge were Allingham and his guards, wasn’t it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Unfortunately, Wendell was only acting as protector for the evil Allingham.&nbsp;So there is no reason to hand it over to the demons.&nbsp;He’s a major prize for me, but it seems like it wasn’t for demons.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Stop imitating bloodthirsty beasts.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ll take Wendell, you understand?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What are you saying!?&nbsp;We can give him much more suffering than you do you know?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ha ha.&nbsp;How funny.&nbsp;You guys say that when you couldn’t even get revenge on Allingham unless everything was arranged.&nbsp;And you say you lots can do much better than me?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I asked them with a smile, the demons fell silent.&nbsp;Not that I want to scare them, but somehow they all shook.&nbsp;Anyway, I’m glad they understood my feelings.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm.&nbsp;As long as you all get it, it’s alright]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Even though I forgive them, the demons were still shy.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Sorry, we got carried away… ..but, you’re right… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Certainly our enemies died… ..it’s true… ..we were freed… ..we should be happy about that… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The demons began to slap each other’s shoulders as if to comfort themselves.&nbsp;The strange excitement and enthusiasm from so far fades.&nbsp;Ada, who was looking at that sight through my eyes, her emotions somehow jolted.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『All of them really are now free… ..』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It was a really honest voice.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Are you more relieved now that you managed to get revenge on Allingham and that the demon slaves were freed?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada hastily denied it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Y-You’re wrong… ..!&nbsp;Of course, I am satisfied that I have taken revenge on Allingham 』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hmm]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But, she does not deny it completely.&nbsp;The feeling of joy that the slaves are safe.&nbsp;Well, it doesn’t matter.&nbsp;When I snapped my fingers and undid the magic space, the demons were returned to the previous camp.&nbsp;The demons are still excited, screaming and hugging with joy.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Very good, Ada.&nbsp;We are going this way]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">After calling Ada herself, we returned to the other camp carrying Wendell.&nbsp;Then, I magically summoned Ada’s body who was still lying in the bathroom.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[With this, our alliance has ended]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">『Kyaaa?』</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada’s scream disappears along with a strong impact like repelling something.&nbsp;When I waited a few seconds, Ada’s body in front of me, began to move her eyelids.&nbsp;When she got up slowly, she looked at me with a complicated face.&nbsp;Well, it seems that she has returned without any problem.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I’m hungry, so I think I’ll go get something to eat.&nbsp;Ah, but it would be a problem to carry Wendell like this]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">While I was talking to myself, and when I turned my back on Ada to leave&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I felt a chill on my neck.&nbsp;When I looked down, a sharp point pierced the skin of my neck.&nbsp;A weak body temperature is transmitted from my back.&nbsp;Hmm, the position is bad and it doesn’t look good, but it seems like Ada is pointing a dagger at me.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Whats wrong?&nbsp;Are we going to be enemies again?&nbsp;Than cruel.&nbsp;Just when we were partners quite a while ago]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..Don’t screw me.&nbsp;I never thought of you as a partner!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada screamed holding the knife from behind.&nbsp;Hearing that, I sighed a little.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see you still have great hatred.&nbsp;I’m surprised you kept those feelings when we had a truce]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right.&nbsp;For me it was nothing more than humiliation.&nbsp;But now that I have achieved my goal of freeing the demons, there is no one standing in my way!&nbsp;Hero Raul, get ready… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">You are my true enemy &mdash;&mdash; with those words, Ada stabbed the dagger into my&nbsp;neck.</p>

<p><strong>End of Chapter 1 &#8211; That Person’s Younger Sister</strong></p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, hey, how sudden.&nbsp;Wouldn’t you like to try something else after a while?&nbsp;We work together to achieve a common goal.&nbsp;We should first celebrate it with a feast&mdash;&ndash;]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Shut.&nbsp;I’m not going to continue with your silly jokes]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada who blatantly directed her hostility at me, While i only regret exaggeratedly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s so cruel.&nbsp;After you’ve used my body the way you wanted, do you just throw me away when you’re done?&nbsp;You are all the same]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I said shut up!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Since when did you get so wild?&nbsp;In the past you used to be such a pure and innocent devil]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……….!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I felt a sign that she was surprised.&nbsp;Taking advantage of that, I slipped away from Ada.&nbsp;Looking back, my eyes met Ada who was with a frustrated face.&nbsp;Well, I expected it, but it seems that she really believed that I did not know her “true identity”.&nbsp;Oh the irony.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Are you underestimating me or are you too shallow?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[… ..S-Shut up… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[What appeared after revealing the identity of the false hero, was a villager.&nbsp;What will appear after revealing the identity of the villager &mdash;&ndash; well, it was very interesting that you put double replication magic on yourself.&nbsp;But after all, your magic only changes the appearance.&nbsp;To your bad luck, if you become a magician of my caliber, you can see that kind of thing from the aura]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Ada, who was still silent, clenched her teeth tightly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, this question is also the second time.&nbsp;Should I forcibly undo your magic or do you prefer to reveal yourself?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[…..Fine.&nbsp;From the moment you appeared in front of me, I have always wanted to express my hatred to you with my true form]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Immediately after saying those words with an aggressive tone, Ada’s appearance began to distort.&nbsp;Her poor brown hair was turning silver and her villager appearance changed to that of a beautiful girl.&nbsp;And the most important difference&mdash;&ndash;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Black wings spread from her back.&nbsp;The girl who was Ada stared at me with her large demonic wings.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Because the magical aura she emitted was the same as “that person”, I imagined that she would be a close relative.&nbsp;But, to think that those overlapping characteristics were so similar &mdash;&ndash; I respectfully bowed to the girl in front of me to pay respect to “that person”.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You look exactly like her.&nbsp;You are her younger sister right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That’s right.&nbsp;I am Theodor, the younger sister of the demon lord  killed… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor screamed with an aura of anger, and her long silver hair fluttered.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hero Raul, the enemy of my older sister, the demon !&nbsp;Get ready!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When she pulled a dagger from her thigh, she approached me without hesitation.&nbsp;Theodor, I understand your anger.&nbsp;But, I still can’t die.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If i used magic, I could easily stop her movements in an instant.&nbsp;However, I didn’t feel like doing it that way.&nbsp;I waited a bit before she could cut my throat, and grabbed her arm on the spot.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ah… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">CLANG &mdash;&ndash; making a murky noise, the dagger fell to the ground.&nbsp;I held her hands together and turned her onto her back.&nbsp;I must teach this silly little girl the difference in power.&nbsp;I don’t care if she wants revenge, but there is no point in just getting upset.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[L-Let go of me!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Holding her hands above her head, and being between me and the wall, Theodor struggled frustratedly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[You’ll only suffer if you keep struggling]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">As i applied pressure from behind, a pained gasping voice leaked from Theodor’s lips.&nbsp;I put my lips close to her ear and whispered softly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Do you now understand?&nbsp;I could kill you so easily]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Fuck you… . someone like you… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">It feels like I’m looking at myself in the past.&nbsp;I looked at Theodor with a coldly and then turned her body over.&nbsp;The line of sight is close enough to see each other.&nbsp;When I reached out and put my right hand on her slim white neck, Theodor let out a shaky  voice.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Huh… ..uhh]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I lifted Theodor’s body against the wall with one hand.&nbsp;Both of her feet kicked painfully in the air.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Don’t think about getting revenge by letting yourself be carried away by your emotions.&nbsp;You should know that you have no chance of winning]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[U-Uguh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There is no way you can kill me by attacking me from behind.&nbsp;Your bloodlust is very obvious, you cannot use magic, you have no strength.&nbsp;Everything is half-baked.&nbsp;That’s why you can’t get your revenge, you’d just die like a dog]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Agahhh… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Oh well.&nbsp;I am very kind to those who seek revenge.&nbsp;So I’ll let you choose]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I released her neck, Theodor’s body fell to the ground.&nbsp;As I looked at her lying down and her breathing desperately, I snapped my fingers.&nbsp;Theodor, who was shedding tears, looked at a mountain of gold and silver treasures that suddenly appeared.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Here’s the treasure Allingham had amassed.&nbsp;This should be enough for the enslaved demons to rebuild their lives]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Will you take this and go with the enslaved demons?&nbsp;Or do you want to face me again and die for nothing?&nbsp;What do you choose?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">The hatred in Theodor’s eyes didn’t disappeared, even after she was about to be killed.&nbsp;I think this girl is dumb, but I don’t dislike that.&nbsp;She is shallow enough to get angry, a weak avenger.&nbsp;I don’t hate you, Theodor.&nbsp;Although I regret your simplicity, lack of thought and weakness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[…..Damnit]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hahahaha.&nbsp;Come on, don’t say that.&nbsp;I really understand your feelings.&nbsp;Because in front of you is the person you want to take revenge on.&nbsp;It’s humiliating and painful to turn your back on him, am i right?&nbsp;But, without this money, it doesn’t matter if the slaves are free, they won’t have a life]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Even if your country was destroyed, you wanted to protect your people because you are part of the royal family.&nbsp;That’s why you called me, to help you free the demons, isn’t it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I said that, Theodor looked down.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hey, there’s something I’d like to ask you.&nbsp;Can you do it?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor was just silent, so I accepted it as yes, and continued as usual.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[It’s about the girl you were dressing up as, Ada.&nbsp;When I asked the neighbors, they said that the whole family suddenly disappeared.&nbsp;By using the magic of darkness to look at the recorded residual thoughts of the place, I couldn’t understand anything other than what happened to Charles.&nbsp;The whereabouts of Ada, her mother and her younger sister is unknown.&nbsp;All I found out was that the mother and sisters left the house separately.&nbsp;What happened to those three?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Did you kill them?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[….. You’re wrong!&nbsp;When I found them, they were already… ..!]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">At that moment, her words stopped on the spot.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[When I recovered and was able to move, I desperately searched for Charles’s missing family.&nbsp;I found their bodies in a forest cabin on the outskirts of town, when they were already in a state of decomposition.&nbsp;But, I was able to get an idea of what happened to them.&nbsp;There were signs of restrains in the limbs and all three were naked.&nbsp;And from what I could see on their bodies… ..there were terrible wounds that implied that they were raped.&nbsp;After that, when I approached Allingham as the fake hero and stole his diary, I saw that what happened at that time was described in detail]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I see]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I could only say that.&nbsp;My current self does not have the heart to feel sorry for the misfortunes of others that have nothing to do with my revenge.&nbsp;First of all, if I said words of sympathy, Theodor would attack me even if she can’t win.&nbsp;Let’s change the subject a bit.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[There is another thing that makes me curious.&nbsp;What is the connection between you and Ada?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[That is something you surely already know]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Ha ha.&nbsp;Is it a little obvious?&nbsp;One of the demon girls Charles saved and it was unknown if she would survive, it was you, right?]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[……… ..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I have no evidence.&nbsp;It’s just a guess]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">But even though Theodor pretended to be Ada, there is no other reason for Charles’ revenge.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[But even if my guess is correct, it is a mystery that you, the demon lord’s younger sister, was being treated like the other demon slaves.&nbsp;I don’t think Allingham knew of you.&nbsp;If he had known that you were the demon ‘s younger sister, he would have given you preferential treatment.&nbsp;Ah, in the bad way, of course]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Theodor made a disgusted face again.&nbsp;It’s like I don’t want to talk about this anymore.&nbsp;I just asked out of curiosity, I didn’t mean to dig deeper.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[I understand.&nbsp;Let’s get back to the topic.&nbsp;If you refuse, I will keep this money.&nbsp;They don’t matter enough to me to change and care for their lives.&nbsp;To them I am just the hated enemy who defeated the demon ]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">If I had to take care of them, I would just throw them around.&nbsp;Having said that, Theodor clenched her fists and stared at me.&nbsp;Will that be your last childish resistance?</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Well, what will you do?&nbsp;My next target is waiting, so I’m very busy.&nbsp;Decide in the next three seconds]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Shit…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Three two…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Tears of frustration trickle from Theodor’s eyes.&nbsp;She’s very serious.&nbsp;You don’t need to think about it so much.&nbsp;If it is knowing that it is for the sake of demons, she would retire here.&nbsp;That alone is enough.&nbsp;It is unusual to see someone who is so bad at balancing their emotions.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[One…..]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">When I counted at this point, Theodor dropped her shoulders.&nbsp;Her eyes were no longer looking at me.&nbsp;That should be your answer.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Hm.&nbsp;I think it was the right choice.&nbsp;For you, of course]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I put my hand on Theodor’s shoulder.&nbsp;She didn’t try to push me away or anything like that.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">[Goodbye, partner.&nbsp;Thank you for being part of my revenge]</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">I waved my hand and left.&nbsp;To go to the next stage.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">Unlike you, there is no other way for me than revenge.</p>
