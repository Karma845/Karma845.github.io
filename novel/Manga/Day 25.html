<h2>Confinement - Day 25</h2>

<p>25th day of imprisonment. My original draft is not finish yet.</p>

<p>No matter how many times I think about it, you can't think any logic for this smelly, weird porno to make him in-heat. (TL: Heat means horny.)</p>

<p>Should I set the main character as having with special fetish that likes ugly and smelly woman?</p>

<p>No! the reader will not accept that logic. Even if the mc got horny, the reader will not accept that he has fetish that is not specified in the past chapters.</p>

<p>"Is the food okay? Does it taste bad?" The girl worriedly asked.</p>

<p>Today's lunch was a ginger roast pork set meal with cabbage as substitute for rice. I can't say it's my favorite, but it's one of the most delicious dishes.</p>

<p>"Problem with the manga?" she asked.</p>

<p>While I rolled the cabbage having shredded pork inside of it.</p>

<p>"I guess, you can tell..."</p>

<p>"Its because, I haven't paint any of your chapter lately." The girl said dejectedly.</p>

<p>"I think it's true. I wanted to finish it in one go, so I focused on the original draft. ...... In fact, the final unfolding of the story was a bit uneventful. I really have a little more to finish, but the main character can't think of a way to defeat the final boss."</p>

<p>As I said this, I took a sip of the Chinese style soup with radish to wash away the grease in my mouth.</p>

<p>"That original...... Can you let me see it?" The girl put her chopsticks down and asked me nervously.</p>

<p>"Oh, I guess it's fine, if you think any problem in the story, I'd be happy to hear your opinion."</p>

<p>I said lightly as I point my chopsticks to the tablet.</p>

<p>When the girl approach the tablet, I feel more trust in her more than expecting advice from her. In reality comparison, I'm like a main character in a T.V. drama series that is already in the climax of the series.</p>

<p>"Got it." The girl nodded and stopped eating. and moved to the tablet.</p>

<p>Although it is still only the original draft stage, I always feel embarrassed to have my comics read at close range.</p>

<p>I hid such inner thoughts and continued to eat as if nothing is happening.</p>

<p>When you think about it, is it really okay to show JK a comic where the characters can get horny with something that is pornographic? It will not sexual harassment, right?</p>

<p>Well, since she said she was a fan of mine, it should be okay, right?</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>After about 10 minutes or so. While I was finishing my meal, this party also finished reading my original manuscript and put down the tablet. Then, return to me.</p>

<p>"Thanks for letting me read it." Lowering her head, as she said.</p>

<p>"So how is it?"</p>

<p>"Very interesting."</p>

<p>The girl smiled, closing its eyes, and nodded with satisfaction.</p>

<p>While I scratched my back of my head.</p>

<p>"You just only need to think about the ending."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"Speaking of which, why did that enemy pornographer come to Earth?"</p>

<p>"Eh?" I raised my head.</p>

<p>"If they're just going to blast the earth when the hero lost, that wouldn't be invasion right? And if they blast the earth down, they will not longer able to use it right? then why did they even go to distant planet just destroy other planet? That's my point." the girl asked seriously while resting her chin on her right hand.</p>

<p>I was very happy that she, who usually does not talk much, was so interested in my work.</p>

<p>"In my perspective, the invaders don't really want to fight the hero.... if they just want Earthlings a hard time and watch them suffer for fun, there should be plenty of other ways to do it."</p>

<p>The girl continue, "Then, why do they have to fight the hero?"</p>

<p>Tilting her head slightly.</p>

<p>"......I didn't think about that."</p>

<p>I put my head down and hugged my arms.</p>

<p>Why didn't I consider the setting of the boss?</p>

<p>Maybe I totally forgotten about it since I design it as gag-comedy manga. That is why I didn't care much about the integration of enemy actions and motives. And in the end there's no value consider in the story.</p>

<p>"...... Maybe the pornographer is feeling lonely. Most of the horny males of many planets did faced off against each other, but no one can look at a pornographer in an erotic way. But somewhere in her heart, the Pornographer must have longed to lose the duel herself. That's why she's been searching the entire universe and continues to compete with different horny males."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>The girl just nodded.</p>

<p>"I see... that's how it is! Pornographers want to be seen in a pornstar light. That's what pornography is! No matter how far from erotic it looks, the fact that a female wants to be looked at in an erotic way is erotic in itself!"</p>

<p>I patted my knees and lifted my head.</p>

<p>(I see! That's how it is!)</p>

<p>Pornstars are not imposing difficult questions on others. She's just looking for a being that will accept her as a female.</p>

<p>In other words, the boss weakness is the earthlings itself. Means the main character's breakthrough.</p>

<p>"Thank you! This recipe? Thanks to this, I can finish the original manuscript!"</p>

<p>I was so grateful that I couldn't help but to shake her hands.</p>

<p>"Eh, oh, it's not a big deal." The girl shrinks.</p>

<p>"Ah, that, I'm sorry, I'm getting excited about myself." I panicked and let go of her hand.</p>

<p>"No, no problem." The blushes and continue to eat again.</p>

<p>"I guess it's turn to return the favor." I spoke with determination.</p>

<p>"..?"</p>

<p>"I'm not sure if you have any problem.... you know like problem on school something like that."</p>

<p>If I were to bring this topic up, my chance would be only now.</p>

<p>"It was finally discovered."</p>

<p>The girl said with an expression that looked like she was about to cry, but also like she was embarrassed.</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, I didn't notice it much. Like why you're only wearing chool uniforms or why you're not studying while you're here, and I'm not really sure why you're here.... So in proposal, let me hear you're problems.</p>

<p>Although the manuscript is not yet finished, thanks to her advice, I can see the hope.</p>

<p>This is probably chance to get closer on her heart.</p>

<p>To manga artist, reading your own created manga in front of you is embarrassing as seeing you naked. Since I let her see it, I should have right to also enter her inner world....... Probably.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>The girl is not moving and still holding the bowl of rice.</p>

<p>"You don't have to force yourself if you don't like it." Waving my hand as I panicked.</p>

<p>"No, I'll say what I wanted to say." The girl put down the bowl of rice and drank fairly amount of tea to moisturize her throat.</p>

<p>"Okay." Straightening my back.</p>

<p>"The cause was just a cold."</p>

<p>"Cold?"</p>

<p>"I contacted the school and took one day or two as day off. Well, normally you can cure normal cold in just two or one day. On the third day, my cold was barely cured, but not still on condition to go school. However, when I was cleaning and throw down the trash, I missed to call the school in that morning and miss my attendance."</p>

<p>The girl words is like an endless river.</p>

<p>I guess she's just spouting random excuses she just made up in the past 25 days.</p>

<p>Normally, she just talk a little word as possible but right now, she said a lot of thing just to hide something.</p>

<p>"Well, there are situations like that." </p>

<p>People do mistake. Just like me.</p>

<p>"Yes. But even though I didn't contact them, They didn't check me from the school. So on the fourth day, the fever had gone down, but I was still a little tired, so I was debating whether to go to school or to take another day off just in case."</p>

<p>Then the girl paused for a moment, chewing on the cold ginger roast meat.</p>

<p>"It's amazing that you can hesitate. If it were me, I would have chosen to laze around without hesitation."</p>

<p>"To be honest, I also wanted to quit. But I accidentally decided that if the school called to make sure I was safe, I would go to school even if I was late. You see, it's like the feeling of an elementary school student praying that if I walk on the white line of the sidewalk, I'll get 100 points on the test. I feel a little childish."</p>

<p>(TL: In childhood days, normally you do things like walking through white lines in streets or parkour in the shadows right? Something like that.)</p>

<p>She bashfully lowering her eyes.</p>

<p>"I occasionally do things like, "If I can throw the paper towels in the trash, the work will be reprinted," or something like that."</p>

<p>Of course, the result of such a prayer has never been answered.</p>

<p>"It's not as if it's a cute divination. It was mean and cowardly of me to leave my decision to a third party. But that day, there was no contact from school either. So, after Saturday and Monday, I thought it was time to go to school, so I got my bag ready and walked all the way to school."</p>

<p>"That's great."</p>

<p>"It's not that great. Because at that moment, I didn't go to school for a few days, and no one was worried about me. Even if I didn't go to school, no one would care. No friends. So, why did I even go to school? I suddenly couldn't understand. Then, I became unmotivated to go to school." The girl murmured.</p>

<p>And the reason for not going to school is..... Right, Not a clue.</p>
