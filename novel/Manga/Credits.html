<p><strong>Words from Translator.</strong></p>

<p>Hello I'm actually the admin of the Anime Stuff website and also the translator of this series. Well, to tell you the truth, not all chapters in this series is not my own translation, so I would like to introduce them to you as credits for their hardwork. Firstly, I would like to give credit to <a href="https://travistranslations.com/">TravisTranslation.</a> They were actually the translator of the Day 1-6 Chapters of the series. Secondly, to <a href="https://akumareleases.com/">Akuma Releases.</a> They were actually the translator of the Day 10-20 Chapters of 
 the series. Thanks for all you hardwork. And the remaining chapters was translated by me. Since I have a lot time, I fairly have time to translate some books besides doing content on my website. While on my translation, I think I have confidence that it can be easily understood by readers. Well I actually planned on imitating the manga series, but unfortunately they were some scenes in novel that is not mention in manga. Anyway that's all, I hope you support my site and some other translator that is mentioned here. Bye-bye.</p>
