<h3>Confinement - Day 27</h3>

<p>The next day, I woke up after 10:00 am.</p>

<p>As expected, she is no longer here. </p>

<p>And the cardboard box simply says "Breakfast in the fridge."</p>

<p>I walk slowly to the kitchen and opened the refrigerator.</p>

<p>There is bento box with two rice balls and rolled fried eggs inside of it.</p>

<p>Then I pour a tea into a cup and place the food on the usual tray.</p>

<p>I finished my breakfast, washed my face, brushed my teeth, took a shower, fixed my grooming, and then there was nothing special to do.</p>

<p>(I guess, I'll write diary today, since I forgot to write yesterday.)</p>

<p>With that thought, I turn on my tablet. Inside the tablet, they were few folders that is connected to my manga, but I didn't open those folders instead, I open the folder name "Inspirational Diary."</p>

<p>.....Day 26th of imprisonment.... etc....</p>

<p>Then I notice that, it's kinda inappropriate to write 26th Day of imprisonment, even I'm not in imprisonment anymore.</p>

<p>I am clearly not in prisoner anymore.</p>

<p>(Well, whatever. The sense of unity is important.)</p>

<p>And I just pick that name randomly.</p>

<p>This diary was created so that my feelings about time to time would not become strange in my life of imprisonment.... But.</p>

<p>Since I was not imprisoned anymore, there's no need to write right?</p>

<p>Well, I guess, writing diary is not bad habit, so I'll write until I got bored out of it.</p>

<p>I was thinking leisurely and writing down notes carefully.</p>

<p>Even so, I finished writing in an hour and became bored again.</p>

<p>(.......Sleep again.)</p>

<p>I guess it is better to become lazy than doing bad habits.</p>

<p>Crawling up to my bed.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

</p>

<p>I woke up and looked at my phone.</p>

<p>(What?! 7:00 in the evening already?)</p>

<p>I feel dizziness because of too much sleep, so I shook my head, left and right.</p>

<p>And the room still empty. Not a single presence.</p>

<p>(Isn't the girl too late? Well, If she has club activities, I guess it's not normal to get late this hours─)</p>

<p>Wait, Is she using her phone. Then I suddenly stopped flickering the phone...
I realized that I don't know her address, phone number, email address nor SNS account name.</p>

<p>In short, I have no contact information of her at all.</p>

<p>I know her name of school, it's a all girl's academy. And if I just go there and finds her address..... but I'm a male non-relatives of that girl, I doubt the guards will let me in.</p>

<p>....It's more likely on jail. And even will trouble the girl instead.</p>

<p>Since the girl also gone back to her real home, she will likely be safe out there, and if ever there's problem, she will likely contact me in my SNS account online. I'm a mangaka after all.</p>

<p>(Jeez. I'm worrying too much. She will likely visit me here tomorrow.)</p>

<p>I optimistically thought.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊
</p>

<p>(It's been a long time since I did my own housework.)</p>

<p>It's because the girl always spoiling me.</p>

<p>I thought so, while putting the washed rice in the rice cooker.</p>

<p>(More or less, I need restore myself.)</p>

<p>I open the fridge and cook something with leftovers left by the girl.</p>

<p>However, it is not very tasty.</p>

<p>It seems the girl surpassed my cooking skills.</p>

<p>From time to time, I scroll through SNS, waiting for her to contact me, but still nothing.</p>

<p>Another hour finished, but the girl still didn't come here.</p>

<p>(She's fine.)</p>

<p>Removing the hint of uneasiness, I turned myself into the blanket.</p>

<p>In the end, I couldn't get sleep, so I drank some milk, do some exercises to tire myself and do some sort of things just to sleep. By the time consciousness finally relaxed, it was already past 3:00 in the morning.</p>
