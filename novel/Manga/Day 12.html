<h3>Confinement - Day 12</h3>

<p>My life in confinement continues, my living space is still this small room, it’s a landscape that doesn’t change much.</p>

<p>Although there have been some notable positive changes, Like, I can now get a more pleasant sleep.</p>

<p>For until now, the only thing that had awakened me from my lethargy were the sounds of trucks passing by on the street, or the explosive sounds of the exhaust systems on motorcycles.</p>

<p>All this has become somewhat comforting, ever since I became a mangaka I had been living alone, but having company now changes everything.</p>

<p>When I looked through the door, I saw what appeared to be a recipe book lying next to her. I could sense her seriousness in this matter by daring to choose a physical book instead of opting for a myriad of recipes that are available with ease of access from your hand just by using your smartphone.
</p>

<p>At the same time, it makes me feel sorry that she’s always going out of her way for me. However, there’s not much I can do, since I’m being shackled.</p>

<p>After some thought, I started doing light exercise and strength training. I need to keep my body from getting weak from living cooped up, and I find that moderate exercise keeps my mind sharp and being more creative. </p>

<p>After about two sets of push-ups, sit-ups, leg raises and all the calisthenics I could remember, breakfast was brought to me.</p>

<p>When I finished eating, the girl brought me a bowl full of water and a cup, along with everything I needed to wash my face and clean my teeth. I proceeded to clean myself up. </p>

<p>Once I was done with my personal grooming, I proceeded to focus my attention on drawing the girl, and also on the manga I have to make.</p>

<p>Time passed, and night had taken over the sky. I still continued to concentrate on the drawings, and didn’t notice the time.</p>

<p>"The bath is ready."</p>

<p>A female voice was heard in the background, the girl had entered the room, and it seems that she had already prepared the bathtub for me. 
</p>

<p>"I can take a bath now?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She proceeded to remove my chain, and escorted me to the site.</p>

<p>"Today I put the bath salts you asked for."</p>

<p>"Oh, the bath salts, I forgot them, thank you."</p>

<p>"…"</p>

<p>The girl nodded silently, then left me alone. It seems that she will prepare dinner while I take a bath. </p>

<p>I proceeded to take off my clothes, and showered first to wash my body very well before entering the bathtub. </p>

<p>Once my body was clean, I excitedly pushed aside the curtain. But what I witnessed stunned me. I could not believe my eyes. The color of the water was pitch black, as if it had been sprayed with ink.
</p>

<p>The bubbles generated by the heat gave off a very intense aroma. The smells I could make out had a strange combination of citrus and forest fragrances. I began to wonder what kind of bath salts these truly were…</p>

<p>I couldn’t be grudge her for anything though, after all, she did go to the trouble of putting them in for me. So, I proceeded to duck my head and stick my feet in the tub. </p>

<p>At first it felt slippery and uncomfortable, but after a while immersing my whole body in the tub, the bad feeling gradually faded away. It felt similar to that of mud baths in hot springs, and in turn, my mind was carried away by this mini paradise I was beginning to experience.</p>

<p>"How are you doing?"</p>

<p>But the nirvana I had come to achieve was shattered in an instant when I heard the voice of a female. I opened my eyes and saw my captor standing in front of me, wearing only a towel. </p>

<p>"Pffft, h—hey, what are you doing here?" I answered nervously, spitting out the hot water that had entered my mouth.</p>

<p>The girl’s most important areas were hidden, but the top of her cleavage was somewhat exposed, and the part of her butt could be completely visible if the towel was raised a few more inches.</p>

<p>Although I tried my best to look away, it was impossible to ignore her.</p>

<p>"I’m coming in."</p>

<p>"B—But you weren’t cooking? You didn’t leave the fire on or anything, right?"</p>

<p>I tried to divert the lustful situation to the food in an attempt to find a way out.</p>

<p>"Everything is off."</p>

<p>"Well, okay, that’s fine, but I have a question, what kind of bath salts were these?"</p>

<p>"I mixed up all the ones that seemed to have good reviews on the internet. I didn’t know which ones would work."</p>

<p>"Well if that’s the case, I’d have to move to the side , so you would have some space…"</p>

<p>"Okay." She said as she held my hand as soon as I tried to move over in the tub.</p>

<p>"It’s a very cramped place you know."</p>

<p>"It doesn’t matter. This way we’ll save water." She said as she put one foot in the hot water. 
</p>

<p>I can understand that saving on the utility bill is a big deal, but us being in the same tub together is something only lovers would do…
</p>

<p>"Hey, um… Could you at least wear the school bathing suit you used the other day?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Persuasion didn’t work, and then she proceeded to sit on the edge of the tub, I shrugged my shoulders as much as I could, and scooted over to the edge.
</p>

<p>"Hey, you could at least keep your bath towel on."</p>

<p>"It’s rude to soak towels in hot water."</p>

<p>That said, the girl removed her bath towel, folded it and proceeded to submerge her body in the bathtub. She performed all this while skillfully concealing her private areas of her body.</p>

<p>Is it possible that all girls have acquired skills of changing without exposing their private parts since elementary school when they start their swimming lessons?</p>

<p>"I’ll stretch my legs."</p>

<p>"That’s okay."</p>

<p>"….Okay."</p>

<p>From a rather constrained position, I slowly stretched out my legs, making hers alternate along with mine. Occasionally her toes would brush against my thighs, and to be honest, I didn’t flinch at all.</p>

<p>Despite my serious expression on my face. It was a very happy and exciting day for me. It seems that my life in this confinement is getting more and more interesting.</p>
