<h3>Confinement - Day 15</h3>

<p>Today has been exclusively dedicated to reading. I had focused on reading the various books that arrived by delivery this morning.</p>

<p>But despite all that time and effort, I still hadn’t come up with any interesting ideas for a plot. Although I can’t deny that many ideas are lurking in my head about a potential story to tell through a manga.</p>

<p>"Time to eat." Says the girl, who was standing in front of the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it time already? Today’s food looks just as good."</p>

<p>I grabbed the bookmark and placed it inside the book so I know where I’ve left off. Then I grabbed the tablet and put it on the floor, so the cardboard I’m working on becomes a makeshift table.</p>

<p>Today’s menu was marinara pasta with seafood, clams, and salad. The nautical smell of the seafood tickled my nose.</p>

<p>The girl placed the tray on the cardboard and returned to the kitchen. But again, she returned to the room, and with another tray containing the same menu.</p>

<p>"Will you eat here too?"</p>

<p>"Of course, tasting a meal like this would only be a waste."</p>

<p>After those words, she took my tray and rotated it to make room for hers.</p>

<p>I wonder what kind of situation generated all this change in wanting to eat together. I could guess that since she started cooking for me, she’s always been eating alone in the kitchen, so this is quite strange at this point… Could it be that she is thinking about wanting to set me free?</p>

<p>"Bon appetit."</p>

<p>"Bon appetit."</p>

<p>We muttered the same words almost simultaneously. Suddenly, the girl pulled down the mask that until now had been hiding half of her face. It was a trivial gesture, but I couldn’t help but get excited.</p>

<p>It was the first time I had seen her real face, and seeing the beautiful girl hiding behind that mask was something a little pleasurable for me.</p>

<p>"Delicious. Fish broth and seafood are nice."</p>

<p>To disguise the excitement in my heart, I concentrated on the food.</p>

<p>"What a relief." The girl expressed, and then put the pasta in her mouth with a very elegant use of the fork."</p>

<p>That simple hand gesture hinted at the kind of education and upbringing she had.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>Silence took over the room, every now and then there were light sounds of the plate colliding with the cutlery. It was quite uncomfortable, so I thought of creating a conversation to give dynamics to this intimate moment.</p>

<p>"I need to ask you something."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"We’ve met before, haven’t we? Well, before I passed out in front of my door."</p>

<p>"Umm..." she said as she nodded silently.</p>

<p>"I knew it. Thank you, I knew I had seen you before."</p>

<p>I was right after all. </p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>The silence came again after that answer. At this point I don’t know what to do, and I can’t ask her directly the reason why she locked me in.</p>

<p>Unlike the first time we had contact, now it does feel like she is much more open, but you never know when she might have a rare change in her thinking.</p>

<p>Not to mention that she still has a knife in her hand.</p>

<p>"I notice you’re wearing a uniform, are you going to high school?"</p>

<p>After some hesitation, I finally deigned to ask her a question that wouldn’t pose a problem. However, since she herself appears before me dressed like that, it shouldn’t be a question she refuses to answer.</p>

<p>"For the time being." She replied in a reserved tone.</p>

<p>"Do you feel uncomfortable going to school? You know, since you’ve must’ve missed so many classes."</p>

<p>"I don’t know." She said as she looked away.</p>

<p>"I see… And do you like math? I could tell you were studying the other day when I went to the bathroom."</p>

<p>"Not really… In fact, it’s the worst subject I’m good at."</p>

<p>Now I see, that’s why she was so focused on studying. She was trying to get over work that was giving her trouble. That attitude seems to be very typical of her</p>

<p>"Wow, what a strange coincidence. When I was in school I wasn’t good at math either. Rather, the only subject I was good at was art, haha."</p>

<p>At the end of my words, I let out a dry, unnatural laugh. I can’t help but get angry at myself because of my lack of ability related to personal communication. I wish I hide myself inside a hole.</p>

<p>"I envy your drawing skills. You’re amazing."</p>

<p>"Oh, really? Thanks. We all have something we’re good at. Do you have any subjects you’re good at?"</p>

<p>"So, languages, huh. I wasn’t good at that subject, but I did like to read smart, although I wasn’t very fast either."</p>

<p>"I’m not good at it, I’m just good at it sometimes."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I can do well on written exams. But sometimes there are group discussions in Japanese class… And I don’t have any friends…"</p>

<p>The girl looked down and spoke hesitantly.</p>

<p>Not knowing what to answer, I kept my mouth shut. I don’t know if it’s a good idea to delve into this. Anyway, it’s pretty obvious what the problems she’s having at school are. Still, I was happy for her making me food, and also for the fact that she cooked pasta for me.</p>

<p>Because by the time the conversation stalled, we had already finished eating.</p>

<p>"Still, thanks for the food. I’m sure this turned out to be a bit laborious for you, since you had to get the sand out of the clams and all."</p>

<p>"I enjoy watching the clams spit sand."</p>

<p>"I see. In that case, I can’t wait to see what tomorrow’s meal will be."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Today was a little awkward… I must make an effort to find some decent conversation topics for tomorrow.</p>

<p>I laid down on the floor and sighed. Now I have more tasks to take care of. And more importantly, why did I feel nervous when she took off her mask?</p>

<p>I admit she’s beautiful. But as beautiful as she is, it’s crazy to get turned on just by looking at her face.</p>

<p>No… I don’t think it’s just her face. I felt that way just by the mere fact that she took off her mask.</p>

<p>Fetishism is born clandestinely. Underwear would not be possible without a skirt, and socks would not be possible without shoes.</p>

<p>Probably until not so long ago, a possible large group of people have found eroticism with face masks, and this is because we have recently become accustomed to the fact of using it. Making it so that there is a shortage of faces that are uncovered</p>

<p>I don’t consider myself a kinky guy or fond of any specific kind of fetishism. But perhaps, this feeling is due to my desire to have wanted to see her without that mask all this time. </p>

<p>I think I could use this. And for a strange reason, my artistic stimuli are reacting again.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I already had a fantastic idea for a manga. How about a comedy story where the protagonist sees everything as erotic? Even with things that aren’t.</p>

<p>Highlighting and distorting the faint anomalies that people experience in their daily lives could work. And more so if I use the same storytelling technique as one of the books I read.</p>

<p>Gag Manga Biyori is a manga series with a rather atypical artistic and humorous style, which could qualify as its own genre. But just because I haven’t tried it before doesn’t mean it could fail miserably. </p>

<p>My editor asked me to think of a romantic comedy, but if I also add some more comedy, even a gag, it would be a unique opportunity.</p>

<p>More importantly, today I got to talk to that girl more than usual. Today was a very productive day. I’m going to have to write this down before I forget.</p>

<p>I opened the notes app on the tablet and jotted this all down before it slipped my mind.</p>
