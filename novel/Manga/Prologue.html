<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I awoke, there was an unfamiliar ceiling above me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Where am I? My head hurts so bad. My throat is throbbing. I&#8217;m feeling exhausted.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s dark.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even a faint flicker of light from an electrical appliance, much like the moonlight flowing through the curtains, is out of my sight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(What time is it? That&#8217;s right. Phone, where&#8217;s my phone?)</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reach out while laying on my back, looking for a light source and information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it just grasped at the air with no response at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no choice but to raise my heavy body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ugh, ack!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took me by surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was suffocating, as if I had been stabbed in my throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, my tonsils look swollen, but this is a different kind of discomfort.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a chilly metallic roughness on my neck when I ran my hands down it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Is this a collar andーーchain?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A donut-shaped choker around my neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chain was connected to the back of the choker&#8217;s neck and stretched further out to somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I&#8217;m chained up. So that meansーーI&#8217;m being held captive?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got goosebumps the moment I realised this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this chill is most likely not caused by my health condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Stay calm. Stay calm.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Take a deep breath, and wait for your eyes to adjust to the darkness.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A rectangular silhouette vaguely emerges in the bleak room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(A Box?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I crawled closer to the box, taking care of the length of the chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, it appeared to be in the other direction of the chain&#8217;s end, and I was able to reach it without any difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Paper with a texture that is somewhere between smooth and gritty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The box looks like cardboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s something on top of the cardboard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A thin, flat board with a smooth texture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right next to it was a shorter stick that fit three fingers in comfortably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an object that, no matter how dimly I saw it, I couldn&#8217;t have mistaken it for anything else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(LCD tablet! Now I can call for help!)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The LCD tablet, or liquid tab, is a familiar tool.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t need to look to locate the power supply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The startup sound was awfully loud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The screen lights up.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not connected to the Internet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was now 23:17, according to the time displayed on the screen&#8217;s edge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only application that was installed was illustration software.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(This is, indeed, my tablet. But how did it get hereーー?）</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Rustle, Rustle.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to recall something when I heard a noise from outside the room.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Creakeee.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opens as soon as I turn around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The lights in the room are turned on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed my eyes reflexively to shield my eyes from the blinding light.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened my eyes again, there was a high school girl standing in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I identified her as a high school student because she was dressed in a school uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was just the uniform, she could be a junior high school girl, but there is no such line in terms of physical development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She glances up at me as I watch her from below.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Barefoot.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bottoms are short skirts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for top it&#8217;s a blazer and a shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her shirt was unbuttoned up to the second button, exposing her collarbone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black mask for the mouth, and fingernails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a small face, and her eyes full of life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hair was black and long enough to reach her waist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the mask, it&#8217;s difficult to say for sure, yet she&#8217;s so attractive that the atmosphere tells you she&#8217;s a beautiful girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So far, so good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can be summed up in a single sentence: &#8220;very modern high school girl.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She did, however, have something in her right hand that was obviously out of place for a high school girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A kitchen knife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is a typical all-purpose knife found in most houses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, a high school girl can have a knife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s a kitchen, you can count on a home-cooked meal made with love, and so on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s a different story when the knife is right under my nose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-47846 lazy" src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20473%20671'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Illus-01.png" alt="" width="473" height="671" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And fortunately or unfortunately, I had seen her before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Yes. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve met her beforeーー)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I gazed at her, I began to recall events from my memories.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">※※※</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was in a slump.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The work I was serializing at the time had been completed, and I needed to begin preparing for a new work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the project&#8217;s editor asked me to write a romantic comedy project, which I was not used to, because it was a selling point, and I couldn&#8217;t think of any good ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To escape reality, I spent my days drinking and smoking, and to top it all off, I was so stressed that I required sleeping pills to sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, in such a state of mind, it was impossible to come up with a good idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s when I saw her.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I remember now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was when I went to a bookstore to buy a manga book to use as a reference for my new project.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, it was also difficult for me to watch all of my peers&#8217; active manga on the market. But I managed to endure it because the manga I went to buy was one that was selling so well that it was stupid to be jealous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The manga I bought for work can be an expense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I need a receipt for this, however my name is rather complicated when written and difficult for others to grasp just by saying it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I leaned over the checkout counter and wrote it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that’s when I realized I&#8217;d dropped my phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, it appears that I dropped it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, I would think that if I dropped my phone, I would notice it by the sound, but at that moment I had no idea.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I was always wearing earphones, rejecting the outside world, and even during the day, I was in a daze and lacked normal judgement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even in this situation, I can afford to receive a receipt, which I find selfish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, if you&#8217;ve been self-employed for a long time, receiving receipts for your purchases becomes a habit that you almost instinctively follow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway, I dropped my phone and left the store without realizing it. So she, who was in line behind me at the time, picked up my phone and ran after me to hand it to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was grateful for the kindness of the casual observer who had run so hard for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The image of her breathing on my shoulder at that moment is burned into my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was somehow different from the average high school girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">High school girls are the strongest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a living organism, the body is at its peak, and as a human being, this is the last time we are allowed to dream endlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The energy of life that pervades them even brings a sense of spirituality, and they just laugh, frolic, and exude an unbridled energy to their surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She, on the other hand, was the polar opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was beautiful, but her physic was not strong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t feel like I have any mental space to ground it myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Weak and feeble, as if she would fly away if the wind blew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She gave off the impression of being somewhat fragile and deviating from reality.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to define her in one word, it would be a cliché: “unworldly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(At that time, what did we talk about?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t really remember all the details.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I probably said “I&#8217;m sorry” or &#8220;thank you&#8221; out of reflex, but if we did, it would have been a very short conversation, two or three words at most.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, that&#8217;s the only thing that connects me to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But of course, having a high school girl pick up my phone didn&#8217;t change my life in the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still couldn&#8217;t give up drinking, I smoked more cigarettes, and my name kept getting rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(What did I do after that? ーーThat&#8217;s right. I was so drunk that I decided to move out.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even with the help of all kinds of legal drugs, I finally couldn&#8217;t come up with any ideas, and I began to think about moving out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted to escape from everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have run away to Hokkaido, Okinawa, or even overseas, but I didn&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The poor side of me came out, wanting to stifle the price of moving. As a result, I decided to look for one in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made the decision to move to a new place without considering the consequences. It was difficult to find the movers, in part because it coincided with the hectic spring moving season.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With no time to spare before I had to move out of my room, I decided to throw away all of my household goods. They were being so stingy with the moving costs and throwing away the home items, which seemed contradictory, but I was so furious that I didn&#8217;t care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not a religious person, but I was in the mood to declutter everything and get rid of evil.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only exception to this was the LCD tablet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t get rid of this one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of the other home appliances were cheap, but the LCD tablet was an expensive piece of equipment, costing more than 200,000 yen. Besides, the LCD tablet had become more of a part of me than an object, so throwing it was out of the question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a miserable separation, but the positives soon became a reality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the first time in a long time, I was able to have a face-to-face meeting with my editor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was happy to see that lately I&#8217;ve been using e-mail exclusively for name exchanges, and even meetings over online calls have disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was glad that they hadn&#8217;t given up on me yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the room in high spirits and went to see the editor in charge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it&#8217;ll work this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had such a premonition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Well, as it turns out, that premonition was just a misunderstanding.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was aware that the name had been rejected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The editor in charge of my work expressed concern about me since I kept sending him names with incoherent contents and requested to meet with me in person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We live in a time when we&#8217;re afraid to meet people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The meeting was over in less than thirty minutes.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll never forget the look in the eyes of the editor in charge who said, “Don&#8217;t worry about the deadline for your name, so don&#8217;t put too much root in it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That look of care and compassion was half of what you see when you look at a sick person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least, it wasn&#8217;t the way he looked at a mangaka with a promising future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the publisher early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt awful when I left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was no longer confident that &#8220;manga artist&#8221; was the first thing that sprang to mind when describing who I am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a feeling that &#8220;unemployed,&#8221; &#8220;self-proclaimed mangaka,&#8221; or &#8220;psycho&#8221; would be more appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sickness begins with the mind,” as the saying goes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body began to weaken as though in response to my depressed mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I barely noticed a slight cold during the train ride. But, as soon as I stepped off the train at the next station, my health began to worsen dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I experienced heart palpitations by the time I left the ticket gate, and by the time I crossed the intersection, I had a headache and nausea. A severe sensation of exhaustion began to take over my body while I was just a hundred metres away from home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made it to the entrance of my new house while hobbling and clinging to the railings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I slipped my hand in my pocket and tried to get my keys out of my walletーーand that&#8217;s where the memory went blank.</span></p>
