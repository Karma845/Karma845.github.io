<h3>Confinement - Day 2</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I woke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m still not feeling well, but I&#8217;m feeling better than I did yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The stockings wrapped around my neck were gone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s likely the girl took it with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nonetheless, I ended up spending the whole morning yesterday unable to communicate with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What do I do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Common sense dictates that being locked up is dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Calm down. First, let&#8217;s take a moment to focus on the situation I&#8217;m in.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took another glance around the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t find anything in the room except a cardboard box, an LCD tab on top of it, and the cracker futon I was sleeping on, as I had suspected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chain was tied to the choker around my neck, and the other end was fastened and fixed to a hook mounted in the wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t see outside since the shutters were closed.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I crept up to the window, mindful about the length of the chain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s no good. I knew it, but I couldn&#8217;t even reach my fingers out the window, much alone step outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The chain has to be about three or four times longer to reach the window.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if my fingers reached the window, the inner lock was solidly sealed with something transparent that looked like glue, and because I was chained to it anyhow, there was no way for me to escape.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Still no luck, huh… Should I attempt shouting for help?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That way, perhaps a neighbor or bystander will notice the anomaly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(But, even if they did notice me, it would be faster for her to stab me than for the cops or neighbors to come rushing.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It reminds me of the dull, rough knife she was holding in her white fish-like fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I had to find a way out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what a normal person would think. I suppose I should consider it…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(But, even if I could get out, what difference would it make?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case, there&#8217;s nowhere I can go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m hardly motivated to seek or gather stuff for the manga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then it doesn&#8217;t really matter if I&#8217;m chained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it makes me lose the urge to escape at once.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(She’s coming.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Footsteps echoing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I made my way back to the cracker futon and sat down.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clack.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl remained silent as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In her right hand, she was holding a kitchen knife. Her left hand and chest held a rectangular silver tray she was holding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was also a random portion of yoghurt, jelly, and some type of supplement that I couldn&#8217;t figure out. There was also a spoon hooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl places the tray on the floor a short distance away from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then slid the tray across the floor with a swish, bringing it close to me with her bare feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this supposed to be my meal? ーーRight now, I don&#8217;t have much of an appetite…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just eat it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was reluctant, and she replied in a subdued tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her voice sounded like a soothing piano.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out the spoon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wasn&#8217;t in the mood to care whether any of these were laced with poison</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In silence, the girl exits the room once more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was thinking when I felt her gaze on me.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/zQJJ9td/Screenshot-418.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t blink as she stared at me through the doorway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure she&#8217;s concerned about whether or not I&#8217;m eating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For such a shattered and sick body, it could be exactly the perfect menu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I bring the item on the tray to my mouth quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It tastes just how you&#8217;d expect it to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It doesn&#8217;t appear to be poisoned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Maybe this spoon is genuine silverware. The trays aren&#8217;t the same as the ones that are commonly used to serve school meals.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unlike stainless steel, it has a softer feel.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These items, of course, do not belong to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve thrown away everything my household owns, and I couldn&#8217;t afford to buy such expensive dishes to begin with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would imply that she had brought it from somewhere else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(&#8230; Who the hell is this girl?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished my meal without hesitation, thinking about these questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her glance vanished at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I become an idle person as the door closes tightly again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lay there in a daze for the next few hours, looking at the ceiling, but I didn&#8217;t hear a single sound from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I became bored and glanced at the room, but I didn’t find anything new.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing left was a cardboard box with an LCD tab perched on top, as if to say something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to draw anything right now, no matter how much free time I had.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laid down and closed my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I escaped into the realm of slumber, using my poor health as an excuse.</span></p>
