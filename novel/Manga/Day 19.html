<h3>Confinement - Day 19</h3>

<p>"Wake up!"</p>

<p>"At such an unexpected call, my body reacts with a strong jolt."</p>

<p>…Ah, good morning." I answered in a drowsy state. I woke up with the feeling of having had an incredible dream.</p>

<p>It’s nighttime. I thought I shouldn’t wake you up, but for some reason you looked agitated, and then, you weren’t breathing at all.</p>

<p>Did I stop breathing? Am I developing apnea by any chance?</p>

<p>"I see, well, I wanted to have a little nap, but I seem to have slept a lot."</p>

<p>I was making a lot of progress on my new work yesterday until dawn, so I guess this is all a reaction to so much accumulated sleep.</p>

<p>"Well, I’m glad you’re okay." she replied while exhaling in a relieved manner.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry I worried… You… Hmm, you’re wearing civilian clothes today."</p>

<p>My eyes roll as I notice her change of look. On top she has a black v-neck shirt, and on it stamped the drawing of a goat on her chest.</p>

<p>And when I say goat, I don’t mean one of those cutely illustrated goats, but a very realistic goat.</p>

<p>And when I say goat, I don’t mean one of those cutely illustrated goats, but a very realistic goat.</p>

<p>The horns are atrocious, and the eyes instill fear. And at the bottom she wore a skirt, also in black. Its design was plaid, but it looks like a lace fabric and is slightly see-through, making it difficult to see, so I tried to rest my gaze elsewhere.</p>

<p>She was even wearing a black accessory in the form of a belt around her neck, also on her right wrist and on her left thigh. In other words, she was dressed all in black. She has the appearance of a person going to a death metal band concert or a gothic gathering.</p>

<p>Possibly it’s very much associated with her tastes. And thinking about things in retrospect, this is the first time I’ve seen her in civilian clothes. It’s a pretty cool sight to my eyes.</p>

<p>"Today I had things to do outside the house." she replied with a sullen expression.</p>

<p>"Really? And where have you been?"</p>

<p>"It’s a secret." she said, at the same time, putting the index finger of her left hand to her lips.</p>

<p>"I see… By the way, you have something white there."</p>

<p>I pointed to the back of her neck. I wonder what it is, it’s like white fluff.</p>

<p>"Eh…?"</p>

<p>Konata proceeded to run her hand along the back of her neck. Finally, her fingers groped into what appeared to be a piece of lint.</p>

<p>The moment she picked it up, and turned her head to see what appeared to be a “fuzz,” she ran out of the room at full speed, and slammed the door shut.</p>

<p>I could see the object for a second, but it seemed to be the price tag, right? If so, that means she might have bought those clothes to show it to me.</p>

<p>I looked away in a daze as I thought about it. Of course, it could just be delusions on my part. But if my guess is correct, that would make me very happy.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>After a few minutes. Konata returns to the room with an expression on her face as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"Have you already taken off the label?"</p>

<p>"There is no such thing." she replies in a scathing tone of voice.</p>

<p>"But then why did you run out of the room"</p>

<p>"I went out to get this."</p>

<p>She pulls out the object she had hidden on her back. It is an exercise tool.</p>

<p>"An ab roller?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I guess you could use it, since you need to exercise. I thought it would be more efficient if you had something like this to help you."</p>

<p>"Thank you. I’ll put it into practice right away." I said, as I picked up the roller.</p>

<p>I got down on my knees on the floor, and held the handle while placing the wheel on the floor. I assumed the pushing position, and then propelled my body forward, and then returned to my original position.</p>

<p>There is a feeling of greater overall strength than with normal abdominal muscles. After going back and forth several times, my body started to warm up. I felt like I was burning calories. But suddenly I felt a weight on my back.</p>

<p>"Why are you sitting on me?"</p>

<p>"To help your workout."</p>

<p>Her cold voice sounds from above in my head, at the same time my back heats up in reverse proportion, tingles of irritation in the area of my neck and buttocks make their presence known. But at the same time it felt pleasant… I wonder how common it is that a fake fingernail can be used as a weapon.</p>

<p>"…Are you angry?"</p>

<p>"I’m not."</p>

<p>"Well, please get out."</p>

<p>I had a feeling that something bad would happen if I started to protest, so I decided to continue exercising in silence. Eventually my strength reached its limit, causing me to fall to the ground, and in turn Konata was on top of me, crushing me to the ground.</p>

<p>Also, Konata went to the trouble of adding protein to my dinner that night. Apparently, she is willing to support me in my training.</p>
