<h3>Confinement - Day 3</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I woke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was morning or night since the curtains were drawn.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was late evening, according to the time displayed on the LCD tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, I&#8217;ve been sleeping for longer than I expected, despite the fact that it&#8217;s just been a few hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, possibly as a result, I feel a lot better today than I did yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my throat is still a little sore, and my body is also a little numb, so I can&#8217;t claim I&#8217;m in prime shape.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Knock knock knock.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A knock sounded as if it was just in time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a one-of-a-kind rhythm that I had heard somewhere before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes. I&#8217;m awake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded in such a clumsy manner.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Clack…</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She reappears, carrying a silver tray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The tray&#8217;s menu was the same as it had been the day before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I, too, started eating mindlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, she didn&#8217;t walk out of the room today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She leans against the wall, staring at me as I eat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I eventually finished my meal and put the spoon on the tray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you make any drawings?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She questioned abruptly, after a quick peek at the LCD tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want to draw&#8230; I just don&#8217;t know what to draw.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder whether it&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been rejected so many times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m afraid to draw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know I&#8217;ll lose my skills if I don&#8217;t strive to imitate them, but even that is too much for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Well thenーー”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a little moment, she inclined her head, as if pondering.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Draw me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said this matter-of-factly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She spoke as though it were her inherent right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Draw her? What a joke.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mouth escapes a laugh that is neither self-mockery nor dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s so funny?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl furrows her brow and flicks her knife at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded dejectedly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then draw.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that said, she sticks out the kitchen knife in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand… I will draw.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded reluctantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hate to draw, but it&#8217;s not worth my life.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I told myself as I stared at the girl I was drawing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hair was more than just black.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hair was darker at the roots, and there were slight brown undertones towards the ends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each lash is somewhat variable in length.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A mole on the neck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or, the hollow of her collarbone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Piercing position.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nail design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Beyond the signifier of a &#8220;high school girl in uniform,&#8221; the characteristics of her as an individual being stand out at you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(ーーCome to think of it, this is the first time I&#8217;ve ever sketched a real high school girl.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It occurred to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve drawn a number of high school girls in manga.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve even used images of high school girls available on the Internet as a source of reference.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;d never had the opportunity to closely observe and draw the real thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that sense, it may be a valuable opportunity.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I hate to be the one to tell what to do, but I don&#8217;t have a choice.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I push the tray against the wall and discreetly move the cardboard over in front of my body.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the LCD tab and took up the pen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pose?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s fine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered the toss and took a bite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl began unbuttoning her shirt silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cleavage was exposed, as is the edge of her bra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It has a light pink tone and is embroidered with exquisite floral design.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s nothing like my elderly mother&#8217;s brassiere that was drying at my parents&#8217; house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-ahem. No, I told you it would be just fine, why would you do that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;d go in like that, but I can&#8217;t take my gaze away from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, this is supposed to be the one I&#8217;m looking at, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a drawing, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buzz Marketing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She cocked her chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, this LCD tab isn&#8217;t even connected to the internet, so what&#8217;s the point of buzzing about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dry chuckle escaped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That misalignment made my worries subside a bit.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have no idea what she&#8217;s thinking, girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(It&#8217;s amusing. After all, it&#8217;s bizarre. I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m drawing the person who is holding me hostage and threatening me with a kitchen knife.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rational side of me cautioned me, but the pen continued to move on its own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I despised drawing, but once I started, I couldn&#8217;t stop myself from finishing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not a glorious thing to be considered a creative spirit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was more of a physiological, curse-like sensation, like not being able to stop defecating in the middle of a bowel movement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Still better than constipation, right?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather than dying as a manga artist&#8217;s failure in a shitty mess, one could be better off twisting with the laxative of a girl&#8217;s blackmail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not in a position where I can confidently declare myself a manga artist right now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Can I be proud of being a creator if I can still feel this way?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(But what good is threatening a third-rate manga artist like me? Why don&#8217;t you go to someone more successful if you&#8217;re going to threaten them? Why me?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt antipathy and interest in the girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s an enticing feeling, similar to what you get after eating food that adheres to your teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were so many worries and questions, yet I continued moving my pen, thinking about this and that.</span><i></i></p>
