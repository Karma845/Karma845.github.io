<h3>Confinement -Day 26</h3>

<p>"I'm full."</p>

<p>After a simple brunch of toast and fried eggs, I folded my hands together.</p>

<p>"It's just a light meal. Well, I'll clean up first."</p>

<p>"I feel like it's going to be a busy day."</p>

<p>Usually after dinner there will be joking and laughing, but today I feel like the girl seems to be a little anxious.</p>

<p>"Did I disturb you? Since you said you were going to finish the original draft today, I wanted to prepare a special deluxe meal to celebrate. I've prepared a lot of things for that."</p>
 
<p>She spoke quickly.</p>

<p>It looks like she's full of energy.</p>

<p>I didn't think it did disturb me, but when she said that, it seemed I hear some sound of noise that seems not noisy to me at all.</p>

<p>"Ahhh, that's right. Thank you. I'm really going to finish my original draft today. Oh, I'm going to apologize now in advance, if I don't make it today."</p>

<p>"Really? ...... But even if you don't finish, we can still celebrate, right?"</p>

<p>She picked up the tray and tilted her head slightly.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Why? It's because, today is your birthday, right?"</p>

<p>(I can't believe it.)</p>

<p>I opened my eyes widely.</p>

<p>"Ah! Oh, that's right. So, it's my birthday."</p> 

<p>I can't help but to be stunned.</p>

<p>It seems that I was so focus in the original draft that I forgot my own birthday.</p>

<p>"So, anyway, let's celebrate."</p>

<p>"Indeed, in that case, it's not bad if we party today."</p>

<p>She smiled and nodded her head.</p>

<p>(Having said that, it would be a bit of a shame if I couldn't finish the original draft today.)</p>

<p>I pick up the pen and patted my cheeks. Since progress has reached the finishing touches. I just need to revisit the lines and the drawings and read them again from the beginning, so that it'll not be problem later on.</p>

<p>──</p>

<p>──</p>

<p>──</p>

<p>"Done! Finally!"</p>

<p>Putting the pen down and I stretched as hard as if I were shouting "Hooray!</p>

<p>It's already evening. I stood up and walk towards the door. I pulled the doorknob and poked my head through the crack and said. </p>

<p>"Oh hey, Konata, I already finished the manga."</p>

<p>"Great! I've got less than ten minutes here, so just wait a little longer."</p>

<p>She look at me and said while wearing an apron.</p>

<p>With pepper in her hand....</p>

<p>While on the chopping board, there is expensive looking beef that is about to get cook. (TL: Probably A5 Wagyu.)</p>

<p>I said "Okay." and went back to the room.</p>

<p>I hadn't been drinking so far, so I kinda wanted to, since it's my birthday.</p>

<p>Although it is troublesome to do work, the sense of accomplishment that comes from completing a job is always accompanied by a sense of drinking alcohol. (TL: Average Salaryman in Japan be like:)</p>

<p>Not long after, the girl appeared with a tray on her hands.</p>

<p>"Thanks for the wait."</p>

<p>The garlic aroma in the steak whets my appetite, and the sliced baguette that is topped with melted cheese, accompanied by salad and corn soup, and strawberry cake.</p>

<p>The luxurious food are beautifully arrange in the tray. Kinda interesting.</p>

<p>"All this food, it probably take a lot of effort."</p>

<p>"Congratulations on completing the original draft, and happy birthday."</p>

<p>The girl while clapping her hands.</p>

<p>"Umm... Well, thank you, and...." I also matched her, gently clapping my hands.</p>

<p>I said feeling stuttered.</p>

<p>"And what?"</p>

<p>"Since it's celebration, I hope you kinda change your uniform, and change with something else? Like in a fancy restaurant's like thing....?"</p>

<p>My eyes were shuttering everywhere and probably look suspicious since I had hard time expressing my request.</p>

<p>"..!"</p>

<p>The girl open her eyes wide.</p>

<p>"You know like, since this is celebration, wearing uniform's kinda look unspecial right?" I said shyly.</p>

<p>"No problem! I'm going to get dressed now! I'll be right back!"</p>

<p>She left the room humming a song while dancing like a ballerina.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for her to come back in her self-care dress, which exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>Wrapping her own body, with a magic user like clothes. It is a white, youthful look dress. Because of her clothes, this dinner tonight seems like in a fancy hotel restaurant.</p>

<p>"So there such some service's like that this days."</p>

<p>"Yep. After all, I am at least a young lady."</p>

<p>She sat sideways on the floor and puffed out her chest with some pride.</p>

<p>"You're pretty."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about all of a sudden? Come on, eat before the meat gets cold."</p>

<p>She looked away shyly and picked up her knife and fork.</p>

<p>If It's my first time being imprisoned, I would have been wary if I had seen that weapon on her hand, but now I don't feel that way at all.</p>

<p>"Right." Also grabbing the fork and knife.</p>

<p>Although the meat is still a little red, but there is no tendon on meat, so the knife can cut down like a butter. And I use the fork to put the meat in my mouth.</p>

<p>Delicious.</p>

<p>Although it was simply seasoned with salt and pepper, it taste very good.</p>

<p>I can feel my muscles at the corners of my mouth relaxing.</p>

<p>But unfortunately──</p>

<p>"If you want a drink, red wine, I have it on fridge." </p>

<p>Just as always, the girl always see me through.</p>

<p>"After all, it's a celebration-- ah, but only half a bottle, so you don't drink too much."</p>

<p>Raising her index finger as she said.</p>

<p>"Thanks... but, it's amazing that you can buy alcohol even when you're still not on age."</p>

<p>"It's because I used your card name to pay."</p>

<p>"Oh, totally forgot that."</p>

<p>This is how we talk and laugh, flowing relaxing atmosphere between us .But the fun time passed in a flash and the plates were soon to get empty.</p>

<p>"--Well, can I see the finished manuscript?" The girl slowly said.</p>

<p>"Yep" I replied.</p>

<p>"Thank you very much."</p>

<p>"Don't be polite."</p>

<p>I picked up the glass with 1/3 of the red wine left and waited for her in silence.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>Soon after, the girl looked at me and said.</p>

<p>"Perfect." the girl muttered.</p>

<p>"I don't know if it's perfect, but I can't get any better than this for me right now."</p>

<p>"...... Wait a little." The girl came out the room. And came back giving me a mobile phone in my hand.</p>

<p>"Here." handing it to me slowly.</p>

<p>"Can I?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I see." I gave a short answer.</p>

<p>Despite this, the girl mood seems acceptable.</p>

<p>Right! This way I can send the original to my editor.</p>

<p>"I have something to report, too."</p>

<p>The girl straightened its back, sitting upright, and said solemnly.</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"..............I, tomorrow, decided to go to school now."</p>

<p>Although it is expectable, I understand her meaning already.</p>

<p>"Well, congratulations." I said quietly.</p>

<p>It's feels like I lost my composure and said something exaggerated.</p>

<p>"It's just since you ran away from home for a long time..... it's probably hard for you to explain.... So......"</p>

<p>And the girl came to my side and bent her body down towards me.</p>

<p>The scent of flowers is wafting in my nose.</p>

<p>"It's probably better if you don't do this kind of──"</p>

<p>With some lonely smile. I don't where would I pull the best words. But.</p>

<p>*Click.*</p>

<p>The chain in my neck fell down that makes a loud sound.</p>

<p>Currently I feel 70% peace, 20% joy, and 10% of emptiness.</p>

<p>I've always have question in my mind, why would she imprisoned me? Now I understand, It's all about reviving me as manga artist.</p>

<p>"Be careful on your way home..." I smiled at her as I rubbed my neck.</p>

<p>"That's kinda quick goodbye." She said lovingly.</p>

<p>"I guess, Oh also please come back here soon, and put collar to me again. I feel like I'm gonna do my past habit soon." I said jokingly. </p>

<p>"I know. I'll be back as soon as I can, so get some rest."</p>

<p>"I feel like I'm gonna sleep peacefully today. I'm little drunk."</p>

<p>"...... Goodnight."</p>

<p>"Yeah, Goodnight."</p>

<p>We greeted each other like this and smiled at each other.</p>

<p>Thus, I aged another year and my time with this girl imprisonment finally ended.</p>

<p>Now, I wonder what's our relationship now? I don't know.</p>

<p>It didn't take long when the girl starts to wash dishes in the kitchen, carrying a tray for two. </p>

<p>While I transferred the original manuscript from the tablet to my cell phone and sent it to the editor.</p>

<p>Then I jump into my bed and got some sleep.</p>
