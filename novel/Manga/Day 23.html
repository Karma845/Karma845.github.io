<h3>Confinement - Day 23</h3>

<p>"I'm already full. Today's food also delicious. Thank you for the meal."</p>

<p>After an elegant breakfast of French toast and broth, I folded my hands.</p>

<p>"It's just a light meal."</p>

<p>The girl is smiling slightly while picking up my finished plate, and left the room.</p>

<p>(Hmm... Since I'm full maybe I should take a nap then go back to work.)</p>

<p>I lay down on my bed and close my eyes.</p>

<p>Since my mind already in conscious of sleep I totally forgot about my manga and drifted myself in sleep.</p>

<p>*Swish, swish, swish, swish.*</p>

<p>"Hmmm...?"</p>

<p>I felt an itchy touch on my arm, so I braced myself.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes, I saw a small teal spider.</p>

<p>I shrugged it off without even thinking about it.</p>

<p>The spider that fell to the ground wandered around doing nothing.</p>

<p>(I want to put the spider outside.)</p>

<p>I reached out to the spider and glanced at the window - and then I noticed.</p>

<p>I obviously can't because I'm chained.</p>

<p>I naturally forget about it.</p>

<p>(Oh, wait? Isn't this bad? I'm getting used to this kind of treatment and starting to turn into a useless person.)</p>

<p>I suddenly turned pale.</p>

<p>If I think about it calmly, am I in a pretty bad state of mind right now?</p>

<p>My relationship of trust with the girl is indeed growing and my living environment is improving, so I don't feel the need to escape from here.</p>

<p>In the second day of imprisonment I have been looking for the possibility of escaping, but until now I have not made even one attempt to escape.</p>

<p>(Well, Maybe I should try to think a escape plan for now.) I thought to myself.</p>

<p>"Oh just like others says. All day sitting in work is tiring."</p>

<p>Firstly, I'm going to pretend doing excercise to test the limits of the chain length.</p>

<p>If I want to reach the window. The best excercise is sit up.</p>

<p>(It really doesn't work.)</p>

<p>Not enough to reach the window.</p>

<p>Although the length of the chain is much longer than the first day of imprisonment, it's still not enough to reach the window unless it is twice longer.</p>

<p>(How about entryway..... Nope impossible.)</p>

<p>Since the entryway was kitchen that's where the girl is always cooking. So it's no doubt that challenging escaping there is impossible.</p>

<p>But even though the length of the chain can reach toilet and kitchen, it's still not enough to reach at doorway outside.</p>

<p>(Lastly, breaking the chain seems impossible too.)</p>

<p>There are no tools here enough to break this strong chain after all.</p>

<p>Smashing it on the walls will make noise. And if I try to break it with fork, it may result to injuries too.</p>

<p>(Then, how about shouting for help?)</p>

<p>This is probably the best way to ask for help but it's still seems impossible.</p>

<p>Assuming my voice will reach outside, someone might call for the police. However before the police will come, the girl might injure me unintentionally because just like I observe, she's already clumsy enough to injure me unintentionally. And I will probably end up like the rabbit apple.</p>

<p>(And if the police broke here and sees me injured by the girl, she will be likely perpetrator.)</p>

<p>This is the biggest reason why I shouldn't do shouting plan.</p>

<p>(Wait, Isn't more simple if I shout when the girl is outside shopping.)</p>

<p>I can't help but to sigh.</p>

<p>But the girl must be going outside when I was asleep, so in the end there was no chance at all.</p>

<p>(Night Ambush might work. I'll just wait for the time when she's outside then I'll try to sneak.)</p>

<p>In the current situation, it is impossible to escape by my own power, so it is better to think more options.</p>

<p>(Or should I just wait when the girl change her mind about imprisoning me.)</p>

<p>Such a vague hope.</p>

<p>(Maybe she's also having trouble on school that is why it's relaxing for her being here. So maybe I should just focus on my manga....)</p>

<p>In the end I didn't make any progress just like in past 10 days.</p>

<p>However, there is something different from before.</p>

<p>The manuscript of my manga is 80% finished.</p>

<p>However, I hit a bottleneck in the climax and couldn't figure out how to end it.</p>

<p>(There is a little bit more, there is a little bit more to finish.....)</p>

<p>My consciousness drifted away from the escape plan and crossed my mind on my imagination.</p>

<p>──</p>

<p>──</p>

<p>──</p>

<p>The draft content of my manga is when the 1st day of imprisonment up to 23rd day. And ever since then, I think I became weird.</p>

<p>It can't be help because she's taking care of me, even though I know that imprisonment is bad.</p>

<p>Ever since the 1st day, I almost recovered my physical strength, so I could just hold the girl down and escape.</p>

<p>Like if I trick her "I want to sketch you back." And I will used the opening to chain her and make my escape.</p>

<p>Even I, can also use violence now, Like I'll just pretend sleeping and attack her when she's asleep.</p>

<p>It's already 23rd day since the imprisonment, maybe it's already time.</p>

<p>But to tell you the truth, I don't have intentions of any violence.</p>

<p>But unconsciously, I still got dominated by a JK girl by imprisoning me.</p>

<p>And ever since the start of imprisonment, I had become a "useless" person...... Right?</p>
