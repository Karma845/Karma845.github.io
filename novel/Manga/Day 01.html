<h3>Confinement - Day 1</h3>

<p>(That’s right. This is my room. I’ve only recently moved in, so it’s no surprise that the ceiling is unfamiliar to me.)</p>
<p>1DK with its own bathroom and toilet.</p>
<p>It’s undoubtedly the place I rented.</p>
<p>I knew I was nuts for not noticing this right away.</p>
<p>This is not a normal state of mind.</p>
<p>(I passed out in front of the doorway. She, who lives nearby, happened came upon it and helped me.)</p>
<p>That’s what it is if I think about it calmly.</p>
<p>I return my gaze to the LCD tab.</p>
<p>If I’m not mistaken, it’s been two days since I collapsed.</p>
<p>“Did you look after me?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>

<p>The girl was deafeningly silent.</p>
<p>She was just gazing at me, holding a knife.</p>
<p>It’s insane when I think about it.</p>
<p>If she just wants to help me, she can call an ambulance.</p>
<p>Why could she do such a thing to me?</p>
<p>What in the world am I worth?</p>
<p>“Hey, you――”</p>
<p>A girl approached me as I tried to ask more questions.</p>
<p>“Wait, a second!”</p>
<p>The girl lifts her knife with no time to stop her.</p>
<p>I instinctively closed my eyes.</p>
<p>AhーーIt doesn’t hurt…</p>
<p>Just a cool sensation on my brow.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes with trepidation.</p>
<p>The girl’s slender arm was whiter than her shirt.</p>
<p>The belly of the knife was apparently placed on my brow.</p>

<p>My body tensed up.</p>
<p>I lost my voice.</p>
<p>My lips were frozen altogether, as if they were glued together.</p>
<p>As though the world had come to an end, silence fell.</p>
<p>The only inkling that time had flown was the chilly sweat trickling down my neck. She then puts the belly of the knife on her own forehead in a deliberate, ritualistic gesture.</p>
<p>(What do you want? I don’t get it.)</p>
<p>I don’t feel like asking the girl directly.</p>
<p>For me, not wanting to provoke her, words were now equivalent to explosives that I had to be careful with.</p>
<p>I will not open my mouth carelessly.</p>
<p>I watched her closely.</p>
<p>The girl walked out of the room backwards, like a moonwalker.</p>
<p>In relief, I relaxed my shoulders.</p>
<p>But, my relief was short-lived.</p>
<p>The girl returned to the room, carrying a new weapon in her left hand besides the knife in her right.</p>
<p><em>Hyun-hyun-hyun!</em></p>

<p>The true nature of the light, wind-swept sound was――stockings.</p>
<p>However, within it was crammed an item roughly the size of a ragged, diced steak.</p>
<p>It is a bludgeoning weapon commonly known as a sap or blackjack.</p>
<p>By using centrifugal force, even an ineffective woman can achieve sufficient striking force.</p>
<p>No sound, little bloodshed.</p>
<p>It was truly the perfect tool for murder.</p>
<p>“D-don’t come here!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>I opened my hands and extended them in front of her.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no way anyone would stop at such a deterrent move.</p>
<p>The girl kicked me in the chest whilst holding a knife menacingly in her hand.</p>
<p>I’m compelled to roll onto my back.</p>
<p>Why should a person I’ve barely met once do something like this to me?</p>
<p>Fear reaches a tipping point, transforming into rage and reopening.</p>
<p>“Ahh, right! Good, then! If you’re going to murder me, do it. I’ve already tossed away my manga; I have nothing left!”</p>

<p>I stretched my arms and legs and perched on my haunches.</p>
<p>Pressure on the stomach.</p>
<p>The horseback girl presses her pin-tight stockings on my neck.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes once again.</p>
<p>My neck tightens up.</p>
<p>Apparently, the most common method of suicide is hanging.</p>
<p>Strangulation is probably a better way to die than stabbing and killing.</p>
<p>I felt like if I could just get comfortable with this, it wouldn’t be so bad.</p>
<p>“I-it’s cold!”</p>
<p>I jumped up.</p>
<p>My neck was wrapped in a stocking.</p>
<p>The contents seemed to be a block of ice.</p>
<p>The girl was gone from the room before I knew it.</p>
<p>(&#8230; So she’s not gonna kill me? I don’t understand.)</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>My body and mind are in chaos, and I can’t think straight.</p>
<p>I’m getting sleepy again.</p>
<p>But even with my current limited thinking abilities, there are certain things I can figure out.</p>
<p>A high school girl has locked me up.</p>
<p>That’s all I know for sure.</p>

<p>The tension caused by fear keeps you awake.</p>
<p>However, this did not last long, as an overpowering physiological urge quickly overpowered the eyelids.</p>
