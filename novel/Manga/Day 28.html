<h3>Confinement - Day 28</h3>

<p>The next day, I pulled myself up and look around room.</p>

<p>(Not back yet, huh.)</p> 

<p>After finishing brushing my teeth, I still feel no other presence in the room.</p>

<p>Although I know it's pointless, I still can't help but open the bathroom door and look inside, or go to the foyer and look out through the door mirror.</p>

<p>I guess I'm only doing this just to calm myself.</p>

<p>After that, I fried eggs and mix it with rice and just finished it instantly. After that I just normally wash the dishes.</p>

<p>Then.</p>

<p>*Ping pong.*</p>

<p>The sound of the smartphone reach my ears.</p>

<p>(Is it DM?) (TL: Direct Message.)</p>

<p>I turn off the faucet, wiped my hands with my shirt and picked up the phone.</p>

<p>(No, It's a email....)</p>

<p>I couldn't help to get disappointed by the email icon in my phone. However, when I read the title of the email, I immediately got nervous.</p>

<p><b>Re: About the new manuscript, Nijido Hyuga.</b></p>

<p>(The editor replied faster than I expected. Normally it would take about three days in earliest.)</p>

<p>Well, the editor is the second person I was expecting to contact me.</p>

<p>Because of the boring title he's always sending to me, I'm already fully familiar with the editor responsible for my work.</p>

<p>I sat across my leg and and read the email.</p>

<p>"I'm Yao Tanaka from furea comic. I have read your original manuscript. I honestly didn't expect you to draw comedy manga. Personally, I would have preferred to see a romantic comedy, but well, never mind, after all, the company adheres to the credo of "anything goes as long as it's funny". So, I'll get to the point, I think it's pretty tough to submit this original manuscript to the conference. The reason is, not every scene can make you laugh, or more like it used unscrupulous words as metaphor to make other laugh, but in the end it was just perverted words. Example, there's scene here that used metaphor, "I haven't lose my shame yet." Since it was designed as comedy manga, the reader will not mind "shame" part of it. Of course, everyone's feeling of laughter varies from person to person. Since I got hard time to get this manga publicize, I asked other editors opinion, but I got same opinion as other. One editor commented, "I feel like I'm watching a junior high school student talking about a pornographic story I just learned". In normal comedy story, they likely use first person perspective (POV). But in your work you used third person perspective. Well actually we don't have problem on the "perspective" topic. In short the work on how you write it."</p>

<p>I put the phone down and let it slide to the floor. The second half of the email, I didn't read it all, its because.</p>

<p>(Hahahaha, it was refuted again.)</p>

<p>My laugh was mix with self-deprecation, remorse, and resignation.</p>

<p>(I see. I guess, I'm the only who's satisfied with it.)</p>

<p>The editor's critique is very long, mainly pointing out that my work has too many pretentious descriptions, too much self-righteousness and lack of objectivity.</p>

<p>Maybe he's right. My manga is not perfect as commercial, it was work of momentum.</p>

<p>(Of course, I already expect to not get accepted right away.)</p>

<p>It's just that I didn't expect such harsh reviews.</p>

<p>But, on second thought, it's only natural. If I only follow them to draw romcom genre, I wouldn't get refuted many times.</p>

<p>(Although the girl give so much praise, but yeah. On second thought, she's not a professional editor either.)</p>

<p>After all, the opinion of the girl is only the opinion of a reader. Moreover, she is also my fan.</p>

<p>I was foolish to believed on a fan.</p>

<p>As always. (I'm tired.) And laid at bed at once.</p>

<p>I can't get excited about it at all.</p>

<p>While there was sound of cicadas, where I don't know where they come from.</p>

<p>*Click Click Click.*</p>

<p>At worse possible time, there was a person in hallway.</p>

<p>So I braced myself and wipe my face with my shirt. And go to the hallway.</p>

<p>"Welcome back."</p>

<p>I tried to put on a smile and said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"I'm back." The girl put her book bag in the hallway near the entrance.</p>

<p>"It's so late to be back here."</p>

<p>"..... sorry."</p>

<p>She took off her shoes, walked into the room, came up to me, and bowed her head deeply.</p>

<p>"No, no need to apologize. Besides, I guess a lot of things happened during the long absence from school." I said with a smile.</p>

<p>I guess I didn't doesn't sound very happy.</p>

<p>"I didn't go to school."</p>

<p>With these words, she closed her eyes and collapsed to the ground.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"I walked to the school, I really did. However, I was approached by my classmates I knew in front of the school, and I couldn't answer properly, so my legs got weak. When the bell rang, and I was so scared and I ran away - I was so embarrassed with you that's why I didn't come back here yesterday, even though you help me."</p>

<p>"Well...... let's do it together." I mumbled.</p>

<p>This is not literally guaranteed to be a positive thing. Rather, it's a viscous mud that subtly contains both darkness and joy.</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"The original draft was rejected." I said lightly.</p>

<p>"How could they...... isn't already enough interesting."</p>

<p>Now I can't accept her words honestly. Better to say, I was bit angry.</p>

<p>"No, they said it was not funny. That's why it was dismissed. That's why the manga was complete mess - I'm sorry, even though you help me couple of times." I lowered my head.</p>

<p>I feel humiliated from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>This is my current strength.</p>

<p>"No, Don't apologies to me. Don't...." The girl mumble in a voice that was almost inaudible.</p>

<p>An awkward silence dominates the room.</p>

<p>"What is the point....."</p>

<p>Then I thought.</p>

<p>"The girl was not able to go to school and my original draft was rejected ...... In that case, what is the meaning of our one-month imprisonment?"</p>

<p>All that remains is emptiness.</p>

<p>Even if I fail, as long as the girl can to the school, that's already enough for me. However, when both people fail like this, our encounter becomes meaningless.</p>

<p>This is just a mutual licking of wounds between defeated dogs.</p>

<p>In the end there was no result on our future.</p>

<p>"He-hey..." The girl help out her hands as if she wanted to say something.</p>

<p>"Sorry. Can you leave me alone for a moment." Turning my back on her.</p>

<p>In the corner of my eyes, I saw her expression clearly . The timid eyes, the trembling lips.</p>

<p>That.... no doubt, that's the expression of hurt.</p>

<p>But even though I knew this, I couldn't agree with her on a single word. Right now I am doing my best to suppress my negative feelings.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>The sound of footsteps fades away. And the sound of the closing door.</p>

<p>It was same feeling before I met the girl. Even though I still haven't eaten or take a bath yet, I just put the blanket on and ran away from reality.</p>
