<h3>Confinement - Day AZ</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>When I woke up, I saw a face of a beautiful girl at the distance where our nose was about to touch.</p>

<p>"He-hey....... Go-Good morning..."</p>

<p>Feeling the soft sensation behind head, realizing I was resting in her thighs.</p>

<p>My body frozed.</p>

<p>"It's already night." The girl patted my head and snickered.</p>

<p>"I-I see..... then.... uh..... Good evening?" Changing my words.</p>

<p>After staying up all nighters for several days it's normal that I'll get tired from it.</p>

<p>"Yep, Good evening." She returns the greetings and smiled at me.</p>

<p>"Well.... uh again, I will decide to not leave." The girl said bashfully while scratching her hair.</p>

<p>"But, aren't your personal belongings gone?"</p>

<p>"Ohhhh, those are things are my things when you collapse, since those things make me sick, I decided to take them back."</p>

<p>"Sick?"</p>

<p>"Yes, because it's from my family, it feels like I'm borrowing something from them. The only thing that can be put in this house is "our" property." She said with her hands together, making a dreamy girl-like expression.</p>

<p>"So that's what happened."</p>

<p>I don't know if I should believe in her theory but I fully understand her reasoning.</p>

<p>"Yep. And thanks to that misunderstanding, I was able to receive such wonderful gift." The girl laughed naughtily.</p>

<p>"Well, uh, uh, so you've read my manga, right?" I said as my eyes wandered around.</p>

<p>I didn't feel anything when I was drawing, but after I woke up and calmed down, I suddenly felt embarrassed.</p>

<p>When I think about it, what I did was like a musician who gave a song he wrote as a birthday present on her crush's birthday.</p>

<p>Of course I don't regret it, but I'm extremely embarrassed about it.</p>

<p>"Yep." The girl closed its eyes and nodded deeply.</p>

<p>"So, what do you think?"</p>

<p>"I'm very happy." she mumbled with dazed look.</p>

<p>"HAHAHA, isn't funny?"</p>

<p>"Because that's how I spent my time with you, isn't it? I'm sure it would be a lie for me to say that the story was interesting." She frowned and said bashfully.</p>

<p>"Indeed, that's true." I nodded my head in understanding.</p>

<p>"But it's good to know that you understand your own feelings."</p>

<p>"Ah, ah.... I also think it's great that I can convey my feelings to you... although I'm a little embarrassed."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I have learned that you are actually looking at me with lustful eyes."</p>

<p>"...... Sorry." I covered my face with both hands.</p>

<p>I should've just edit some scene in that manga. That manga is too honest.</p>

<p>"It's fine."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"Even if you look at me with lust." With these words, she moved my hands aside. Her eyes shone with a sultry glint.</p>

<p>"May I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Of course, it's okay to go further."</p>

<p>"This is..... not a crime right?"</p>

<p>"It's a crime, if I was against it." She stared at me intently, her face gradually approaching.</p>

<p>I closed my eyes.</p>

<p>*Vibrates*</p>

<p>That's when my phone rang in my pocket.</p>

<p>(Read the timing...)</p>

<p>I tried to ignore it but it keeps ringing.</p>

<p>"It's better if you answer it."</p>

<p>"Yeah, that's right."</p>

<p>I brace myself and take out my cellphone.</p>

<p>(This is from the editor of the Second Hall? Is there something wrong?)</p>

<p><strong>Sensei! Congratulations! The editor-in-chief reads it and decided to publish it in our magazine!</strong></p>

<p>"Eh? What are you talking about?" I was overwhelmed by the sudden blessing from the responsible editor.</p>

<p><strong>Here we go again. I've read the original manuscript. "The story of a manga artist imprisoned by a high school girl." That's it! That's what I want! A great work that brings out the teacher's style! It shows the truthfulness of the manga artist's frustration that his original manuscript is not progressing well, and the balance of the fantasy plot of being imprisoned by a high school girl while taking care of him is just perfect. It's also easy to push the romance comedy in line with the current story.</strong></p> 

<p>The editor-in-charge is very excited, as if the salt response so far has been false. The editor-in-charge's reaction to the manga is very real, to the point of being explicit. I think it's really funny. </p> 

<p>But it's not a dream, the high school girl is right in front of me right now.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>However if the editor finds out the truth, it will be trouble for me, so i just nooded my head.</p>

<p><strong>Yes. After that, I'll put it out as a short story and see how it goes. If the feedback from readers is good, I would like to turn it into original series, is that possible?</strong></p>

<p>"Yes, yes! Please take care of it." I nodded in response.</p>

<p>There is no reason to refuse after all.</p>

<p><strong>Great! Then I'll go back to the meeting. I'll send you an email with the details later!</strong></p>

<p>"Yes, thank you." I bowed my head over the phone and hung up.</p>

<p>"That's strange. Did I send the original manuscript to the editor when I was sleeping?" After putting my cell phone in my pocket, I cocked my head.</p>

<p>"Ahhh, that. I sent it to the editor for you. It would be a loss to humanity if I were the only one to own such a great manga." The girl said.</p>

<p>"HAHA, you're exaggerating, but thanks." I bowed my head deeply.</p>

<p>The only thing I've always dreaming of, thanks to the blessing of the goddess of luck, it finally fell for me.</p>

<p>"It's no big deal. As a fan, it's a normal." The girl proudly raised her chest.</p>

<p>(The girl is back, and I see a bright future as manga artist. Is this kind of happy thing really exist?)</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>Hmm? By the way, wait.</p>

<p>"The editor in charge should not have an SNS, and if he is the sender, why would he contact me? I don't think the responsible editor has an SNS, and if he is the sender, why would he contact me?" I put my arms up and thought about it.</p>

<p>"Eh? Just look at the editor's email address and you'll see it in his SNS account. That's what I did when I contact you from school, isn't it natural? HAHAHA, are you still half-sleep?" The girl said flirtatiously.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I'll get a call. Because it was sent from my email, so I must have been called."</p>

<p>I was make fun by girl while I just accept it in a cool way.</p>

<p>No, it's weird to think about it.</p>

<p>".....By the way, how did you open my account? I know you know what my card password is but I wouldn't add my birthday in my email password."</p>

<p>In my SNS account, the only thing that is not hidden was my email and my job.</p>

<p>Therefore, it is only natural for this party to know about it.</p>

<p>However, the password of the email is automatically generated by Google itself so it should safe.</p>

<p>If I use my birthday as password, the four-digit num will not accept as password. However, if I use my laptop, I think I can send emails through my browser. However, she left all my stuff in this room when she went out.</p>

<p>"That was a lot of work for me. You're really serious person. You don't even play with your cell phone when you go out. You're an indoor person who only comes out to walk when you need to buy something."</p>

<p>This seems to be the right place to nod.</p>

<p>"Yeah, I'm a indoor-person at heart."</p>

<p>"You only go out every 28th day of the month to eat outside. And you favorite food was fried chicken at fast food chain. So every 28th day I always follows the movements of your fingers, analyze them and unlock the screen lock. But when you go outside, you don't touch your cellphone at all, so it was failed plan, So when you dropped your phone at the bookstore. It was fate." The girl said quickly in an enchanted tone.</p>

<p>(Wait, when I dropped my phone at bookstore it was already 10 minutes pass, so it wouldn't be strange if she picked it up because she's always behind me. And just returned it to me naturally and there will not be any suspicion.</p>

<p>In short, In that 10 minutes, she collects information in my phone and returned it to me naturally after 10 minutes.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Since my email password was saved automatically she can easily open it and she can just change the password and returned it to me naturally without suspicions. (TL: If you saved you password in phone made by google, it will automatically fill up the information because it was generated password by google.)</p>

<p>The password is hidden like that on the screen.</p>

<p>So if she change the password and remove the notification log in, in the settings, I wouldn't be able to notice it, that the girl is already seeing my email an other stuff.</p>

<p>Of course if I check the log in history, I will immediately notice it but I'm not sure if I can get back the password itself.</p>

<p>After all, I'm a careless man who sets his bank account password with his birthday.</p>

<p>"That's right! Thanks to this, I am closer to your heart. If I follow SNS, I can only know your appearance. And when you understand the feeling, pain and, despair of your idol, that only means you're a true fan" The girl declared without a trace of guilt.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're thinking of me like that." I muttered hiding my inner thoughts.</p>

<p>(Wait, this girl is not just a fan who supports me to returned on my manga career, she's just a stalker who was waiting to lock me in her hands.)</p>

<p>A goosebumps ran down on my spines. This must be the emotion called frightened.</p>

<p>(And I even sent a manga confession on a stalker.)</p>

<p>But I'm not a person who spit something I just promise.</p>

<p>And it's also hard to make a manga that is a story I want to forget.</p>

<p>My inner feelings suddenly became chaotic.</p>

<p>But thanks to the girl, I was be able to get back on my own feet.</p>

<p>I'm seriously very grateful to the girl.</p>

<p>I think she's very attractive as a gentle, awkward, but hard-working person. </p> 

<p>The sentiment is not a lie.</p>

<p>I admit that I am attracted to her but I'm now afraid of her.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I have to warm up the soup, I'm sure I can do that, after all your own body is your money." She put her lips to my ear and whispered at me.</p>

<p>"I guess your right, but there's nothing good living alone, its just going to messed your life." I inadvertently agreed.</p>

<p>"I see, i see. Don't worry I'll be there for you." As the girl said and picked up something in the ground. And as expected she put the collar on my neck once again.</p>

<p>That smile? is that angel? or devil?</p>

<p>Right now. I can't tell.</p>

<p>(What will happen to me from now on?)</p>

<p>I couldn't control the feelings that were hanging in my chest, as I watched her back as she walk away to the kitchen.</p>

<p>The story of a manga artist imprisoned by a high school girl.</p>

<p>The genre seems still not been determine.</p>
