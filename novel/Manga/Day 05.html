<h3>Confinement - Day 5</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, too, I’m drawing that girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Drawing her has become somewhat of a routine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All I have in this room is an LCD tablet, and it&#8217;s the only way I can keep the girl pleased.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> I know that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Is this the right thing to do?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a vague sense of frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My editor assured me that I could submit my story at any moment, but I felt like I wanted to do something different…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">New furnishings——now’s good?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can&#8217;t help but think now about things like taking out the trash or greeting neighbors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I need to change my license address, and did I remember to debit the water and power bills?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that——</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Right! Today&#8217;s the day to transfer the rent!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I slapped my knee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I&#8217;ve transferred the money from our account.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, the girl&#8217;s eyes widened in shock, but she said nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our account?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl flips up the hem of her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black waist pouch was wrapped around her navel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the sort of thing you keep valuables in while traveling abroad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a single motion, she pulled out three bank passbooks from there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them look familiar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I know where the money for the washing machine came from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s right. Good. Well, ours, or rather, mine…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s not. ‘Ours.’ I make sure I pay for mine. Rent and living expenses are split fifty-fifty.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl corrects me in a strong tone and turns over the passbook to show it to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure enough, there was a deposit in the passbook that I didn&#8217;t remember.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it was a royalty transfer from the publishing company, the company name should be printed, but it is not in the record of the payment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, she must have used my passbook to deposit the money herself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s quite a lot of money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the very least, it is not an amount that can be paid out of a high school girl&#8217;s allowance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who in the world is she?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just when I thought one mystery was solved, another deepened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right… … … Eh, I mean, even if you did, how did you transfer the rent? You need a PIN to transfer rent, let alone deposit money!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost let it go for a second, but then I thought of the obvious question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa. I can&#8217;t believe that people exist today who use their birthday as their PIN.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl sighs in exasperation as she flips through the passbook idly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ulp.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I patted my chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I hear that you proudly publish your date of birth on social networking sites…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stared at me like an animal trying to flee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! So that’s what you mean!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My own carelessness disgusts me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such governor security, it&#8217;s no wonder she&#8217;s been getting the rent transferred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now I have no way to reset my PIN.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this happens, I’ll reopen it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I was a little uncomfortable about her feeding me, but if she&#8217;s going to take money out of my bank book, there&#8217;s no reason for me to refuse her. She said she&#8217;d divide it 50/50, but the money isn&#8217;t colored, so I&#8217;ll just refund her deposit later.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, I need something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened my mouth with my will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, like cigarettes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She denied the request without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, alcohol?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She denies again.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, at least, gum, gummies, chocolates. Whatever, I&#8217;m the type of guy who can&#8217;t concentrate on my work if there’s nothing in my mouth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; I understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded reluctantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then placed her finger on the phone, which she had taken from her pocket.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if they&#8217;re on an online shopping site.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, of course, since it&#8217;s a personal item, I&#8217;ll pay for everything.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said without looking away from her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She again denies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Well, but it definitely pays off to know that she&#8217;s not holding me captive for money.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s for money, then there&#8217;s no need to keep me locked up as long as she has my passbook PIN number.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve heard a case in the news of a criminal who mind-controls others and exploits them by forcing them to engage in slave-like labor, but seeing how she wants to break even so much, it seems unlikely that this is the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that does deepen the question of “Why are you locking me up?” though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ordered.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl muttered and looked up from her phone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. I’m looking forward to it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nod and smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; I did what you asked.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl put her phone aside and sternly cut to the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you owe it to yourself to do me a favor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Favor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gulp and swallow my spit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What in the world does she want from me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl remained silent, and then she took off her high socks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The exposed bare feet made me nervous for a moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s nothing obscene or anything like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no way, you&#8217;re not going to tell me to lick your fingers.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jokingly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s a common development in M-rated manga, but I&#8217;m not in the mood for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; Are you an idiot?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl pulls back her body a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. But, it was a joke. So?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Foot nails.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl points to her own nails.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, you want me to draw nail art? Me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Your character.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is nail art a price of candy?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It is the same in the sense that it raises the tension.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see… But I&#8217;ve never painted nail art before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She reaches for the knife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute! It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t like it or anything, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;ve never painted nail art before, so I was just a little hesitant. I can try, but don&#8217;t get mad if I fail, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll nail you on that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t want to make a mistake on my first try at a new technique and get pissed off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No problem. It&#8217;s a nail tip.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nail tip?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fake fingernail.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl said this, walked out of the room once, and returned with a translucent acrylic box. It looks like the boxes I used to put mini 4&#215;4 parts and stuff in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a quick lecture from her, I sat on my haunches, bent over, and stared at her legs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The well-groomed nails shone like crystals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a fake nail was attached on top of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up a paintbrush like the ones used for watercolors and started coloring with polish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl raises her knife above my head and watches me closely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s as restless as an Argentinosaurus stepping on thin ice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I guess it would be easier to draw a deformed, low head than an elaborate one.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although humiliating, the process itself was surprisingly enjoyable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think I understand a little bit why so many girls want to open nail salons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without uttering a single word, I concentrated my nerves on my fingertips. Not even a scratch on her beautiful feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her ankles and fingers are so thin that they look as if they might break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Come to think of it, bare feet of a high school girl are pretty rare, aren&#8217;t they?)</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is normal to see a transparent bra in the summer, and with the stream of high school girls wearing short skirts on the streets, it is not uncommon to glimpse their thighs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But you can&#8217;t see bare feet unless you go to the ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about it, it makes me feel a little strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">……</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">……</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It smells.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t stand the agony of being silent, so I muttered a few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pulls her leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I mean, about not smelling like nail polish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Isn&#8217;t it bad for the body to do nail art in a closed space?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; !”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl suddenly kicked forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fake fingernail sticks into my forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ow!  I told you earlier that I can make mistakes.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Another matter.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl turned her head away in a huff and muttered.</span></p>
