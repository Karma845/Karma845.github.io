<h3>Confinement - Day 10</h3>

<p>*Rustling.... Chopping....*</p>

<p>(Eh ...... what is that sound?)</p>

<p>Woken up because of unsettling noises.</p>

<p>"&#$#*&$─!"</p>

<p>From the outside of the room, I hear words of unknown noises is it sound of an cars outside, I don't have clue who's making the sounds.</p>

<p>I'm little concerned about who's person doing it.</p>

<p>I quietly approached the door.</p>

<p>I want to get close to the sound so that I can hear it clearly.</p>

<p>(Oh, the chain is longer than yesterday.)</p>

<p>It seems girl adjusted it for me.</p>

<p>Until yesterday, my fingertips could not reach the door.</p>

<p>But now it is possible to put your forehead on the door.</p>

<p>(Is this a reward for drawing a manga?)</p>

<p>As I thought this, I peered through the doorway and into the kitchen.</p>

<p>She was standing in the kitchen.</p>

<p>The familiar kitchen knife is in her hand.</p>

<p>I couldn't see what she was cutting because her body was in the way.</p>

<p>She made strange noises from time to time and waved the kitchen knife carelessly.</p>

<p>There were pieces of something flying in the air.</p>

<p>I was glad I wasn't resisting when she put her knife carelessly to me..</p>

<p>If I did, even if she doesn't have that intention to hurt me, it feels like the knife will make unexpected moves, and it will probably turn out to be not a threat, but the end.</p>

<p>I left the door quietly.</p>

<p>It looks like she's practicing cooking.</p>

<p>Before my manga is created, there are several chapters of the original manga, something the reader does not need to know.</p>

<p>So likewise, she doesn't want to be seen in the painful process, right?</p>

<p>*Click.*</p>

<p>After a few minutes, she walked into the room as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>"Food."</p>

<p>Placing the tray in front of me.</p>

<p>And the same three-piece set as usual.</p>

<p>However, today's yogurt has pineapple in it.</p>

<p>(I see, So this pineapple is her guinea pig.)</p>

<p>The fruit was the sacrificed so that it'll improve her cooking skills was now being scooped up with a spoon and yogurt by me.</p>

<p>(Just adding a little of ingredients, the usual yogurt I always eating suddenly feel delicious. ー)</p>

<p>"It hurts."</p>

<p>My lips felt like they were stung by something.</p>

<p>I reflexively spit the foreign object onto the tray.</p>

<p>"...... Pineapple Spines?"</p>

<p>I looked at the thorns and whispered.</p>

<p>The yogurt now is tinted with light red color. (Note: Light red means blood.)</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>*Swishing.*</p>

<p>She silently lifted the hem of her shirt and reached into her fanny pack.</p>

<p>Then, she pushed the highest japanese money in front of me.</p>

<p>"¥10,000? Why?"</p>

<p>"Compensation."</p>

<p>She said in a serious tone.</p>

<p>"Sincerity is important, but I don't think it's right to think that everything should be solved with money." I corrected.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>She looked around for a while and took the money back.</p>

<p>"Yep. You don't need to compensate for this little thing.</p>

<p>"So, this way?"</p>

<p>The young girl suddenly put her hand on her skirt.</p>

<p>"It's not like that either."</p>

<p>I averted my eyes while stopping her from flipping her skirt.</p>

<p>Although I saw some thighs, but I did not see the fabric inside, so it was SAFE.</p>

<p>"What should I do to compensate?"</p>

<p>"You don't need to do anything. I'll just pay attention once again when I eat."</p>

<p>In order to not let the girl continue worrying about it, I said in a lighter tone and then resumed eating.</p>

<p>But she looked like she wants to compensate for something and left the room in a hurry.</p>

<p>(In that case, it's better not to expect too much from her cooking.)</p>

<p>Lowering my expectations of her cooking in my heart.</p>

<p>After that, I carefully removed the thorns while taking a few small bites to finish the rest of the food.</p>

<p>The young girl looked like she saw the right moment and went back to the room.</p>

<p>While the kitchen knife is in her right hand.</p>

<p>And then, the left hand is--</p>
