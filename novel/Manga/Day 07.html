<h3>Confinement - Day 7</h3>

<p>I feel great.</p>

<p>My body is finally back to normal.</p>

<p>I guess getting enough sleep, quitting smoking and drinking, and sticking to the healthy diet she provides? Is the result....</p>

<p>Since I got recovered, I also got back my energy to observe her.</p>

<p>However, seeing that uniform, there is no doubt that she is a female high school student. But such things as uniforms can also be bought online cosplay, but at least her uniform does not look like that cheap thing.</p>

<p>It's also possible to buy real uniforms from graduates through mobile apps, but I don't think she's that much have uniform obsession ...... </p>

<p>(By the way, that's "Sakuraba", I think. (I think it was a famous private aristocratic school nearby.)</p>

<p>I thought that as I looked at the school logo on her uniform.</p>

<p>Having neither children nor having taken the relevant exams, I didn't know much about such schools.</p>

<p>I remember hearing those middle-aged women say things like, "Haha, our family doesn't have that much money to pay for our kids to go to Sakuraba, so public school is enough."</p>

<p>Since they can say such things, I guess the tuition there is very expensive. It's really a noble school.</p>

<p>Since they can attend an aristocratic school, surely the students there don't need to earn pocket money by selling their uniforms on the online store apps?</p>

<p>(In that case, her uniform is really her own property.)</p>

<p>But isn't strange that she keep doing modeling in my manga and doesn't go to school on weekdays?</p>

<p>Don't you have to go to school? </p>

<p>Of course, there are students who skip class a lot, but she doesn't seem like that kind of person either.</p>

<p>Even she's in kitchen all the time, I still can't concentrate on my drawing. (Except for modeling.)</p>

<p>And she doesn't let me go outside either. Isn't normal to go outside the room to change pace.</p>

<p>Everytime I ask "Can I go outside?" she responds.</p>

<p>"You're in luxurious prison life right now and according to the standard of general prison life, the excrement disposal should be diapers or something like that ......"</p> 

<p>At least that's how some movies and comics are.</p>

<p>Normally, the person who's in charge of gaurding you cannot be with you every time you want to go on bathroom and there are other jobs they have to do after all. So you just have to wait until they come for you.</p>

<p>However, everytime I want to go bathroom, she always go with me, she remove the attached chain in my neck and followed me.</p>

<p>In other words, she have no intention on harming me.</p>

<p>And since she imprisoned me, my body is better than before.</p>

<p>(In that case, what is she doing here late at night? She should be going home, right?)</p>

<p>I suddenly cared about this matter.</p>

<p>Since I entered prison life, I have been living a semi-compulsory routine because she controls my diet and other rhythms.</p>

<p>The sleep cycle is very healthy, going to bed by 11pm and getting up around 7am.</p>

<p>(In other words, I always obey what she tells me to do.)</p>

<p>Go to bed earlier than usual in order to solve my doubts.</p>

<p>Then suddenly I got up around 5:00 AM.</p>

<p>"Excuse me! I need to go to the bathroom!"</p>

<p>I shouted to the outside of the house.</p>

<p>It's not that eager to go, but it's true that I want to go.</p>

<p>After a few seconds, no response.</p>

<p>Not long after, a coming busy sound of footsteps.</p>

<p>(So it's t's true that she stays in this house.) I guess I'm correct.</p>

<p>*Ka-chow.* Soon, the door opened.</p>

<p>The JK was in uniform as always. (JK means Joshik≈çsei in English means highschool girl.)</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>She rubbed her eyes sleepily and came towards me with a kitchen knife in other hand.</p>

<p>She remove the chain, and led me out of the room.</p>

<p>I took glanced at the side and a newly took off clothes is in the floor. And to it there are sleeping bags next to it.</p>

<p>"I sleep in my pajamas at night."</p>

<p>There is also an interesting design that mimics a vampire coffin.</p>

<p>Just looking at the clothes matter, she responds to it quickly.</p>

<p>She quickly moved her sleeping bag and hid her pajamas.</p>

<p>Do you embarrassed to be seen in your pajamas?</p>

<p>And school swimsuits are fine, while embarrassed at pajamas?</p>

<p>I don't understand any of her mindset.</p>

<p>"Ummm.... I'm sorry." I lower my head.</p>

<p>It was just an unintentional mention on what I saw, not an attempt to embarrassed her.</p>

<p>"It's fine." She replied rudely.</p>

<p>I got my business done quickly and flushed.</p>

<p>"--Wait a minute."</p>

<p>She took the chains back and chains me again and she also go in the toilet.</p>

<p>The toilet flushes again.</p>

<p>I don't know what she just doing. Is she already done? Quickly?</p>

<p>(So, now, I am sharing the same toilet and bathroom with JK, right? ......)</p>

<p>Although the conclusion is deduced from the fact that the young girl also lives in this house, I always feel a little embarrassed when I experience this kind scene myself.</p>

<p>*Dank.*</p>

<p>The toilet door was shaking, as if chiding me for my whims.</p>

<p>"--Come."</p>

<p>The young girl seems to be saying something.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? I can't hear you?"</p>

<p>I called back.</p>

<p>Because of the door its even harder to hear.</p>

<p>I put my hand to my ear and put my face close to the door.</p>

<p>"Bring me the toilet paper."</p>

<p>*Click* *snap.*</p>

<p>She open the toilet door half opened for a few seconds, then closed again.</p>

<p>"Ah... ah... Right.... A little more."</p>

<p>The length of the chain barely allowed me to reach the toilet paper and return to the bathroom.</p>

<p>"I've got it!"</p>

<p>I turned my back on the toilet and handed her toilet paper with my backhand.</p>

<p>*Ka-chink.*</p>

<p>Along with the slightly anxious voice of the young girl, the weight on my hands lightened.</p>

<p>Then the sound of the door closing again.</p>

<p>(Ah.... that scares me.... just a moment when the girl open the door..... I saw black underwear.</p>

<p>Is this some sort of torture?</p>

<p>By the way, did the JK notice me seeing her panties?</p>

<p>It would be too defenseless to not notice. It would be too much to despise men as creatures if they were seen on purpose. The men of the world are not all cowardly fools like me.</p>

<p>I go back to my bed and gone back to sleep. And I lost my mood to continue observing her.</p>
