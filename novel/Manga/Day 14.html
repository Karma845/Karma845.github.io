<h3>Confinement - Day 14</h3>

<p>I closed my notes app and laid down on the floor staring at the ceiling. Since yesterday I’ve been going through all my written ideas that I’ve accumulated in the past, but it seems to have been a futile attempt.</p>

<p>Now that I think about it rationally, it’s a no-brainer. First of all, all the good ideas that came up in my mind have already turned into works. Everything else I had written were useless projects that never became anything for the simple fact that they were not good enough.</p>

<p>I have to make an effort to look for new ideas. All this time I had been looking for the easy way out, I guess I have to get down and dirty again when it comes to making good ideas.</p>

<p>"It’s time for dinner."</p>

<p>The girl enters the room with a tray in her hand.</p>

<p>"Wow, it looks quite appetizing." I exclaimed with much admiration."</p>

<p>Today’s dinner was a shiny steaming portion of rice, with hamburger steak on the side, and as a garnish, demi-glace sauce.</p>

<p>It didn’t look burnt anywhere, everything seemed perfectly cooked. There were even cherry tomatoes, asparagus and sautéed carrots on the side. My stomach roared at the sight of the wonderful food in front of me.</p>

<p>I think this is the first time I’ve seen a meal this appetizing since I’ve been locked up.</p>

<p>"Enjoy."</p>

<p>I grabbed the chopsticks, then took some of the rice along with the vegetables. They were slightly mushy, but the sautéed vegetables were of even sizes, and they were moderately salty.</p>

<p>Afterwards I went for the main course, I cut the hamburger steak in half, causing the meat juices to overflow. I took some with my chopsticks, and popped it into my mouth.</p>

<p>An explosion of flavors was felt on my palate. The sweet aroma of the sauce was not an illusion, the meat was quite good, the juices had sweetness and acidity and were overall quite balanced.</p>

<p>"This food is delicious." I muttered as I put the chopsticks down on the plate.</p>

<p>"Do you really think so?"</p>

<p>"Of course. It was really delicious, I’m quite surprised that you’ve improved so much in such a short time."</p>

<p>It was inevitable to applaud the progress she was making after so much effort. She was probably thinking that she made a simple dish.</p>

<p>However, for me, this time her food was an unmistakable feast.</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>Despite the cold response, I could tell how pleased she was. For the way she was relaxing her facial muscles were reflected through the mask.</p>

<p>The fruits of her efforts were beginning to show. The bandages on her hands denote the sacrifice she has had to make to get to this point in her culinary skills.</p>

<p>If she puts in that much effort, I must do the same with my drawings, I can’t lag behind.</p>

<p>"Um, hey, there’s a book I’d like you to buy for me."</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"A picture story book."</p>

<p>If I don’t come up with ideas, I’ll have to get stimulation from somewhere.</p>

<p>"And what do you want in return?"</p>

<p>"Your manga."</p>
