<h3>Confinement - Day 18</h3>

<p>My new work was beginning to take shape, and the pages were slowly filling up with quite hilarious situations. However, when it came to the beginning and end of the story, it remained an enigma to me.</p>

<p>"It’s time for dinner."</p>

<p>Konata entered the room without even knocking on the door. And to be honest, I don’t see the need for her to continue doing so either.</p>

<p>"Wow! Did you cook Omurice? It looks delicious."</p>

<p>Acclamations came out of my mouth at the sight of the yellow semi-spherical object perched on the plate. She really went to the trouble of preparing what I asked for. Lately you can tell she’s more confident in her cooking, and every once in a while, she asks me what I want to eat.</p>

<p>I’m not very proud of this, but I particularly have tastes like a child. I don’t complicate my life. I want meals that are easy to prepare and with a lot of flavor.</p>

<p>"Today’s is a bit special." Konata expressed it with a tone that denoted pride.</p>

<p>At first glance, Omurice is a simple dish to prepare, but the truth behind it is that you need to go through an extensive learning curve before you can make such a meal. Or at least that’s how I see it, as getting the egg to completely envelop the rice takes skill.</p>

<p>She must have gone through a considerably higher effort to perform it. Proof of this is that her saucer, the egg looked particularly misshapen, while mine looked flawless. I guess he wants to look good at all costs.</p>

<p>"I can tell, I’m eager to try it. Oh! You even wrote something on the surface!"</p>

<p>On the tortilla were written the words “keep it up” with ketchup. I told you yesterday that I was having complications with my new play, so I imagine you were thinking about it during this time.</p>

<p>"Yes, I wanted to inject a motivational spell into the food."</p>

<p>"A motivational spell? Don’t tell me you’re going to do a performance like one of those maid cafe things while saying moe moe kyun!?"</p>

<p>That would certainly be a great motivational spell for me.</p>

<p>"No. It’s a magic spell out of King Solomon’s grimoire."</p>

<p>I didn’t understand anything the girl told me, but I didn’t care, since to some extent I was really motivated.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, her pajamas were skull and zombie-themed. She might be into that kind of occult-related stuff.</p>

<p>"Well, I’ll eat now before it gets cold."</p>

<p>I dipped the spoon into the omelet, the red of the ketchup combined with the rice and egg made me work up an appetite. I blew a little on the hot surface to cool, then spooned it into my mouth.</p>

<p>"How delicious, it’s the best thing I’ve tasted in a long time!" I expressed my excitement after tasting the first bite.</p>

<p>"What a relief." Konata smiled and then took a bite of her food.</p>

<p>I swallowed half a plate of the Omurice in one gulp, and dinner was accompanied by friendly banter and laughter between us.</p>

<p>"Fuuh. Thanks for the meal, now I’m even more motivated thanks to this delicious omelet you prepared for me. I think I’ll be able to continue drawing some more."</p>

<p>That spell really worked. I’m really looking forward to getting to work.</p>

<p>"Good luck." Konatana replied, as she opened her hands towards me and made a pose as if she was sending me powers from her hand.</p>

<p>"Thank you. Hey, when I’m done with my work, what do you…?"</p>

<p>I stopped my words abruptly. I almost suggested she tell me more about her private life. As soon as she told me her name, I think it would be rather inconsiderate of me to take such a step. I have to find a better way to do it, and at a better time.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>Konata was very curious to hear the rest of my words.</p>

<p>"N—No, nothing. I’ll go on with my work." I said with a wry smile.</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>She gave a small nod of her head and left the room with the dishes.</p>

<p>First, I must concentrate my attention on my work. If I am going to propose something as risky as what I was about to say, I have to prioritize my activities.</p>

<p>I am still not yet a recognized artist. I don’t have any notable work for the public to recognize me as such. If I don’t fix that, then I will never be able to have confidence in my own words.</p>
