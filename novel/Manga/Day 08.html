<h3>Confinement - Day 8</h3>

<p>The greatest life in prison is eating right?</p>

<p>Bathing is just same as eating but bathing is not something you can do everyday. So eating is the winner. </p>

<p>Of course, I was happy she buy me candy, but that's just candy.</p>

<p>But it is true that the daily staple food is delicious.</p>

<p>The food served today was the same always, trio of yogurt, jelly, and nutritious food. Best food for patients in hospital, but still a bit tiresome to eat.</p>

<p>"I'm full."</p>

<p>"Just a light meal."</p>

<p>"The menu is good for digestion, but I'm getting better now, so I'd like some food that is not the usual one. Something with a stronger flavor, something chewy or something like that.</p>

<p>She took back the tray and was about to walk out of the room when she gone back and approach me.</p>

<p>"There is no kitchenware."</p>

<p>She said as she put the tray on the floor and sat frozen in place.</p>

<p>"Indeed, I got rid of all the dishes and kitchenware before I moved." I said.</p>

<p>"This?"</p>

<p>She nodded her head ambiguously.</p>

<p>"Right, but this tray and spoon aren't my things, are they? Where did these come from?"</p>

<p>"I just took it from my house." she replied in her usual tone.</p>

<p>Are these silver dishes really hers?</br>

<p>Considering the matter with the uniform, she should have been born in a wealthy family.</p>

<p>"So, that kitchen knife too?"</p>

<p>"This kitchen knife is bought."</p>

<p>"You have a tray and a spoon in your home, but no kitchen knife?"</p>

<p>"Cooking is forbidden."</p>

<p>Her family environment seems a bit complicated.</p>

<p>"...... So you mean, since you bought a kitchen knife, You might as well buy other kitchen utensils as well. It's like buying a G-pen and buying ink and paper as well. That does feel right?"</p>

<p>I made a poor analogy, desperately trying to tell my thoughts.</p>

<p>"Want to eat my cooking?"</p>

<p>She tilted her head slightly and stared intently at me.</p>

<p>"Um.... if you can." while nodding my head</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>The young girl said coldly, standing up and walking out of the room.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry. Did I get carried away? If it's not possible, canned food or instant noodles is fine."</p>

<p>......</p>

<p>......</p>

<p>......</p>

<p>(Did I get myself carried away? ......)</p>

<p>It's already about 10 minutes since I started daydreaming.</p>

<p>The doors open again.</p>

<p>"It'll be here by tomorrow evening."</p>

<p>She stood in front of the door, while looking at her phone screen. She probably buy high set cookware online.</p>

<p>It seems that the coldness just now seems to be a cover for her shyness. (Note: DereKakushi)</p>

<p>"Thank you for accepting my request."</p>

<p>"Don't expect too much."</p>

<p>Leaving these words behind, she finished recycling the tray and left.</p>

<p>(That said, it's still something to look forward to. ...... I've never had a meal cooked by a woman other than my family.)</p>

<p>I can't help to get new pages in my daily prison life.</p>

<p>"Speaking of costs."</p>

<p>The young girl poked her head out of the doorway and said as if she remembered something.</p>

<p>"...... Ahhh, for cooking? No problem, I'll make sure I will not get my fingers cut."</p>

<p>I already do cooking in the past. I'm sure I can do better this time.</p>

<p>"No need." The young girl shook her head.</p>

<p>"So, what am I going to do?"</p>

<p>"Your manga."</p>

<p>That is her answer, her sharp gaze seemed to see right through me.</p>

<p>"No, but manga is not like copying, you can't just draw something. You see, there are a lot of things to consider, such as story, composition, etc.-"</p>

<p>"Don't talk too much."</p>

<p>The young girl interrupted my defense, peering at me through the doorway with a kitchen knife.</p>

<p>......</p>

<p>"Your manga."</p>

<p>After repeating the phrase, she closed the door.</p>

<p>(I wouldn't have to work so hard if I could just verbally draw story.)</p>

<p>While cursing my mind, I looked at the tablet.</p>

<p>I groaned as I held my head and struggled to turn around on the floor a few times, and I still unable to come up with a new story.</p>

<p>Concerning myself into the manga, I totally forgot the girl's cooking.</p>
