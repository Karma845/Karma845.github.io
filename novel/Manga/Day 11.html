<h3>Confinement - Day 11</h3>

<p>As scheduled, I continue to draw my manga.</p>

<p>At first, like yesterday, I drew some non-fiction daily life manga. But drawing one story will always be boring. So I began to consider adding fantasy and SF or Science Fiction. But the idea is not that good together.</p>

<p>Because of this, I got myself get back to my work that I almost forgot the time for dinner.</p>

<p>The time has finally come. Where the girl will reveal what she cook this time.</p>

<p>It was served with the same tray as before, with a pottery plate and fork on top.</p>

<p>She usually stays outside the room while I eat.</p>

<p>But, today she sat in front of the cardboard box, staring at me with absorbed expectation.</p>

<p>I understand how she feels.</p>

<p>It must be the same feeling when the time I waited for her to comment on my first manga work.</p>

<p>I stared at her cooking and starts to inspect it.</p>

<p>(This is.... Um what should I say..... Is this japanese food or foreign food?)</p>

<p>How will I say this to her?</p>

<p>Overall, the main course is two baked pancakes.</p>

<p>However, it was so burnt that for a moment I thought it was baked rice.</p>

<p>A side dish that looks like something like scrambled eggs.</p>

<p>There is a reason why I don't know where did this food come from. Firstly.</p>

<p>The scrambled eggs are covered with a tomato sauce that could be mistaken for a murder scene.</p>

<p>I can't even tell what is the sauce in this course. Is it the tomato or the scrambled egg?</p>

<p>If it is normal to make a scrambled egg, it should not be like this.</p>

<p>I've tried to make omelettes rice before, but I failed and ended up spreading a bunch of ketchup to cover up my failures.</p>

<p>That's probably how she also try to cover up her failures.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the apple for dessert. And there is no doubt that it is an apple.</p>

<p>Normally apple's is shape like an rabbit but now it looks like piranha.</p>

<p>I guess it was intended to look like a rabbit, but the actual product was not like that.</p>

<p>Even if it's a rabbit, it's still a zombie rabbit.</p>

<p>The plates brand-name is pottery from England or probably somewhere, so the two look even worse together.</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>"I'll eat now."</p>

<p>I reached for my fork and the young girl stopped me.</p>

<p>"Are you going to feed me? I'm not a child anymore......"</p>

<p>"It's my duty as the chef."</p>

<p>The young girl said, grabbing my fork.</p>

<p>The girl stabbed a piece of pancake in one fork and started to bought it in my mouth </p>

<p>Frankly, probably it's even better than pancake bought in store, but of course let's not expect.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I'm counting on you."</p>

<p>I opened my mouth.</p>

<p>The young lady grabbed my chin with her left hand and shoved the pancake into my mouth.</p>

<p>...... Is it sweet or salty?</p>

<p>No, it's a bit too salty.</p>

<p>However, if you treat it as a dessert, it is not recommended.</p>

<p>"---and here's the egg."</p>

<p>She said while pointing the scrambled eggs into my mouth.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, the name of the dish should be scrambled eggs, but it would be rude to her to say it's wrong. So I chose to say the 100% correct egg.</p>

<p>"It's good."</p>

<p>The young lady put the scrambled eggs (presumably) on the fork and shoved them into my mouth again.</p>

<p>If you want to ask whether there is a taste, there is, I think...</p>

<p>After all, the tomato sauce itself is a delicious seasoning, so the overall quality of the dish is barely palatable, regardless of how well the eggs are made undercooked.</p>

<p>Some eggshells were mixed in, but that's nothing compared to the pineapple thorns.</p>

<p>The rest were dessert apples, which she grabbed with her hands and shoved into my mouth.</p>

<p>There is nothing to say about the taste.</p>

<p>It's just plain apple flavor. Normally eaten by other people.</p>

<p>I finish eating safely without incident.</p>

<p>The overall rating of the dishes cooked by the young girl is──</p>

<p>"It was delicious."</p>

<p>I muttered to myself as if I were talking to myself.</p>

<p>I tried to put poker face as much as I could and worried that she might tell if she notice it.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was delicious. Thanks for the hospitality."</p>

<p>She stared at me intently, as I praised her again and after finishing my meal.</p>

<p>If you judge her casually, you will make her feel that cooking is meaningless.</p>

<p>In fact, I think it's not bad to be able to cook like this for the first time.</p>

<p>It's just that if it's she cook like this every day, she will probably improve. However, compared to yesterday's pineapple, there is indeed an improvement.</p>

<p>"It's just a light meal."</p>

<p>Along with the usual expression, the young girl wiped the ketchup from my lips with her index finger. </p>

<p>Then, she pull her mask out slitting a little, and licked her fingertips.</p>

<p>I was humiliated to be treated like a child, but in that moment I was so focus on her face. And she's extraordinarily beautiful.</p>

<p>The young lady stood up with the tray as if nothing had happened and turned away.</p>

<p>"Ahhh. I haven't finished my manga yet....."</p>

<p>I said with a slight apology.</p>

<p>"No need to repeat it, I already see it."</p>

<p>The young lady turned her back on me and said calmly.</p>

<p>Contrary to her tone of voice, and her footsteps seem to be very brisk.</p>
