<h3>Afterwords.</h3>

<p>First time readers, Not first time readers, how are you? it's been a long time. I'm Hiroshi.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for reading "The Story of a Manga Artist Who Was Imprisoned by a Strange Highschool Girl."</p>

<p>As many of you know, this work is based on the illustrations of  Kitada Ryouma-sensei posted on social media. As one of his readers, I thought that this amazing work would soon get advertise commercially. But I never dreamed that I would be responsible for adapting this work into a novel.</p>

<p>It is said that the manga version drawn by Kitada Ryouma-sensei will also be released recently. However, this work is the first to be released at the same time, which makes me feel very responsible and honored by it.</p>

<p>For me, I will do my best to show the charm of our amazing heroine. I would be very happy if I could convey my thoughts to you readers.</p>

<p>Then, let me first express my gratitude to all the people involved in this series.</p>

<p>First of all, I would like to express my deep gratitude to  Kitada Ryouma-sensei who is both the original author and the illustrator of this work. I can say that this work would not have been possible without Kita Dariyoma-sensei. If it were normal, I would have exhausted my vocabulary to explain the beauty of the illustrations, but only this time I will not say anything. Please "appreciate" this aspect of the cover. The illustration speaks more eloquently than my humble praise.</p>

<p>Then, I would like to thank Mr. Bessan, who was responsible for editing. Mr. Bessan selected me from many writers to edit this excellent work. In addition, he gave me precise and concise corrections for the immature work, which contributed to the completion of this work. I would like to ask for your guidance in the future.</p>

<p>Finally, to everyone who has participated in this work, and to you who have read this far, I offer my heartfelt thanks. </p>

<p>So, if there's another volume, I'll see you next time, but I'll take my leave now.</p>
