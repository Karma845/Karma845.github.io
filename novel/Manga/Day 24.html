<h3>Confinement - Day 24</h3>

<p>Can't think of any ideas.</p>

<p>Even if I think a qoute that will show my cleverness, I can't think an idea that will not come up with my mind.</p>

<p>I put down my pen and silently started to do squats.</p>

<p>(Because the pornographer says "hand over the most erotic person on earth or the whole planet will be blown up", the main character is chosen as the representative of earth. Using his natural delusional power to solve the problem posed by the pornographer - it's okay up to here, the problem is the climax. The final trial is "to the pornographer in heat". However, the key final boss, the porn star, looks so ugly that even the troubled protagonist will be shocked by the degree. With a direct look will make SAN value into a crisis of the appearance of the evil god, there is a disgusting smell of rotten. (How to let the main character break through this deadlock ......) (TL: Synopsis of his manga..... Probably.)</p>

<p>While sitting on the sit-ups, I was troubled.</p>

<p>(The truth is manga is not smooth as exercising. In exercising, you can do it like an habit but for manga, it's not.)</p>

<p>But If I didn't get imprisoned, my manga probably will not created.</p>

<p>Before, I just waste my time on manga or playing games. If I got hungry I'll just go to the nearby convenience store and get something I can eat.</p>

<p>I don't exercise or do any sports because I hate them.</p>

<p>Right now, I can do all of them like it's just breathing technique.</p>

<p>"Food."</p>

<p>This time around, the girl always came with a lunch.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. What a healthy lunch today."</p>

<p>I stopped exercising and sat on the floor.</p>

<p>Basmati rice, calcium-rich salted sardine skewers, spinach, and a clear soup vegetables.</p>

<p>It's like design menu for athletes.</p>

<p>"Because the calories in yesterday's dinner were little too high."</p>

<p>The girl put the tray on the cardboard box and tilted it's head thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"The pork chops dinner yesterday did have high calories, but it was good. Creating light meal today is better."</p>

<p>"That's good. Eat well, it's good for digestion."</p>

<p>"That's true"</p>

<p>After I finished the food, I drank the tea that the girl made, and started to draw again in my tablet.</p>

<p>However, I still can't come up with any ideas.</p>

<p>A month ago. Everytime I think about word "manga". It was huge annoyance and hatred to me.</p>

<p>But now I almost finished it, even I hit bottleneck, it's still miracle for me to draw this much so far.</p>

<p>After all, it was all thanks to the girl.</p>

<p>(What if I were alone? Could I even come to this far?)</p>

<p>No, I can't.</p>

<p>Although, I move because I want to escape from everything, just living alone only indulge me to alcohol and cigarettes.</p>

<p>If the girl didn't come to me, I'll just probably eating convenience store food and probably less healthier now.</p>

<p>Not only on physically but also on mentally. I'm probably happier to be imprisoned. After all, this way I can do my everyday activities.</p>

<p>Since I am in an environment without internet, I will not be distracted during my work.</p>

<p>Since no one will distract me, I can face my manga without problem.</p>

<p>Of course, even if I create an excuses to go outside, I still can't. Because of the girl.</p>

<p>(I wonder why I have so much respect for the girl even though she imprisoned me without permission? Weird.....)</p>

<p>Imprisonment is a very good crime.</p>

<p>But for normal citizen, he/she will not probably forgive the person, I fully understand that reasoning. But right now I'm not lying that I am filled with gratitude for the girl.</p>

<p>"I said."</p>

<p>The party poured tea into a cup while making conversation.</p>

<p>"W-What?"</p>

<p>I pulled my consciousness back to reality.</p>

<p>Since I was thinking about the girl, I suddenly got flustered.</p>

<p>"If you have time, can you shave your beard? I've been concerned about it since before."</p>

<p>The girl said while pointing my face.</p>

<p>"A beard? Ahhh, right, I haven't shaved."</p>

<p>I stroked my stubbled chin.</p>

<p>Actually, I haven't shaved since I was imprisoned.</p>

<p>To others, I look like a untidy now.</p>

<p>However, it's not usual to shave your beard, unless you have reason to shave it, like going to wedding. I guess my looks don't look good with JK in home.</p>

<p>"If you're busy, you don't have to do it right away." while carefully tidying up the dishes.</p>

<p>I drained my tea and said. "No, it's fine now. Think of it as a change of mood."</p>

<p>"I'll get some tools then."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>And the girl came out on the room.</p>

<p>"Thanks....... for the wait."</p>

<p>She returned to the room with a hot towel and shaving cream in her left hand and a razor in right.</p>

<p>At first glance, it looks like a very normal shaving set - but...</p>

<p>"Do you use that to shave? Is that okay? It will be painful if you get a mistake, you know."</p>

<p>The girl use a razor that don't have protective function into it.</p>

<p>It's the type with the exposed blade that barbershop uncle's often used.</p>

<p>"Used to it."</p>

<p>The girl said with a deep smile.</p>

<p>"Is that so..."</p>

<p>(She's obviously not good at handling knife. Is razor even possible?)</p>

<p>I have such a doubt. Well girls also do have problems in the body hair as well.</p>

<p>"So, let's get started."</p>

<p>"Please have mercy."</p>

<p>The girl place a hot towel around my mouth. And she aded shaving cream that is rather feel itchy.</p>

<p>"Unbelievable." The girl muttered while the blade strokes my beard.</p>

<p>The cold temperature of the blade and the hot towel kinda creates unique sense of comfort.</p>

<p>"Eh? What? What?"</p>

<p>I can't help myself to asked with a slugged voice because the girl breast is hitting my head.</p>

<p>Because of the soft sensation, It's impossible for me to concentrate on my words.</p>

<p>"Everyone has hair in their body but there are some part that has to be eliminated. Everyone says "You should take care of your own body." but hair excluded, too bad."</p>

<p>After the razor shaved the hair around my lips. The shave my chin next.</p>

<p>Apparently the girl's eyes is sharp as knife when the topic grasp her interest.</p>

<p>I don't know where did she got that talent but she's really unique a person.</p>

<p>I am a normal person in terms of sensibility, although I have talent in art stuff topic, I am rather envious that the girl has such that focus.</p>

<p>"Even in that sense, the beard is rather lucky because they are usually left because they are fashionable."</p>

<p>"I see.... Half hearted choices sometimes do feel cruel." The girl said with dry smile.</p>

<p>My brain is currently feeling warmth of happiness. Maybe because the girl is so close to me right now.</p>

<p>Her chin sometimes do swivel my hair while her voice feels like kinda electric effect into that shivers my entire body.</p>

<p>"I see... you can still think like that." I said, pretending to have a good point.</p>

<p>"...... Sometimes, I feel like I'm not quite sure. Where is my own and where does it start to be not my own. When are the hair and nails that are cut off is considered to be mine? Or It's not mine when I cut it off? Or is it the moment when I throw away in trash Or when it get burnt?"</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I'm clueless in that kind of knowledge. I don't know much about such difficult things like philosophy." I confessed.</p>

<p>Even if I wanted to pretend I understand,  I'm an idiot anyway, So I'll be exposed soon.</p>

<p>So it's better to not show off.</p>

<p>"Hoo-hoo, I like the way when you're honest in this kind of topic." The voice of the kinda soft and quickly.</p>

<p>"Am I being treated like an idiot?"</p>

<p>"I'm not treating you like an idiot. Rather, I'm complimenting you."</p>

<p>*Rustle, rustle, rustle.*</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The sound of the razor only echoes in the room.</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of the razor, what came to my mind was the image of the deep sea that I had seen on TV some time ago.</p>
