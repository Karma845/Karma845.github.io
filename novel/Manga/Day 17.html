<h3>Confinement - Day 17</h3>

<p>I guess after all, the important thing for a good coexistence between people is to have excellent communication. I have felt freer since Konata and I started talking.</p>

<p>Proof of this is that she is less and less seen with a knife in her hand. Not even when she takes me to the bathroom. Although sometimes she tries to pretend, she does, but she’s so bad at faking it that it’s noticeable to the naked eye.</p>

<p>I don’t know if she’s just letting her guard down about our new coexistence, or if she’s starting to trust me more and more.</p>

<p>As much as I try to see a bad side to it, I refuse to believe that this is some sort of trap to study my reaction to a possible opportunity to escape. I even feel more alarmed than before. But anyway, the fear of dying that I had ingrained deep inside me has diminished drastically.</p>

<p>I had a more important problem to attend to, though, and that was the manga gag I had to draw. Making a chapter is not an easy thing to do, let alone overnight.</p>

<p>I was thinking about what to do as I sat in front of the tablet. I was involved in an inhospitable terrain of which I was unfamiliar.</p>

<p>The design of the characters for this type of work is quite… Peculiar. They do not carry a drawing aesthetic like what we can see in other genres such as shonen, shoujo, or Seinen. Instead, they have a particularly ugly aesthetic.</p>

<p>And this is where I find myself cornered between four walls, since drawing ugly characters on purpose is very complicated. If the layout of the frames is done in the same way as a normal manga, the movements will become cute and boring due to the design of the characters themselves.</p>

<p>I have no choice but to vary the drawing techniques I normally use. I’ve always drawn in a rather theoretical way, and that has led me to go through trial-and-error situations.</p>

<p>Some of it is very frustrating, but fun. It reminds me of the feeling I had when I was drawing strenuously for a novice artist contest.</p>

<p>"Yes?" I asked at the unexpected knock on the door from the other side.</p>

<p>"I have prepared iced tea. You suffering from heat stroke is very dangerous."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks."</p>

<p>I stopped what I was doing and turned to her; in turn, she held out her hand with the iced tea. It was very hot today, and the humidity was on par.</p>

<p>"How are you doing with your work?" she asked as she sat across from me and glanced at the tablet screen.</p>

<p>"Not so good, I’m trying out a new style of drawing for my new work, but it’s proving to be somewhat frustrating." I proceeded to take a sip of iced tea.</p>

<p>Feeling the coolness of the tea sliding down my throat was somewhat pleasant.</p>

<p>It’s kind of embarrassing for me to say this out loud, no one is proud to say that they are failing at something they put a great deal of time into.</p>

<p>"…You can use me in your play, if you want."</p>

<p>"Hahahaha. Are you serious?"</p>

<p>Her comment left me perplexed and nervous. What I’m trying to do is a play focused on laughter and absurdity. Something very different from what I’m experiencing with it, which is more like a horror story.</p>

<p>Coining it under the term ‘non-fiction’ might be possible, but a story about a mangaka who was kidnapped by a high school girl is so unrealistic that it’s bound to be dismissed.</p>

<p>First of all, if I did a story about us and the manga became very successful, we would be in big trouble. We run the risk that a reporter from a major newspaper or television station will run a story about it with a flashy and controversial headline questioning whether the story is based on a real-life situation rather than just fiction.</p>

<p>"Yes." Konata answered bluntly and then took a sip of her iced tea.</p>

<p>"I’m sorry. Don’t be mad at me, but I have to decline that offer. I’m trying to make a manga gag now, so a story about a JK doesn’t fit the concept very well. But thanks for coming up with ideas."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>Come to think of it. It’s been a long time since I’ve laughed. I hadn’t been able to since the day I was locked up here. I hadn’t been able to realize it until now. I think conversing with Konata has made a lot of changes in me.</p>

<p>I hope this will also transfer to creativity for good ideas for future works.</p>

<p>"Konata. I’m not going to make a story out of this, but thanks to you, I’m going to be able to move forward with my work." I smiled after saying those words.</p>

<p>"..?"</p>

<p>She tilted her head in curiosity without understanding what I was referring to.</p>
