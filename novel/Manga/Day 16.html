<h3>Confinement Day 16</h3>

<p>It’s a new day, and today I’m focused on working on a manga gag inspired by the notes I took yesterday. Considering the genre on which the story will be based, short chapters instead of long plots would be appropriate.</p>

<p>Eventually, the girl enters the room with a tray, it was time for lunch. Today’s menu was Japanese food. Rice, miso soup with eggplant, and grilled fish.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, she sat down across from me, and proceeded to eat. It seems that eating together will be a common thing between us from now on.</p>

<p>Watching her taste her food, I was a little surprised to witness her wonderful use of chopsticks, details like this hint that this is not just anyone. I even felt a little embarrassed.</p>

<p>I have to do my best to be able to strike up a conversation with her. But because of my nervousness, I had forgotten the question for the first topic of conversation I had already planned in my head.</p>

<p>I put the chopsticks down on the chopstick rest and with great courage opened my mouth.</p>

<p>"Hmm?"</p>

<p>"Umm, hey, is it okay for you if you tell me your name? It just doesn’t feel right for me not to address you in the right way, it feels weird."</p>

<p>It’s been over half a month since I started living in captivity with her. And yet, I still don’t know anything about her. I should at least know her name.</p>

<p>"Konata. In Kanji the meaning is ‘here’."</p>

<p>My body stiffened as I tried to pull the bones out of the fish. After a while of silence, I spoke again.</p>

<p>"I see, my name is…"</p>

<p>"I know."</p>

<p>"Oh? Really? My real name?"</p>

<p>I was perplexed at such a statement.</p>

<p>"Of course." She replied as she nodded her head vigorously.</p>

<p>"I—I see. After all, you had possession of my tablet, my phone, and even my bank PIN. It was obvious that you might already know what my true identity was."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Konata answered cautiously, and then continued to focus on her food. But at that moment I remembered something.</p>

<p>"Although… On my tablet my real name is nowhere to be found. I only use the pseudonym with which I represent myself on social networks. And my phone uses a pattern lock, not a pin…"</p>

<p>My thoughts filtered through my mouth. I was struggling to find a correlation between one thing and the other. There were still loose ends that I wasn’t entirely convinced about.</p>

<p>"Your wallet. I only had to look at your driver’s license or insurance card to find that information."</p>

<p>Her answer was so obvious that I felt kind of silly for not having thought of it sooner. But…</p>

<p>"And I already knew that before you passed out."</p>

<p>However, what she went on to say was even more surprising. So, does it mean that she already knew perfectly well who I was?</p>

<p>"Oh, right. You knew when you were in line and I dropped my phone without realizing it. I had also said my name out loud when the store clerk didn’t know how to spell my name."</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>Konata smiled vaguely and began to pick up the grains of rice left on her plate.</p>

<p>"Still, how could you come up with my birthday? It’s not like I made it public… Or did I?"</p>

<p>But, now that I think about it more calmly, I probably did do it unconsciously. Not directly. But if the girl was smart, she probably found a certain pattern among my posts, or I just missed a photo of a birthday cake.</p>

<p>"You’re wrong, actually… I am a fan." She said with an embarrassed expression.</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have every volume of your work."</p>

<p>"Amazing."</p>

<p>"Even with bonus content that you’ve published."</p>

<p>"I see… That makes me very happy."</p>

<p>A big smile formed on my face. And my words of gratitude came from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>I have received many comments like that from my fans on social media. But this is the first time I have met one in person.</p>

<p>I’ve been approached on occasion to sign autographs of my works in bookstores, but I’m not the kind of artist who likes that sort of thing.</p>

<p>And in the face of all these unexpected developments. I was missing an important topic to discuss. If this girl is a fan of my work, why is she holding me hostage?</p>

<p>Although I was very intrigued to get out of this doubt, I decided to keep it to myself, as I ran the risk of ruining the good mood I was in.</p>
