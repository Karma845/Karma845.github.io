<h3>Confinement - Day 4</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Alas, I didn&#8217;t finish drawing her by yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t plan to be that detailed at first, but as I kept drawing her, I ended up paying attention to every detail, which took a long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why I continued to draw her today as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl never gets tired of posing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m good since I&#8217;m working with my hands, but I&#8217;m worried that she&#8217;ll just sit there and get bored. But she never complained, even though she didn&#8217;t get anything at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, about an hour after eating lunchーthe regular jelly-yogurt-supplement mealーthe drawing was finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Finally!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put down my pen and stretched out my arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On all fours, she reaches me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I averted my sight after catching a peek of her cleavage through the gap in her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How is it? I tried to draw you like you said…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I half-turned the LCD tab and turned it in her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I drew it since it was something I had to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the fact that I had been staring at a high school girl for over half a day made me feel embarrassed, so I blamed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(If she gave me a poor evaluation, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to look at her.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was anxious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t believe I did a poor job, but I wasn&#8217;t sure how others would react to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She fixed her gaze on the LCD tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was so short on time that I couldn&#8217;t even make a cup of noodles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few vexing minutes passed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, she looked at me and opened her mouth, and her first words were…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take off your clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Why?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unexpected words surprised me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it possible that I offended her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was the drawing not good enough?</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knew that my work would never reach anyone&#8217;s heart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, even if I did, what would I do once I am naked?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not going to be simple for me to take off my clothing if you want me to. I&#8217;m trapped on a chain, as you know.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pushed aside my internal conflict and voiced such an obvious concern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Okay, then…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl places the knife in her left hand and pulls the key from her blazer&#8217;s breast pocket with her right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She reached for the collar with her other hand while holding the knife out to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ーーNow you can take it off, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I easily removed the chains from me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I removed the shirt I was wearing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On second thought, I had been wearing the same clothes for several days.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The temperature was just ideal this time of year, halfway between spring and summer, so I shouldn&#8217;t be sweating so much. But I have to add that it&#8217;s a dirty dress to be wearing in front of a high school girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The lower also.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She demanded mercilessly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The lower?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I obediently obeyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First the jeans, and then the underwear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nonetheless, in a desperate last-ditch attempt, I covered my crotch with my hands and defended it to the death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl turned to face me and began walking backwards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I left the room, she got behind me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pushed me into the bathroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(What? Are you planning to murder and dismember me in the bathroom?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a dreadful sight flashed across my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go in.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, in the bathtub? Are you sure?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was apparently overthinking things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I entered the bathroom and shut the door obediently.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the room, there was shampoo and body soap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body was sticky, and my head was itching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, I was honestly grateful to be able to take a bath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn on the shower.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard the sound of clothes rustling from the changing room at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Eh? This isーー)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bathroom door squeaked open before I could gather my thoughts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl&#8217;s image reflected in the bathroom mirror.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Needless to say, unlike me, she wasn&#8217;t entirely naked; she was dressed in a school swimsuit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Obviously, she&#8217;s wearing a mask and holding a knife in her right hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not the typical one-piece school swimsuit seen in mangas, but rather a separate type with a separate top and bottom. If you changed the gym uniform to a swimsuit material and chopped the sleeves off at the shoulders, it would be easy to understand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I thought it was the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(That’s an ant.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">School swimsuits in the past were probably more provocative, but the current style, with its wildness, is also nice since it underlines teenagers&#8217; simplicity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From the head? From the body?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe she&#8217;s asking about the order of washing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, I can wash it myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s okay.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not sure what to make of that, but she&#8217;s dead set on washing me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umm, then, from the head.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t want to get stabbed, and I didn&#8217;t want to offend her and forfeit my right to bath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Then, close your eyes.”</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/D5wy5d3/Screenshot-378.png"></img>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I did as told and closed my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard a thud, like something being put down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Maybe it&#8217;s the knife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl&#8217;s fingers rubbed my scalp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her hands seemed pretty awkward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the fact that she isn&#8217;t as good as the professional barbers I attend to every day doesn&#8217;t help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially still, she appears to be clumsy, even given the circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sometimes she puts too much pressure on it, which hurts, but I&#8217;m not complaining.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Could this be a reward for my drawing?).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, then my drawing convinced her.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If so, I&#8217;m honestly happy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pleasant sensation of a hot shower, together with the shampoo, cleans the dirt from my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I open my eyes again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next is the body.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, okay, so just the top half. I&#8217;ll do the bottom myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I insist in a firm voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even as a prisoner of war, there is a line that I wanted to protect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230; I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She mumbled, a little dissatisfied for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She eventually went out of the bathroom after I finished washing myself and soaking in the bathtub.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hear a huge motor noise coming from the changing room a little time later.</span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Whirr, whirr, whirr.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Is she washing my clothes? But, was there a washing machine? I tossed away the last one I had, so did she buy it? If that&#8217;s the case, where’s the money coming from?)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought and thought, but no answer came.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(I mean, come to think of it, this is the first time a girl outside of my family has seen me naked. That is a really unusual case…)</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can feel my cheeks turn red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if it was because I was sitting in the tub, if I was sick again, orーー</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeatedly splashed the hot water on my face with both hands, as if to shake off the myriad imaginations that come and go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got out of the bathtub when my body was warm enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened the door after softly sweeping away the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ーーAhh! You’re still here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl was standing silently, and I hurriedly covered my crotch with my hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Quickly change your clothes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl tosses me the clothing that was in her arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, thank god… Wait, what the hell is this…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I received them and unfolded them, I was in awe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bath towels, shirts, pants, and underwear, all with characters from my work printed on them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s why, change into a bath towel.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not what I meant…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A manga artist who uses a skin-colored bath towel of his own heroine to clean his body, wears mascot-patterned pants, and uses a T-shirt printed with the hero and pants of a rival character as sleepwear.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really hate it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s very narcissistic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“? It should be the right size.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl tilts her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about the other clothes? I&#8217;ll take anything that doesn&#8217;t have my character printed on it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no such thing here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl answered immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bit her back teeth and wiped herself with a bath towel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was prepared for any physical abuse, but I didn&#8217;t expect such a psychological humiliation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was quite embarrassing, but it didn&#8217;t matter because I had no other clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(Yeah, damn it. It may be annoying, but it doesn&#8217;t make much a difference to the function of the clothing.)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what I told myself as I hastily put on my clothes.</span></p>
