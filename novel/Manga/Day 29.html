<h3>Confinement - Day 29</h3>

<p>When I woke up, the girl is already gone.</p>

<p>(Where did she go?) For a moment, my eyes tried to find her figure.</p>

<p>(I guess she's gone back her home. After all, I turn her down.) shooking my head.</p>

<p>I extremely regret it. After daydreaming for a moment, I wash my face in the bathroom and her toothbrush is gone. The cup she's also using is gone.</p>

<p>(Did she take all her personality belongings?)</p>

<p>Not only the cup, the tray, sleeping bags, and the knife is also gone. I mean all of the traces of the girl came here as proof is gone.</p>

<p>Of course only her personal belongings are gone not mine.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room, there I put my backpack, which still had my notebook, computer, passbook and other valuables.</p>

<p>(The room was clean throughout every corner, it's almost like the girl didn't exist here at all. Or it's just all my delusions?)</p>

<p>The disappearance was clean in perfection that I couldn't help to get doubt about her existence.</p>

<p>(Nope, not a chance. Even if I lost my mind, it's still rude to just doubt she didn't exist at all.)</p>

<p>I just shake my wet hands and my rude thoughts and I just laughed it off.</p>

<p>I walked on the entrance and planning to go on convenience store to eat. When I was about to put my shoes on, I noticed something.</p>

<p>(Wait. Since a lot happened recently it's not impossible. Can I just really laugh this issue? But if this is really delusions, then a lot of things might make sense.)</p>

<p>A JK fan suddenly come here, took care of me, and support my manga? Is that kind of coincidence really happened in reality? It would be normally say as delusions right?</p>

<p>(But if it's really delusions, why do I have to delusions a JK with a knife and have to imprisoned me? A cat maid would be more reasonable as delusions right?) I thought about it while walking outside.</p>

<p>(I wonder if this is affect of mental issue.)</p>

<p>About a month ago, my brain became quite abnormal. I was aware of it myself, and I even said it euphemistically to my editor.</p>

<p>The mental problem of not being able to draw anything and even have to get threatened by a JK with knife and even to imprisoned me.</p>

<p>When I think about it, it all make sense.</p>

<p>(Wait, the girl just bought washing machine and refrigerator here and those things should be still there.) I suddenly gone back to room.</p>

<p>I open the door of the fridge and there are basically no ingredients inside.</p>

<p>(Right, the bills. The girl said "our account" but it was actually mine there should be nominal evidence there.)</p>

<p>In other words, there is no objective evidence to prove that I did not order the appliances myself.</p>

<p>(If she bought it on store, the clerk might remember her face, but I dont know where store she went. Also the other purchases was bought online.)</p>

<p>I also do not know anyone other than me who can prove her existence. I have never even seen the girl come into contact with anyone other than me.</p>

<p>(If I go to the school and ask— no, schools don't give out information about students to strangers, they'll think I'm just suspicious guy.)</p>

<p>I clenched my fist, and banged it on the door of the refrigerator.</p>

<p>"That hurt."</p>

<p>No doubt, this is the reality.</p>

<p>Since the girl is just my delusional, the praised she just made to my work is probably my own delusions also. No wonder it was rejected.</p>

<p>I gone back to the bedroom and turn on the tablet. The manga was so bad that I have to re-examine it.</p>

<p>Remembering the memories in my original manga. I don't want to accept, that the girl was just my delusions.</p>

<p>(If the girl was just my delusions, that means I cannot see her again right?)</p>

<p>The worst future I don't want to imagine, swift throughout my mind.</p>

<p>My heart felt like a ice that stopped for a moment. It is impossible to see the girl anymore.</p>

<p>I hate this.</p>

<p>I definitely hate this.</p>

<p>Even if she is just an illusion I created, I still want to see her.</p>

<p>(——Why do I want to see her? Why do I cling to her so much? To say thank you? Or, to apologize to her?)</p>

<p>No, it's not. If it's to thank her for her help in my selfishness, I've already done that several times.</p>

<p>If I want to apologize, I shouldn't have thank her in the past.</p>

<p>I'm sorry, but I actually...</p>

<p>(Unknowingly, the girl occupied something important place in my heart.)</p>

<p>I've noticed. The most realistic feelings I'm currently feeling right now.</p>

<p><strong>That I just want to convey this feeling to her.</strong></p>

<p>I feel something vibrating in my pocket, the phone is ringing.</p>

<p>(SNS or DM?) opening the phone.</p>

<p>The sender's account name was blank.</p>

<p>There are only two words in the main text and one selfie attached into it.</p>

<p>"I'm late."</p>

<p>It was probably shot in a hurry, and the photo was only up to the mask below, and also some blur.</p>

<p>But I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>(It's the girl! It's not just my delusional.) I suddenly got settled down.</p>

<p>"HAHAHAHAHA, that side.... Great. You're on school now." I laughed and looked up at the ceiling. I am happy from the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>I'm even happier now than when I first received my serialization as manga artist.</p>

<p>(Oh, right. I have to reply now and tell my feelings right now.)</p>

<p>My fingers slid anxiously over and over on the screen, stammering out some words.</p>

<p>Just like that, I was about to click the send button but, my index finger stopped 1mm away from the screen.</p>

<p>(Is this already good enough? The girl gather her courage to go on school while me, sending random message and done with it?)</p>

<p>Nope, this is not enough yet. I'm not a novelist nor a poet creator after all.</p>

<p>Just a manga artist.</p>
