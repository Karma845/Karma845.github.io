<h3>Confinement - Day 21</h3>

<p>"What's your favorite dish?"</p>

<p>She suddenly asked while eating pasta.</p>

<p>"Big Mac."</p>

<p>I already understand that she wants to cook my favorite food. But since it was so sudden. I can't help to make impossible reply.</p>

<p>I think she already got tired, thinking what she wants to cook. That is why she asked me.</p>

<p>Since she's only beginner in cooking she probably don't have any idea on what food I want.</p>

<p>But first, let see her expression first.</p>

<p>"...... I'm going to place an order."</p>

<p>"No it justâ€”"</p>

<p>Before I finished the words "joke." The girl stood up expressionlessly.</p>

<p>It's already half hour since she give me the meal and the girl still didn't come back.</p>

<p>Obviously, she was upset.</p>

<p>Did I make an expression that I didn't like her cooking?</p>

<p>But I probably did it unconsciously. Sigh....</p>

<p>(I did something unnecessary...)</p>

<p>I finished my meal in a hurry while regretting it.</p>

<p>Looking at the tablet, I wanted to continue to finish the original draft, but I just got no mood to get into it.</p>

<p>In order to change my mood, I tried to do muscle exercises and cleaning the room, and the time passed unnoticed.</p>

<p>*Ding-dong!*</p>

<p>While I was repeating the action of erasing and redrawing the lines, the sound of the doorbell came.</p>

<p>I was startled.</p>

<p>(......Who is it? Is she came back?)</p>

<p>After thinking about it for a while, I suddenly thought she must be it.</p>

<p>And as expected, the door opened.</p>

<p>"Dinner."</p>

<p>The girl said coldly.</p>

<p>*Dang!* The tray was thrown hard to the floor.</p>

<p>On top is a chicken and fries combo.</p>

<p>Also the nostalgic food I wanted to eat, revived.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>The girl walked out of the room, and then returned to the room with another tray.</p>

<p>She sat across from me as usual.</p>

<p>But now she sat sideways across her body, and I could really feel her protesting.</p>

<p>I took a big bite on the fried chicken.</p>

<p>Quite delicious. At least it is something you love to eat everyday.</p>

<p>Not many home cooking can produce the taste of junk food that directly satisfies every person's appetite.</p>

<p>However, I feel sorry for the girl, so I try to put on an expressionless face, so that she will not notice it.</p>

<p>"--- Mmm. That's it, that's the smell."</p>

<p>I entrusted it to her, so I at least wanted to try to please her, but after all, I couldn't say it wasn't good, so it turned out a subtle expression.</p>

<p>"..."</p>

<p>And the girl gotten upset more and turn herself 90 degrees and completely turned her back to me.</p>

<p>"I think it's also good idea if I eat this kind of food once in a while, but it's still not as good as when someone's cooking.</p>

<p>I mumbled in a tone that sounded quite deliberate.</p>

<p>"Don't worry about it."</p>

<p>She said, as if she was squirming.</p>

<p>However, she turned her body back 90 degrees and returned to a side-sitting position again.</p>

<p>I guess I'll give her one more push.</p>

<p>"No, no, really. I'd like to eat some of
your cooking tomorrow. Look, like curry or fried rice something like that.</p>

<p>With that said, I've listed some dishes that are easier for beginners to make.</p>

<p>"I've heard recently that fast food seems to be quite good too."</p>

<p>As she stuffed her mouth with fries and puffed out her cheeks like a squirrel.</p>

<p>Normally, the table manners of the girl is very elegant, however now, I know that she's doing it on purpose.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, I was just going to make a joke. I have no complaints about your meal here." I honestly explained.</p>

<p>"I'll forgive you if you draw me."</p>

<p>She simply turned to face me and sipped her drink through a straw.</p>

<p>"I can draw you, but isn't still the same if draw you again?"</p>

<p>Sketching her has become my daily lesson after all.</p>

<p>"If that's the case, can I color it?"</p>

<p>The girl said while eating fried chicken with his head down while her eyes looking up at me.</p>

<p>"Yep, you can." I nodded.</p>

<p>"Isn't more different if its nude?"</p>

<p>"...... That won't do." It took a moment before I replied.</p>

<p>I still can't draw nude without getting conscious of it.</p>

<p>If you can't stopped your erection with just bikini in a beach. That only means you're not qualified to draw nude JK.</p>

<p>It's a shame though.</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>The girl pouted with slight regret.</p>

<p>After the meal. My sketches were better than the usual ones.</p>

<p>Although I still regret upsetting her, I still enjoyed seeing different side of her.</p>
