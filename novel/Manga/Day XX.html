<h3>Confinement - Day XX</h3>

<p>Many days have passed. I just keep drawing and drawing my manga. </p>

<p>Under the torment of fatigue and lack of sleep, my consciousness gradually becomes blurry.</p>

<p>While fighting this, I'm already at climax where the story is mixed with 2D fiction and reality.</p>

<p>Sooner, my current "now" will connect to the "now" that is drawn on the paper.</p>

<p>There will be no proper happy ending nor bad end. The series wil not get proper ending, it's just processing of daily lifes of two people.</p>

<p>If I were participate in Newcomer Award, I would undoubtedly lose.</p>

<p>Now, the story ends with poignant but tender life of the main character.</p>

<p>"I would like to see the girl again, if possible." I put down the pen while adding understandable idea.</p>

<p>(Done, now this is my new manga.)</p>

<p>I sent the comic I drew for the only person who matters to me to her account.</p>

<p>(I don't know if the girl will read it. Even if she reads it, I don't know if she will come back.)</p>

<p>In the end I'm just manga artist to the bone.</p>

<p>In that time, I can't think any ideas about my new manga. There's nothing I can't do. But now, I'm sure I can do it now.</p>

<p>After that, my body sense a strong feeling of fatigue, as if the Earth's gravity suddenly increased.</p>

<p>Then I lay down at my bed at once.</p>
