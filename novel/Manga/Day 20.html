<h3>Confinement - Day 20</h3>

<p>It’s been more than half a month since I started this new manga. I’ve already tried a lot of different styles, drawing characters from the front, side, back, standing, and even sitting. But the drawing patterns still don’t convince me.</p>

<p>"How are you doing?" Konata asked as she lay down on my futon.</p>

<p>"No, don’t lie there."</p>

<p>I quickly got up to prevent her from lying on my futon, and pounced on her. Although I sometimes changed my sheets, I was worried that my body odor would be permeating there.</p>

<p>"Do you want to sleep together?" she said as she called out to me with clenched fists, as if imitating a cat.</p>

<p>"You serious?"</p>

<p>I find it quite unbelievable that until recently we exchanged a couple of words, and now she’s teasing me with things like that.</p>

<p>"I wouldn’t mind trading my sleeping bag to sleep with you." she said as she laughed.</p>

<p>"That’s a problem."</p>

<p>There’s something a little kinky about sleeping next to a JK. If it’s a girl who smells good, I’ll suffer great agony, but if she has a bad smell, I’ll be very disappointed.</p>

<p>"Well, in that case, get back to what you’re doing."</p>

<p>"Yes… I’ll try."</p>

<p>I got up from the futon and refocused in front of the tablet. But I still felt a little embarrassed by Konata’s words. So, to try to disguise it, I took the cup of tea and drank it in one gulp.</p>

<p>But as soon as the tea slid down my throat, I started coughing uncontrollably. I choked on liquid, making my chest feel tight.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I just drowned in the water." I replied with a worried look on my face.</p>

<p>I wiped my mouth with the hem of my shirt and focused on making my drawing. But just as I was about to do it… A muffled sound involuntarily came out of my mouth.</p>

<p>"Do you have the hiccups?"</p>

<p>"Looks like it, hip. I’m in trouble, hip. Now I won’t be able to draw at ease, hip. I have to stop it somehow."</p>

<p>The spasms in my diaphragm wouldn’t stop, and it was inevitable that it would happen, since I couldn’t control them.</p>

<p>"…Close your eyes." Konata said with a serious look.</p>

<p>"What? Why?"</p>

<p>Her tone of voice was so commanding that it was impossible for me to refuse.</p>

<p>"O—Okay…"</p>

<p>I closed my eyes as she asked me to.</p>

<p>Given the circumstances, it seems that he is trying to do something about my hiccups. Maybe that was the reason for this request? Is she trying to surprise me in some way? I wonder what she will do.</p>

<p>Will she intend to kiss me…? No… Impossible, I think I’ve been reading too many romantic comedies, haha.</p>

<p>The moment I laughed at my rose-colored fantasy in my brain, I felt a sharp thump in my chest. My body leans back and the pain disperses to the back of my head.</p>

<p>A moment later, my breathing stops. I tried to move my limbs, but for some reason I didn’t feel strong enough. Did it immobilize me too?</p>

<p>"Hmm! Hmm! Hmm!"</p>

<p>I opened my eyes, and the first thing that appeared in my vision was a brown cloth in front of me. My nose and mouth were blocked by a pillow.</p>

<p>A great feeling of fear invaded my body. Now I remember my position in this place. I have not ceased to be a hostage for this girl. There is nothing I can do about it, so I let my consciousness slowly fade away.</p>

<p>But just as I was about to give up, I regained mobility in my body, so I leaned on my arms and lifted my body.</p>

<p>"What the hell are you supposed to be doing!?"</p>

<p>"I’ve heard that scaring is good for curing hiccups, and so is holding your breath. So I thought it might be effective if you did both at the same time." she said, as she stepped back a little with a look of fear.</p>

<p>"Hip… I guess it didn’t work."</p>

<p>"I see. Still not enough."</p>

<p>"Hip!"</p>

<p>The girl comes closer to me as she reaches out her arms and places her fingers in my ears. I stopped hearing the noise around me. And I had the present fear that they were going to squeeze my brain.</p>

<p>"What now?"</p>

<p>I gently took Konata’s arms so I could remove my fingers from my ears.</p>

<p>"I wanted to stimulate the vague nerves behind your ear, possibly that might work."</p>

<p>"I appreciate you doing that for me, but next time, I’d like you to tell me beforehand."</p>

<p>"Okay… So, how about the hiccups? Have they gone away?"</p>

<p>"Yeah… I think it’s stopped."</p>

<p>The measures Konata took were quite radical, but it seem to have worked.</p>

<p>"Good, then I’ll come back with the drawings."</p>

<p>"Okay."</p>

<p>I sat back down in front of the tablet, and for some reason, I was quite excited to get back to work.</p>
