<h3>Confinement - Day 13</h3>

<p>"Is it possible for me to have a cup of tea or something?"</p>

<p>It was the late afternoon, and I was very thirsty. So I decided to call my captor, but there was no answer from her. So I wondered if she was napping instead.</p>

<p>I peeked through the door, but she was indeed awake, but sitting on her legs in front of a piece of cardboard that served as a desk with an open book on top of it, next to that book she also had a notebook and a mechanical pencil.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look like a recipe book, but a more serious and complicated subject. A book of mathematical problems. She’s probably so focused on solving the equations that she didn’t hear my voice. </p>

<p>If she’s so focused on her studies, wouldn’t it be better if she went to school? Despite the obvious question pondering in my head, surely there must be a reason why she can’t go even if she wanted to. </p>

<p>More importantly, why am I worrying about her? Could this be what people call Stockholm Syndrome?</p>

<p>Anyway, I suppose the most reasonable reason why she doesn’t go to school is because she doesn’t want to make me think I’m no longer locked up.</p>

<p>A small feeling of worry started to rise up inside me, I felt like asking her if she feels worried about her classes. But it’s a waste of time to try, as she’s not usually the type to be talkative. Although the same goes for me, for that reason I chose to express myself through manga.</p>

<p>Well, I guess I have no choice but to keep working on my drawings, not to mention the small fact that she also keeps waiting for me to show her one of my finished works. </p>

<p>I slowly withdrew from the door so as not to disturb her, I placed myself in front of my tablet and opened the notes application, inside it, I had many ideas about future projects I had in mind to do. It had been a long time since I had looked at them. </p>

<p>It was important to note that most of the ideas captured in this application have been rejected. Still, I was willing to analyze them one by one in order to find a hidden treasure.</p>

<p>"It’s time for lunch."</p>

<p>I turned around and saw the girl standing behind me with the tray in her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, it’s already twelve o’clock, I hadn’t noticed. The food looks delicious." I mumbled as I looked at the food that had been placed in front of me.</p>

<p>After placing the food in front of me, she gets up and leaves the room.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the food."</p>

<p>Several minutes later I heard the door behind me open. The girl must have come into the room to pick up the tray.</p>

<p>But to my surprise, her presence continued to be present behind me, her gaze was quite penetrating at my back, so I turned around to find out what I wanted to know.</p>

<p>"Um, is there anything I can do for you?"</p>

<p>The girl suddenly pulled out a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>"H—Hey, easy now… It’s not what you think, I didn’t stop drawing the manga, I’m just looking for ideas."</p>

<p>"Hair. Long." She said while placing her hand on my head.</p>

<p>"My hair? Come to think of it, my bangs are pretty long."</p>

<p>I hadn’t had my hair cut in a while, so it was long enough to completely cover my eyes.</p>

<p>She drags my bangs with her hands. I don’t know how long I hadn’t had my hair cut, but if it was long enough to cover my eyes, then it must’ve been a long while.</p>

<p>"So… You want to cut my hair?"</p>

<p>The girl nodded at my question.</p>

<p>"Call me when you want to take a break, then I’ll cut it."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. It’s okay don’t worry, I don’t want to be a bother for you, give me the scissors I’ll cut it."</p>

<p>It’s a task I can do on my own, and it will also only take me a couple of minutes to do it.</p>

<p>"No." She expressed while shaking her head.</p>

<p>Well, I guess it’s reasonable since I can use it as a weapon with which to defend myself.</p>

<p>"All right, I’ll let you do it. And as for the drawing, don’t worry, right now I’m checking old ideas in case I come up with something better, I don’t want you to think that I’ve abandoned what you asked me to do."</p>

<p>I turned around and stood in front of the tablet again, while the girl continued to stand behind me. I know from experience that this girl is very clumsy, and not to be pessimistic, but I would like to have a haircut without ending up with several scars in between.</p>

<p>"Here I come."</p>

<p>The girl takes small steps and slowly approaches me. I steadied my head firmly so that I wouldn’t tremble from the anguish that invaded me, but to my surprise, I felt something that made me feel calm. The girl’s fingers were gently stroking my hair.</p>

<p>It was quite a nostalgic and maternal feeling at the same time. And it’s a funny thing, since she was younger than me.</p>

<p>At the same time, the scissors began to move slowly but boldly, parts of my black hair fell to the floor. I tried to focus my attention on reading my notes written on the tablet, but nervousness prevented me from achieving that goal.</p>

<p>It was a total relief, I was afraid I was going to lose my ears.</p>

<p>Then the girl starts to pick up the remains of my hair with her hand, that’s nice and all, but…</p>

<p>"What are you doing?"</p>

<p>"Cleaning."</p>

<p>For some strange reason, she was silently storing the remains of my hair in a clear plastic bag. I could understand if it was a garbage bag, but it was one of those thick zipper bags.</p>

<p>"Why are you keeping my hair in a zipper bag?"</p>

<p>"Sustainable development goals."</p>

<p>After she finished collecting my hair she left the room. Her answer generates doubts in my head, the more I think about it, the more I don’t get a direct link between using hair and sustainable development goals.</p>
