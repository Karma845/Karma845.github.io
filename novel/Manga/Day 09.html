<h3>Confinement - Day 9</h3>

<p>After breakfast.</p>

<p>The confrontation with the tablet continues.</p>

<p>After roughly dividing the frames, deleting them, and after drawing the character sketches, I delete them again, repeating the process over and over again.</p>

<p>If I were so talented, I could draw a masterpiece at will, without getting rejected by my editors.</p>

<p>(- No, wait? I think it's okay not to draw an interesting story that will not get hype this time. It's okay to look bad, it's not about making money, and I don't have to care about editor's feelings, and I don't have to care if your work will not a hit on SNS.) (Note: SNS is social media.)</p>

<p>The girl just only wanted me to draw a manga.</p>

<p>Then it will not be difficult.</p>

<p>You don't need to follow the editor's wishes to draw those romantic comedy manga's that can sell, I just need to draw a manga that can please that JK.</p>

<p>For some reason, I feel so much relaxed when I think like this.</p>

<p>(In that case, it would be better to let that girl make an appearance in my manga.)</p>

<p>In short, there are many ideas I can  create into story, by using her so far.</p>

<p>(Draw four-pages manga daily is enough.) (Note: The mc plan on drawing her(the girl) as model on the story, based on the girl daily life in 4 pages only. Just like in the manga series.)</p>

<p>I picked up my pen.</p>

<p>The first four-panel manga is based from her sucking a sugar-soaked finger.</p>

<p>I didn't expect that it would take less than 30 minutes to finish it.</p>

<p>So far, 'I'm in slumped' seems false. I can still manage to draw.</p>

<p>(While this colored illustration will be use as fan service. In that case, I'll just draw this for fun.)</p>

<p>This time, I will use yesterday's conversation as plot for another short story.</p>

<p>If I think like that, I don't have to consider the reader's acceptability on my plot. Then I will start to try out new subplots and character designs, and the more I drew, the better It'll got.</p>

<p>"....."</p>

<p>When I came back to my senses, she was already beside me.</p>

<p>And there are two silver trays are placed on the floor.</p>

<p>I realized that it was already time for dinner.</p>

<p>It seems that I didn't even haven't eaten lunch.</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm eating now."</p>

<p>I put down my pen in a panic and picked up the spoon.</p>

<p>"Can I see it?"</p>

<p>"Eh, Oh, yes. There are still some details that is not completed yet, if that's okay with you."</p>

<p>I nodded as I ate my lunch.</p>

<p>"....."</p>

<p>The girl grabbed my tablet and starts to read the manga I draw.</p>

<p>Looking at one page after another.</p>

<p>I watched her with fear and nervousness as I slowly took the dinner jelly that was swirling on the spoon into my mouth.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for her to look up after I finished my two meal servings.</p>

<p>"Any opinion?" I asked.</p>

<p>I peered at her face and asked cautiously.</p>

<p>Her thoughts on my first work are....</p>

<p>"Thank you."</p>

<p>And that's all.</p>

<p>"Why did you thank me for that?"</p>

<p>I thought I would receive comments such as "interesting" or "boring", when I asked but...</p>

<p>"....."</p>

<p>But the girl didn't answer my question and started packing up the silver trays.</p>

<p>Because of the mask, I couldn't see her expression at all.</p>

<p>However, the corners of her eyes seems did relax.</p>

<p>For now, that response is enough.</p>
