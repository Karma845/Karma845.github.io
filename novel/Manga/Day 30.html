<h3>Confinement - Day 30</h3>

<p>Yesterday, I did not sleep a wink. And I don't have plan on sleeping either today again.</p>

<p>It's not like I can't sleep because I'm being threatened by a knife nor being chained, it's because I'm currently working on with my new manga again.</p>

<p>And it's also to prove that the imprisonment made by the girl to me was not meaningless.</p>

<p>Even when I eat, I just eat raw egg and water for breakfast.</p>

<p>My brain and the tip of the pen feels integrated. My body is in zone that is mechanized to visualize ideas and imagination.</p>

<p>I dont feel any pain nor happier either.</p>

<p>When you are committed you will forget anything.</p>

<p>*Draw.*</p>

<p>*Draw.*</p>

<p>*Draw!*</p>

<p>Now, I can say this with confidence. I'm a manga creator. </p>

<p>Even If I was forgotten by other people, I don't care.</p>

<p>I'm a manga creator, that's all I need.</p>
