<h3>Chapter 1 - The Unspoken Service of Kate, the Male-Disguised Hero.</h3>

<p>&#12288;Dino Turner, who had discovered the big secret of the Hero Kay Brennan, was walking to school the next day with bright red autumn leaves on his cheeks.</p>
<p>&#12288;Students passing by him were surprised and started laughing. The students who managed to hold their laughter in so as not to make a sound were still conscientious. After a humiliating visit to Tiana Lintner to have his swollen cheek treated, she pointed the finger at him and laughed.</p>
<p>&#12288;Normally, he would have complained to her about her behavior, which was unlike that of a child of a noble family, but he felts guilty that he had forced himself to look at the naked body of a girl, even though he did not know her, so he took the curious stares and laughter of his quarreling friends as a punishment.</p>
<p>(But who would have known that the hero of the Holy Sword is a girl and that she attends the school dressed as a man!)</p>
<p>&#12288;To be honest, he couldn't even sleep properly last night. He was so shocked that he wanted to think that what happened in the locker room was not a dream. When he closed his eyes, Kay's naked body, her cherry-red nipples, and the girl's crack clearly visible on her hairless pubic area come vividly to mind and do not disappear.</p>
<p>&#12288;This caused him to spend an agonizing amount of time.</p>
<p>&#12288;Needless to say, he could not even concentrate on the classroom lecture, and the afternoon practice class ended in a mess.</p>
<p>&#12300;That's it! Winner, Akira Konoe!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... God damn it!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're not like your usual self ...... You need to take this more seriously.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The one who gave the cold words of encouragement was Akira Konoe, the third most talented student at the school. He was the picture of sincerity, and he probably didn't like Dino's absentmindedness. Despite his victory, there was not the slightest hint of happiness in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#12288;Akira, who is of Eastern descent, has shiny black hair tied into a single string, giving him a cool appearance. Although of average height, his slender but moderately muscled limbs and well-groomed posture make him appear taller than the numbers indicate.</p>
<p>&#12288;His brown eyes reflect no interest other than to be strong, and he has something in common with Dino, who is also in search of strength. But today was different.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino's head was filled with the naked body of a hero dressed as a man. Akira, on the other hand, seemed to be even a little taken aback by Dino.</p>
<p>(There is no way I can say that I am in agony and have no strength because I saw her naked. ......)</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino was greatly depressed at his first defeat other than Kay.</p>
<p>&#12300;I said a little too much. But I don't think this victory is a real victory. I want a rematch.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, I'll do better next time.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;if it is the case then, fine&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With that, Akira heads for the locker room.</p>
<p>&#12288;As Dino, who was left behind, was apologizing inwardly to Akira, Tiana approached him.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/bsTAZiN.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="751" data-original-width="532" height="751" src="https://i.imgur.com/bsTAZiN.jpg" width="532" /></a></div><br />
			<p>&#12300;Yesterday you lost to Kay-sama, and today you lost to Konoe-san.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm a loser anyway. Laugh it up.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh-ho-ho-ho!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't laugh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're a troublesome gentleman. Didn't you tell me to laugh?.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I didn't expect a noble lady to open her big mouth and laugh.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;However, it is too late now, as she had laughed against Dino, who had also made autumn leaves on his cheeks in the morning.</p>
<p>(I'll get even with him someday.)</p>
<p>&#12288;A warm glow envelops Dino's body as he vows revenge on the unreserved young lady.</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I, for one, have a policy of being kind to losers. Today, Kay-sama said he was feeling unwell and missed his afternoon classes, so I was short on time as a healer.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, thank you&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He was about to say, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Who's a loser"</span> but he was more concerned about Kay missing class.</p>
<p>(No doubt, it's my fault.)</p>
<p>&#12288;Yesterday, Kay, who had been struck with the force of a hero's power so hard that her brain was shaken and she was unable to move without strength in her limbs, left the changing room without changing her clothes at a blindingly fast pace.</p>
<p>&#12288;The fact that he was forced to look at the naked body of a girl who didn't want to, and the fact that he saw the naked body of a girl for the first time, raged in his brain and his mind hasn't been at ease since yesterday.</p>
<p>&#12288;Perhaps Kay is wary that Dino is telling the world that she was dressed as a man.</p>
<p>(What am I supposed to do with a secret too big to be a hero ...... Don't tell me, am I going erased?)</p>
<p>&#12288;Not only the secret of a hero but also the naked body of a maiden had been worshipped. He could not complain even if he was purged without question.</p>
<p>&#12288;If Kay, who had defeated him in succession, seriously tried to silence him, Dino would be at his wits' end. Of course, he will resist and he must apologize before she does so, but he doesn't want to die just because he saw her naked body.</p>
<p>&#12288;From a girl's point of view, the fact that a man she doesn't like has seen her naked body may be worth all the deaths, but what he doesn't want to die for is not dying.</p>
<p>&#12300;You are very quiet today, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Say.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What would you do if a man you didn't like saw you naked?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'll kill him. I'll give him a nasty surprise, and then I'll slaughter him.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I guess.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When he asked Tiana, who is the same gender as Kay, in her opinion, he received a reply that was more horrifying than he had imagined and sent a chill down his spine. He thinks he may have asked the wrong person, but he is certain, without having to ask, that it is not something he's happy to see.</p>
<p>&#12300;What is it, suddenly asking that?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I didn't mean anything in particular. And, while I'm at it, let me ask you&#8213;what do you think of girls dressed as men?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I think you probably suffered a serious and fatal head injury in the fight with Konoe-san. Infirmary ...... No, please wait here while I make arrangements for you to be admitted to the Royal Hospital.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, no, no, no! I'm not crazy! Also don't casually focus your recovery magic on my head.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He is aware that he asked a strange question without context, but he did not expect to be treated this much. In other words, it is not so often that there are girls dressed as men.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even Dino did not think that anyone would go to the trouble of dressing up as a man to attend school. And this was from a hero who was the focus of everyone's attention.</p>
<p>(What's the point of dressing up as a man in the first place? A hobby, maybe? No, I don't think so.)</p>
<p>&#12300;If there were a woman dressed as a man, she would probably have a very special reason for doing so.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What does that mean?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What kind of a life must be lived under constant surveillance to disguise one's gender? I would definitely be stressed out. I am sure that person must be feeling a lot of stress. Or, he/she would probably be alone and not in contact with anyone so as not to feel any stress.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It reminds him of something he was told. Kay Brennan has no close friends, and even with Tiana and the other chaperones, she has a minimal conversation.</p>
<p>&#12288;It is not clear why a young girl of her age would be lying about her gender, but perhaps her minimal contact with anyone is to hide her false gender identity.</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't think such a person actually exists, though. If there were, surely it would only be in your boiling brain?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I told you, you don't have to focus your restorative magic on my head. I'm just sort of asking.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After thanking Tiana for most of the recovery, Dino decided to meet with Kay. First, he would apologize for forcing to see her naked, even though she did not know, and tell her that he would not tell anyone else about her secret.</p>
<p>&#12288;He stands up, hoping to reassure Kay, who may be feeling stressed and anxious every day, as much as possible.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh my, don't you need to go to the infirmary? I-I'd be happy to keep you company if you'd like, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Not today. Thank you. Oh, I haven't forgotten about our appointment yesterday, so maybe another time.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hold on ...... Can't you at least say something thoughtful about coming back with me on the way?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He thanks Tiana and return to the locker room. After a quick shower and sweat, he noticed a letter in his locker.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... From who?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It's not likely to be a love letter. Sad to say, he doesn't have a deep enough relationship to be adored by anyone. If so, a letter of appreciation&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">I have an idea of what this might be. I had received a few, but not once since I fought with Kay and won second place in the school.</span></p>
<p>&#12288;He opened the letterhead, wondering who in the world had sent the letter and when, and found that it was written in cute and concise letters.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;I'll be waiting for you in the arena after school.</span></p>
<p>&#12300;Ah, this must be to keep me quiet.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The sender was Kay Brennan, without needing to check.</p>
			<p style= "text-align:center;">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;After school, Dino was alone in a corner of the arena waiting for Kay Brennan.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, she had missed all her afternoon classes after all and had not been seen.</p>
<p>(I bet she's probably plotting my demise right now.)</p>
<p>&#12288;As he was envisioning his own selfish paranoia, the person in question appeared.</p>
<p>&#12288;As a minimum of manners, Dino was unarmed. In contrast, Kay had a holy sword at her waist.</p>
<p>(I failed. ...... I should have brought at least one of my swords)</p>
<p>&#12288;He wanted to believe that as a hero, it was natural for her to carry a holy sword with her at all times and that it was never meant to harm him.</p>
<p>&#12300;You came as you promised&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah. I thought it would be a good time since I needed to talk to you too.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She looked around to make sure no one was around.</p>
<p>&#12300;What you wanted to ask me was about yesterday, right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's right. But first, let me apologize. I know you're trying to keep me quiet. I've learned your secret and, you know, it's true that I've forced myself to look at it&#8213;I'm sorry.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino bowed deeply.</p>
<p>&#12288;It is true to say that he did not know she was a girl, but since he had seen her naked body, it was unconditionally worse for the man. This is always the same.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even though he had a pretty good idea of what she was going to do to him, he wanted to at least make sure he apologized. That was Dino's way of being sincere.</p>
<p>&#12300;Uhh, I'm not trying to keep Dino's mouth shut.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;What? Really?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He couldn't help but look up when he heard a confused voice.</p>
<p>&#12288;Kay smiled bitterly and revealed that she had actually thought about keeping his mouth shut at first, which cooled Dino's nerves.</p>
<p>&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">"I knew it,"</span> he said, breaking into a cold sweat at the thought of the worst-case scenario. If she had really tried to keep him from talking, Dino would not have won. The odds might be different if it came down to a fight for his life, but he was too reckless to take on an undefeated hero.</p>
<p>&#12300;Then why did you call me out?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I had a favor to ask Dino, well, you know ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She swallowed her spit, nodded once deeply and determinedly, and</p>
<p>&#12300;I'll do anything, just don't tell my secret!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino was stunned to hear this.</p>
<p>(I can't believe she's asking me for a favor. ......)</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm in trouble.</p>
<p>(I mean, don't say you'll do anything for a guy. ...... Doesn't she have a sense of crisis?)</p>
<p>&#12288;This is not something you say to the opposite sex even in jest, no matter how much they know who you are. But he can tell by the look in her eyes that she means it.</p>
<p>(How did this happen?)</p>
<p>&#12288;His head hurts. No doubt, it's because of the nakedness Dino saw yesterday when he revealed his taste for Kay, who didn't like it.</p>
<p>(Yep, you got what you deserved. ......)</p>
<p>&#12288;She must be confused because he knows she lied about her gender. Dino finds a few tears in Kay's eyes and leads her to the bleachers to sit down.</p>
<p>&#12300;If you don't mind, could you tell me the situation?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He felt guilty for her tears and asked her what was going on, hoping that he could do something to help her because he was aware that he had caused her to be trapped, even if it was an irresistible force.</p>
			<p style= "text-align:center;">&#8251;</p>
			
			<p>&#12300;My real name is&#8213;Kate Brennan. Kate for Kay is a bit of a stretch, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Looking down at the arena, Kay - no, Kate - told him that she was nostalgic for the past.</p>
<p>&#12288;She became one of the heroes of our time, appointed by the Church as a hero after being chosen by the Holy Sword, which presides over the fire attribute, at a young age.</p>
<p>&#12288;But until then, Kate seems to have been a tomboyish girl everywhere.</p>
<p>&#12288;Her mother was a court magician, her father a knight-errant, and her brother a knight belonging to the Order of the Knights, so she had a complex because she was quite normal compared to her elite family, but she was happy and close to her family. However, her happiness came to an end three years ago when she became a hero.</p>
<p>&#12288;What awaited Kate when she became a hero was the ugly side of humanity.</p>
<p>&#12288;The birth of a hero at the age of a child was greeted with as much envy, jealousy and backbiting as it was a joy. Sometimes they looked down on her because she was a girl. Even if a child who had nothing to do with fighting was chosen as a Holy Sword and gained power, if she did not know how to use that power, it would be a waste of treasure. Not a few people blamed her for this.</p>
<p>&#12288;Many people tried to take advantage of the power that was given to the hero, such as men as old as her father who offered to marry a girl who was not yet old enough to be her father, and others who tried to take advantage of her by rubbing up against her, and she became completely distrustful of people.</p>
<p>&#12288;Fortunately, her talent as a hero blossomed in no time and she was soon able to fight. At first, she even beat those who looked down on her to a pulp to relieve her frustration.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, the stress definitely built up, and it is needless to explain that being her person quickly became painful.</p>
<p>&#12288;The family, who could not bear to see Kate like this, would not have taken any action for their beloved daughter, and after consulting with the Church, it was decided &#8213; instead of prioritizing heroism &#8213; to give her a position as a student and encourage her to grow slowly while she learns how to become a hero.</p>
<p>&#12288;Some people wanted to take her to the battlefield immediately, but those who said so were forcibly silenced by her parents.</p>
<p>&#12288;Being a student was not a problem, but as long as Kate was a hero and her gender was a girl, she would not necessarily be approached by dirty-minded people at the school as well as adults. The overprotective family and the Church authorities, who sympathize with her, decide to have Kate dressed as a man and enroll her at the academy as a boy hero named Kay.</p>
<p>(......But that doesn't mean it's absurd to make her dress up as a man.)</p>
<p>&#12300;I've always been a bit of a tomboy, so it was easy for me to spend time as a boy.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;In fact, she says, it was also rather fun. As a girl, you have to be picky about your manners, but as a boy, you can be rather rough. She was anxious about attending a boarding school, but thanks to the fact that she was in a single room and that she felt more at ease than she had imagined, she says it was not a hardship.</p>
<p>&#12300;But I feel guilty about deceiving everyone. That's why I can't be friends with anyone.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The way she said this was so lonely that Dino couldn't find the words to say.</p>
<p>&#12288;But he also understood. This hero is living her life as a student under a false gender identity. It's easy to put it into words, but if an unthinking person finds out, it could become a source of bad words again.</p>
<p>&#12288;She has already recovered from her distrust of people and is not accused of lack of power because she is a child or a woman. It seems that only some of the upper echelons of the Church and state and a few of the Knights know her true gender.</p>
<p>&#12288;Because of this thoroughness, it is said that Kay Brennan the Hero, not Kate Brennan, has become widely known and it is now impossible to say that she was a woman.</p>
<p>(......I feel sorry for her)</p>
<p>&#12288;As she is already a hero, it seems that her family and the Church are consulting with her about where to reveal her gender, and she cannot reveal it at Kate's discretion.</p>
<p>(The more I listen to her, the more trouble she's getting into for dressing as a man.)</p>
<p>&#12300;The truth is, I like living as a boy. But sometimes I feel sorry for the girls who confess to me and stuff. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With her pretty, girlish appearance, Hero Kay is popular with girls. In fact, because he is a girl, she is just a cute little girl in men's clothes, but some girls would fall in love with her if they didn't know the truth.</p>
<p>(I bet her parents didn't expect her to be so popular with the girls either.)</p>
<p>&#12288;Only people's feelings are unpredictable, no matter who they are.</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate says that she is heartbroken and sorry that every time a female student has the courage to confess to her, she cannot tell her the truth and has to just say no.</p>
<p>&#12288;Sometimes she feels the urge to say out loud that she is lying about her gender identity. But there is no way she can do that.</p>
<p>&#12288;She is afraid that if her true identity is revealed &#8213; as a result &#8213; people will think she is a liar.</p>
<p>&#12288;Therefore, she has to keep her distance from other students, focus on her heroics, build walls and remain solitary. That was the real Kate Brennan, the heroes.</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;That's why, please don't tell anyone who I really am.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate bowed deeply and hoped. Dino does not know how much feeling was put into that wish.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino hates both Holy Swords and Heroes. He thought it was easy to gain power and become powerful. They always stand at the forefront of humans as heroes and continue to fight, leaving those who are making efforts behind. He hated such heroes.</p>
<p>&#12288;But the hero who lowered her head in front of him was different. For her, being a hero must be painful, even if she doesn't say so.</p>
<p>(Selfishly jealous of and hating heroes &#8213; what was I doing?)</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It made me want to punch myself in the face for being so one-sidedly hostile to them, which was so shameful.</span></p>
<p>&#12300;Until one day, when I can tell everyone that I'm a girl myself &#8213; I'll do anything, just don't tell anyone my secret!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Just because someone knows your secret doesn't mean you'd be cowardly enough to let anyone in on it!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He founds himself releasing words on his own.</p>
<p>&#12288;Most of Dino's mind is occupied with anger. He was angry at both the fact that he had tried to defeat Kate without knowing what was going on, just because she was a hero, and the environment she was in.</p>
<p>&#12300;Dino?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Even if Kay Brennan is actually a girl and she's Kate Brennan &#8213; I'll face you head-on, fair and square, and I'll beat you eventually. That's all I'm saying.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... That's all you said ...... That means you won't tell anyone?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's obvious. No matter how many contacts we didn't have in this way regularly, we've met hands many times. Do you think I would do something so cowardly?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Err, I'm not going to answer that question, because it's too much to answer.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino reminds Kate, who has a look of genuine trouble on her face.</p>
<p>(Ah&#9472;&#9472;Oh, come to think of it, my fighting method is basically a concentrated attack on weak points...)</p>
<p>&#12288;While Kate uses the power of the Holy Sword to reap her enemies with a one-hit kill, Dino uses dark-attribute magic to attack in detail until the opponent is exhausted, then finish them off. He was the type who, if he seized a weakness, would attack it to a single point.</p>
<p>&#12300;A-anyway! I would never try to do anything to anyone's weakness. So you can rest assured. I won't let anyone in on your secret, I promise.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes - thank you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Perhaps relieved by Dino's words, Kate smiled with tears welling up in the corners of her eyes, and his heart unexpectedly fluttered.</p>
<p>(H-How comes I didn't realize she was a girl before?)</p>
<p>&#12288;She is powerful, but because of the benefits of the Holy Sword, her body is slender, frail, and petite. She has a high voice and a cute appearance. She has a boyish impression, but this is probably because the original Kate was a tomboy, but even including that, she doesn't look like anything other than a girl now.</p>
<p>(&#8213;Kate is such a cutie.)</p>
<p>&#12300;Dino, what's wrong?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino hurriedly replies to Kate, who tilts her head and asks her questions when she is staring at him.</p>
<p>&#12300;N-nothing, it's nothing. First of all, knowing your secret won't change me. But if that. Well, you know, if you need any help, you can always count on me. I mean, how should I put it, I've seen you naked, and I'll help you with that as an apology.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Geez, even though I already forgot about that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;S-sorry&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The words he said hastily lacked delicacy, and Kate's cheeks turn red when she remembers that he has seen her naked.</p>
<p>&#12300;Dino you perv.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I think that's an exaggeration! I demand a retraction!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It was his fault, but Dino protested, unable to admit to being told he was a pervert.</p>
<p>&#12288;At some point, Kate seemed to lose her anxiety about her secret being known and smiled.</p>
<p>&#12288;After that, she told him a lot of things, like a fish out of water.</p>
<p>&#12288;Perhaps it was a reaction to being lonely. As a tomboy, she must have been bored every day without making close friends.</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate smiled brightly when she realized that she didn't have to be shy with Dino now that he knew her secret.</p>
<p>&#12288;Although their contact was all about fighting, they were able to communicate their true nature to each other through fighting. Dino's glad that he felts she could trust him because of that.</p>
<p>&#12288;He was a little glad to know a side of Kate that he hadn't known before &#8213; that she was cheerful, laughed a lot, and talked a lot.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino, who had stubbornly been thinking only of defeating the heroes, will have to change his attitude from now on. Of course, defeating the heroes is his goal, and he still wants to prove that anyone can fight without the Holy Sword, not just relying on the heroes.</p>
<p>(But first of all... I think I should start by becoming friends with heroes.)</p>
<p>&#12288;Seeing Kate with a reassuring expression on her face and happily chatting with him, Dino decided to do so.</p>
			<p style= "text-align:center;">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;Three days have passed since Dino discovered the secret of the Hero Kay Brennan.</p>
<p>&#12288;He discovered that Kay's true identity was a girl and her real name was Kate Brennan, but he decided to keep her secret. He thought that was enough to convince her.</p>
<p>(I'm being watched again today.)</p>
<p>&#12288;He noticed a look and turned his head to see Kate watching him intently.</p>
<p>&#12288;He has made a promise not to tell anyone, and she is probably making an effort to trust Dino, but she seems to be worried. However, he seems to be being watched because of the way she is looking at him from start to finish.</p>
<p>(She was convinced on the spot, but I'd hate it if she thinks I'm going to tell on someone.)</p>
<p>&#12288;He wouldn't make a promise in the first place if he was going to make a promise that he had started to make himself.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino hates cowardice and dirty things even more than the Holy Sword. It's not that he doesn't understand her feelings, but he can't help but feel annoyed and irritated that she suspects him of being someone who would do such a thing.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, there is no way he could complain so openly. If he did, he would attract the attention of other students, who would wonder what had happened. Dino and Kate don't want that, of course.</p>
<p>(It's a little late for that, but isn't Kate not aware enough of being a hero?)</p>
<p>&#12288;Even though they have little contact with the students, the heroes are always the center of attention. For better or worse, they are interested. If despite this, they are looking at her all the time, they can't help but wonder what's going on. If someone notices that she is dressed as a man because of this, it would be a disaster.</p>
<p>&#12288;She is so preoccupied with Dino that she neglects to pay attention to her surroundings. He doesn't know how many times he had lost his nerve in the last few days.</p>
<p>&#12288;Once she is recognized as a girl, no matter how you look at her, she looks like no one other than a girl, so it has been three days when Dino, who is supposed to be a third party, has been more worried that someone else might notice her every move.</p>
<p>(Maybe I should warn her once we're alone somewhere.)</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, there were no major mistakes, but he was mentally exhausted with constant anxiety, so he quickly returned to his room in the dormitory and went to sleep without eating.</p>
<p>&#12288;However &#8213; while sleeping, Dino woke up when he felt the presence of someone in the room.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the darkness, he realized that there was definitely someone in the room, and as he tried to reach for the sword that lay beside the bed, a small voice called out his name.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Dino, it's me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Could it be, Kate?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The visitor at midnight was &#8213; Kate Brennan, a Hero dressed as a man.</p>

			<p style= "text-align:center;">&#8251;</p>

<p>&#12288;He checks his watch and realizes that he has been asleep for quite a long time. The night was completely gone. He thought that he had missed dinner and that he had half-escaped reality due to the current embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#12288;But it was not to be.</p>
<p>&#12300;Why are you in my room? I'm not impressed with you coming to the room of a boy who knows who you are, no matter how much you're dressed as a man.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's been a long time since I've been treated like a girl.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate laughs off Dino's caution.</p>
<p>&#12288;He had a pretty good idea what her purpose was for showing up in his room. Considering the looks she had been giving him for the past few days, she was probably anxious.</p>
<p>&#12288;He hadn't had a conversation with her since that time. Perhaps she came to see if he had told anyone else.</p>
<p>&#12300;First of all, let me tell you that I haven't told anyone your secret.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yup. I know about that. I've been watching you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I noticed. I have an idea what to expect, but I'll ask why.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She laughed as if she was troubled to learn that he knew she had been watching Dino. She thought she was doing it secretly.</p>
<p>&#12288;He was chilling to see if and when people around him would notice her gaze, but she didn't.</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate was smiling a deceptive smile, but her expression gradually darkened.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sorry.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What's going on all of a sudden?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Dino promised not to tell anyone about my secret, and I believed him once... but I was so worried.&#12301;</p>
<p>(I knew it.)</p>
<p>&#12288;He had noticed that the look she was giving him was filled with anxiety and fear.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was true that he had been bothered by the fact that she was watching him from beginning to end, but he had held back, thinking that it was understandable considering the anxiety that was oozing from her and the magnitude of the secret that she was hiding.</p>
<p>&#12300;I was always worried that Dino would break your promise or tell someone about my secret, and I couldn't calm down.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If you're so anxious, why don't you just stop wearing men's clothes?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Many people will understand if you just tell them what's going on. There may be people who will say that she deceived them, but it is unlikely that they will say anything bad about her now that she has already saved many people as a hero.</p>
<p>&#12288;He hates the Holy Sword and Heroes, but he does not hate even the achievements of the Hero Kay Brennan. When he learned that Kay was a girl and that her real name was Kate, he was very surprised, but he did not feel deceived at all.</p>
<p>(I bet she won't be convinced when I tell her that I didn't feel deceived when I found out her gender.)</p>
<p>&#12300;I've fixed my distrust of people, but I still get scared of people sometimes.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate, who once had no power or accomplishments yet, distrusts people because of the heartless words she has heard and the dirty desires she has seen in adults. Thanks to her family and the Church, she has been able to move into the academy as a male student, and she now receives nothing but praise for her solid accomplishments, but the emotional scars of her past are hard to heal.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm afraid that people will say I'm a liar because I'm deceiving everyone.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He's not sure what to say to Kate, who is feeling weak.</p>
<p>&#12288;He knows very well that easy comfort can sometimes be hurtful, so he can't say anything appropriate.</p>
<p>&#12300;What do you think would happen if everyone found out I was a woman?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He doesn't have the words right away. You might be surprised. Some of them will say they've been deceived, as Kate predicts. But he doesn't think all of them are like that.</p>
<p>(&#8213;There must be people who understand, just as I did.)</p>
<p>&#12288;That is not all she cares about. Because of her gender identity, she makes no close friends and has few personal relationships with the students at the school. Some students adore her, and she has heard that some of them not only liked her but also had the courage to confess their feelings for her.</p>
<p>&#12288;She feels guilty about these people.</p>
<p>&#12288;This makes her very anxious, and she is afraid that if the fact that she dresses as a man comes to light, she will be treated as a liar.</p>
<p>&#12300;Please, Dino ...... I'll do anything you want, just don't tell anyone my secret.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I know. I won't tell anyone, so don't worry so much.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;But...&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He racked his brains trying to figure out what to do to calm the girl who was trembling slightly. Dino, who had never had the slightest intention of telling anyone, was not expecting Kate to be so crushed by her anxiety.</p>
<p>(Maybe I was taking it a little easy on Kate.)</p>
<p>&#12288;At any rate, he couldn't leave the girl standing forever, so he tried to move his body to give her something warm to drink to help her sit down and calm down.</p>
<p>&#12288;But &#8213; suddenly, Kate approached and hugged Dino as if she was covering him.</p>
<p>&#12300;H-hey, Kate?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino's body stiffens at the suddenness of the event.</p>
<p>&#12288;He had caught her body and ended up hugging her, but this was not a good idea.</p>
<p>&#12288;He rushes to push her away, but she does not move an inch. He is confused as to where Kate's thin limbs possess such strength, but he soon realizes that it is the benefit of the Holy Sword.</p>
<p>&#12288;She removes the sword from her waist and places it next to the bed. She moves more easily, her cheeks flushing a faint red in the small light of the room.</p>
<p>&#12300;You can do whatever you want with my body, so please. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;Wha!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With a hot breath, she uttered these unbelievable words.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino was so surprised by Kate's words and actions that his heart stopped. Despite the surprise, he felt his chest heat up.</p>
<p>&#12300;Are you serious?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Yeah. I'm serious.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He had been feeling aroused by her, whom he thought was a boy until the other day.</p>
<p>(I can't believe Kate only looks like a girl at a time like this!)</p>
<p>&#12288;Her cute appearance is only attractive now, flushed as if in a fever.</p>
<p>&#12288;It's too cash to change, but once he recognizes that she is a girl, it's difficult for a boy of his age to refuse her.</p>
<p>&#12288;A girl who is aware that she is a girl and has become conscious of the opposite sex has entrusted her body to him and told him he can do what he likes with her body. Excitement builds as if to drown out the confusion.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl, who was so close to him that he could smell her breath, smelled of sweet citrus fruits. He doesn't know if it was her body odor or if she had prepared for this situation, but the scent that tickled his nostrils didn't even seem to remind him that she was a girl.</p>
<p>&#12288;Hot, rough breath on his cheeks made it clear that she was already ready.</p>
<p>&#12288;The heat is on Dino as well, his lower abdomen hardening from excitement at the unexpected action of the girl dressed in men's clothes.</p>
<p>(Th-This can't go on like this!)</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;Ah, Dino ...... You're getting bigger.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He tried to hide the hardness in his lower abdomen, but it was soon obvious, as her modest buttocks were just right on top of his hips.</p>
<p>&#12288;Unaware of Dino's blush in embarrassment, Kate flinched as her cheeks flushed.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm so glad you're excited about me like this.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait, wait...&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate floats her hips and sits back down between his legs, her eyes focused on his erection, which is clearly visible through his pants.</p>
<p>&#12288;Her breathing becomes more labored, and at the same time, a slender finger is slowly extended.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sto&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Despite his cries of resistance, Kate does not stop. And somewhere along the line, Dino is expecting it, too, and can't really resist.</p>
<p>&#12288;With an awkward hand, the girl unbuckles his belt, exposing his tented underwear.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Haa, it's amazing&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;<i>*Gulp*</i>, Gulping and swallowing spit, was it Kate, Dino, or both?</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl took a deep breath and turned her fevered, determined eyes to Dino.</p>
<p>&#12300;If only Dino could have a secret, You'll never be able to tell mine, right?&#12301;(?)</p>
<p>&#12288;She looked so charming that it was hard to believe she was dressed as a man.</p>
			<p style= "text-align:center;">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;Kate slips down Dino's underwear with vigor. At the same moment, his penis shot out with great force.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl in men's clothing, who was startled by the sight of a man's penis that she did not have, stiffened, but soon regained her senses. She swallowed her spit and fearfully extended her thin, supple fingers to the hard, warped rod.</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When the girl's fingers touch his manhood, the sweet numbness becomes a pleasant sensation that strikes Dino.</p>
<p>&#12288;Since this was the first time he had ever had someone touch his genitals, he was confused by the unknown sensation and pleasure.</p>
<p>&#12300;S-sorry, did it hurt?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, it's not that, it just ......&#12301;</p>
<p>(How can I say it felt good?)</p>
<p>&#12288;As he was lost for words, Kate, perhaps sensing his feelings, put on a happy expression.</p>
<p>&#12300;Fufu, it felt good, didn't it? I'm happy. .......You can feel it, even with me, who is like a boy.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate's confused and anxious movements become firm, and her slender fingers grasp the meat stick.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnhh. Amazing, it's so hot&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;A sweet exhale escapes from the girl as soft fingers grip the meat stick.</p>
<p>&#12288;Every time her hand moved awkwardly, a numbing sensation of pleasure assaulted his manhood.</p>
<p>&#12300;I learned a little bit about boys, too. If I'm going to dress up as a man, there are some things I need to know. I know how to make boys feel good.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Her hand grips the pole and moves it up and down, as her cheeks redden as she reveals her monologue.</p>
<p>&#12288;The sight of her slippery fingers squeezing the penis looked so obscene. What's more, Kate's figure was wearing a men's uniform, which made the scene in front of his eyes seem even more perverse.</p>
<p>(I thought that if she looked like men, my excitement would subside, but Kate's hands felt too good and I was going crazy. ...... Did I have a weird taste?)</p>
<p>&#12288;He becomes concerned about his own sexuality as he becomes more and more aware that his arousal is growing stronger at the sight of Kate. Dino is oblivious to his fears, and the handjob continues.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl must have been interested in it as well. Her eyes were glued to the man's genitals, and the distance between them was getting closer.</p>
<p>&#12300;It's a very strong, boy smell...... It makes my head dizzy.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's face was only a short distance away from the penis as she wiggled her lower body and whored herself with her hands. Due to the excitement of being hand-fucked by the girl, the tip of the penis was overflowing with the pre-cum.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino himself could smell the thick male odor, but the girl dressed in men's clothes did not show even a hint of disgust when she smelled the male semen, but rather a more glamorous and mellow expression on her face.</p>
<p>&#12288;Her hand gripping the penis becomes stronger, and her thrusts become more vigorous.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino, who is being pleasured, as well as Kate, who is doing the groping, are all breathing heavily.</p>
<p>&#12288;Every time the hot breath hit on the penis, the glans react exaggeratedly. Kate was surprised but pleased to see that she was doing a good job with her hand job, and she continued to rub the penis. Next, the awkwardness disappeared, and she stimulated mainly on the most sensitive glans and bell mouth.</p>
<p>&#12288;Finally, she began to spit on the penis and intertwine her fingers and saliva with it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnmm ...... Does this make you feel any better?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It was an act that was not something that she had seen in her knowledge, but the result of her search for more pleasure while performing manual service.</p>
<p>&#12300;Kate, that's not good!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Aha, I'm glad. It feels good, doesn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The saliva acts as a lubricant, and her fingers intertwine with the penis, making a lewd and obscene sound. The pre-cum also increased in volume, staining the girl's fingers and making them wetter and wetter.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's hand was giving him the pleasure that he could ejaculate at any moment if he was not careful.</p>
<p>&#12288;He bit his back teeth and fought against the ejaculation, but the girl's hand was stimulating him even more.</p>
<p>(If things go on like this, Kate will get dirty. Endure it, endure it, me!)</p>
<p>&#12288;When the saliva dries up a little and becomes slippery, she does not hesitate to dribble additional saliva on the penis.</p>
<p>&#12288;Every time the girl's hot saliva and her hand wrap around the glans, he almost feels as if he is inside her body.</p>
<p>(I'd rather be inside Kate with all my heart...)</p>
<p>&#12288;A dusky desire was someday born inside Dino.</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate's efforts to stimulate him, even when her hands were stained with saliva and juices, was a healthy sight.</p>
<p>(How good would it feel to have sex with Kate if I could push her down?)</p>
<p>&#12288;The pleasure of the experience causes him to overflow with wicked feelings, but he endures them by mobilizing all of his rational faculties to kill his desires.</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate, who is oblivious to the depths of adolescent boys' sexual desires, is in danger. This danger is girlish and heightens his arousal.</p>
<p>(Is Kate feeling good too?).</p>
<p>&#12288;The sight of her wriggling lower body makes him more excited at the thought of what might be.</p>
<p>&#12300;Haah, nnmhh... ...... You can let it out anytime you want, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>(If she says such a thing...I'm already)</p>
<p>&#12288;The most intense feeling of ejaculation he has ever felt rushes up behind his hips, triggered by the fact that she looked up at him and said that.</p>
<p>&#12288;As his hips lifted involuntarily, Kate realized that he too would soon reach his limit, and she put more strength into her squeezing hand. The obscene sounds of the <span style="font-style: italic;">schlhop-schlop</span> echoed in the quiet room.</p>
<p>&#12288;As the rough, heated breaths and the obscene sound of the water repeated themselves &#8213; the limit had finally been reached.</p>
<p>&#12300;Kate, get away from me, I'm at my limit!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He couldn't resist ejaculating, but he wanted to at least avoid soiling Kate. But instead of being disgusted, she looked happy and relaxed.</p>
<p>&#12300;It's okay. I've made you feel good, and make me dirty!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's desire to be ejaculated and the increasing vigor of her hand job finally broke down the walls of his patience, and his pent-up desire began to fly out.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Byuruu, byurururu, byuuu, byuu, byurururururu!</span></p>
<p>&#12300;It's hot, Dino, it's so hot. ...... My hands are burning&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The unleashed semen stains Kate's hands mercilessly.</p>
<p>&#12288;The amount of semen that had been pent up in agony since the moment he saw her naked body was too much, and it stained the girl's thin, sunburned fingers white.</p>
<p>&#12288;The afterglow of his first ejaculation in a long time was so strong that he could not afford to worry about the surprising amount of cum he had produced.</p>
<p>&#12288;Both Dino, who had ejaculated, and Kate, who had been bathed in semen, were breathing hard and just stunned.</p>
<p>&#12288;Both were far away from consciousness after their first experience with each other, but Kate was the first to come to her senses and licked the semen off her fingers with her tongue.</p>
<p>&#12300;H-hey!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Her sudden action brings him back to his senses. He rushes to hand her a tissue, but the girl licks all the white fluid off her fingers without a care in the world.</p>
<p>(Seeing her like that would get me all excited again. ......!)</p>
<p>&#12300;Nchu... ...... This is what semen tastes like. It's bitter, but I don't hate it. Is it because it's Dino's?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She said such a thing and swallowed the semen.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was a surprising enough sight, and Dino did not expect her to swallow the semen, but Kate took an even more surprising step.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm going to clean this one up too.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;Eh? What do you mean &#8213; Hold on, that's!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Before he could stop her, she buried her face between Dino's legs and sucked the half-standing glans into her mouth.</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;Nnhh, suuck, suuuuckkk&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The sight of the girl with the red shortcut swinging, sucking on the penis, and swallowing the semen was so lewd that it made him forget that she was dressed as a man.</p>
<p>(Oh my God, I can't believe she's doing it with her mouth... Oh, shit, that feels so good...)</p>
<p>&#12288;Every time her tongue tangled with the penis, pleasure hit him like a tidal wave, and he could feel his penis, which had lost half its firmness due to the ejaculation, becoming hard again.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl with the penis in her mouth couldn't have been unaware of this, and once she stopped the movement in her mouth, she looked up at Dino.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sorry for the lack of moderation ...... But If it was done orally&#8213;Guhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;To Dino's apology, the girl smiled softly, as if to say she didn't mind and resumed her oral service.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnmghhhh, sluuuuuurppp.....sluurp, sluuuuurppp, suuuck!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Her tongue twines around and sucks the glans, not to clean the manhood covered in semen and saliva, but as a mouthwash clearly intended to give pleasure.</p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/quUVjAG.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="568" height="800" src="https://i.imgur.com/quUVjAG.jpg" width="568" /></a></div><br />
			<p>&#12288;Saliva tangled and the <span>slurping</span> sounds leaked from the girl's well-groomed lips, getting him more excited and stimulated than ever before. The pleasure of the first blowjob was unimaginable, and he felts like he was going to fall off his back.</p>
<p>(Kate's mouth is so slimy and so hot that it almost burns)</p>
<p>&#12288;The urge to fit his meat stick inside the girl was fulfilled, and he was more than excited, he was happy.</p>
<p>&#12288;A second ejaculation was just around the corner as heated tongues entwined around the glans, sometimes sucking on it.</p>
<p>&#12288;His heart pounded in his chest as he watched the girl engrossed in his penis so much that he could hardly believe it was her first time. Her face was moving up and down, her lips were pursed, and she was sucking the penis.</p>
<p>&#12300;Kate, if you do that to me, I'm going&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When the girl screams out, unable to resist the pleasure that threatens to bring him to his knees, a finger joins in the girl's oral service with pleasure.</p>
<p>&#12288;She stimulated the tip of the penis with her lips and tongue and then squeezed the base of the rod with her fingers to make a circle around it. The pleasure becomes stronger and his hips float. The rod bounces in the girl's mouth and touches the back of her throat.</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;Nnbghh, Nnmmghhhhh, nnghhh, <span style="font-style: italic;">cough-cough</span>, haaah, nnfgghhhh&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl choked greatly, but she never let her lips go and did not stop serving, struggling to hold back her bitterness.</p>
<p>(Why do serve me so much?)</p>
<p>&#12288;Although he is confused and unable to understand the reason for her devoted service, he almost forgets it due to the pleasure he is soon to be given.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sluuuurp, nnchuuu, suck-suuuck, sluuuurppp&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The more the sucking increases, the greater the stimulation and the more his hips move. His desire for more of this pleasure clashes with his desire to release his semen and dirty Kate's mouth as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&#12288;He continued to receive oral services without being able to choose between the two.</p>
<p>&#12288;The feeling of ejaculation, the second of its kind, was already close at hand, and any further stimulation would soon unleash his desire.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sluuurp, nnrllpp, chuu, suuuck, pwahh ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As the suction increases, a wave of pleasure washes over his hips. Kate's lips once leave the penis to catch her breath, and she smiles as she regains her breath.</p>
<p>&#12288;The sight of her mouth, throat, and chest wet with her own undrinkable saliva is more than enough to arouse arousal, even if she is wearing a men's uniform.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even if the slender girl sitting on his inner thighs at the base of his own feet was wearing a men's uniform, the scent of a female in heat could not be concealed.</p>
<p>(How had I never noticed that Kate was a girl before?)</p>
<p>&#12288;She continues to slowly squeeze, never taking her hand off the meat stick, even as she regulates her breathing.</p>
<p>&#12288;The penis stimulated to the point that it could reach its limit at any moment, is bouncing around in the girl's hand, wanting to ejaculate as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl gently moves closer to Dino's ear.</p>
<p>&#12300;You can always let it ou anytime. ...... I'll drink it for you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When she spoke the words with a hot breath, she brought her lips close to the meat stick again and opened her mouth wide, and swallowed it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnmhh, aammhh, sluuurp, sluurp, sluuuuuurpppp, suuckk-sluuurpppp&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The slurp and obscene sound echo, and he gets the illusion that pleasure is coming up to his ears.</p>
<p>&#12288;The feeling of ejaculation is so intense that he's not sure when he will reach his limit, and the girl tells him that she doesn't care when he ejaculates.</p>
<p>(I want to be served more by Kate! I want to keep tasting more of Kate's mouth!)</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's oral services increase in vigor as if she is unaware of such struggles of the boy.</p>
<p>&#12288;She slides the tip of her tongue into the bell mouth and stimulates even the most sensitive parts of the mouth. Not content with this, the girl then crawls her tongue along the underside of the penis and carefully caresses it by moving her tongue along the hollows, which is so pleasurable that it melts the boy's brain.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's tongue would no longer touch everything on the penis. This is not the act of a boy who, until recently, had been mistaken about her gender, let alone dating, and a girl who had lied about her gender.</p>
<p>(I know I shouldn't, but I can't resist!)</p>
<p>&#12300;Sluuurp, nnchuuu, slluurrrrrrppppp&#8213;Nnnmhmhhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He founds himself putting his hand on Kate's head, who was engrossed in serving. Because of this, the tip of the penis reached the back of the girl's throat.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl moaned in pain, but she showed no sign of stopping. On the contrary, she even stimulates the glans with her throat. The limit of the boy's desire was reached by the unknown stimulation and the healthy way she served him.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sorry, it's coming out!&#12301;</p>
<p><i>&#12288;&#8213;Byrururu, byuruuu, byurururururu</i></p>
<p>&#12300;Nnmmuuuhhhnnnnnn, Nnmmhghhhhh&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;An unbelievable amount of ejaculate was released directly into the back of the girl's throat for the second time.</p>
<p>&#12288;The girl's body trembled slightly as the penis pulsed two or three times as if he had not enough after just one ejaculation.</p>
<p>&#12288;With the boy's hand on her head, she has no choice but to swallow the cum. But instead of making a disgusted face, she happily clears her throat and takes it all in.</p>
<p>&#12300;S-sorry, Kate, are you okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When the boy finished ejaculating, he realized that he was holding the girl's head and hurriedly removed his hand, and the girl removed her mouth from the penis, coughing repeatedly.</p>
<p>&#12288;The sight of the mixture of semen and saliva, which even seems to have coagulated, dripping from her lips is obscene but beautiful. You will never again be able to mistake her for a boy.</p>
<p>&#12288;When the girl regained her breathing and swallowed to show off the semen and saliva remaining in her mouth, her cheeks reddened, and flushed a little in embarrassment.</p>
<p>&#12300;That's a lot of cum. ...... Did my mouth feel good?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The boy simply nodded his head. Kate's smile deepened and she slowly leaned in closer.</p>
<p>&#12288;As he takes in the girl's slender body, he feels a twinge of guilt for having ejaculated twice without being able to resist the pleasurable sensation.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't apologize, it's what I wanted. And besides.......no, it's nothing.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It would have been easier if the girl had blamed him, but he felts no anger from her. On the contrary, he found himself wondering why she even had a somewhat satisfied expression on her face.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a few moments of silence, Dino felt awkward and tried to open his mouth, but a finger gently covered his lips.</p>
<p>&#12288;Facing Dino, who is confused.</p>
<p>&#12300;Now we have a secret from each other.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate smiles happily.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino doesn't understand what she's thinking, and his confusion only grows.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, he became aware that his desire to taste Kate again was just as strong as his confusion.</p>
