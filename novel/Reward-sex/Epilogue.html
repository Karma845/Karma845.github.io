<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>&#12288;A year had quickly passed since Dino Turner was united with the three girls, and the four had graduated from the academy.</p>
<p>&#12288;The fact that the Hero Kate Brennan and the Magic Sword contractor Akira Konoe had stopped wearing men's clothes surprised many students, but they were accepted without major problems. This was partly thanks to Tiana Lintner's prior groundwork.</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate and Akira spent the rest of their school years as girls, making lots of friends and graduating with satisfaction.</p>
<p>&#12288;After successfully completing &#12302;The Great Battle of the Prairie&#12303;, Tiana suggested that Kate and Akira go to their families on the battlefield to tell them that they would no longer be dressed as men. Of course, their families were very surprised. Kate's family, in particular, was furious at first when it was explained that she had a relationship with a boy named Dino, but they were calmed by their daughter's words of thanks that everything would be all right.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, they somehow had to fight to see if Dino, who had suddenly taken a lover and even touched another girl, could make their daughter happy, but Dino put up a good fight and was recognized by Kate's family.</p>
<p>&#12288;As for Akira's family, things went too easily. They had trained her hard, but they had never expected her to say she was going to give up on being a woman, and they says "Well done for turning her back into a girl!" They were so grateful. Dino was also stunned by this.</p>
<p>&#12288;Tiana, of course, introduced her parents to the girls who shared Dino's feelings, but her parents approved of the boy, partly because he had played a major role in the &#12302;Great Battle of the Prairie&#12303;. It seems that there were advantages to having a family with a hero and a Magic Sword contractor, not to mention the name of bringing him into the family, since, as Tiana had predicted, countries and organizations were moving under the radar to try to extract him.</p>
<p>&#12288;Then, Dino's polygamy was approved.</p>
<p>&#12288;The country did not want to pull out its best people either. Moreover, in Dino's case, it was also significant that he was loved by a hero, a Magic Sword contractor, and a Countess, so it was expected to be a catastrophe if he was pulled out.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was not only the girls in men's clothes that changed.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino is probably the one who has changed the most. The boy who saw the hero as rivals is no longer anywhere to be found, and his personality has softened and he has made more friends in battle. Many students admired his courageous performance in &#12302;The Great Battle of the Prairie&#12303;.</p>
<p>&#12288;As he neared graduation, he found out that Tiana was pregnant, and this was the occasion for Dino to officially marry Kate, Akira, and Tiana.</p>
<p>&#12288;After graduation, Dino earned the two names of "Magic Swordsman" and was asked to join a different group of heroes than Kate, which he accepted. He now wields his power to the fullest, protecting many people.</p>
<p>&#12288;Because he wanted to be close to his family, he chose to join a group of heroes whose scope of activities was within the country, and he devoted himself to the defense of his country. When he is not out on missions, he is an instructor at his alma mater, focusing on human resource development.</p>
<p>&#12288;He has become good friends with Kate's family, who call him their son-in-law and brother-in-law. Akira's family and Tiana's family also treat him like a son, and Dino, who had no family of his own, is happy to see them.</p>
<p>&#12288;And now...</p>
<p>&#12300;I would love to make something hand knitted for my daughter, but was I this clumsy?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After graduation, Akira fulfilled her dream of becoming a member of the Order of the Knights, but she is now pregnant. She struggles with her unfamiliar knitting in the mansion Dino has prepared to live with their newborn children.</p>
<p>&#12300;Look, daddy's home! Oh, I wonder if you're saying welcome home, you kicked me in the stomach!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Kate was pregnant as well, and her heroic work was on hiatus. She wondered if it was okay to take a break from being a hero, but was relieved when the church was greatly pleased that it was a good thing to increase the lineage of heroes. Now, her parents, who could be described as parental idiots, and her brother, who is a siscon, are not at all happy to have a new family member, and they visit her at the mansion every day.</p>
<p>&#12300;Welcome home. Please wait a moment, the meal will be ready soon.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Tiana is about to give birth, but she is in charge of the housework by herself. She is determined to protect her family as long as her ex-girlfriends and her husband are protecting the country, and she is doing her best as the real housekeeper.</p>
<p>&#12288;She is trying her best to be a real wife, and she is trying her best to make the girls learn housework little by little, and to make them into proper women, not only on the outside but also on the inside.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dino is prepared to continue fighting to keep his beloved girls, whose bellies are getting bigger, and to keep this happiness alive.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Even if you are not a hero, you should do what you have to do</span>&#8213;The boy who was stubbornly eager to defeat the hero became an adult when he met girls whom he truly cherished.</p>
<p>&#12288;He has a new family and each day is fresh and fast-paced, but he is definitely happy.</p>

<p>&#12288;&#8213;It was an awkward relationship that began when Dino discovered his rival's secret, but Dino and his family were definitely happy, blessed with a loved one and an important family.</p>
