Seek”?</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span lang=EN>A Game with two dictating roles. One is
of a ‘child’ who hides in their favorite place while another being; a ‘demon’
who finds this child. It is a simple and easy to understand game. A game which
anyone must have experienced at least once in their life.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span lang=EN>Oh yes, right,</span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span lang=EN>An amusing tale of a clumsy dragon god,
who was hiding under the seas while playing hide and seek, inadvertently slept
and let 3000 years pass by…</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span lang=EN>Perhaps, this story found its beginning

never known to have melted in the known history. There stood a rugged ice wall,
as tall as a mountain, blocking the path of any crossing adventurers.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span lang=EN>In this area, there’s an expedition team
working in this snowstorm, working on making a way through the ice wall, when
suddenly one of them shouted with an astonishing voice.</span></p>

12.0pt;margin-left:0in'><span lang=EN>“It came out! But… it’s not a fossil?”</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

able to keep their physiological properties in this temperature of ‘-<span

long.”</span></p>
