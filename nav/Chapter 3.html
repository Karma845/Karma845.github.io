<h1>Chapter 3: As Sara Likes It</h1>


<p>The next day, a dull gray covered the sky from the morning.<br /> <br />Haruya, who arrived at school as usual, pretended to be asleep at his desk, as if trying to block out the sound of the pouring rain.<br /> <br />He listened intently, sharpening his awareness to catch the conversations of the S-class beauties as they echoed through the rain.<br /> <br />He couldn’t help but be curious about Sara’s movements.<br /> <br />Yesterday, Sara had discovered his true identity. Haruya wondered what actions she would take today.<br /> <br />Despite trying not to think about it, he couldn’t help but be concerned about Sara.<br /> <br />Although Haruya had obtained assurances from Sara not to reveal his identity multiple times, he couldn’t fully trust her.<br /> <br />Therefore, with a sense of anxiety and impatience, Haruya kept an eye on the movements of the S-class beauties.<br /> <br />“─Sara-chan, what’s wrong? You seem down.”<br /> <br />“Indeed… your complexion doesn’t look good. Did something happen yesterday?”<br /> <br />“Rin-san, Yuna-san, please don’t worry. I’m okay.”<br /> <br />Seeing Sara, who seemed far from okay, Rin and Yuna exchanged puzzled glances.<br /> <br />They wanted to be supportive, but Sara’s aura clearly conveyed a rejection that they could sense.<br /> <br />However, this was an unconscious aura emitted by Sara, and only a few could perceive it.<br /> <br />─Everyone has things they don’t want others to touch.<br /> <br />Especially the S-class beauties, who often received special treatment because of their exceptional beauty, were adept at reading the atmosphere.<br /> <br />Therefore, they established a clear distance, a definite line not to be crossed, and maintained friendships without intruding into each other’s personal space.<br /> <br />Rin, who would usually engage in love talk without hesitation,<br /> <br />realized from Sara’s gloomy state that this topic had become taboo. Apologizing with a simple “I’m sorry,” Rin shifted the conversation to a neutral topic.<br /> <br />“Hey, hey! By the way, that new product from the store near the station we tried the other day was so delicious!”<br /> <br />“Oh, that shop… it’s really good.”<br /> <br />While discussing such topics, Rin and Yuna cautiously observed Sara’s reactions. When Sara finally noticed their gazes, she hastily put on a smile, as if trying to cover up her true feelings.<br /> <br />“…… We’re friends, you know. “<br /> <br />Rin muttered casually.<br /> <br />“If you’re in trouble, Sara-chan, just tell us. We’ll support you.”<br /> <br />“Yeah… we’ll support you.”<br /> <br />Yuna nodded subtly in agreement.<br /> <br />n response, Sara momentarily shook her eyes, tightly closed her lips, and then bowed her head.<br /> <br />“Thank you very much. But I’m sorry… this is my problem.”<br /> <br />With a polite yet resolute tone,<br /> <br />Sara conveyed her gratitude but made it clear that it was her issue.<br /> <br />Feeling helpless, Rin and Yuna tried their best to steer the conversation to other topics.<br /> <br />(Is Himekawa-san okay?)<br /> <br />(Her complexion is clearly not good…)<br /> <br />(She was smiling so much recently, but suddenly…)<br /> <br />Sara’s classmates expressed their concern,<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Haruya, who had been eavesdropping on their conversation, couldn’t help but express his confusion.<br /> <br />(…Huh? What’s going on?)<br /> <br />he said in a bewildered voice.<br /> <br />Sara’s lack of energy is one thing, but more than anything, Haruya is at a loss as Sara has completely lost interest in talking about love.<br /> <br />Until yesterday, she seemed so happy talking about herself, almost like a toy, making Haruya concerned about her.<br /> <br />(Is it possible that she found out my true identity, that I’m this uncool guy with long, messy bangs?)<br /> <br />Haruya is tempted to interpret it in a positive way.<br /> <br />However, it would still make him sad.<br /> <br />(One thing is for sure, her mental state is definitely unstable.)<br /> <br />Yesterday, Sara had such a charming smile,<br /> <br />but today, it’s clear that something is off.<br /> <br />Seeing Sara’s unstable mental state, Haruya feels a sense of urgency.<br /> <br />(There might be a time when my true identity is revealed… really.)<br /> <br />Haruya is a worrier. It’s such a delicate issue that he has to handle it with extreme caution. It’s a matter of life and death for him.<br /> <br />Even though there’s a promise not to reveal his true identity, it was said by Sara when she was in a stable mental state.<br /> <br />Still, Haruya can’t feel at ease.<br /> <br />Considering Sara’s emotional state and her mental instability, it wasn’t something he could take lightly.<br /> <br />(I’m getting more and more anxious, but maybe I should talk to her about this.)<br /> <br />Haruya decides to seek advice from a certain person.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p> <br />In the early evening of that day, around 6:00 PM.<br /> <br />The sky was tinted with a faint indigo, and if one were to go outside, the lights of houses and street lamps would stand out prominently.<br /> <br />Dressed in a stylish outfit, Haruya visits his favorite cafe.<br /> <br />Kohinata, working as a helper, gets permission from the manager to talk with Haruya during her break, still wearing a maid-like costume.<br /> <br />“─Big brother, what’s wrong? It seems like you have something to discuss with me.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, that’s right. I have something to ask you, Kohinata.”<br /> <br />“Something you want to ask me…? What is it? Love talk?”<br /> <br />In response to Kohinata’s slightly teasing question, Haruya shakes his head in denial.<br /> <br />Then, he looks at her with a serious gaze.<br /> <br />“Kohinata, you value trust in relationships a lot, don’t you?”<br /> <br />“Well, yes…”<br /> <br />She, who loves herself more than anyone else, is not very trusting of others.<br /> <br />She is reluctant to make friends, but she has a few friends whom she genuinely trusts, as Haruya had heard before.<br /> <br />Knowing that Kohinata, who usually doesn’t trust others easily, has built unwavering trust with her friends,<br /> <br />Haruya seeks advice from her. He wants assurance that Sara will never reveal his true identity.<br /> <br />After briefly discussing the details, he asks about how to build such a solid trust. Kohinata coolly suggests,<br /> <br />“It’s easy. Just give the other person an absolute favor.”<br /> <br />Haruya shivers at her colder tone than he expected.<br /> <br />“An absolute favor?”<br /> <br />“Yes. Judging from our conversation, is that person someone with a conscientious personality?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I think so. She has a conscientious personality.”<br /> <br />“If that’s the case, giving her a favor when she’s in trouble is the key to building trust.”<br /> <br />“Give her a favor… I see.”<br /> <br />“Yes, the quickest way is to help her when she’s in trouble. Well, it would be easier if her struggles were visible.”<br /> <br />Kohinata smiles wryly as she says this, but Haruya opens his eyes wide.<br /> <br />Seeing his reaction, Kohinata asks in surprise,<br /> <br />“Wait, is that person in trouble right now?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, surprisingly…”<br /> <br />Locking eyes and nodding at each other, Kohinata pointed her index finger straight towards Haruya, saying, “If that’s the case,” with a determined look.<br /> <br />“I think the key is to help solve that person’s problem.”<br /> <br />Haruya nodded as he listened to Kohinata’s words.<br /> <br />“But you, with such an honest personality, are facing a problem now, huh?”<br /> <br />Kohinata responded as if she had some idea about Haruya’s situation.<br /> <br />“Do you have any idea about it?”<br /> <br />Haruya asked, and she nodded right there on the spot.<br /> <br />“Yes, actually, I have a few friends who are going through similar things…”<br /> <br />Kohinata turned to Haruya with a sense of self-reflection.<br /> <br />“I thought maybe I could help in some way, but it seems like it’s not working.”<br /> <br />“Is that so?”<br /> <br />Feeling a mix of resignation and self-deprecation in her expression, Haruya didn’t know how to respond, so he just nodded. But maybe she sensed his hesitation because she shook her head and said, “But…”<br /> <br />“My friend’s problem is probably something I can’t really do anything about… but as for that person, I think he could be like a white knight for her.”<br /> <br />She wore a gentle smile, and Haruya couldn’t help but tilt his head in confusion.<br /> <br />“That person? I’m not sure, but Kohinata-san… you seem to have hopeful eyes.”<br /> <br />Though he didn’t really understand, Haruya nodded for now and tried to go along with the conversation.<br /> <br />“I hope that person does well,”<br /> <br />“Yes, I hope that person will do their best.”</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/1i1RF1s.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>(Regardless of what I don’t understand, do your best, that person…!)<br /> <br />Internally cheering as if it’s none of his business, Haruya didn’t realize at that moment.<br /> <br />That person Kohinata is referring to is none other than Haruya himself.<br /> </p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p> <br />Outside, the night has already fallen.<br /> <br />Staring through the window at the deepening darkness of the night sky, Sara continues to blame herself.<br /> <br />(…What am I doing?)<br /> <br />Today at school, both Rin and Yuna could see through that she’s not normal.<br /> <br />Despite their concern, Sara pushed them away with harsh words, and even now, she feels disgusted with herself.<br /> <br />(And, if it had been a clear day today, I couldn’t go to the rooftop, but if we had met today…)<br /> <br />She wonders if she has caused trouble for him again.<br /> <br />With such thoughts, Sara’s chest tightens.<br /> <br />(I am Himekawa’s daughter… It can’t be helped.)<br /> <br />With a resigned expression, she sighs lightly.<br /> <br />(It’s not like I lacked confidence…)<br /> <br />Indeed, Haruya praised her homemade lunch, and during their date, he seemed to enjoy himself.<br /> <br />However, Sara wore an expression of resignation and said to herself, “It’s too late now…”<br /> <br />(I can’t allow myself a fateful romance… That’s why, on that day, I had that destined encounter with Akasaki-san, and it triggered some sort of filter in me.)<br /> <br />Unable to have a free-spirited romance, Sara found herself desiring it even more.<br /> <br />Such feelings surfaced after her fateful encounter with Haruya.<br /> <br />(I must have admired it… A fateful… No, to be honest, just a normal sweet romance.)<br /> <br />With this self-analysis, Sara realized that her feelings seemed to lighten.<br /> <br />(So, if I can enjoy a normal romance before the arranged marriage, these feelings will surely subside…)</p>

<p> <br />With this revelation, Sara began listing the romantic things she wanted to experience, thinking of them on the spot.<br /> <br />(Sneaking home after school, studying together, oh, and I’d like to go to the beach.)<br /> <br />Sara started to list things she wanted to do in a normal romance.<br /> <br />Since the list got too long, she narrowed down the realistic options,<br /> <br />realizing that time was running out.<br /> <br />(Going home together, studying, and the beach… maybe?)<br /> <br />She judged that the first three options were more realistic.<br /> <br />(I guess there’s not much time left, so…)<br /> <br />The next day during lunch break, Sara immediately sent a message to Haruya.<br /> <br />[Sorry for bothering you late at night. Can you come to the rooftop during tomorrow’s lunch break? I have one last favor to ask.]<br /> <br />She felt bold about it but knew it was her last chance.<br /> <br />(…Akasaki-san.)<br /> <br />With a somewhat heartbreaking feeling, Sara mentioned the name of her crush in her heart.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>The next day during lunch break.<br /> <br />Haruya, wearing a wicked smile, headed towards the rooftop.<br /> <br />This was because he received a message from Sara the previous night.<br /> <br />The content was about having one last favor to ask.<br /> <br />Though he hadn’t been told the details yet, Haruya was excited about being asked for a favor.<br /> <br />Following Kohinata’s advice, Haruya heard that if he did a favor, he could be confident that his true identity wouldn’t be revealed.<br /> <br />To be honest, with Sara’s current mental state, Haruya couldn’t rule out the possibility of her accidentally revealing his identity.<br /> <br />Therefore, he thought that if he heard Sara’s “last favor” and then asked her not to reveal his true identity, it would work out well.<br /> <br />(…Any wish is fine. I have my own plans anyway.)<br /> <br />Suppressing the emotions he kept inside, Haruya reached the rooftop and prepared to hear Sara’s request.<br /> <br />“Um, could you listen to my request?”<br /> <br />“In essence, you want me to let you do three things that seem like ordinary romantic activities, right?”<br /> <br />“Yes, that’s right.”<br /> <br />“I see.”<br /> <br />The offered list included walking home together, studying together, and going to the beach—three activities.<br /> <br />These are the three wishes.<br /> <br />Haruya was taken aback;<br /> <br />he expected something more challenging.<br /> <br />He thought about asking her to keep his secret in exchange, but he decided it would be more efficient to wait until after hearing Sara’s “last favor.”<br /> <br />Looking at Sara’s anxious eyes, Haruya uttered a simple “Got it.”<br /> <br />In response, Sara’s face lit up, and she expressed her gratitude with a “Thank you very much.”<br /> <br />(…It’s nothing much. It’s just a condition to keep my identity hidden.)<br /> <br />With a forced smile, Sara bowed respectfully.<br /> <br />“So, is it okay to start right after school?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, but I don’t want it to be too noticeable. Can we wait until our classmates have left?”<br /> <br />“Yes, that’s perfectly fine. I had the same intention.”<br /> <br />And so, after school, Haruya and Sara ended up walking home together.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>After school.<br /> <br />Waiting until the number of students going home settled down, Haruya went to the school gate and waited.<br /> <br />Sara hadn’t appeared yet, and after about five minutes of waiting, she finally showed up.<br /> <br />“Sorry for keeping you waiting…”<br /> <br />“No, I wasn’t really waiting.”<br /> <br />They exchanged the usual banter, both looking around nervously.<br /> <br />Haruya was currently in his disguise, presenting his public persona, or rather, his shadowy side.<br /> <br />“Hehe. You really can’t believe that you were the same person. Isn’t your hair too long? I think you should cut it.”<br /> <br />“I get told that a lot, but I feel more comfortable this way.”<br /> <br />Haruya chuckled, and Sara whispered to herself.<br /> <br />(Well, it’s not bad that only I know… )<br /> <br />With a slight distance from Sara, Haruya started walking ahead, concealing the emotions he kept inside.<br /> <br />“…By the way, my house is in the right direction, but what about Himekawa-san?”<br /> <br />“Oh, mine is in the same direction, so please don’t worry about it.”<br /> <br />Haruya nodded, and then he and Sara started heading home.<br /> <br />Just walking home together with Sara made them stand out.<br /> <br />Although they weren’t directly stared at, Haruya could spot students from other schools observing them from a distance.<br /> <br />Just the act of walking home with a beautiful girl heightened the tension.<br /> <br />Sara, watching Haruya’s back as he glanced around, felt her heart pounding.</p>




<p>(Feels like he’s protecting me… This isn’t bad at all.)<br /> <br />Sara struggled to suppress a smile that was threatening to break out.<br /> <br />In the midst of this, fortunately, Haruya didn’t encounter any students from the same school. He breathed a sigh of relief.<br /> <br />Walking cautiously, on alert for almost ten minutes, they finally saw the end of their path where they could relax from the constant watchfulness.<br /> <br />At that moment, Sara abruptly stopped.<br /> <br />Following Sara’s gaze, Haruya noticed a crepe vending truck parked there.<br /> <br />(Seems like she wants to stop…)<br /> <br />Haruya, who honestly wanted to go home right away, thought it wouldn’t hurt to earn some goodwill.<br /> <br />“…How about having crepes?”<br /> <br />Haruya suggested, and Sara enthusiastically nodded in agreement.<br /> <br />“Sure, let’s go.”<br /> <br />Saying that, they moved towards the crepe stand.<br /> <br />“…These are delicious, Yuna!”<br /> <br />“Yeah, this place is surprisingly good…”<br /> <br />“Too bad Sara-chan couldn’t come.”<br /> <br />“So, Sara has been seeming like she doesn’t want much involvement lately,”<br /> <br />a voice that sounded vaguely familiar to Haruya reached his ears.<br /> <br />Regardless of the conversation’s content, he confirmed they were wearing the same high school uniform, and his face twisted in discomfort.<br /> <br />Both Sara and Haruya shared the same thought at that moment – “Oh no, we need to escape.”<br /> <br />In a rush, they tried to leave the scene, but…<br /> <br />“Eh? Is that Sara?<br /> <br />Why is she trying to run away?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, true. And who’s that guy with her?”<br /> <br />“Huh, I don’t know…”<br /> <br />It seemed they were too slow in their escape.<br /> <br />Sara and Haruya exchanged glances.<br /> <br />(What do we do? Those people are my friends…)<br /> <br />(If we run away here, Himekawa-san will be in trouble too. I have to figure out a way to bluff our way through.)<br /> <br />After silently communicating through eye contact, they resigned themselves and headed towards the S-class beauties – Yuna and Rin.<br /> <br />“Who’s that guy with you, Sara?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, he seems interesting…”<br /> <br />Both of them stared at Haruya with intense curiosity.<br /> <br />(No, no, they’re just classmates from the same class as the S-class beauties.)<br /> <br />Feeling impressed by his own lack of presence, Haruya couldn’t help but make that internal comment.<br /> <br />But more than that, there was a sense of déjà vu in Yuna and Rin’s voices.<br /> <br />(Still, these two voices sound familiar… )<br /> <br />As someone who often frequented the cafe where they worked, discussing their shared interest in shoujo manga,<br /> <br />hese two sounded exactly like those girls.<br /> <br />However, considering the possibility of having three similar-sounding people in the world, Haruya didn’t pay much attention to it.<br /> <br />Seeing Sara struggling with how to explain, he scratched the back of his head and replied to the two girls.<br /> <br />“Well, you see, it’s just that…”<br /> <br />” ” ” ” ……… ” ” “<br /> <br />Sara, along with the S-rank beauties, fixed their eyes on Haruya.<br /> <br />“By chance, we met when I was thinking of buying crepes…”<br /> <br />Haruya nervously explained, and surprisingly, Yuna and Rin nodded, seemingly satisfied.<br /> <br />(Managed to bluff through this one…)<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Now, because it felt a bit awkward to let him go home alone when they’re in the same school, Haruya ended up sharing crepes with the S-Class beauties.<br /> <br />It might seem like a situation that every guy would envy, but to be honest, Haruya felt completely out of place.<br /> <br />“Sarachin, are you really okay now?”<br /> <br />“Yes, I appreciate your concern from yesterday, but I’m fine now.”<br /> <br />“Good to hear. Sara, I’m glad you’re okay.”<br /> <br />After the S-Class beauties finished their conversation, the next focus shifted to Haruya.<br /> <br />“By the way, your hair is soooo long. Don’t you think it would be better to cut it… right, Yuirin?”<br /> <br />“Um, well, I understand what Rin is saying… I won’t deny it.”<br /> <br />Agreeing with Rin’s enthusiastic suggestion, Yuirin nodded vaguely.<br /> <br />“I’ll… consider it.”<br /> <br />“Hahaha, sure, take your time thinking.”<br /> <br />“I don’t mind either way, but… by the way…”<br /> <br />The S-Class beauties talked to Haruya about this much.<br /> <br />Later, the conversation shifted to Sara’s story, and with Sara getting better, they transitioned to discussing love.<br /> <br />“Hey, you over there too, about Sara’s story. Don’t you think this is a fateful encounter?”<br /> <br />When the topic of Sara’s love story came up, Rin asked Haruya.<br /> <br />“Ah, please stop.”<br /> <br />In response, Sara blushed and looked down.<br /> <br />Of course, that was expected. Being told it’s a fateful encounter right in front of the person involved.<br /> <br />Haruya, on the other hand, blushed in embarrassment due to the shame play.<br /> <br />Why, you ask…<br /> <br />“He’s amazing, you know. Just hearing about him makes it clear how cool he is. I actually want to see him… that person.”<br /> <br />“I would like to see him too… that person.”<br /> <br />Direct and cliché compliments came from Rin and Yuirin, respectively.<br /> <br />“(Hey, what kind of torture is this…)”<br /> <br />“(Ugh… this is way too embarrassing.)”<br /> <br />Both of them blushed and were dyed in embarassment<br /> </p>



<p> <br />On the way home that day.<br /> <br />There was silence between them on the way back from the crepe shop.<br /> <br />They couldn’t discuss private matters with the other S-Class beauties (Rin and Yuirin) present.<br /> <br />“Ah, then I’ll go this way.”<br /> <br />And when the paths diverged, Haruya and the S-Class beauties parted ways.<br /> <br />Sara discreetly waved her hand in this direction, making sure the others didn’t notice.<br /> <br />In response, Haruya nodded slightly and then changed his direction and began walking.<br /> <br />While walking alone on the way home, his phone buzzed with a notification.<br /> <br />It was a message from Sara.</p>


		
		
<p>[Sorry for today, but walking home together felt like a normal and fun date. There were some mishaps though…]<br>&nbsp;<br>Haruya, after checking the message, smiled wryly as he replied.<br>&nbsp;<br>[Yeah… well, I enjoyed it too. How about walking home together again next time?]<br>&nbsp;<br>[Yes. If something like today happens again… that would be nice. Next time, let&#8217;s focus on studying, okay?]<br>&nbsp;<br>[Got it.]<br>&nbsp;<br>After this brief exchange, Haruya put away his phone.<br>&nbsp;<br>(Whether that was really okay… I don&#8217;t know, but… with two more to go, I can finally relax after that…!)<br>&nbsp;<br>Haruya chuckled to himself inwardly.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>&#8220;This is a typical problem with integers, but it requires application.&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Oh, I see. I didn&#8217;t understand at all.&#8221;<br> <br>One afternoon,<br> <br>Haruya, who had been asked to study together, was studying with Sara on the rooftop.<br> <br>And now, Sara was explaining in a clear and understandable way about the area Haruya didn&#8217;t understand.<br> <br>Although Sara&#8217;s explanation was easy to understand, Haruya noticed something.<br> <br>(Himekawa-san… she really pays attention to her surroundings.)<br> <br>Haruya didn&#8217;t appeal that he didn&#8217;t understand this particular problem.<br> <br>But when he stopped and struggled, Sara explained from the side.<br> <br>&#8220;Himekawa-san seems to pay attention to her surroundings.&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;…Eh, why are you suddenly saying that?&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;No, I just admired it.&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Ah, thank you.&#8221;<br> <br>She nodded honestly, and she smiled modestly.<br> <br>They continued to study together, and at a convenient stopping point, the two took a break.<br> <br>&#8220;Oh, is that Tetris?&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Yeah, I play it during breaks when I have time…&#8221;<br> <br>Haruya started the Tetris app and began playing, and Sara commented.<br> <br>Oh …… That&#8217;s where the T-spin is ……)<br> <br>Sara looks at Haruya&#8217;s Tetris and a feeling of frustration starts to swirl in her chest.<br> <br>Sara was an experienced Tetris player. She was one of the top players.<br> <br>&#8220;Oh… I lost.&#8221;<br> <br>Haruya was defeated by an opponent he was competing against online.<br> <br>Seeing Haruya losing, Sara felt frustration welling up inside her.<br> <br>&#8220;Maybe, Himekawa-san… would you like to try Tetris?&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;…Uh, yes. I can do it.&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Beginners all say that, but it&#8217;s quite difficult… this.&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Leave it to me…&#8221;<br> <br>Despite his confident words, Haruya was momentarily bewildered, but wanting to see Sara&#8217;s skill, he decided to let her play.<br> <br>And the result?<br> <br>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s…!&#8221;<br> <br>Haruya was dumbfounded by Sara&#8217;s lightning-fast movements in Tetris.<br> <br>(What… that incomprehensible speed. I feel like I&#8217;ll never win against her.)<br> <br>As he was puzzled by the speed of Sara&#8217;s Tetris moves, he realized that she had won the first place.<br> <br>Sara silently makes a peace sign and raises the corner of her mouth.<br> <br>(…I&#8217;m sorry for underestimating you.)<br> <br>Apologizing in his mind, Haruya listened as Sara conscientiously explained the tricks of Tetris.<br> <br>&#8220;After you&#8217;ve learned the basic controls, it&#8217;s all about practice. There are basic patterns, so practice until you can master them completely…&#8221;<br> <br>Sara&#8217;s explanation might be the most accurate, but in Haruya&#8217;s eyes…<br> <br>(No, that&#8217;s the answer of a hardcore player…)<br> <br>After that,<br> <br>Haruya closes Tetris for a while and starts a kart racing app, where he competes for rankings by driving a virtual car.<br> <br>Haruya, now behind the wheel, finds it challenging to control the kart by tilting his phone left and right.<br> <br>While Haruya struggles with the controls, Sara, unlike during Tetris, watches the screen with genuine interest.<br> <br>&#8220;Wanna try this too?&#8221;<br> <br>he asks, and Sara nods eagerly.<br> <br>With a slightly tense expression, this game seems to be her first experience, unlike Tetris.<br> <br>Haruya hands over his phone to Sara, and as she starts playing, she not only uses her hands but also involves her whole body in the gameplay.<br> <br>When she wants to turn right, her whole body shifts to the right,<br> <br>and when she wants to turn left, she moves her entire body to the left.<br> <br>Every time she does this, a pleasant fragrance stimulates Haruya&#8217;s nose.<br> <br>(…Her reactions are cute every time.)<br> <br>Haruya is surprised to find himself thinking this way.<br> <br>Distracted by Sara&#8217;s actions, she pouts and asks,<br> <br>&#8220;Akasaki san, is this difficult? Can I try again?&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Yeah, sure.&#8221;<br> <br>And so begins Sara&#8217;s kart game.<br> <br>First attempt: She turns her body to the right at the wrong timing for a left turn, causing damage to the car.<br> <br>Second attempt: This time, she turns her body to the left at the wrong timing for a right turn, resulting in a major crash.<br> <br>[GAME OVER] appears on the screen, accompanied by the original clown character laughing and taunting.</p>




<p>&#8220;Ugh, what&#8217;s with this clown…!&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;…The taunting ability of that clown is annoyingly high.&#8221;<br> <br>This game is known as a difficult one,<br> <br>and the high taunting level of the clown adds to the frustration.<br> <br>&#8220;Akasaki san, it&#8217;s frustrating. Can I try again?&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;We should probably get back to studying soon…&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;This will be the last time, I promise!&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Fine…&#8221;<br> <br>Haruya almost wants to ask her to move away.<br> <br>Sara&#8217;s gameplay is distracting, making it hard for him to focus on studying.<br> <br>However, Sara unconsciously grabs the hem of Haruya&#8217;s clothes and looks up at him with puppy eyes.<br> <br>&#8220;Is it not allowed?&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Fine…&#8221;<br> <br>His true feelings would be a straightforward &#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s not allowed.&#8221; However, his current goal is to owe Sara a favor<br> <br>and ensure that she won&#8217;t reveal his identity.<br> <br>For now, in Haruya&#8217;s mind, Sara is not just Sara but also Sara-sama, the daughter of a noble family.<br> <br>He must comply with any request she makes.<br> <br>As a result…<br> <br>&#8220;Ugh, this clown is really infuriating…!&#8221;<br> <br>Getting frustrated repeatedly, Sara seems like she might throw the phone on the floor when…<br> <br>&#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s my phone!&#8221;<br> <br>Suddenly, Haruya finds himself using unexpected energy.<br> <br>In the end, the second study session with Sara&#8217;s request turns into more of a gaming session.<br> </p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>After the incident through messages:<br>&nbsp;<br>[Sorry again for this. It turned into a gaming session instead of a study session.]<br>&nbsp;<br>[Well, if you enjoyed it, that&#8217;s good.]<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;I can&#8217;t forgive this clown…!&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Frustrated, Sara sends a stamp of an angry rabbit.<br>&nbsp;<br>[Since the study session is over, next…]<br>&nbsp;<br>[The beach, right?]<br>&nbsp;<br>Thus, at Sara&#8217;s last request to go to the beach, Haruya and Sara head towards the sea, taking a train and swaying along the way.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>**<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;<br>Another day after school:<br>&nbsp;<br>In order to fulfill Sara&#8217;s last request to go to the sea, Haruya and Sara use the train, swaying as they head towards the beach.<br>&nbsp;<br>By the way, Haruya&#8217;s current appearance is the stylish side, the fashionable look he shows when going out.<br>&nbsp;<br>This is because Sara requested him to dress nicely.<br>&nbsp;<br>Currently, Haruya feels like he&#8217;s Sara&#8217;s butler, so he refrains from giving any verbal responses.<br>&nbsp;<br>While swaying in the train, Sara whispers something to Haruya in a low voice.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;…Going like this makes my heart race.&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#8220;Yeah, about the school uniform…&#8221;<br>&nbsp;<br>Now, Haruya and Sara are wearing the uniform of Eika High School.<br>&nbsp;<br>Apparently, the beach requires wearing the school uniform, according to Sara.<br>&nbsp;<br>Haruya didn&#8217;t really understand, but it seemed important to Sara.<br>&nbsp;<br>Therefore, not on a holiday but after school, Sara specified going to the beach.<br>&nbsp;<br>Also, the evening sea with the school uniform supposedly looks great.<br>&nbsp;<br>Haruya agreed with her.<br>&nbsp;</p>



<p> <br>In the end, about 30 minutes on the train, they walk a little from the station, and finally, they arrive at the beach.<br> <br>The sea stretches endlessly, and the sea breeze is refreshingly pleasant.<br> <br>&#8220;…Wow, it&#8217;s beautiful.&#8221;<br> <br>Sara murmurs with admiration, and the surface of the sea reflects the sunset, creating a beautiful boundary that extends far.<br> <br>Haruya, too, is captivated by it, and a smile involuntarily forms on his lips.<br> <br>Then, Sara walks alone towards the sandy beach and looks back at Haruya.<br> <br>&#8220;Akasaki san, the sunset is really beautiful.&#8221;<br> <br>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s incredibly beautiful.&#8221;<br> <br>Responding loudly to Sara&#8217;s enthusiastic declaration, Haruya also finds himself entranced.<br> <br>Come here, Akasaki-san! It feels so good.&#8221;<br> <br>Unnoticed, Sara had taken off her shoes and socks, burying her feet in the damp sand.<br> <br>Now, as Sara-sama, Haruya walked towards the sea as instructed by Sara.<br> <br>Approaching Sara, he felt a silent pressure from her.<br> <br>Haruya, like Sara, took off his shoes and socks, burying his feet in the sand and then immersing them in the seawater.<br> <br>&#8220;Oh, it does feel good…&#8221;<br> <br>A cool sensation spread throughout his feet.<br> <br>In this warm spring season, Haruya thought it would be even more enjoyable in the summer.<br> <br>Swoosh, swoosh.<br> <br>Enjoying the sound and scenery of the ocean waves, Sara, somewhat fidgety, asked Haruya with a shy demeanor.<br> <br>&#8220;Um… uh…&#8221;<br> <br>Upon hearing Sara&#8217;s voice, Haruya turned around, looking at her.<br> <br>Meeting Haruya&#8217;s gaze, Sara tightly clenched her fists in front of her chest and earnestly made her request to Haruya.<br> <br>&#8220;I, as I mentioned, wanted to experience things like a normal romance…&#8221;<br> <br>Haruya, without saying much, nodded slightly, urging her to continue.<br> <br>&#8220;So, I, uh, wanted to do things like splashing water on each other or playing tag… Is that okay?&#8221;<br> <br>Sara earnestly requested this from Haruya.<br> <br>Haruya silently agreed to Sara&#8217;s request, but internally thought, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s quite embarrassing…&#8221;<br> <br>Fortunately, it was a weekday in the spring at the beach, and there was no one else around, which was a relief.<br> <br>Not knowing how to start their little game, Sara, somewhat embarrassed, began to splash water on Haruya with awkward movements.<br> <br>Haruya found Sara&#8217;s inexperience endearing and said, &#8220;Well done,&#8221; as he decided to splash water back.<br> <br>Splash, splash, splash.<br> <br>The two enjoyed splashing water on each other, laughing happily.<br> <br>Although internally Haruya was filled with embarrassment, he remained calm and unperturbed, thinking, &#8220;Someone, kill me…&#8221;<br> <br>Objectively, it was the sight of two individuals embracing youth.<br> <br>After finishing their water play, they moved on to playing tag in the sandy beach.<br> <br>Haruya suppressed his embarrassment and played along naturally to avoid looking too forced. Sara seemed satisfied judging by her expressions.<br> <br>After having their share of fun, Haruya and Sara settled down to enjoy the scenery around them.<br> <br>&#8220;Akasaki-san, thank you so much for everything.&#8221;<br> <br>Suddenly expressing gratitude, Sara gave Haruya a small, quiet smile.<br> <br>However&#8230;.</p>

<p>Haruya could see various emotions mixed in Sara’s eye<br /> <br />—anxiety, fear, self-deprecation, all negative sentiments.<br /> <br />“…Is it over now?”<br /> <br />“Yes, it’s enough… I think I was able to enjoy a normal romance.”<br /> <br />Sara briefly reflected on their time together.<br /> <br />“At first, you saved me from a pickup… and then we happened to meet again, found out we’re in the same class… Looking back, the probability was unbelievable,”<br /> <br />Sara said, making Haruya realize the incredible odds objectively.<br /> <br />“I was drawn to the idea of a fateful encounter… That’s why I asked Akasaki-san to mimic a normal romance for me… I’ve really enjoyed it. Thank you so much.”<br /> <br />Sara bowed her head dutifully, expressing gratitude once again.<br /> <br />While Sara wore a smile, there was a sense that her expression was somewhat strained.<br /> <br />“…And Akasaki-san, I apologize.”<br /> <br />Not understanding what she was apologizing for, Haruya silently prompted her to continue.<br /> <br />Then, Sara continued in a delicate voice.<br /> <br />“I had selfish reasons… I deceived Akasaki-san and imposed my own desires.”<br /> <br />During this time, Sara’s gaze never met Haruya’s face.<br /> <br />Whether it was a sense of guilt or an unsettled state of mind,<br /> <br />Sara appeared somewhere uneasy.<br /> <br />Haruya decided to express his honest opinion,<br /> <br />as she might be misunderstanding something.<br /> <br />“Thanks, Himekawa-san…”<br /> <br />Feeling a bit embarrassed, Haruya thanked Sara.<br /> <br />Not expecting words of gratitude, Sara widened her eyes but seemed to realize that Haruya wasn’t lying and fell silent.<br /> <br />Haruya continued,<br /> <br />“I also somehow (despite various things) managed to enjoy this relationship.”<br /> <br />Certainly, there were many times when he wanted to escape or found things troublesome, but looking back, those days weren’t too bad.<br /> <br />With a wry smile, Haruya said, “…Thanks for that.”<br /> <br />Sara bit her lower lip as if in response and then tightly gripped her chest, as if appealing for something.<br /> <br />“…… I have no right to …… I don’t deserve to be told that.”<br /> <br />Sara said, her voice trembling.<br /> <br />Although on the verge of tears, she forcefully declared,<br /> <br />“I acted selfishly… deceiving Akasaki-san and forcing my own circumstances onto you.”<br /> <br />Sara was on the verge of tears, but she said strongly.<br /> <br />“What’s going on?”<br /> <br />“…huh.”<br /> <br />Sara exhaled quietly, her face contorted, and she tightly clenched her shoulders, leaving nail marks on them.<br /> <br />“To be honest, I knew. I knew that I would have an arranged marriage, that I wouldn’t be allowed the freedom of love. Yet, I selfishly pushed all of this onto Akasaki san.”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />A heavy silence fell.<br /> <br />Thinking that Haruya was disappointed in her, Sara either feared his reaction or simply bowed her head.<br /> <br />Haruya listened to Sara’s story without expressing sympathy, just calmly taking in her words.<br /> <br />Eventually, a tear rolled down Sara’s cheek.<br /> <br />Unbeknownst to him, Sara’s body was trembling intensely.<br /> <br />“…that’s why I have no right to receive such warm words.<br /> <br />I’m the worst.<br /> <br />I’m ugly.<br /> <br />I’m despicable.<br /> <br />So, please don’t thank me,” Sara earnestly pleaded.<br /> <br />She wiped away her tears while keeping her head bowed.<br /> <br />During this vulnerable moment, Haruya caught a glimpse of Sara’s ample figure.<br /> <br />Despite Sara’s confession catching him somewhat off guard, Haruya couldn’t bring himself to blame her.<br /> <br />At least not when he, too, was in a position of trying to use Sara.<br /> <br />“…Himekawa-san.”<br /> <br />When he called her name, Sara’s body twitched, and she timidly raised her face.<br /> <br />However, her gaze still couldn’t meet Haruya’s.<br /> <br />“…even after hearing that, I can’t blame Himekawa-san. After all, I also used a ‘fake name’ to deceive Himekawa-san.”<br /> <br />“But, still…”<br /> <br />Sara seemed like she wanted to continue speaking,<br /> <br />but there was something she couldn’t bring herself to say.<br /> <br />Haruya told her with a pained expression,<br /> <br />“I understand that Himekawa-san has her reasons. Besides, living in such a strict family and trying to control oneself, that’s not something easy to do. At least, I wouldn’t be able to endure it.”<br /> <br />In the tumultuous period of adolescence,<br /> <br />having to live a restrained life while surrounded by the freedom of school would be unbearable for Haruya.<br /> <br />The only future he could envision for himself was one of rebellion.<br /> <br />“It’s not like you did anything wrong. In a way, Himekawa-san just showed a bit of vulnerability. It’s just that. I don’t mind, and you shouldn’t mind either.”<br /> <br />Haruya didn’t know the details of Sara’s family situation.<br /> <br />However, he could imagine the image of a traditional and strict household.<br /> <br />It might be okay to be a bit spoiled, Haruya thought.<br /> <br />But in Sara’s case, perhaps she didn’t know how to show vulnerability due to growing up in such a strict environment.<br /> <br />It seemed like she was mentally struggling.<br /> <br />“Why… why are you… being so kind?”<br /> <br />“I wouldn’t blame Himekawa-san. Besides, if I were a child in Himekawa-san’s family, I would definitely turn into a delinquent.”<br /> <br />So, Haruya couldn’t blame her, and he said it with a slightly embarrassed smile.<br /> <br />It wasn’t a confident statement, but Haruya asserted it.<br /> <br />At that moment, Sara couldn’t bear it any longer and threw herself at Haruya.<br /> <br />She seemed to have lost the strength to pretend to be tough.<br /> <br />“…Why… why are you like this?”<br /> <br />Haruya felt Sara repeatedly hitting his chest. But it didn’t hurt at all.<br /> <br />Sara, who still seemed to carry a painful emotion, couldn’t hold back anymore.<br /> <br />“…Why… How am I supposed to respond when you speak so kindly to me?”<br /> <br />She continued to lightly pound on Haruya’s chest. Still, Haruya didn’t embrace her, didn’t put his hand on her shoulder. He simply accepted it.<br /> <br />“…If you speak so kindly to me, what should I do? I was supposed to say goodbye with a smiling face… but I can’t even do that…”<br /> <br />Sara has an arranged meeting scheduled soon. She probably wanted to part ways with a smile. Yet, because of Haruya’s kind words, she found herself struggling.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/OXGC2Dw.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p></p>Even though she wanted to say goodbye, it seemed increasingly impossible.<br /> <br />To be precise, she was starting to dislike the idea of parting ways.<br /> <br />Emotions with nowhere to go clashed warmly against Haruya’s chest.<br /> <br />“…I hate this dirty side of myself. So, even though I don’t deserve those words from you…”<br /> <br />Her eyes moistened, Sara tightly grasped Haruya’s chest.<br /> <br />Once Sara confirmed that she had calmed down, Haruya smiled with a slightly lowered brow.<br /> <br />“I think it’s not true. Since Himekawa-san has friends who like her just the way she is.”<br /> <br />Sara’s charming smile… Haruya found himself drawn to it.<br /> <br />Because of that, he straightforwardly denied Sara’s statement.<br /> <br />“…Th-that’s not…”<br /> <br />Sara let her gaze wander, but when she lifted her face, their eyes met. And they stayed connected.<br /> <br />Whether there was no lie in Haruya’s words or not, Sara blushed and buried her face in Haruya’s chest.<br /> <br />“…You’re unfair, Akasaki san.”<br /> <br />“I’m not a guy who can do all that. I’m just not.”<br /> <br />“Yeah…”<br /> <br />However, Sara smiled faintly and continued.<br /> <br />“…Even so, I can’t help but feel happy when you say such kind things to me.”<br /> <br />With a lingering expression of sorrow, Sara murmured. The smile on her face was not a bright one.<br /> <br />…Just one step away.<br /> <br />To dispel Sara’s sorrow, just one step more…<br /> <br />The imminent arranged marriage was likely hindering that “one step.”<br /> <br />(If I can remove that obstacle, I can owe a favor to Himekawa-san, and…)<br /> <br />Completely revealing my true identity won’t be a concern anymore, Haruya thought, boosting his excitement inwardly.<br /> <br />“About the arranged marriage, I will go to Himekawa-san’s house.”<br /> <br />“…Eh?”<br /> <br />Upon hearing Haruya’s words, Sara seemed taken aback, as if it was an unexpected statement.<br /> <br />“I’ll go to Himekawa-san’s house and stop the arranged marriage. Even if Himekawa-san’s parents are strict, opinions from those around might change things.”<br /> <br />“I-It’s impossible…! I’ve never even talked back to my father. Such selfishness is not allowed!”<br /> <br />Such selfishness is not allowed. That’s true.<br /> <br />But even if it’s wrong… nothing will change if you don’t act.<br /> <br />Haruya, with a serious gaze, asked Sara.<br /> <br />“What does Himekawa-san want? Do you really want the arranged marriage? I can’t really believe that, but…”<br /> <br />“My feelings don’t matter. I was born into the Himekawa family.”<br /> <br />With a weak voice, Sara avoided eye contact with Haruya.<br /> <br />“What do you really feel, Himekawa-san?”<br /> <br />Repeating that question, Haruya continued when Sara bit her lip and tightly gripped her chest.<br /> <br />“I… I actually don’t want an arranged marriage. I want a free, destined love.”<br /> <br />After expressing her true feelings, Sara continued,<br /> <br />“But when faced with my father, I can’t do anything. Talking back is out of the question!”<br /> <br />Sadly, painfully, and while clutching her chest, she continued.<br /> <br />“But, if I’m with Akasaki-san, I might be able to overcome it…”<br /> <br />With teary eyes, Sara looked straight into Haruya’s eyes.<br /> <br />“So… could you cooperate with me…?”<br /> <br />Even if it’s impossible, Haruya wanted to believe. He wanted to rely on it.<br /> <br />Such feelings overflowed from Sara’s inner self.<br /> <br />Without hesitation, Haruya nodded.<br /> <br />“…Let’s fight together.”<br /> <br />“Y-Yes…!”<br /> <br />Haruya saw Sara smile faintly, but deep down, he was secretly amused.<br /> <br />(If this resolves the issue, we should establish an unshakable trust. With this, I can be completely sure that my true identity won’t be exposed.)<br /> <br />That’s how Haruya thought.<br /> <br />…But that was just one of the honest thoughts within him.<br /> <br />He couldn’t ignore Sara’s plea for help, her eyes weakly pleading.<br /> <br />He wished for her liberation from the curse of the arranged marriage.<br /> <br />(…And, well, I want Himekawa-san to face forward.)<br /> <br />After all the interactions he had with her, Haruya couldn’t treat Sara as just another person.<br /> <br />He had seen her kind side, her caring side, and her charming smile.<br /> <br />In addition, he wanted her to smile.<br /> <br />(…I might be getting carried away too.)<br /> <br />The clear sky, the sea, and the tears of a beautiful girl.<br /> <br />Surely, these circumstances were shaping Haruya’s current emotions.<br /> <br />Thus, Haruya decided to convince himself that it was just one aspect of his true self.</p>
