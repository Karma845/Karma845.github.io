<h1>Chapter 4: Himekawa Sara</h1>


<p> <br />Several days have passed since the decision to visit Sara’s family.<br /> <br />Haruya and Sara rode the train, swaying gently as they headed to Sara’s family home.<br /> <br />Haruya, strangely, felt no tension, but Sara seemed restless and lacked composure.<br /> <br />“…You seem really nervous,”<br /> <br />Haruya casually nodded to Sara’s words.<br /> <br />Rather than nervousness, Haruya was curious about the strict and traditional household Sara came from.<br /> <br />(What does Himekawa’s family home look like…?)<br /> <br />He wondered if it resembled a luxurious mansion of nobility based on his imagination.<br /> <br />As he let his thoughts wander, Sara, sitting next to him, spoke up on the train.<br /> <br />“Um…”<br /> <br />“Yeah? What’s up?”<br /> <br />“It might be too late to ask, but why do you treat me so well?”<br /> <br />“It’s quite sudden to ask that…”<br /> <br />“Sorry, but I’ve been curious.”<br /> <br />After a brief pause, Sara turned her serious gaze towards Haruya.<br /> <br />“Dealing with someone else’s family issues is usually something people don’t get involved in.”<br /> <br />“I saw someone in trouble in front of me, so I thought I should help. That’s all.”<br /> <br />With that, a sharp gaze was immediately directed at Haruya from the side.<br /> <br />“In the case of Akasaki san, it seems a bit different… Can’t you give me a serious answer?”<br /> <br />Sara asked Haruya without any deception, seemingly seeking a genuine response.<br /> <br />Haruya smiles at her, but she is very perceptive.<br /> <br />Haruya had worked hard so far to avoid revealing his true identity to Sara, but it would be challenging to speak it out loud.<br /> <br />Haruya, with a wry smile, acknowledged Sara’s keen intuition.<br /> <br />“It’s very important to face your family …… “<br /> <br />Sara did not interrupt this time.<br /> <br />that means she is silently urging to go on.<br /> <br />“I’m a bit like Himekawa-san in that sense. A bit distant from my family…”<br /> <br />He spoke with a self-mocking tone, shrugging his shoulders.<br /> <br />Though he didn’t want to dwell on his middle school days, Haruya had his reasons for living alone now.<br /> <br />Skipping the details, Haruya continued,<br /> <br />“I can’t face forward yet, but I wanted Himekawa-san, who is dealing with similar family issues, to face forward.”<br /> <br />After saying just that, Sara, quietly swaying her hair, asked in a subdued manner.<br /> <br />“That’s why Akasaki san, with your long hair and behavior in class, is connected to that… right?”<br /> <br />Haruya, feeling uncomfortable but understanding Sara’s firm assertion, nodded in silence.<br /> <br />Sensing Haruya’s reluctance to discuss further details, Sara didn’t press the matter any further.<br /> <br />The room was silent for a few seconds, then—Clank, clunk, clank, clunk.<br /> <br />After a few seconds of silence, Sara muttered softly.<br /> <br />“In that case, I have to do my best. To help Akasaki san face forward.”<br /> <br />Sara smiled, showing her teeth, seemingly unshaken.<br /> <br />…Haruya felt a slight tremor in her body.<br /> <br />Whether Sara had realized she was a bit scared internally or not, she continued, trying to explain herself.<br /> <br />“I really understand. What I’m going to do from now on is a bit selfish… and the person introduced through the arranged marriage will probably be a good person.”<br /> <br />“…But deep down, your true feelings are different, right?”<br /> <br />“Yes, so I’ll do my best. Thank you for talking to me.”<br /> <br />Sara bowed politely, and after confirming that, Haruya scratched the back of his head uncomfortably, avoiding her pure and innocent eyes.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p> <br />After another thirty minutes on the train, Haruya and Sara finally reached Sara’s family home.<br /> <br />A majestic gate stood proudly in front of a traditional Japanese mansion.<br /> <br />It exuded a robust and dignified presence.<br /> <br />Haruya, still captivated by the appearance of Sara’s family home, watched as Sara walked to the entrance and rang the intercom.<br /> <br />A person resembling a servant, dressed in a traditional kimono, politely greeted Haruya and Sara.<br /> <br />“Welcome back, Miss Sara… Your father has matters to attend to today.”<br /> <br />After bowing to Sara, the person frowned and glanced at Haruya.<br /> <br />“Ah, I see.”<br /> <br />Haruya nodded understandingly, and a gentle smile was directed at him.<br /> <br />(What does this mean…?)<br /> <br />As Haruya looked bewildered, Sara explained to the person who seemed like a servant.<br /> <br />“We came today for my father’s business.”<br /> <br />“I understand… I’ll prepare for the master then.”<br /> <br />“…Thank you.”<br /> <br />Saying so, Sara turned back to Haruya.<br /> <br />“…Was that a servant or something?”<br /> <br />“Yes, a member of the staff. They’ve been working in the Himekawa family for many years.”<br /> <br />Sara casually mentioned it, leaving Haruya surprised. Then, unexpectedly, a voice came from the intercom with only one sentence.<br /> <br />[Preparations are complete, please enter.]<br /> <br />It was the voice of a servant just now.<br /> <br />Sara and Haruya exchange glances and nod at each other.<br /> <br />” …Well then, shall we go in promptly?”<br /> <br />“Uh, yeah.”<br /> <br />Sara takes a deep breath, repeating the process a few times next to Haruya.<br /> <br />From her attitude, it’s evident that Sara is quite nervous.<br /> <br />As the door opens, Haruya is first surprised by the spaciousness of Sara’s family home.<br /> <br />(It’s almost like an inn… you could probably play hide and seek here.)<br /> <br />Glancing around while following Sara, she suddenly stops in front of a large sliding door.<br /> <br />“H-Here…,”<br /> <br />Sara declares with a somewhat nervous voice.<br /> <br />When Haruya nods silently, Sara tentatively addresses the door as if approaching it with caution.<br /> <br />“S-Sorry to intrude… Father.”<br /> <br />“Sara, huh… Come in.”<br /> <br />A dignified voice resonates from behind the sliding door.<br /> <br />Even just from the voice, Haruya senses an imposing presence and involuntarily swallows.<br /> <br />Slowly opening the door and entering, Sara, while avoiding eye contact with her father, steps into the room.<br /> <br />Haruya follows and gently closes the door behind them.<br /> <br />In the traditional Japanese-style mansion, the most important person is sitting in the center of the tatami room with his arms crossed.<br /> <br />To put it bluntly, he looks like a stern, intimidating uncle, Haruya silently evaluates.<br /> <br />Sara’s father, with a sharp and penetrating gaze, first directs it towards Sara and then smoothly shifts it towards Haruya.<br /> <br />Furrowing his brows, Sara’s father questions Haruya.<br /> <br />“…And who might this be?”<br /> <br />Although he asks politely, his intimidating appearance makes Haruya naturally tense.<br /> <br />Unconsciously, his face tightens, and Haruya realizes he’s holding his breath.<br /> <br />Just as Sara hesitates to explain Haruya’s background, Haruya speaks first.<br /> <br />“I’m Haruya Akasaki, a friend of Himekawa-san.”<br /> <br />Sara widens her eyes in surprise, but Sara’s father calmly mutters, “I see.”<br /> <br />Maintaining a strict gaze on both of them, Sara’s father continues to question Haruya.<br /> <br />“So, what business does Sara’s friend have with me?”<br /> <br />A penetrating gaze is fixed on Haruya.<br /> <br />Haruya straightens his spine, exhales quietly, and answers,<br /> <br />“I’m here to listen to Himekawa-san’s concerns… No, I’m here to discuss the arranged marriage.”<br /> <br />Satisfied with Haruya’s words, Sara’s father lets out a small sigh and places his hand on his forehead.<br /> <br />“Indeed, you must have come here to understand Sara’s feelings. But you see, Akasaki-kun, this is a matter for the Himekawa family. It has nothing to do with you. So, shall I ask you to leave?”<br /> <br />Sara’s father, who seems to have grasped everything, glares sternly at Haruya.<br /> <br />Haruya, though feeling a bit overwhelmed, maintained composure and continued to look directly into the other’s eyes.<br /> <br />“Regardless, it does concern me. I’ve been watching Himekawa-san struggling, so it’s not unrelated.”<br /> <br />Giving a somewhat diplomatic response, Haruya noticed Sara’s father exhaling softly.<br /> <br />“Certainly, it’s understandable for friends to worry. However, Akasaki-kun, it’s a parent’s responsibility to firmly guide their child onto the right path. Let’s say we decide not to proceed with Sara’s arranged meeting. Even so, what assurance is there that Sara won’t fall for a bad guy? Can she discern whether a man is good or bad? No, she probably can’t. It’s visible that she could be deceived by a bad adult. But if I choose her partner, it won’t be like that. I’ll only arrange a meeting with someone trustworthy. Can you guarantee that Sara, who can’t even think for herself and express her thoughts, won’t fall for a bad guy?”<br /> <br />Haruya found some validity in Sara’s father’s statement, and he hesitated for a moment.<br /> <br />The truth was, Haruya knew firsthand about Sara’s somewhat blind approach to love. Her father’s remarks seemed reasonable given the circumstances.<br /> <br />Unable to find the right words, Haruya was about to stay silent when, unexpectedly, Sara grabbed the hem of his shirt.<br /> <br />“(I… It’s okay now. Enough.)”</p>


<p>Sara weakly shook her head, wearing an expression of resignation.<br /> <br />Observing Sara’s expression, her father continued.<br /> <br />“That’s how it is. She can’t speak for herself, can’t make the right judgments. She lacks charm. It’s a girl like Sara. It’s the natural duty of a parent to guide their daughter onto the right path.”<br /> <br />Haruya, who had been momentarily tongue-tied, started to glare at Sara’s father with a determined look.<br /> <br />“Oh, what’s with that attitude? Akasaki-kun.”<br /> <br />“A little while ago, you mentioned lacking charm…”<br /> <br />“Ah, yes. Indeed. A small child who can’t make correct judgments on their own. No charm at all. In fact, I’ve never seen Sara with any friends so far.”<br /> <br />Haruya took Sara’s father’s words and confronted him head-on without hesitation.<br /> <br />“Certainly, Himekawa-san has some reckless and naive aspects. I understand the concern about her being risky in romance… But, I can’t agree with your recent statement.”<br /> <br />“…What?”<br /> <br />Sara’s father’s stern face twisted a little and a quizzical look appeared on his face.<br /> <br />Haruya, with a serious expression slightly distorted, met Sara’s father’s puzzled look head-on as he responded.<br /> <br />“A girl lacking charm? There’s no way that’s true!”<br /> <br />His almost angry voice resonated heavily in the room.<br /> <br />…He didn’t quite understand it himself. However, hearing Sara being belittled as lacking charm bothered him.<br /> <br />Decisively, Haruya continued.</p>

<p>“Himekawa-san is attentive and considerate of others. She has a caring heart. Yet… for you, her parent, to say she’s a girl lacking charm, that’s just not right!”<br /> <br />Haruya was probably bringing in his own family background when saying such things.<br /> <br />Sara’s father, astonished, found himself taken aback by Haruya’s unexpectedly passionate words.<br /> <br />After a moment, Sara’s father cleared his throat and spoke.<br /> <br />“I see… Akasaki-kun really cares about Sara. I was wrong to say she lacks charm. Sara… I’m sorry, I should apologize for that.”<br /> <br />Sara’s father apologized with a gentle tone, bowing slightly──<br /> <br />“──However, Sara is still a girl who can’t speak up for herself. Isn’t that right?”<br /> <br />“I-I don’t think so…”<br /> <br />“Then why hasn’t Sara tried to speak up until now? Moreover, from my perspective, it seems like she’s relying on you for everything, Akasaki-kun…”<br /> <br />“…”<br /> <br />Even if Haruya said something, convincing her father would be difficult if Sara couldn’t speak for herself. Haruya fell silent, realizing this.<br /> <br />However, giving up wasn’t an option.<br /> <br />Haruya gently placed his hand on Sara’s back, choosing to believe in her.<br /> <br />Sara looked up with a surprised expression, meeting Haruya’s eyes.<br /> <br />(…It’s okay, it’s okay.)<br /> <br />Haruya sent warm eyes full of trust to her.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>───I have to say it, I have to say it.<br /> <br />Sara clenched her fists tightly, repeating these words to herself.<br /> <br />She had never interfered or answered back to her father, and her body unconsciously tensed. It seemed impossible to speak out loud as she wished.<br /> <br />Her father’s words and Haruya’s words didn’t seem to register at all.<br /> <br />The atmosphere suddenly became oppressive, and her heart pounded heavily.<br /> <br />(───I can’t say what I want to say.)<br /> <br />Such a foolish thought left Sara dumbfounded in her own disbelief.<br /> <br />She keenly felt her own weakness.<br /> <br />Time seemed to pass slowly, with the sensation of it flowing leisurely.<br /> <br />(…I’m really useless, huh?)<br /> <br />Originally, Sara had always been like this in front of her father.<br /> <br />Her adoptive father had saved her, an orphan with nowhere to go.<br /> <br />Since then, Sara had decided to live for the Himekawa family.<br /> <br />Therefore, no matter how unpleasant things were, Sara had diligently followed her father’s instructions.<br /> <br />Rebellion was out of the question.<br /> <br />Sara had grown up in the Himekawa household without ever answering back.<br /> <br />Sara was afraid of being ungrateful to the Himekawa family that had saved her.<br /> <br />(…Let’s give up. Accept the marriage proposal. There’s no other choice.)<br /> <br />She had endured and overcome unpleasant things before. Sara tried to convince herself to give up.<br /> <br />──But.<br /> <br />Suddenly, she recalled the day she met Haruya.<br /> <br />Since that day, Sara’s world had started to change color.<br /> <br />Feelings she didn’t know, feelings she had hidden, overflowed despite her efforts to keep them in check.<br /> <br />It was the feeling of falling in love.<br /> <br />Having tasted the sweetness of fateful romance, Sara now struggled in agony.<br /> <br />(…For me, the Himekawa family…)<br /> <br />Squeezing her eyes shut, Sara remembered Haruya’s words that flashed in her mind.<br /> <br />[…But, that’s not what you truly feel, right?]<br /> <br />[Let’s fight together.]<br /> <br />[I think it’s amazing because it’s Himekawa-san, not just because she’s the daughter of the Himekawa family.]<br /> <br />Those were the warm words spoken by Haruya.<br /> <br />(…Ah, you really make it so easy to resolve my worries.)<br /> <br />Even though she had thought of giving up, Haruya wouldn’t allow it.<br /> <br />Sara felt that Haruya’s voice demanded a response.<br /> <br />She wasn’t alone now. Haruya was by her side.<br /> <br />To make that clear, Haruya’s warm and large hand rested on her back.<br /> <br />(…It’s okay, it’s okay.)<br /> <br />She felt as if he was encouraging her.<br /> <br />Then, Haruya looked at Sara calmly.<br /> <br />And Sara responded to Haruya’s calm gaze.<br /> <br />“…………No.”<br /> <br />In a delicate voice, Sara naturally spoke up as she felt Haruya’s presence.<br /> <br />Looking firmly into her adoptive father’s eyes without turning away, Sara continued.<br /> <br />Once Sara breaks out of her shell, she does not stop.<br /> <br />“I always thought I shouldn’t oppose Father’s opinions. So, I’ve never gone against Father’s opinions or suggestions until now. But, Father, I’m sorry, father. I know you were thinking of me and wanted to arrange a marriage. ……. But I’m …… I…<br /> <br />Pausing there, she then flashed an even more charming smile.<br /> <br />“—actually want to enjoy a more fate-filled romance than anyone else.”<br /> <br />That smile was the most attractive and human-like smile Haruya had seen from her.</p>




<p>Upon receiving Sara’s charming smile and words, Sara’s father was left dumbfounded.<br /> <br />Haruya, too, was frozen, but eventually, Sara’s father showed a faint smile.<br /> <br />It seemed as if he had secretly wished for this outcome, his expression calm and serene.<br /> <br />“Oh, I see… You decided to express your opinion.”<br /> <br />Confirming this with his eyes lowered, Sara’s adoptive father continued.<br /> <br />“So, you spoke your mind, knowing you would be denied… knowing you would trouble me. I see. “<br /> <br />Satisfied, Sara’s father nodded several times.<br /> <br />“Well, if you say that much, there’s nothing to be done. Introducing Sara in such a state would affect the honor of the Himekawa family.”<br /> <br />With a gentle smile, Sara’s father directed an admiring gaze at Sara.<br /> <br />“Do as you like. If Sara wants that, then so be it.”<br /> <br />“Yes!”<br /> <br />Responding with a pounding heart to her adoptive father’s words, Sara answered with a radiant smile.<br /> <br />Now, it seemed that the issue at hand had been resolved, and Haruya was about to leave for home.<br /> <br />At that moment, Sara’s father’s attention shifted to Haruya.<br /> <br />“Akasaki-kun, it’s a bit early, but you should have a meal before heading home.”<br /> <br />“…Uh, no, it’s fine.”<br /> <br />“No need to be reserved. You came all the way here using the train. I must show some hospitality…”<br /> <br />Following Sara’s father’s request, Sara also pleaded with Haruya.<br /> <br />“Please, from me as well… I’ll help with cooking.”<br /> <br />Unable to easily refuse their requests, Haruya reluctantly said, “Well, I’ll take you up on that.”<br /> <br />Thus, the Himekawa family and Haruya ended up having a meal together.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />****.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After Sara went with the maid to prepare the meal, Haruya and Sara’s father were left waiting in a spacious Japanese-style room until they could eat.<br /> <br />An awkward and heavy atmosphere dominated the space.<br /> <br />(Oh no… Looking closely, this person’s face is still scary…)<br /> <br />Although Haruya had bravely expressed his opinions earlier, he was now sweating internally, feeling a chill…<br /> <br />(I shouted almost like I was yelling… Now it’s even more awkward.)<br /> <br />As Haruya tried to straighten up, Sara’s father suddenly asked him a strange question, looking at him as if appraising him.<br /> <br />“By the way, Akasaki-kun, do you have affection for Sara?”<br /> <br />Haruya almost burst out laughing but managed to restrain himself.<br /> <br />Then, looking directly into the other’s eyes, Haruya replied,<br /> <br />“Friends, I guess?”<br /> <br />The questioning tone was because Haruya, too, couldn’t find the right words to easily express his relationship with Sara.<br /> <br />“I see… Well, if it’s hard to say, it can’t be helped.”<br /> <br />Even so, Sara’s father said while wearing a gentle smile.<br /> <br />Perhaps he interpreted Haruya’s statement as being embarrassed about his affectionate feelings.<br /> <br />Though Haruya tilted his head, Sara’s father continued.<br /> <br />“If you like, I’d like you to support Sara by her side… I’ve never seen Sara’s smile like that before, thanks to you.”<br /> <br />“Is that so…”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I’m sure Sara changed because you were there. And, I keenly felt that I’m a useless father… I couldn’t believe that Sara would express her opinions even when she knew she would be denied and cause me trouble… I see.”<br /> <br />Sara’s father turned back, as if reflecting on the past, and then spoke in a self-deprecating manner.<br /> <br />“Since I adopted Sara as my daughter, she was determined to live for the sake of the Himekawa family more than anyone else. So, she diligently fulfilled my requests without a word of complaint. Yet, I labeled her as a child who couldn’t express her opinions… I even tried to force her into an arranged marriage to avoid being deceived by a bad man… Sara has grown splendidly, despite my misconceptions.”<br /> <br />It seemed Sara’s father regretted treating her like a small child.<br /> <br />“But, I’m sure Himekawa-san won’t blame her father. I’ve heard a few things about the house from Himekawa-san. None of them were blaming statements about her father.”<br /> <br />(Well, if it were me, I’d probably rebel right away.)<br /> <br />Haruya, internally burdened with thoughts that weren’t anything to be proud of, nodded in agreement.<br /> <br />“But, I believe she can change from now on.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, she’ll surely change from now on.”<br /> <br />Then, when Haruya met Sara’s father, he wore a gentle smile.<br /> <br />“By the way, Akasaki-kun, did you not find Sara’s smile adorable earlier?”<br /> <br />Seeing Sara’s father asking with a delighted expression, Haruya couldn’t help but think—<br /> <br />(Oh, this person doesn’t seem scary at all now. Just a father who loves his daughter.)<br /> <br />His image of Sara’s father crumbled, and he was on the verge of laughing.<br /> <br />Although Haruya found Sara’s smile from earlier charming,<br /> <br />he decided to brush it off casually to avoid complications.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>About an hour passed, and dishes started to be served on the dining table.<br /> <br />Drawn by the delicious aroma, Haruya and Sara’s foster father moved from the large tatami room to the dining table.<br /> <br />Once all the dishes were prepared, Sara took a seat facing Haruya.<br /> <br />“Itadakimasu.”<br /> <br />With the pre-meal greeting, Haruya started savoring the food.<br /> <br />Sara’s foster father, the servant, Sara, and Haruya—all four sat around the dining table.<br /> <br />It was quite an unusual combination.<br /> <br />The dishes presented were all Japanese, perfectly matching the atmosphere of the mansion.<br /> <br />The flavors were rich and delightful, a feast for the taste buds.<br /> <br />Haruya particularly enjoyed the agedashi tofu among the various dishes.<br /> <br />Sara’s father seemed to notice Haruya’s reaction to the food.<br /> <br />“This agedashi tofu was made by Sara herself; she often makes it…”<br /> <br />With a gentle smile, Sara’s father stared at Haruya.<br /> <br />“Is that so? But this agedashi tofu is really delicious.”<br /> <br />“Ohoho… shall we instill the principles of the Himekawa family? Akasaki-san.”<br /> <br />This time, the servant, with a strange smile, looked at Haruya.<br /> <br />Seeing Haruya’s wry smile, Sara’s father, nodding, instructed the servant.<br /> <br />“That might be a good idea…”<br /> <br />“Yes, sir.”<br /> <br />The servant, after smiling at Sara’s father’s kind eyes, turned his gaze back to Haruya.<br /> <br />“W-Well… that might be a bit much.”<br /> <br />He looks at Sara who is sitting across from him, and she….<br /> <br />“…… Wait, what are you talking about? I mean, I’m not at all …… “<br /> <br />Her face was bright red, but she didn’t seem to be satisfied.<br /> <br />Looking at Sara on the opposite side, who blushed but didn’t seem entirely displeased, Haruya sighed.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />**<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Then, after the meal was served.<br /> <br />After enjoying the feast, despite the reluctance, Haruya decided to leave, as he had school the next day.<br /> <br />It seemed Sara, too, preferred to return to her lodgings rather than staying overnight at her family’s house, anticipating an early morning.<br /> <br />“I’m glad we could have a proper conversation with your father today. Well then, I’ll be going home with Akasaki-san…”<br /> <br />“Thank you for everything. It was a great meal.”<br /> <br />With farewells and being seen off by Sara’s father and the servant, Sara and Haruya started their journey home.<br /> <br />And at that moment—<br /> <br />“Feel free to come back anytime, both Sara and Akasaki-kun should feel at home, naturally.”<br /> <br />(Well, I’m good for now.)<br /> <br />Haruya’s honest feelings, though, couldn’t be expressed, and he just nodded.<br /> <br />After that, Haruya and Sara took the train back home.</p>


<p>In the train, both were silent.<br /> <br />Leaning against the wall, Haruya and Sara were close to each other.<br /> <br />Perhaps due to the many salarymen returning home on time, the train on the way back was more crowded than the one they took earlier. Haruya and Sara couldn’t find seats.<br /> <br />—Clank, clunk, clank, clunk.<br /> <br />As the train swayed, both Haruya and Sara felt embarrassed.<br /> <br />The reason was simple. Haruya had pushed Sara to the wall and positioned himself with his hand near her face,<br /> <br />” ………… “<br /> <br />” ………… “<br /> <br />a stance prepared against potential harassers to protect Sara.<br /> <br />(Well, this is quite embarrassing.)<br /> <br />Haruya couldn’t help but repeatedly sigh internally.<br /> <br />On the other hand, Sara, with a strangely feverish gaze, was staring blankly at Haruya.<br /> <br />Thump, thump.<br /> <br />Along with the painful feeling in her chest, she became aware that her body was warming up.<br /> <br />(He’s protecting me… Akasaki-san.)<br /> <br />As she reflected on the situation, a childlike smile naturally appeared on Sara’s face.<br /> <br />(Really… how much do I need to express my gratitude to Akasaki-san?)<br /> <br />Looking back on everything, Sara’s cheeks blossomed.<br /> <br />(Well, I need to convey my gratitude… But how?)<br /> <br />However, mere words might not convey sincerity.<br /> <br />Sara, contemplating how to express her gratitude to Haruya, continued to think on the train.<br /> <br />On the other hand, Haruya, feeling embarrassed, pondered—<br /> <br />(When should I get Sara to acknowledge my true identity…)<br /> <br />And, to avoid getting into an awkward situation, he reaffirmed his original goal in his mind.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Well, …… The train was… Sorry, I was in that position for so long.”<br /> <br />” …… No, no…”<br /> <br />After getting off the train at the nearest station, Haruya called out to Sara.<br /> <br />“Is your leg okay? If you need to rest a bit, I’ll gladly accompany you.”<br /> <br />“I appreciate your concern… Thank you, but I’m fine. And, you really helped me earlier.”<br /> <br />The incident referred to is undoubtedly when Haruya took a stance to protect Sara from harassment.<br /> <br />With a smile on her face, Sara inwardly thinks, “…Thank you very much.”<br /> <br />“Oh, um, shall we head back then?”<br /> <br />“Y-Yes…!”<br /> <br />Sara answers with a slightly trembling voice to Haruya’s words.<br /> <br />Watching Haruya’s back as he moves forward, Sara becomes convinced that the warmth within her chest won’t fade away.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Um, Himekawa-san.”<br /> <br />On the way back from the station, walking side by side on the riverbank path, Haruya finally gathers his courage to speak to Sara.<br /> <br />“Y-Yes…”<br /> <br />Sara replies, straightening her spine with a slight tremor.<br /> <br />Apologizing to Sara with a somewhat apologetic expression, Haruya clasps his hands together and makes a request.<br /> <br />“Himekawa-san, I have a favor to ask. “<br /> <br />Haruya’s hidden purpose.<br /> <br />He feels a surge of excitement as he believes that with the family issue resolved, he has earned considerable favor.<br /> <br />If he can get Sara to promise not to reveal his identity, there’s almost no risk of his true self being exposed in class.<br /> <br />Thinking this way, Haruya asks Sara ──<br /> <br />“ask anything, so please go ahead!”<br /> <br />Despite her face still being red, Sara encourages Haruya enthusiastically.<br /> <br />Smiling wryly at the effectiveness of earning favor, Haruya says,<br /> <br />“I don’t want to stand out in class, you see… Can you promise not to reveal my identity?”<br /> <br />Upon hearing Haruya’s words, Sara’s eyes widened, and she froze for a moment.<br /> <br />Then, she turned her puzzled gaze toward him and spoke.<br /> <br />“I think you said something similar before…”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I did… but I wanted you to reconfirm your determination now.”<br /> <br />Sara tilted her head for a moment but then raised her hand again, making a solemn vow.<br /> <br />“Yes, I understand. I swear.”<br /> <br />“T-Thank you.”<br /> <br />Internally, Haruya couldn’t help but chuckle.<br /> <br />With this, he was almost certain that Sara, with her honest personality, wouldn’t expose his true identity.<br /> <br />“Uh, excuse me, Mr. Akasaki… There’s some dust on your shoulder. May I brush it off?”<br /> <br />Blushing, Sara asked, even though her face was already red from earlier.<br /> <br />Haruya, caught up in the joy of achieving his goal,<br /> <br />That is why didn’t find the abrupt and unnatural request suspicious.<br /> <br />“Huh? Oh, uh… sure.”<br /> <br />As he bent down to allow her, in that moment,<br /> <br />a soft sensation briefly touched his cheek.<br /> <br />Without understanding what had happened, Haruya’s mind went blank.<br /> <br />“Th-This is a thank you for everything so far.”<br /> <br />Blushing deeply, Sara hastily said, “Well then,” and walked away with light footsteps.<br /> <br />Left alone in that spot, Haruya could only remain dumbfounded for a while.<br /> <br />His cheek still felt the gentle touch, and Haruya hung his head in bewilderment.<br /> <br />(That was …… What the….. was that?)</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FKL4ecs.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>




<p>Experiencing this sensation for the first time… Haruya unintentionally feels his face heat up.<br /> <br />Sara, who was reserved and spoke very little on the train and especially on the way back, was likely struggling with this issue.<br /> <br />(…A kiss on the cheek as a gesture of gratitude, perhaps… But when was the right timing?)<br /> <br />Throughout the way back, especially on the train, Sara was likely grappling with this dilemma.</p>

<p>Now, onto the next day.<br /> <br />The weather today is unbelievably clear, with not a single cloud in the sky. It’s a perfect, clear day.<br /> <br />When Haruya finally arrives at school, feeling relieved, and takes his seat, he overhears the conversation of the S-rank beauties.<br /> <br />“…Sara-chan, you seem so energetic today! What happened!?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, your vibe is totally different from usual…”<br /> <br />With a natural and radiant expression, Sara talks with Rin and Yuna.<br /> <br />Her complexion is healthy, and her expression is more lively than ever.<br /> <br />Seeing Sara like this, Rin jokingly inquires,<br /> <br />“Oh… Could it be that you’ve tasted the flavor of love?”<br /> <br />Normally, Sara would weakly deny at this point, but…<br /> <br />“Yes, I’ve fallen in love…”<br /> <br />Sara, more charming than usual, confesses with an extra dazzling smile. Taken aback, both Yuna and Rin are left speechless, and Rin, with a hint of jokingly, presses Sara for details.<br /> <br />“Oh… did you fall in love? Tell us more!”<br /> <br />Some classmates, too, are watching with bated breath to see what’s happening.<br /> <br />“Fufu, it’s a secret… Because it’s embarrassing.”<br /> <br />Saying so, Sara winks at Haruya, pretending to be asleep at his desk.<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />Feeling a bit dumbfounded, Haruya pretends not to notice, and some classmates are left shocked by Sara’s wink, showing excitement.<br /> <br />“Eh, just now… Did Sara-chan just wink at me? No, it was me!”<br /> <br />“No, it was me for sure!”<br /> <br />“You don’t get it; it was obviously me!”<br /> <br />And so, in a mysterious turn of events, the male students compete, claiming, “I’m the one!”<br /> <br />Amidst this, Kazamiya, a male student from the back seat, pats Haruya’s shoulder.<br /> <br />Haruya lifted his heavy body and turned towards Kazamiya.<br /> <br />“Hmm? What’s up this time?”<br /> <br />“Hey, hey… Akasaki, what do you think about that change in Himekawa-san?”<br /> <br />“What do I think… Well, her smile is quite charming, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />“She used to be so down, and now it’s like a lie. I’m convinced that whoever Himekawa-san fell in love with must be amazing.”<br /> <br />“Amazing?”<br /> <br />While trying to hide his embarrassment, Haruya asked Kazamiya.<br /> <br />“Yeah, because even from my perspective, it seemed like Himekawa-san was struggling with the arranged marriage issue. And he’s the guy who resolved it, right? Definitely someone extraordinary.”<br /> <br />In response to Kazamiya’s words, Haruya answered with a serious gaze.<br /> <br />“That’s not it… Himekawa-san overcame it herself.”<br /> <br />“…”<br /> <br />Kazamiya’s face tensed up.<br /> <br />“So, Akasaki can make that kind of face…”<br /> <br />Unconsciously, it seemed that his facial muscles had relaxed.<br /> <br />Haruya immediately averted his gaze from Kazamiya, embarrassed by the situation, but Kazamiya persistently pressed on.<br /> <br />“…Hey, but why did you make such an expression?…”<br /> <br />“…Annoying. Your eyes are full of holes.”<br /> <br />“Oh~ Isn’t that too harsh!?”<br /> <br />Haruya fluttered his hand in an exaggerated manner, dismissing Kazamiya’s overly dramatic behavior.<br /> <br />At that moment,<br /> <br />the conversation of the S-rank beauties reached Haruya’s ears.<br /> <br />“Ugh, but the guy who changed Sara-chan so much is definitely intriguing!”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’m curious too…”<br /> <br />“That’s right, Yuna. Well then, let’s organize it a bit. I remember his distinctive features, like saving from a pick-up──”<br /> <br />Rin started going over Haruya’s story with Yuna while looking back on what happened.<br /> <br />(Wait, wait, wait, …… Hey, aren’t I still the topic of the S-class beauties after all?)<br /> <br />Inwardly, Haruya let out a pathetic sigh.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>In my life so far, I never thought I would come to know “love.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Since childhood, even when I made friends, they were always talking about love stories.<br /> <br />I didn’t envy them, but still, I couldn’t help feeling different from the other kids, always left behind and lonely.<br /> <br />I’ve been taught since childhood that I’m special and different from other kids.<br /> <br />As I grew up, being raised in a privileged family provided me with an environment to strive.<br /> <br />As a result, I devoted myself to various pursuits such as academics, sports, martial arts, music, and achieved excellent records.<br /> <br />There were tough times in the process, but I’m full of gratitude toward my adoptive father.<br /> <br />Living for the Himekawa family.<br /> <br />That became my creed, and I lived that way, avoiding going against my adoptive father.<br /> <br />But, when I entered high school, a turning point came unexpectedly.<br /> <br />That was when I met Haruya Akasaki.<br /> <br />With a fateful meeting, I unconsciously began to think about him.<br /> <br />Gradually, as we interacted, I became aware of my feelings for him, but I forgot about it. I consciously avoided thinking about it.<br /> <br />That I am the daughter of the Himekawa family. And that I live for the Himekawa family.<br /> <br />Surely, it’s just because of the fateful encounter that my feelings are throbbing, and it’s just a temporary emotion. If I do something like a normal romantic relationship, these feelings will subside.<br /> <br />So, I told myself that.<br /> <br />──Yes.<br /> <br />This is the last time. With that determination, I planned to say goodbye to Akasaki san.<br /> <br />However, the conversation took a direction that betrayed my wishes.<br /> <br />Not only did Akasaki san say the words I wanted to hear, but he also resolved my concerns.<br /> <br />(…Honestly, it’s annoying.)<br /> <br />Because he exists, I was able to speak up against my father…<br /> <br />But despite myself, this intense feeling of “liking” him continued to swell within me.<br /> <br />I want to continue this relationship with him as much as possible…<br /> <br />And so, such feelings began to expand within me.<br /> <br />“Akasaki san…”<br /> <br />In the empty room, lying on the bed, I spoke his name.<br /> <br />Just as Akasaki san had found me and helped me…<br /> <br />Now, I found myself wanting to help Akasaki san.<br /> <br />In my mind, I pictured Akasaki san at his school.<br /> <br />In other words, his hidden, shadowy side.<br /> <br />“…I like Akasaki san.”<br /> <br />Sara threw those words at her pillow.<br /> <br />──But, she didn’t have the courage to say those words directly to Akasaki san.<br /> <br />However, it seemed impossible to keep these overflowing intense feelings within her.<br /> <br />(So, it’s okay to talk to Yuna-san and Rin-san about these feelings, right…?)<br /> <br />Since Akasaki san was always lying on his desk, Sara realized that he probably didn’t hear her.<br /> <br />Therefore, Sara felt comfortable talking to Yuna and Rin about it.<br /> <br />It seems like an indirect confession, but Sara is naturally filled with a sense of excitement when she talks about her love.<br /> <br />“When the day comes for Haruya’s problems to be resolved, and Sara can express her feelings, that will be the time.”<br /> <br />“At that moment, I’ll properly tell him that I like him face to face.”<br /> <br />So, until then.<br /> <br />She won’t mention Akasaki’s name in the classroom, let her have some girl talk with her friends.</p>



<p>Blushing, Sara had a radiant smile on her face.</p>
