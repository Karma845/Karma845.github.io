<h2>Afterword</h2>



<p> <br />Nice to meet you, I’m the author, Konatsu Wakioka.<br /> <br />Thank you very much for purchasing this work.<br /> <br />This piece was originally written as a romantic comedy on Kakuyomu, and I remember consciously writing with the mindset of “Just make it comical and enjoyable!” during the web serialization.<br /> <br />Ignoring realism, I wrote it recklessly, doing whatever I wanted (laughs).<br /> <br />However, when I received the offer for publication, I had mixed feelings of joy and anxiety, thinking, “The revision process seems tough…”<br /> <br />Indeed, that premonition came true, and the revision process was really tough (laughs).<br /> <br />About 90% of the main text is newly written, so it’s not an exaggeration to say it’s almost a completely new work!<br /> <br />Therefore, I hope readers who have read this work on Kakuyomu will find it enjoyable!<br /> <br />In this story, Sara took the lead, but how was it?<br /> <br />Sara is cute! An angel! If you think she’s cute even though she’s a bit eccentric, the author will cry with joy (laughs).<br /> <br />Regarding the other two heroines, I think they will be explored more in volumes two and three if this work continues.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Now, let’s move on to the acknowledgments.<br /> </p>
