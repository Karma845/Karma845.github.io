<h1>Chapter 2: Sara’s Happiness</h1>

<p>The day after exchanging contacts with Sara.<br /> <br />The weather was clear and warm, with a refreshing breeze.<br /> <br />Even Haruya, who was no longer interested in class, had become accustomed to the routine. However, the S-class beauties in the class were still engrossed in romantic discussions.<br /> <br />“Wait, you exchanged contacts right after that!?”<br /> <br />“Looks like destiny, Sara…”<br /> <br />Sara’s conversation with the other S-class beauties was straightforward.<br /> <br />She kept the rooftop incident and the fact that Haruya was a fellow student at the same high school a secret. She only conveyed the fact that they exchanged contacts.<br /> <br />But, naturally, if she revealed that much…<br /> <br />“What happened? How did it lead to exchanging contacts?”<br /> <br />It was inevitable for them to ask about the details.<br /> <br />Rin, who loved romantic talks, pressed Sara for information. Sara, looking shy, answered hesitantly.<br /> <br />“That’s… well, it’s a secret.”<br /> <br />” ” ” …… ” ” “<br /> <br />Yuna and Rin exchanged surprised glances.<br /> <br />Sara’s bashful demeanor and her slightly blushed cheeks made her words even more intriguing.<br /> <br />It was probably because Sara’s gesture was so cute.<br /> <br />Rin refrained from probing further and instead embraced Sara with a satisfied smile.<br /> <br />“Sara-chan, you’re so cute right now. Okay, I won’t ask about the details… But why keep it a secret?”<br /> <br />With a mischievous grin, Rin questioned Sara, who turned her face away. Sara, looking embarrassed, responded.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s because… my heart feels a bit fuzzy. Both Rin-san and Yuna-san are wonderful, so I don’t want it to be known too much…”<br /> <br />Sara’s words made Rin and Yuna exchange glances and smile.<br /> <br />Although her statement confessed feelings of liking someone, Sara seemed unaware of it.<br /> <br />“I see, I see. If that’s the case, we won’t pry into the details.”<br /> <br />Satisfied, Rin nodded several times, looking satisfied.<br /> <br />Yuna, on the other hand, had a happy expression, with the corners of her mouth loosening.<br /> <br />Sara was not aware of her feelings for Haru, but she had been afraid.<br /> <br />If she revealed that Haru was a student from the same high school, and they got to know him… both Yuna and Rin might be drawn to him too.<br /> <br />However, Sara couldn’t help but want to talk about him.<br /> <br />She had always struggled to keep up with discussions about the opposite sex, always feeling like she was left out.<br /> <br />Sensing Sara’s emotions, Yuna gently placed her hand on Sara’s head.<br /> <br />“I—no, you don’t have to worry about me and Rin. Sara, just talk about what you want to talk about… And if Rin goes too far out of curiosity—”<br /> <br />At that point, Yuna turned to Rin and pinched her nose.<br /> <br />“I’ll punish her like this.”<br /> <br />“Ouch! That hurts… Yuna-ri~n.”<br /> <br />Once Yuna let go, Rin, with tearful eyes, nodded in agreement.<br /> <br />“But yeah, you’re right. We’re friends, so don’t worry too much, Sara-chan. Whenever you want to talk about it, just bring up the topic. In fact, you’re always welcome.”<br /> <br />Encouraged by Rin and Yuna’s words, Sara smiled gently.<br /> <br />“Thank you so much!”<br /> <br />“Alright, let’s get back to the topic. You exchanged contacts, right?”<br /> <br />“Yes, that’s right, but…”<br /> <br />“Now that you’ve exchanged contacts, you’re wondering what to do next, right?”<br /> <br />Yuna, perceptive as ever, asked Sara.<br /> <br />Sara widened her eyes, and Rin, this time, embraced Yuna.<br /> <br />“Wow, Sara-chan’s expression says it all… You’re amazing, Yuna-ri~n.”<br /> <br />“H-hey, don’t embrace me like that.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, Yuna-ri~n, you smell nice.”<br /> <br />“Hey, don’t sniff me.”<br /> <br />Listening to this exchange, some classmates had various thoughts.<br /> <br />(Is this paradise?)<br /> <br />(Teehee.)<br /> <br />(…I’m starting to feel embarrassed just watching.)<br /> <br />And so, everyone seemed to share similar sentiments.<br /> <br />Yuna desperately tried to pull Rin away, and as Rin was freed, she suddenly remembered something she had forgotten to convey to Sara.<br /> <br />“Oh, by the way, Sara-chan, you also smell really nice!”<br /> <br />“Eh, um…?”<br /> <br />“See, Sara looks troubled. The conversation always derails with her.”<br /> <br />Yuna sighed in exasperation and scolded Rin.<br /> <br />Then, they returned to the main topic.<br /> <br />“So, after exchanging contact information, you’re not sure what to do next, right?”<br /> <br />“…Y-yes.”<br /> <br />From there, the discussion among the top-tier beauties shifted to “what to do after exchanging contact information.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Now, while the S-class beauties were engrossed in their conversation, Haruya pretended to be asleep but was consciously listening. Internally, he couldn’t help but want to scream.<br /> <br />(Huh? Isn’t this strange? It feels like my likability hasn’t decreased at all…)<br /> <br />In fact, his likability seemed to have increased.<br /> <br />(…I need to intentionally lower my likability more during lunch break.)<br /> <br />The discussion continued on what to do after exchanging contacts.<br /> <br />Sara asked other S-class beauties about it, but if we rewind a bit, she actually sent a message to Haruya the night before.<br /> <br />[“If you’re free during lunch tomorrow… would you come to the rooftop?”]<br /> <br />So, to make sure she hadn’t made the wrong choice, Sara asked the other S-class beauties.<br /> <br />“By the way, have you heard the name Asai Yuu?”<br /> <br />Listening to the S-class beauties’ conversation, Haruya heard Sara’s words.<br /> <br />“Asai Yuu, isn’t that the name of the protagonist in a shoujo manga? Is something wrong?”<br /> <br />“No, I just heard someone I know talking about how cool that person is… it’s just the name of a character in a shoujo manga…”<br /> <br />“Huh, Yunarin? You don’t seem like someone who would read shoujo manga.”<br /> <br />“Well, no, my cousin reads it a lot, so I’ve heard about it from her.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, right, Yuna doesn’t seem like the type to read shoujo manga.”<br /> <br />“That’s right. ……”<br /> <br />With the S-class beauties’ conversation overheard, Haruya felt a shiver down his spine.<br /> <br />(…Himekawa is already trying to figure out who it is… oh, this is getting scary.)<br /> <br />She sighed in relief that she used a fake name.<br /> <br />(But, I could get along really well with that cousin.)<br /> <br />Shoujo manga, featuring Asai Yuu, falls into the more obscure category.<br /> <br />Yet, it’s quite evident that those who can identify the [manga character] quickly are true enthusiasts.<br /> <br />As Haruya, feeling an unexplained sense of closeness to someone he doesn’t know, turned around, he was unexpectedly tapped on the shoulder from behind.<br /> <br />“What’s up? Getting interested in those S-rank beauties, huh?”<br /> <br />With a smirk, Kazamiya, the occupant of the seat behind, inquired.<br /> <br />Trying to keep it unnoticed, Haruya seemed to have been busted by Kazamiya for showing interest in the S-rank beauties’ conversation.<br /> <br />Haruya reluctantly lifted his heavy body and turned back lazily.<br /> <br />“Sorry… It’s just surprising that Akasaki is interested in the S-rank beauties, so I couldn’t help but comment.”<br /> <br />“Hey, there’s been some stuff going on,”<br /> <br />“Well, I can understand, you know? Himekawa-san… it’s interesting to see what she’ll do now that she has someone she likes,”<br /> <br />“I didn’t ask for your opinion.”<br /> <br />“Don’t be so cold. These kinds of topics, my friends or acquaintances usually don’t talk about them so willingly, you know?”<br /> <br />(Setting aside the fact that I have no friends… Am I not even an acquaintance?)<br /> <br />Ignoring that remark, Haruya showed interest in Sara.<br /> <br />Kazamiya then fluttered his hands in front of his face.<br /> <br />“…Stop it.”<br /> <br />“I didn’t say anything about liking or confessing or whatever.”<br /> <br />“Then why suddenly bring up Himekawa-san?”<br /> <br />“I just thought about taking the advice from last time seriously.”<br /> <br />The advice from last time was about expanding one’s circle of friends by getting to know the S-rank beauties.<br /> <br />Though Haruya didn’t seem fully convinced, Kazamiya explained with a puzzled expression.<br /> <br />“Well, she’s a celebrity in our class, right… Himekawa-san. It seems she’s got someone she’s interested in lately, comes from a good family, and, in general, she’s not the type to let others get close. So, there are few boys who confess to her.”<br /> <br />Suddenly, Haruya’s heart skipped a beat.<br /> <br />Understanding that the person she’s interested in is most likely him, he couldn’t help but smile wryly.<br /> <br />Maintaining composure, he urged Kazamiya to continue.<br /> <br />“Study-wise, she’s excellent, good at sports too. And she has a good-looking face and comes from a good background. Honestly, there’s nothing to complain about.”<br /> <br />Sara seems to be a perfectionist, achieving actual results.<br /> <br />Probably due to having no faults, many male students were captivated by her when they entered the school.<br /> <br />However, Haruya had no idea about any of this…<br /> <br />“Well, since Himekawa-san seems to have someone she likes now, it might be impossible, but good luck anyway.”<br /> <br />“It’s not like that.”<br /> <br />Brushing off Kazamiya’s hand that had been placed on his shoulder, Haruya turned back to face forward.</p>



<p>After the morning classes ended, it was lunch break.<br /> <br />Haruya, in a less crowded spot, adjusted his hair, took off his glasses, and headed to the rooftop with a sandwich in hand.<br /> <br />Opening the door to the rooftop, he was greeted by the clear sky and a pleasant breeze.<br /> <br />Normally, going up to the rooftop would lift his spirits, but today, the oppressive feelings lingered. The reason was clear. Sara, with her sparkling hair, was there.<br /> <br />“Oh, Asai-san. Thank you for coming.”<br /> <br />“Hello, Himekawa-san.”<br /> <br />It seemed Sara had called out to Haruya just to have lunch together.<br /> <br />Choosing to sit at a distance, Haruya sat down, and Sara even moved closer.<br /> <br />Haruya forced a wry smile, but Sara had a gentle smile on her face.<br /> <br />“…You don’t have to be so nervous. And, calling me Sara is fine too.”<br /> <br />(No, that’s just a form of harassment☆)<br /> <br />“And, if I could just say it out loud… it’s probably because I’m a wimp that I can’t express myself too strongly.<br /> <br />(…I’m just too pathetic, damn it.)<br /> <br />Calling her by her first name, “Sara,” felt embarrassing, and there was no other reason but the embarrassment hitting me.<br /> <br />Feeling my own incompetence, I open the sandwich wrapper.<br /> <br />” …Let’s eat.”<br /> <br />After offering a pre-meal greeting by clasping my hands, I, Haruya, took a bite of the sandwich.<br /> <br />“Is it from the convenience store…?”<br /> <br />“Well, yeah.”<br /> <br />“Do you usually eat convenience store food?”<br /> <br />“I live alone, and cooking is a hassle… so it just ends up like this.”<br /> <br />“…I-I see. I understand the feeling, living alone myself.”<br /> <br />Saying this, she gives a wry smile and stiffens her face.<br /> <br />(Is she disappointed knowing I’m a lazy piece of shit?)<br /> <br />Haruya senses a definite reaction from Sara. A package of mochi falls from the shelf.<br /> <br />“Basically, I neglect cleaning, and I just get by with meals… that’s me.”<br /> <br />In response to Haruya’s continued statements, Sara lowers her face and then clenches her fist tightly.<br /> <br />Observing her bright expression… it seems tense.<br /> <br />(Good reaction. This must be proof that my likability is going down…!)<br /> <br />Thinking so, Haruya inwardly expresses joy, but sensing Sara’s determination, he turns his attention to her.<br /> <br />“Would you… like to eat my homemade lunch?”<br /> <br />“…Huh?”<br /> <br />Haruya inadvertently lets out a dumbfounded voice.<br /> <br />Why… and the first question that comes up in his mind.<br /> <br />Seeing Haruya perplexed, Sara either realizes her explanation was insufficient or she decides to clarify.<br /> <br />“I originally invited Asai-san here with that intention. I realized that I haven’t properly thanked Asai-san. so I thought I should thank you in some way.”<br /> <br />“No need to thank me.”<br /> <br />“No, that’s not possible. Not only did Asai-san help me from a pickup, but he also cared for me, and last weekend, he behaved like a gentleman. Not showing gratitude would be unacceptable.”<br /> <br />It’s all a misunderstanding, and regarding last weekend, Haruya felt a sense of responsibility due to accidentally triggering her sensitive topic. Therefore, he tried to be gentlemanly, offering to carry her bags and being considerate, though none of it was required.<br /> <br />Despite this, there’s no reason for gratitude.<br /> <br />When Haruya tries to deny this, Sara preemptively cuts him off.<br /> <br />“Asai-san, you acted with my well-being in mind… isn’t that right?”<br /> <br />A confident expression is directed at Haruya.<br /> <br />Unable to deny her hopeful feelings, Haruya avoids her gaze ambiguously.<br /> <br />(Even if I say it’s different, this is a kind of torture.)<br /> <br />Before her, Haruya explains how inadequate he is as a person,<br /> <br />confessing one self-deprecating statement after another.<br /> <br />There’s nothing more painful than this.<br /> <br />Taking silence as affirmation, Sara puts on a gentle smile and offers her homemade lunch to him.<br /> <br />“That’s what I mean. So please accept it with gratitude.”<br /> <br />“And… why a lunchbox?”<br /> <br />“Asai-san, you mentioned earlier that you often rely on convenience store lunches for lunch, so I thought nutritional balance is important…”<br /> <br />It seems that Sara made this suggestion out of concern for Haruya’s health.<br /> <br />Sara’s bright expression also seemed to be a nervous one, as she lacked the courage to express her desire for him to eat the lunch she made.<br /> <br />“Well then, can I really eat this?”<br /> <br />“Yes, please…”<br /> <br />With that, Sara handed a pair of disposable chopsticks to Haruya.<br /> <br />Glancing at Sara, who had a tense expression, perhaps due to nerves about him accepting the lunch she made, Haruya picked up his chopsticks to try Sara’s colorful and varied lunch.<br /> <br />Tamagoyaki, karaage, salad, and more.<br /> <br />To be honest, every dish was delicious, and he couldn’t help but praise them involuntarily.<br /> <br />Unable to lie about the delicious food, or rather, the words “It’s good” slipped out reflexively.<br /> <br />Haruya had intended to lower Sara’s favorability by claiming the food wasn’t tasty, but that plan miserably failed.<br /> <br />As the next tactic, Haruya attempted to monopolize Sara’s lunch.<br /> <br />In essence, he tried to eat a lot of the lunch without thinking about Sara and intentionally eat less of the portion meant for her—a rather mean-spirited strategy.<br /> <br />Silently devouring Sara’s lunch, with every bite of the elaborate dishes, he couldn’t help but appreciate the flavors.<br /> <br />(… The guilt is overwhelming, but I’m sure this will lower my rating.)<br /> <br />Believing this, Haruya inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.<br /> <br />However, contrary to Haruya’s expectations, Sara looked at his profile with a somewhat satisfied expression.<br /> <br />(… She seems happy that I’m enjoying her lunch this much!)<br /> <br />Feeling her heart pounding, Sara, with a slightly raised voice, continues while looking into Haruya’s eyes.<br /> <br />“Um, if it’s okay, I would be happy if we could have lunch together here from now on.”<br /> <br />Haruya couldn’t help but feel annoyed inside.<br /> <br />(Every time I come here, I have to worry about people staring and fix my hair…)<br /> <br />But, for the sake of lowering her self-esteem, continuing to interact with her in the future seems unavoidable.<br /> <br />“…Um, well.”<br /> <br />Still, with a bit of hesitation, Haruya responded, and Sara joined in.<br /> <br />“If that’s the case, I’ll be waiting here tomorrow too!”<br /> <br />Faced with a smile like sunlight, Haruya could only nod with a wry smile.<br /> <br />“…Alright, I’ll come again.”<br /> <br />And so, Haruya made it a daily routine to share secret moments with Sara on the rooftop.<br /> <br />…But, let me say one thing.<br /> <br />(Himekawa-san? You’re smiling to cover it up, but you’re also taking advantage of the rooftop. ……)<br /> <br />Haruya inwardly comm-</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Just before the end of school, the time before homeroom on the way home.<br /> <br />Between finishing a boring class and the teacher arriving, classmates were chatting lively, and the classroom was filled with noise.<br /> <br />In this midst, Haruya, alone, lay on the desk with a calm feeling…<br /> <br />“───It’s so nice when someone enjoys the bento you made!”<br /> <br />“I know~. Especially when someone you want to eat it appreciates it, it’s really heartwarming.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I haven’t experienced it myself, but I can imagine the feeling…”<br /> <br />And so, the topic of such S-class beauties suddenly caught Haruya’s ear.<br /> <br />“What’s up? Could it be, Sarachin, were you absent during lunch because of that?”<br /> <br />“……… Oh, that’s what I was wondering too.”<br /> <br />“N-no, it’s not like that, but when I imagined it, I felt a surge of excitement.”<br /> <br />Inwardly stunned by Sara’s cheerful comment, Haruya couldn’t help but think, “This can’t be true…”<br /> <br />Haruya felt frustrated that his actions were being interpreted positively against his expectations.<br /> <br />(Why… why would she be happy that I’m eating it? I should have eaten so much that it’s almost annoying…)<br /> <br />Thinking so, Sara, as if to cross-check, added an explanation to the other S-rank beauties.<br /> <br />“…At first, even if someone says it’s delicious, I doubt it’s just flattery. But when someone enjoys it so much, I feel it from the bottom of my heart. Also, I don’t actually have much confidence in cooking…”<br /> <br />“Yeah, if he eats a lot, it’s not just flattery, right?”<br /> <br />“Uh-huh, the amount he eats builds trust, right?”<br /> <br />Rin nodded in agreement, and Sara nodded vigorously as if strongly endorsing that.<br /> <br />(Maybe that person also saw through that…)</p>

<p>As Sara contemplated this possibility, her heart pounded,<br /> <br />thinking that the man she had a fateful encounter with might have seen through her true self.<br /> <br />The idea that he might have seen through her so deeply made her feel embarrassingly self-conscious.<br /> <br />Sara desperately tried to suppress the blush rising from her chest with heat, not wanting it to show. Watching Sara’s reaction, Rin added a comment that felt like a blow.<br /> <br />“Someday, it would be great if that person could eat a lot of your lunch!”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I’m cheering for you too.”<br /> <br />Following Rin, Yuuna spoke, and Sara raised an eyebrow, smiling.<br /> <br />While hiding her emotions, Sara let her thoughts gather in her heart.<br /> <br />(…Both Yuuna-san and Rin-san seem envious… It’s the first time I’ve felt so uplifted. Hehe.)<br /> <br />Sara desperately suppressed the urge to smirk.<br /> <br />Meanwhile, Haruya, who had been listening to Sara’s words near their seats, was internally holding his head and screaming.<br /> <br />(This can’t be happening… Or is it just my imagination that her liking me has increased…?)<br /> <br />Having acted with the intention of lowering Sara’s favorability, erasing her interest in him, and avoiding being the topic of conversation among the S-rank beauties,<br /> <br />Haruya felt that everything had turned out counterproductive.<br /> <br />The only thing he was still managing to protect was [his true identity not being exposed].<br /> <br />At least, this was something he absolutely had to defend.<br /> <br />Feeling a sense of danger from this incident, Haruya decided to contact someone for advice. He sent a message to Nayu.<br /> <br />[… Nayu-san, can we meet for an offline gathering tonight?]<br /> <br />[…Sure, I can make it.]<br /> <br />When he sent the message, one of the S-rank beauties, Yuuna, asked curiously.<br /> <br />“Eh, Yuuna-rin? Who’s the message from?”<br /> <br />“N-nothing, really.”<br /> <br />“Why are you hiding it so much?”<br /> <br />“It really is nothing…”<br /> <br />And so, when Rin pressed her, Haruya couldn’t realize that Yuna was desperately trying to cover up.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />****.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Around nineteen o’clock, the time had passed slightly.<br /> <br />The sky was already faintly darkening, and the moon was showing its face.<br /> <br />Haruya styled his hair with wax and wore a white shirt with a black cardigan, waiting alone at the designated meeting spot – the station – for the arrival of a person.<br /> <br />Despite it being spring, the night air had a slight chill to it.<br /> <br />Arriving a bit earlier than the meeting time, Haruya contemplated stepping indoors to escape the cold when…<br /> <br />“…Haru-san, sorry to keep you waiting.”<br /> <br />A transparent voice, representing elegance and maturity, reached Haruya from behind.<br /> <br />Turning around, he saw a woman with an air of maturity, seemingly a bit unsettled.<br /> <br />She wore a slightly oversized hoodie with denim pants,<br /> <br />a casual outfit with a touch of sexiness emanating from the typical casual clothing worn by adults.<br /> <br />The elegance came from her poised demeanor and undeniable beauty.<br /> <br />However, Haruya had never seen her face without sunglasses.<br /> <br />“…Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?”<br /> <br />“No, I just got here a little while ago.”<br /> <br />“Oh, good then.”<br /> <br />Engaging in the classic interaction that could be mistaken for a couple, Haruya looked around, feeling a sudden awkwardness.<br /> <br />(Now that I think about it… there are quite a few couples around here.)<br /> <br />This was the famous fountain area in the station, often used as a meeting place.<br /> <br />However, today, there seemed to be an unusually high number of young couples, especially for a weekday.<br /> <br />(……If you look at us, we might seem like a couple too.)<br /> <br />While thinking this, Haruya couldn’t help but feel a sense of embarrassment. Nayu seemed to sense the same atmosphere.<br /> <br />“Seems like there are a lot of couples today.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, it does look that way.”<br /> <br />Indeed, couples with linked arms passed by in the direction they were facing.<br /> <br />“…We might also look like a couple from an outsider’s perspective.”<br /> <br />Her voice, sensual and alluring, was something Haruya wished she wouldn’t use.<br /> <br />It unintentionally made his heart race.<br /> <br />(…Does Nayu-san not feel embarrassed saying these things?)<br /> <br />While thinking this, Haruya noticed that Nayu, with her adult composure, showed no signs of being perturbed. Despite feeling embarrassed, he couldn’t find any hints of discomfort in her.<br /> <br />Feeling awkwardness, Haruya glanced at Nayu, who, while fidgeting with her hair, apologized in a somewhat sheepish manner.<br /> <br />“…By the way, sorry for not dressing up today. I didn’t put much thought into my outfit. You’re all stylish, Haru-san.”<br /> <br />“No, don’t worry about it. And I don’t really see a reason for you to apologize.”<br /> <br />“…Isn’t it a bit rude to not dress up when the other person is all stylish? So, sorry. I just came in casual clothes today.”<br /> <br />(I thought it was nothing to worry about) from Haruya’s point of view since he was dressed up, but it seems she was wrong.<br /> <br />While Nayu mentioned that she dressed casually today, her attire actually suited her quite well.<br /> <br />It was a loose-fitting style, yet it highlighted her charm.<br /> <br />” …I don’t think I’m particularly dressed up today.”<br /> <br />“I think it suits you… a bit boyish, though.”<br /> <br />Loose-fitting clothes with a bit of room.<br /> <br />Even in such attire, the beauty of the person wearing it appeared fresh and alluring in Haruya’s eyes.<br /> <br />However, terms like “cute” or “beautiful” were not something he could say directly to the person…<br /> <br />Blushing, Haruya scratched his cheek and gave his honest opinion about her outfit.<br /> <br />“Uh… Y-yeah? Haru-san, is this your kind of style?”<br /> <br />Her voice carried a mischievous undertone.<br /> <br />After widening her beautiful eyes, she continued speaking from lips that shone with a glossy lip color.<br /> <br />Her cheeks were slightly flushed and she had a calm expression on her face.<br /> <br />“Thank you. It suits you as always, Haru-san…”<br /> <br />Calling it “as usual” probably referred to Haruya’s fashion, which rarely deviated from the white and black theme.<br /> <br />Though being praised wasn’t a bad thing, the presence of many couples around made Haruya feel a bit strange.<br /> <br />Trying to divert the conversation, he asked Nayu a question.<br /> <br />“Is there any place you want to go eat?”<br /> <br />“Well, last time was at a family restaurant… but there’s a popular café near the station.”~<br /> <br />For a moment, thoughts of the coffee shop he frequented as a regular customer crossed Haruya’s mind.<br /> <br />If Nayu was also a regular there, it would be a pleasant surprise.<br /> <br />However, as soon as Nayu mentioned it being near the station, Haruya shrugged.<br /> <br />“They say the sweets there are really good. So, if you’re okay with it, shall we go there? If you have somewhere else in mind, I’m fine with that too.”<br /> <br />If you’re looking for a coffee shop, there’s no better place than a place you regularly go to as a regular.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q9Y1MAJ.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>Haruya thought, but when he heard that it had a good reputation, he was instantly intrigued.<br /> <br />“Anything sounds good. Let’s go there.”<br /> <br />“…Sure, let’s go.”<br /> <br />With Nayu leading the way, seemingly eager to guide him, Haruya followed her.<br /> <br />Haruya followed her and started walking to the coffee shop.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>An “offline meeting” is when people who have connected online, usually through social media or other online platforms, meet in person due to shared interests. However, Nayu and Haruya had some rules for their “offline meetings.”<br /> <br />Firstly, they would share and discuss their favorite shoujo manga.<br /> <br />Secondly, they agreed not to pry into each other’s private lives.<br /> <br />These are the two rules.<br /> <br />So, as usual, Nayu and Haruya ordered some food at the cafe, discussed their thoughts on shoujo manga, and Haruya recommended some manga to Nayu.<br /> <br />After talking animatedly about manga for about twenty minutes, the manga discussion took a temporary pause.<br /> <br />“…By the way, Haru, you’re a fan of black coffee, huh?”<br /> <br />Nayu casually dropped this statement while sipping her coffee.<br /> <br />Haruya always ordered black coffee at the cafe, enjoying its aroma, richness, and taste.<br /> <br />He was currently savoring the scent of his coffee.<br /> <br />“Nayu, aren’t you into black coffee?”</p>


<p>Considering Nayu’s mature image, Haruya had assumed she would prefer her coffee black.<br /> <br />“I’m not a fan of it being too bitter.”<br /> <br />Nayu chuckled, and then she reached for the milk and sugar on the table to add to her coffee.<br /> <br />Haruya couldn’t help but interrupt.<br /> <br />“Surprisingly, the black coffee here isn’t that bitter. Want to give it a try?”<br /> <br />Haruya found this black coffee quite easy to drink.<br /> <br />At first, Nayu frowned at his casual suggestion, but after a moment of contemplation, she took a deep breath and decided to give it a shot.<br /> <br />“…If Haru says so, I’ll believe it. Let’s start by enjoying the aroma… like this, savoring the coffee, right?”<br /> <br />She intentionally crossed her legs, struck a triumphant pose, and even though her eyes were hidden behind sunglasses, the narrowed look conveyed a sense of arrogance.<br /> <br />Doesn’t this feel like a cool and mature woman? The prejudice was evident.<br /> <br />Crossing her legs, resting an elbow on the table, Nayu stared out of the window with a bored expression.<br /> <br />Despite the forced act, it added to her allure, radiating a sophisticated career woman vibe.<br /> <br />“…Well, maybe my choice of outfit wasn’t the best.”<br /> <br />Nayu mumbled while tugging at her loose hoodie. Despite that, she looked towards Haruya as if saying, “But isn’t this fine?”<br /> <br />Then, with a cool demeanor, she brought the coffee to her lips.<br /> <br />“…Hmm, not bad—”<br /> <br />She suddenly widened her eyes, a pained expression on her face.<br /> <br />Her eyebrows furrowed, and her previously cool demeanor was instantly shattered.<br /> <br />The appearance of a “mature woman” who can afford to be mature is no longer there.<br /> <br />Tongue slightly out, Nayu stared at Haruya with a resentful look.<br /> <br />“…T-Too bitter. Haru, you liar!”<br /> <br />“No, I genuinely thought the black coffee here was easy to drink…”<br /> <br />“Don’t laugh… It’s a bit embarrassing.”<br /> <br />Seeing Nayu acting shy, Haruya couldn’t help but chuckle.<br /> <br />She had transformed from a mature woman to a child in an instant, and it seemed adorable to him.<br /> <br />To avoid Nayu’s dissatisfaction turning towards him, Haruya abruptly changed the topic.<br /> <br />However, for Haruya, this was the main topic for today.<br /> <br />“Suddenly, but… Can I talk to you about something?”<br /> <br />“…Can I refuse?”<br /> <br />“It’s not something weird.”<br /> <br />Even though Haruya answered promptly, Nayu blatantly showed her displeasure.<br /> <br />However, she quickly sighed, as if saying “Fine,” and gestured for him to continue.<br /> <br />At least she seemed willing to listen to the conversation.<br /> <br />“Actually—”<br /> <br />While skimming the details, Haruya shared his thoughts with Nayu.<br /> <br />He wanted to change the current situation where he felt overestimated and misunderstood.<br /> <br />After finishing his story, Nayu pointed her index finger at Haruya.<br /> <br />“That’s easy. If you think you’re being overestimated, why don’t you just go on a date with that girl?”<br /> <br />“A… date?”<br /> <br />Haruya was taken aback by Nayu’s suggestion.<br /> <br />“If you spend time together naturally, you’ll see each other’s true selves. I think that’ll solve the overestimation issue.”<br /> <br />She stated that there was no need for tricks, and time would resolve the problem.<br /> <br />“Well, but… Isn’t that a bit too simple?”<br /> <br />“It’s just a matter of sharing time between a man and a woman, that’s all.”<br /> <br />Even though Nayu didn’t need to mention it, she quickly shook her head as if realizing her unnecessary comment.<br /> <br />“Oh, by the way, this isn’t a date, it’s an offline meeting.”<br /> <br />“I get it, but—”<br /> <br />Nayu raises her eyebrows when I answer her immediately.<br /> <br />When Haruya tilts his head at Nayu, she clears her throat to cover her mistake.<br /> <br />“Well, that’s fine. Anyway, if there’s any advice I can give to Haru-san, it’s probably just to go on a normal date.”<br /> <br />“A… a date, huh. I see.”<br /> <br />Honestly, although not enthusiastic, her opinion was something to consider.<br /> <br />“Thanks, Nayu-san. I appreciate it.”<br /> <br />“N-no, it’s nothing…”<br /> <br />And with that, the topic came to an end, and the two continued their discussion on shojo manga until they parted ways.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>During the lunch break the next day,<br /> <br />Haruya and Sara, having come to the rooftop immediately, were having their lunch in the same way as yesterday, sitting side by side.<br /> <br />Haruya had planned to intentionally not eat Sara’s lunch to lower her likability, but…<br /> <br />“Ah, thank you for coming again today.”<br /> <br />—She’s very earnest.<br /> <br />“I wasn’t confident in my cooking, but since you enjoyed it yesterday, would you mind having it again today?”<br /> <br />—Being so humble like this…<br /> <br />Haruya couldn’t refuse Sara’s request to “not eat,” and he felt a strange sense of frustration.<br /> <br />(My incompetent self… Oh, by the way, the food is delicious.)<br /> <br />For some reason, feeling frustrated internally, Haruya munched on Sara’s lunch while silently cursing his own incompetence.<br /> <br />Without lying about the tasty food, and in response to Sara’s anxious question…<br /> <br />“…H-how is it?”<br /> <br />Sara anxiously asks him. …….<br /> <br />“It’s delicious. Really delicious.”<br /> <br />Haruya, clenching his fist tightly out of anger towards his own incompetence, could only honestly say:<br /> <br />However, inwardly, he cursed himself, “You idiot!”<br /> <br />Seeing Haruya’s reaction, Sara, misunderstanding that he was so moved by her homemade meal, smiled contentedly.<br /> <br />(If Asai-san appreciates something I did, it makes me happy…)<br /> <br />Amidst such misunderstandings, Haruya, feeling rushed, decided to propose a date.<br /> <br />Because, to improve the overestimated evaluation of himself, a date where they spend more time together is essential, as he learned from Nayu, his fellow manga enthusiast, yesterday.<br /> <br />Since the bento strategy failed, Haruya, looking for the right timing, asked Sara.<br /> <br />“Uh, you know… …… I wanted to know more about you, Himekawa-san. I was wondering if you could go on a date with me this weekend? “<br /> <br />Inadvertently, with a nervous voice, Haruya proposed to Sara.<br /> <br />Sara was surprised by the unexpected proposal.<br /> <br />“Eh…”<br /> <br />Opening her eyes wide, Sara blushed as she tried to understand the meaning of Haruya’s words.<br /> <br />Her heart is thumping and she is aware that her body is burning up.<br /> <br />“Um, if it’s okay with me… please.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I appreciate it.”<br /> <br />For a moment, he was worried about being rejected, but she agreed, relieving Haruya.<br /> <br />(Nervous about inviting her on a date, what am I doing?)<br /> <br />Reflecting on how he couldn’t smoothly ask her out and became awkward, Haruya’s whole body heated up.<br /> <br />Regardless, the date between Haruya and Sara was decided.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />On the Day of the Date<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The awaited day of the date arrived.<br /> <br />The weather today was perfect, with clear skies extending endlessly… ideal conditions for a date.<br /> <br />Haruya, dressed stylishly rather than showing his gloomy appearance at school, hurried to the meeting place to avoid being late. However, at such a moment…<br /> <br />“Mommy, where are you?”<br /> <br />On the way to the meeting place, in a park that served as a shortcut, he heard the voice of a little girl seeking help.<br /> <br />(—Surely, someone around will do something about it.)<br /> <br />Such a passive approach would be no good.<br /> <br />Indeed, there were some people who pretended not to notice or observed from a distance.<br /> <br />Without any hesitation, Haruya, without relying on others, approached the little girl.<br /> <br />Bending down, he adjusted his gaze to the girl’s level.<br /> <br />“Um, big brother. Who are you?”<br /> <br />Judging from her appearance, the girl seemed to be around four or five years old.<br /> <br />For now, Haruya breathed a sigh of relief that she didn’t start crying or making a fuss.<br /> <br />“I’m Haruya Akasaki. Uh, just Haruya… What’s your name?”<br /> <br />“I’m Miyu.”<br /> <br />“Got it, Miyu-chan.”<br /> <br />“Yes, Miyu. big brother’s name is Haruya.”<br /> <br />Even though he was relieved that she was an energetic child despite being lost, Haruya didn’t know how to handle children.<br /> <br />Anyway, as long as she seemed lively, that was good. After a moment of relief, Haruya tried to ask about her parents…<br /> <br />“—Excuse me, sir. We’d like to hear your side of the story.”<br /> <br />At that moment, coincidentally, police officers arrived.<br /> <br />“Ah, please. Thank you for helping, big brother.”<br /> <br />The police officer asked Haruya to accompany him in a refreshing tone.<br /> <br />(Well, I knew this was coming…)<br /> <br />Haruya was now certain that he would be late for the date.<br /> <br />(…Well, it might be effective in lowering Himekawa-san’s favorability, but this is also a matter of common decency.)<br /> <br />Being late is generally unacceptable.<br /> <br />Even when trying to lower Sara’s favorability, Haruya had his own constraints on acceptable actions. Being late was certainly among the actions he shouldn’t take.<br /> <br />“Haruya, Haruya!”<br /> <br />The only thing saving him was that this child was enjoying herself by just calling his name without bursting into tears, behaving well even at the police station.<br /> <br />It was a big relief for Haruya.<br /> <br />As a result…<br /> <br />“Sorry, Akasaki-san. I’ve caused you trouble.”<br /> <br />Haruya was bound by time until Miyuu’s parents arrived.</p>

<p>Haruya had informed Sara about the delay, but when he arrived at the meeting place, Sara was already there, as expected.<br /> <br />She was dressed in black, with a red and black checkered skirt.<br /> <br />The contrast with her fair skin was captivating,<br /> <br />and a stylish necklace sparkled around her neck, enhancing Sara’s glamorous appearance.<br /> <br />Her light makeup highlighted her facial features, adding to her allure.<br /> <br />Although it was from a distance, Haruya quickly spotted Sara amidst the surroundings due to her radiance.<br /> <br />“…Sorry for being late.”<br /> <br />“…Is everything okay?”<br /> <br />Sara’s response was not blaming or displeased, but rather, she expressed concern for Haruya, her voice gentle.<br /> <br />“No… sorry. I just got delayed.”<br /> <br />There wasn’t any particular reason, but Haruya decided to keep the incident with the lost little girl to himself.<br /> <br />Simply explaining was too troublesome, and making up overly elaborate excuses would only invite suspicion.<br /> <br />“S-So, is that so…”<br /> <br />Sara furrowed her brows suspiciously, but it was just a momentary reaction. She quickly switched her mood and continued with a bright voice.<br /> <br />“Asai-san, your outfit today looks really good on you.”<br /> <br />“Thank you.”<br /> <br />As Haruya replied, Sara continued to gaze at him with eyes that seemed to be pleading or appealing for something.<br /> <br />Haruya, perplexed, tilted his head, but her round eyes didn’t seem to want to leave him.<br /> <br />After a while, Sara, somewhat hesitantly, looked up with upturned eyes.<br /> <br />Her cheeks seemed to puff up ever so slightly.<br /> <br />“Um… is my outfit today weird?”<br /> <br />Her eyes were silently pleading for him to say something.<br /> <br />Haruya, reflexively, responded with a genuine “Huh, it suits you really well.”<br /> <br />“Thank you!”<br /> <br />Confirming that Sara’s anxious expression had brightened, Haruya inwardly scolded himself.<br /> <br />(Hey, you should’ve said it doesn’t suit her. Why am I just stating my honest opinion straightforwardly! I…)<br /> <br />Today’s date is not for fun.<br /> <br />Its purpose is to reconsider Sara’s excessive, perhaps fabricated, overestimation of himself and make her lose interest in him.<br /> <br />Haruya shook his head vigorously, as if trying to change his consciousness right there.<br /> <br />“Do we have a plan for today?”<br /> <br />Standing next to Haruya, Sara asked with eyes filled with anticipation.<br /> <br />“Yeah, I have it all planned out, so leave it to me.”<br /> <br />“Yes! Thank you very much…”<br /> <br />When Haruya gave her a refreshing smile, Sara nodded and wore a gentle smile.<br /> <br />(…I can handle leading the date. Sorry, Himekawa-san… But, my evaluation is sure to drop after today.)<br /> <br />With an evil grin in his heart, Haruya and Sara walked shoulder to shoulder towards their destination.<br /> <br />“Hey, Himekawa-san, you haven’t had lunch yet, right?”<br /> <br />It was around 1 PM.<br /> <br />A perfect time for lunch.<br /> <br />“Yes, not yet.”<br /> <br />“Got it. Let’s start by having lunch.”<br /> <br />“I was just getting hungry, so that works for me.”<br /> <br />And so, the two immediately proceeded to have lunch.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />On the way to their destination, the streets were quite crowded, perhaps because it was a holiday.<br /> <br />Especially the street with stylish cafes was teeming with couples.<br /> <br />“…T-There are a lot of couples here.”<br /> <br />Sara murmured in a small voice.<br /> <br />“Well, it’s the weekend, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />“Yeah… I wonder if we look like a couple to others?”<br /> <br />“I don’t know.”<br /> <br />To be honest, Haruya thought they probably didn’t look like a couple.<br /> <br />There was a clear distance between him and Sara.<br /> <br />They didn’t hold hands or do anything couple-like.<br /> <br />They just walked side by side, maintaining some distance.<br /> <br />The student-like couple walking ahead of Haruya and Sara occasionally held hands with a closeness that suggested their shoulders might touch.<br /> <br />(Well, I guess that’s the kind of closeness you’d expect from a couple.)<br /> <br />Haruya’s gaze, with a wry smile, followed the couple in front, and Sara timidly spoke up.<br /> <br />“…I-Is it normal for people to be so close like that?”<br /> <br />Sara’s face flushed with confusion and embarrassment.<br /> <br />“Well, but I think that level looks like a couple.”<br /> <br />Casually, Haruya said, and Sara closed the distance with Haruya by just one step.<br /> <br />A faint citrus scent stimulated Haruya’s nostrils.<br /> <br />It was a distance where their hands might touch while walking.<br /> <br />Inadvertently, when Haruya looked at Sara standing beside him, Sara said something with a shy expression.<br /> <br />“I-I find it embarrassing to be that close… s-so, maybe this much.”<br /> <br />Sara offered a reserved smile, intertwining her fingers.<br /> <br />(Huh, what is this adorable creature?)<br /> <br />Blushing cheeks, yet adorable gestures.<br /> <br />Her actions were charming, and Haruya couldn’t help but think, “Cute.”<br /> <br />Haruya immediately reminded himself, “No, that’s not it, I won’t let it be like that!”<br /> <br />Today’s goal for the date was to lower Sara’s favorability.<br /> <br />Praising her as cute would be counterproductive, so he had to avoid thinking of her as cute as much as possible.<br /> <br />While maintaining composure to conceal his unease, Haruya asked Sara.<br /> <br />“…But why do we need to have a couple’s distance?”<br /> <br />“…I checked around, and there weren’t many people of the opposite sex with a distance like ours… s-so, I wanted to blend in with the surroundings.”<br /> <br />Is that not okay? Haruya was met with Sara’s sorrowful eyes.<br /> <br />Haruya felt his face getting warm, but he couldn’t bring himself to say it was not okay.<br /> <br />(If I say it’s not okay here, it might seem like I’m just trying to hide my embarrassment…)<br /> <br />It seemed counterproductive, so Haruya could only nod.<br /> <br />“…Thank you!”<br /> <br />Seeing her smile with her teeth showing, Haruya felt an inexplicable sense of frustration.<br /> <br />It felt like she was getting what she wanted.<br /> <br />(Damn it, this beautiful girl. Next time, I won’t let things go her way.)<br /> <br />With that thought in his mind, Haruya quickened his pace to the destination.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>“Here is…”<br /> <br />“Lucky House, huh? Let’s have lunch here.”<br /> <br />Feeling embarrassed, they walked for about fifteen minutes.<br /> <br />The two arrived at a large chain restaurant specializing in gyudon (beef bowl).<br /> <br />it had a menu primarily centered around affordable gyudon (beef bowl), and the predominant customer base consisted of salarymen or students, with a common feature being a higher number of male customers.<br /> <br />Choosing such restaurant as the lunch spot for a date would generally be considered lacking in taste due to its inexpensive menu.<br /> <br />Haruya deliberately selected restaurant to lower Sara’s evaluation of him.<br /> <br />Haruya genuinely thought that Sara would be disappointed in him, but…<br /> <br />“Sh-Should we go in!”<br /> <br />Her face seemed tense, but for some reason, Haruya felt her energy level was surprisingly high.<br /> <br />“Y-Yeah.”<br /> <br />Feeling somewhat overwhelmed by Sara, the two entered restaurant.</p>


<p>After being guided to a table, Sara began to look around the restaurant with eyes that seemed to be observing something strange.<br /> <br />She appeared fidgety, lacking composure.<br /> <br />Observing Sara’s behavior with curiosity, Haruya noticed her fidgety movements. When she noticed his gaze, Sara fidgeted even more before answering.<br /> <br />“…I’m sorry, but this is my first time coming to this place.”<br /> <br />“…Huh, oh, is that so.”<br /> <br />“Yes, so I’m a bit nervous right now… I’m sorry.”<br /> <br />“But, it’s unusual for someone not to have been to restaurant before.”<br /> <br />“Well, um, that might be true. I come from a strict and affluent family, so I haven’t had many chances to visit these kinds of places…”<br /> <br />“Huh, but before—”<br /> <br />Before Haruya could mention that she knew about family restaurant visits, Sara preemptively responded.<br /> <br />“I knew about family restaurants because we occasionally went there as a family. But, I haven’t had many opportunities to visit other places like this.”<br /> <br />And, with a self-deprecating expression, Sara lowered her face once before breaking into a beaming smile.<br /> <br />“I’ve actually wanted to try a gyudon place for a while, but as a woman alone, the hurdle was high… However, thanks to Asai-san suggesting it, I could finally come. Thank you very much.”<br /> <br />“Uh…”<br /> <br />Seeing Sara’s genuine smile, Haruya inadvertently broke into a cold sweat.<br /> <br />(…No, no, no! This is weird… Why pinpoint that exactly!?)<br /> <br />Thinking that the purpose was to lower her favorability, Haruya couldn’t help but feel a headache.<br /> <br />At first, he tried to convince himself that she was just being considerate, but seeing Sara’s satisfied expression, he couldn’t deny that she genuinely felt grateful.<br /> <br />(She understands me without putting it into words. Maybe Asai-san is really my destined one…)<br /> <br />Internally, Haruya was panicking, thinking that now the only way to disappoint her was through the taste.<br /> <br />“Asai-san, this is really delicious!”<br /> <br />It was a situation reminiscent of a noble young lady being impressed by cup ramen for the first time.<br /> <br />Sara’s eyes sparkled as she savored the beef bowl, genuinely melting with delight.<br /> <br />“Unbelievably tasty! Sugoi!”<br /> <br />“Hehe, Asai-san, your Japanese is still a bit basic.”<br /> <br />Sara laughed amusingly, but for Haruya, it was no laughing matter.<br /> <br />If he allowed himself to be overestimated further, discussions about S-class beauties would spread, making school an unbearable place for him.<br /> <br />(This is… I need to lower the evaluation next time! Hang in there, me, don’t give up.)<br /> <br />That was the only thing Haruya could strongly convince himself of at the moment.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Leaving the beef bowl chain, behind, the place Haruya proposed they head to was…<br /> <br />“The second floor here. It seems like there are various sports, games, and even karaoke.”<br /> <br />“Oh, it sounds like there’s a lot to do here.”<br /> <br />It seemed like a large entertainment facility.<br /> <br />Haruya’s reason for suggesting this place was that if he could defeat Sara thoroughly in various sports and games, he might be able to lower his evaluation. He schemed that this might be a way to achieve it.<br /> <br />(I heard that in places like this, men usually go easy and try to make their date happy. But I’ll go without holding back.)<br /> <br />While harboring this wicked plan in his heart, Sara suddenly asked a question as they stood side by side.<br /> <br />“Asai-san… is this your first time here?”<br /> <br />“It is. We should probably go to the second floor for the procedures.”<br /> <br />“Shall we then?”<br /> <br />So, the two headed upstairs and started the procedures.<br /> <br />Since there was a student discount available at the ticket machine, Haruya used it, and when he saw the next screen, his eyes widened.<br /> <br />“…So that’s how it is.”<br /> <br />“What happened?”<br /> <br />“In addition to the student discount, it seems there’s an additional discount for couples.”<br /> <br />Sara blushed slightly upon hearing Haruya’s explanation.<br /> <br />“…There seem to be various sales, and there’s even one for couples.”<br /> <br />“What do you think?” Sara nodded her head and said, “Taking advantage of discounts is always a good idea.”<br /> <br />So, after confirming there weren’t many people around, they purchased tickets for couples.<br /> <br />For Haruya, it was economically beneficial to choose the cheaper option.<br /> <br />With the tickets handed over to the staff at the entrance, Haruya asked Sara.<br /> <br />“Where should we go first… any place you want to visit?”<br /> <br />“Well… oh, I’d like to try that.”<br /> <br />After staring at the guide board for a while, Sara pointed to the central skating rink inside the building.<br /> <br />“…I’ve never done it before, so I thought it might be an interesting experience. Is that okay?”<br /> <br />“It’s been a while since I did it in elementary school, roller skating. Let’s give it a try.”<br /> <br />Both being inexperienced, there was still some anxiety, but they quickly put on protective gear.<br /> <br />Haruya thought that Sara, being a girl, might prefer sports or activities she was familiar with, but it seemed that Sara was an adventurer at heart.<br /> <br />Once ready, the two headed to the skating rink.<br /> <br />“Shall we skate?”<br /> <br />“Y-Yes…”<br /> <br />Haruya was about to try circling the rink, but he noticed something.<br /> <br />Sara’s legs were shaking, and it seemed challenging for her to start skating.<br /> <br />Upon closer inspection, she was leaning against the wall.<br /> <br />“…Are you okay? Himekawa-san.”<br /> <br />“I’m sorry. It’s unexpectedly frightening.”<br /> <br />“If it’s your first time, it can’t be helped.”<br /> <br />“I haven’t done it since elementary school… Asai-san, you’re good at this, right?”<br /> <br />Surprised that Haruya could skate well, Sara widened her eyes.<br /> <br />“I’m surprised myself, but it seems like I still remember the sensation.”<br /> <br />“…If it’s not too much trouble, could you teach me the tricks or something?”<br /> <br />“The key is probably not to be unnecessarily scared. It feels like you’re struggling due to crisis awareness.”<br /> <br />Indeed, children were gliding smoothly compared to adults.<br /> <br />While kids didn’t think much about falling, mature adults always considered the risk of injury.<br /> <br />It was natural, but in terms of skating, going fast was less risky than going slow.<br /> <br />“So, I think it’s best to go for it and skate boldly. Can I skate first to show you?”<br /> <br />Suggesting to showcase his skating skills as an example, Haruya proposed this to Sara, who shook her head slightly.<br /> <br />“N-No, it’s not allowed.”<br /> <br />” ………… “<br /> <br />Being left alone would make anxious, but then Haruya would be unable to move freely.<br /> <br />Wondering what to do, Sara, as if offering a brilliant idea, grabbed the hem of Haruya’s clothes.<br /> <br />“Um, I want to get used to skating first, so can I be led by Asai-san?”<br /> <br />In other words, since Sara is afraid to skate alone, she wants Haruya to lead her to get used to it.<br /> <br />That’s Sara’s plan.<br /> <br />“No, I’m not used to skating either. Besides, even with protective gear, isn’t it still dangerous?”<br /> <br />“It’s okay to go along the wall… please.”<br /> <br />Modestly but desperately pleading, Sara made her request.<br /> <br />To be honest, Haruya didn’t quite understand why Sara was so determined to skate.<br /> <br />Maybe she wanted to try it out of curiosity, but it didn’t seem like a strong reason to challenge something scary.<br /> <br />Curious, Haruya decided to ask Sara.<br /> <br />“…I’m okay with it, but is there a reason you’re putting in so much effort to skate?”<br /> <br />“W-well, it’s because the children look like they’re having so much fun skating. I thought it would be fun once I got used to it.”<br /> <br />“I see.”<br /> <br />Looking around, he could see children having fun skating.<br /> <br />Sara added, frowning slightly and tightening her lips.<br /> <br />“I don’t want to settle for not being able to do what kids can do…!”<br /> <br />Seemingly competitive, Sara puffed her cheeks for a moment.<br /> <br />Soon after, she returned to her usual composed expression.<br /> <br />“…Pfft.”<br /> <br />Seeing this unexpected side of Sara, Haruya couldn’t help but let out a small laugh.<br /> <br />“W-what’s so funny…”<br /> <br />“Sorry, sorry.”<br /> <br />Sara, who seemed more childish than he thought, remained puffed up for a moment but soon lowered her gaze and grabbed the hem of Haruya’s clothes again.<br /> <br />“Well then, excuse me.”<br /> <br />“Alright, let’s slowly skate along the wall.”<br /> <br />“Y-yes.”<br /> <br />As Haruya observed Sara, who was slightly nervous, he also started feeling a bit embarrassed.<br /> <br />Thus, the practice of Sara skating with rollerblades began.<br /> <br />(She can’t skate at all, so the bet won’t work without this… reluctantly, reluctantly.)<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Roll, roll, roll.<br /> <br />There was the figure of a beautiful girl with light brown hair, gracefully gliding on the rink.<br /> <br />The skating rink, being an indoor space, attracted a lot of attention.<br /> <br />Many users were captivated by her beauty and graceful movements.<br /> <br />“I did it! I did it. It’s fun, Asai-san.”<br /> <br />“You catch on fast…”<br /> <br />Not even twenty minutes into practice.<br /> <br />Sara, who had overcome her fear of skating, was now able to skate without Haruya’s support.<br /> <br />(…Isn’t her growth rate too incredible? Well, it did help me, though…)<br /> <br />While casually watching Sara gracefully glide on the ice, Haruya couldn’t help but recall the moments when they were both skating earlier.<br /> <br />He remembered Sara clinging to the hem of his clothes just a while ago.<br /> <br />Although Sara is now elegantly maneuvering on the ice, not long ago, she clung not only to the hem of Haruya’s clothes but even tightly held onto his arm.<br /> <br />Sometimes, her ample chest would press against his arm, creating an awkward sensation for Haruya.<br /> <br />Squish, squish.<br /> <br />At times, Sara would press against him, and he could feel the softness against his back. It made Haruya’s heart race, and he couldn’t stay calm.<br /> <br />As that time came to an end, Haruya couldn’t help but let out a relieved sigh.<br /> <br />(…That sensation was dangerous.)<br /> <br />Therefore, Haruya was relieved that Sara quickly grasped the technique.<br /> <br />After a while, Sara returned to Haruya, who was standing near the wall.<br /> <br />“Asai-san, let’s skate together!”<br /> <br />In high spirits, Sara suggested.<br /> <br />If she had a tail, it would probably be bouncing around.<br /> <br />“Alright, how about we make it a competition?”<br /> <br />“A c-competition?”<br /> <br />Unexpectedly, Sara’s eyes widened.<br /> <br />“The one who completes two laps first wins.”<br /> <br />Saying this, Sara answered with a challenging smile.<br /> <br />(…Finally, the time has come. The time for my evaluation to be judged fairly.)<br /> <br />Internally, Haruya raised the corners of his mouth in a smug grin.<br /> <br />(Let’s win without mercy…!)</p>

<p>After enjoying a few rounds of skating and feeling satisfied, the two decided to stop.<br /> <br />They then enjoyed various sports such as batting, badminton, table tennis, golf, and more, making the most of the large entertainment facility.<br /> <br />Although Haruya challenged Sara to various games every now and then, the result was that Haruya lost every single time.<br /> <br />Even though he gave it his all without holding back, he couldn’t win in any of them.<br /> <br />(…This is beyond embarrassing, isn’t it, me?)<br /> <br />Feeling disappointed with the results,<br /> <br />Haruya’s original goal was to show Sara that he wasn’t that capable of a guy after all. However…<br /> <br />(But being so weak… It’s a bit painful to have my evaluation lowered for not being able to do things.)<br /> <br />Regret and a sense of pathetic self-loathing swirl simultaneously in my chest.<br /> <br />“Princess Himekawa has impressive athletic skills…”<br /> <br />While searching for a resting spot, Haruya expressed his admiration to Sara.<br /> <br />In response to his words, Sara lowered the corners of her eyes and slightly lifted the corners of her mouth.<br /> <br />“I am none other than the daughter of the Himekawa family.”<br /> <br />Unconsciously, she wore an expression that seemed to say, “Of course, I can do these things.”<br /> <br />However, it seemed that Haruya had some issues with Sara’s statement.<br /> <br />“…Doesn’t it have nothing to do with the family background?”<br /> <br />With a puzzled expression, Haruya said, causing Sara to abruptly stop in her tracks.<br /> <br />“……Huh?”<br /> <br />“If Himekawa-san can do sports and academics, I don’t see how it’s related to her family background.”<br /> <br />Following Haruya’s words, Sara remained silent for a moment, tightly closing her lips.<br /> <br />“My, my family is from a traditional and strict, prestigious background… So, um, excelling in both academics and sports is natural for me.”<br /> <br />“Sure, there might be some connection, but I think it’s not everything. Sorry, let me correct myself there.”<br /> <br />While we don’t know the exact background of the Himekawa family,<br /> <br />we can infer from the image that it’s a conservative and strict household, emphasizing the importance of living up to the family name.<br /> <br />But even if that’s the case…<br /> <br />“If it were me, I’d probably run away or rebel immediately. Just because it’s the family’s policy doesn’t mean it’s easy to handle.”<br /> <br />No matter how much the surroundings encourage and provide a good environment, ultimately, the person has to put in the effort themselves.<br /> <br />Of course, the environment is an important factor, but at the end of the day, the individual needs to persevere.<br /> <br />Haruya strongly believed in recognizing the person who had overcome challenges.<br /> <br />“…And also, it doesn’t sit well with me if I lost just because she’s the daughter of the Himekawa family.”<br /> <br />In other words…<br /> <br />“Well, not because she’s the daughter of the Himekawa family, but because she’s Sara Himekawa, that’s why she’s amazing. At least, that’s what I think.”<br /> <br />Haruya said it with conviction.<br /> <br />In response, Sara widened her eyes, then her expression changed suddenly.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/k8wpmIc.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>It was almost as if she was trying to cover up her embarrassment…<br /> <br />“Thank you…”<br /> <br />In a voice so soft it could barely be heard, she spoke with her eyes downcast.<br /> <br />“Um, would you like to try that?”<br /> <br />As if blatantly changing the subject, Sara pointed to something.<br /> <br />Instinctively, Haruya squinted his eyes.<br /> <br />“Is it okay if it’s scary?”<br /> <br />Sara pointed to a gun-shooting game full of horror.<br /> <br />Haruya have never played this game before,<br /> <br />but it was obvious from the appearance of the game cabinet that it looked scary.<br /> <br />“I’m okay, but are you sure, Himekawa-san? Usually, girls are not great with this kind of thing.”<br /> <br />“I’ve never played that kind of game, so I want to try.”<br /> <br />Sara said, grabbing her own chest tightly.<br /> <br />From her gesture, it was clear that she was nervous.<br /> <br />Sara seemed to have an adventurous mindset,<br /> <br />as Haruya had noticed during skating.<br /> <br />“Is it okay, really?”<br /> <br />“I’m fine…”<br /> <br />Checking once again, Haruya and Sara entered the box-shaped console together.<br /> <br />Sitting down and manipulating the controls for a while, Sara picked up the gun placed in front of her.<br /> <br />She looked closely, seemingly fascinated, then nodded to herself.<br /> <br />“…I see. So, we shoot zombies in this game.”<br /> <br />Her voice seemed to tremble, but Sara had a curious glint in her eyes.<br /> <br />“…Oh, this game. It measures our heart rate.”<br /> <br />“Meaning, we can see how scared each other gets, right?”<br /> <br />Sara said, looking at Haruya with anxious eyes.<br /> <br />If the heart rate is displayed, it means that no matter how much you pretend to be brave, it will reveal how scared you really are. Apparently, this game is designed to expose the coward within.<br /> <br />“I’ll take the challenge, then?”<br /> <br />Even so, Sara confidently suggested.<br /> <br />“Of course. The one with the higher heart rate loses, then.”<br /> <br />“Yes!”<br /> <br />“I’ve been losing every time so far, so I’ll make sure to win this time.”<br /> <br />“I hope so.”<br /> <br />And so, the two prepared to face the horror shooting game.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />My impressions after trying this type of game were that it focused more on thrilling and scaring than actual horror.<br /> <br />Although I didn’t scream, when zombies suddenly appeared in front of me, the shaking of the console made my body tremble involuntarily.<br /> <br />But when a large number of zombies attacked, the horror aspect became significant because the faces of the zombies were emphasized in close-up shots.<br /> <br />If I had been alone, I would have run away for sure. …….<br /> <br />[“H-Hey, I didn’t sign up for this shaking!”]<br /> <br />“Asai-san, zombies… I can’t… I can’t defeat the zombies.”<br /> <br />“Ugh, I don’t want to see the screen… I’m closing my eyes.”<br /> <br />Sara’s reactions, combined with her cute responses, somehow made the fear more bearable.<br /> <br />After finishing a playthrough, the results of both their heart rates were displayed on the screen.<br /> <br />Seeing the results, Haruya made a small triumphant gesture and called out to Sara.<br /> <br />“Himekawa-san, it looks like I won.”<br /> <br />(Yes, I won… in a horror game.)<br /> <br />Internally gloating, Haruya sighed softly,<br /> <br />“Haa,” feeling a bit defeated once again.<br /> <br />“…Uh, Himekawa-san?”<br /> <br />“…I-It’s… I’m fine… Uh, yes.”<br /> <br />Despite insisting verbally, her complexion did not look fine at all.<br /> <br />Her face was pale, and her lips trembled.<br /> <br />Once they left the game cabinet, Sara huddled on the floor, holding her legs.<br /> <br />Seeing her shivering, clearly terrified,<br /> <br />Haruya felt a pang of guilt. He had originally intended to lower her favorability, so he hesitated to speak. However, against his better judgment, he reflexively offered a comforting suggestion.<br /> <br />“Um, should I… lend you my hand?”<br /> <br />Internally, he scolded himself, thinking, “I should have refrained from offering,”<br /> <br />ut it seemed that Sara was feeling the same way he was.<br /> <br />As Haruya extended his hand, Sara tightly grabbed it. Her hand felt strangely cold.<br /> <br />Haruya tried to pull her up,<br /> <br />but something unexpected happened.<br /> <br />“Um, Himekawa-san, your hand?”</p>



<p>Even after helping Sara up and releasing her hand, she showed no signs of letting go of his. Haruya was taken aback.<br /> <br />Immediately after called out to her, sara turned her moist eyes to haruya.<br /> <br />“Sorry… Can I… hold your hand for a little longer?”<br /> <br />She said while she was holding hand.<br /> <br />Even if he wanted to say no, seeing Sara’s frightened eyes, he couldn’t bring himself to do it.<br /> <br />Haruya found himself in a dilemma, scratching the back of his head, muttering quietly.<br /> <br />“…Well, I guess it can’t be helped.”<br /> <br />If he forcefully let go of her hand now, it would be too obvious that he was trying to make her dislike him. He didn’t want to behave so blatantly to be disliked.<br /> <br />(Sigh, I just want to make her lose interest in me without being disliked, that’s all.)<br /> <br />Sighing, feeling disgusted with his own convenience, Haruya was at that moment.<br /> <br />Just then, they unexpectedly encountered the girl from earlier.<br /> <br />“Oh, it’s Haruya. Haruya.<br /> <br />Hey, Miyu. Don’t move without permission. …… “<br /> <br />At the direction of Haruya and Sara’s gazes, a parent and child were approaching them.<br /> <br />The parent and child happened to be the lost girl and her mother, whom Haruya had talked to around noon.<br /> <br />“Uh, is that girl… an acquaintance?”<br /> <br />“No, don’t worry about it, Himekawa-san.”<br /> <br />With a puzzled expression, Sara tilted her head. Haruya felt a sense of impatience.<br /> <br />The reason for Haruya’s concern was<br /> <br />that the lost girl, Miyu, had called out to him as “Haruya.” The parent and child were aware of his real name, which he wanted to keep hidden.<br /> <br />For now, all Haruya could do was try his best not to reveal his true identity to Sara.<br /> <br />He involuntarily broke into a cold sweat. Miyu approached without any consideration.<br /> <br />Just then, Miyu’s mother’s phone rang, and she temporarily left Miyu in their care.<br /> <br />“Mom, Haruya is holding hand! Haru, you’re playing hide and seek!”<br /> <br />Innocently clinging to him, Miyu seemed to find solace in Haruya. He could only manage a wry smile in response.<br /> <br />Responding to Miyu’s comment, Haruya felt Sara let go of his hand, clearly uncomfortable with the idea of them holding hands.<br /> <br />Miyu continued, curious.<br /> <br />“Haruya, is this lady your wife?”<br /> <br />“Well, not exactly… we’re more like friends…”<br /> <br />“Really? Then you’re friends?”<br /> <br />In reality, Haruya had mistakenly assumed that he and Sara were just destined opponents.<br /> <br />But to convey that to the young Miyu as “destined opponents” wouldn’t make much sense.<br /> <br />Therefore, Haruya nodded in agreement.<br /> <br />“Ah, Miss over there… has a red face.”<br /> <br />Sara was pointed out by Miyu.<br /> <br />Haruya didn’t understand why Sara blushed when being called a friend. Nevertheless, seeing Sara with a red face, Haruya…<br /> <br />(Friend …… It seems that Asai-san and I are friends……!)<br /> <br />Internally, Sara seemed rather pleased with the idea.<br /> <br />As they lingered in the aftermath of the encounter, Sara realized something and asked Haruya.<br /> <br />“Um, Asai-san… by the way, what does ‘Haru-ya’ mean?”<br /> <br />“…Well… SWOOOOSH.”<br /> <br />Haruya unintentionally broke into a cold sweat and panicked.<br /> <br />(You shouldn’t notice it, you shouldn’t notice it…)<br /> <br />Trying not to lose composure, he reassured himself internally.<br /> <br />“See, I’m a cheerful guy, right? That’s why they call me ‘Haruya’ from the nickname ‘Bright Man,'” he explained.<br /> <br />“Oh, I see. I actually thought Yu Asai might be a fake name…”<br /> <br />“…”<br /> <br />It was indeed the truth, but Haruya could only desperately cover it up.<br /> <br />He couldn’t afford to reveal his real name; his identity would be compromised.<br /> <br />“No, it’s not like that at all. Yeah… really, it’s not like that,”<br /> <br />Haruya nodded repeatedly to himself.<br /> <br />“Alright, it’s about time, Himekawa-san, let’s go.”<br /> <br />He thought he could still manage.<br /> <br />Just as he was about to make a hasty exit, Miyu’s mother, returning from the phone call, added an unnecessary comment.<br /> <br />“Sorry about earlier, and for keeping my daughter company. Thank you so much, Mr. Akasaki, for being with her.”<br /> <br />” ………… “<br /> <br />With Miyu’s mother’s words, Haruya’s mind went blank.<br /> <br />Seeing Haruya in this state, Sara didn’t press further; she mumbled, “Akasaki? …Akasaki?” repeatedly, as if confirming.<br /> <br />(…I’m done for. I can’t possibly cover this up…)<br /> <br />If Miyu’s words were still manageable, the appearance of her mother changed the game.<br /> <br />The opponent was now an adult.<br /> <br />Haruya couldn’t afford to be suspected of using a fake name, as it would breed distrust.<br /> <br />Thus, in this situation, the only thing Haruya could do was to ensure that nothing more embarrassing would be revealed.<br /> <br />That is the only thing he can do.<br /> <br />“Himekawa-san, it’s about time for us to go…”<br /> <br />Haruya tried to guide Sara, but she didn’t seem willing to move.<br /> <br />“Haruya, don’t be mean to the lady,”<br /> <br />Miyu, the little girl, pointed out, which made Haruya say, “I’m sorry,” and lower his gaze, but this innocent remark became the catalyst for Haruya’s tragedy.<br /> <br />“Hey, Miyu. Haruya is a big brother, right?”<br /> <br />Miyu’s mother, rightfully as a parent, spoke the correct words to Miyu.<br /> <br />“Yes, Haruya oniichan.”<br /> <br />Normally, being called “big brother” might have been heartwarming, but Haruya was not in a state to appreciate it.<br /> <br />Inwardly, he was holding his head in despair, letting out a sigh repeatedly.<br /> <br />(…What do I do? It’s impossible already…)<br /> <br />Recalling his earlier casual excuse,<br /> <br />“See, I’m a cheerful guy, right? That’s why they call me ‘Haruya’ from the nickname ‘Bright Man,'”<br /> <br />he realized how this careless reasoning led to being called “Haruya oniichan.”<br /> <br />The main culprit should be Miyu’s mother, but… he couldn’t blame her. He couldn’t.<br /> <br />This is bad, dangerous, and these three words echoed in his mind repeatedly.<br /> <br />“Ah, it seems we’re running out of time, so we’ll excuse ourselves now.”<br /> <br />“Bye-bye, Haruya. I mean, Haruya oniichan.”<br /> <br />Checking the time, it seemed urgent, so Miyu and her mother quickly left the scene.<br /> <br />Left behind were only Haruya and Sara.<br /> <br />(Well, today was enjoyable, so let’s head home!)<br /> <br />While convincing himself inwardly, as he was about to start walking, Haruya felt a tug at the hem of his clothes.<br /> <br />“W-Wait… Asai-san. I mean, Akasaki san.”<br /> <br />” ……… “<br /> <br />The awkward atmosphere filled the air because his real name had been revealed.<br /> <br />Simultaneously, the fact that it was a fake name had also come to light.<br /> <br />Sara seemed to have several questions, but she first touched on the topic of his lateness.<br /> <br />“Um… I was thinking as I listened to your story, but was your tardiness today really because you got lost, not because you helped Miyu-chan who got lost?”<br /> <br />“Huh? Ah, well, yeah, that’s true.”<br /> <br />“You should have just said that…”<br /> <br />After confirming just that, Sara seemed satisfied, and she smiled as she walked ahead.<br /> <br />(…Huh?)<br /> <br />Haruya involuntarily let out a dumbfounded voice.<br /> <br />He thought she might inquire about more, considering the circumstances.<br /> <br />“It was an unexpected, but I’m not angry about you using a fake name. “<br /> <br />” …… Sorry, it’s complicated.”<br /> <br />(I don’t want to stand out in class. I don’t want to get into trouble with the school.)<br /> <br />These feelings are dominating Haruya’s mind.<br /> <br />“Yes, I understand, don’t worry. …… “<br /> <br />Sara said with a warm, humane smile. Haruya, on the other hand, had no reason to feel reassured.<br /> <br />He could only hope for one thing<br /> <br />– that he wouldn’t encounter Sara in school and that there wouldn’t be any opportunity for awkward interactions.<br /> <br />(…Please, God, I really hope for that.)<br /> <br />Haruya could only rely on divine intervention in his heart.</p>

<p> <br />The next morning.<br /> <br />Having welcomed the morning without getting any decent sleep, Haruya, burdened with more drowsiness than usual, headed to high school.<br /> <br />After returning from yesterday’s date,<br /> <br />Haruya repeatedly begged Sara not to reveal his true identity with messages like, “Even if you know who I am, please don’t tell anyone! I beg you!” Sara responded with, “I get it, lol,” but the issue wasn’t significant enough to alleviate Haruya’s anxiety.<br /> <br />Arriving at school, Haruya, seated at his desk, was more engrossed in the conversations of S-class beauties than usual. However, from what he could hear, there was no indication that Sara was discussing his true identity.<br /> <br />Still, it seemed they were discussing the ideal male figure, with S-class beauties exchanging opinions.<br /> <br />“—What kind of person is Sara’s ideal romantic partner?”<br /> <br />This question was posed by Yuna, who seemed somewhat bored.<br /> <br />“I think someone who doesn’t use helping others as an excuse for being late is cool…?”<br /> <br />“Hmm, Sara-chan. Can you give a specific scenario?”<br /> <br />Rin tilted her head cutely.<br /> <br />Sara, recalling the time spent with Haruya yesterday, began to speak.<br /> <br />“For example, let’s say there’s a lost girl, and you help her. As a result, you end up being late, but you don’t use that as an excuse and hide it.”<br /> <br />“…That’s oddly specific.”<br /> <br />“But, you know, doing things like that casually… it feels cool. Since you’re not flaunting it.”<br /> <br />In response to Yuna’s statement, Sara vigorously nodded, saying, “Exactly, exactly!”<br /> <br />“Doing kindness in secret… yeah, that does sound cool. Anything else?”<br /> <br />“Someone who puts their full effort into everything, maybe? I also find it cool if the person has a slightly childish side.”<br /> <br />This referred to the time Haruya challenged Sara to various competitions at the entertainment facility.<br /> <br />Haruya had challenged her wholeheartedly, trying to liven up the atmosphere.<br /> <br />Yes, that’s how Sara perceived Haruya’s actions.<br /> <br />In response to Sara’s words, Yuna put her hand to her chin in thought.<br /> <br />“Putting full effort into everything, huh. It does make you want to cheer for them. Like in studies or sports?”<br /> <br />“Of course, there’s studying, but I think sports or something where you can see the person’s effort by their sweat is even better…”<br /> <br />Recalling Haruya, Sara spoke, and Rin narrowed her eyes, smiling mischievously.<br /> <br />“Wow, Sara-chan. That’s quite specific. You seem really happy about it! Is it from personal experience? About that person.”<br /> <br />“…It’s a secret.”<br /> <br />“Aww, keeping it a secret?”<br /> <br />“…Sara, you look really happy.”<br /> <br />“Yes, I’m really happy right now.”<br /> <br />So, while S-class beauties were engaging in such discussions, Haruya was desperately trying not to blush with embarrassment.<br /> <br />Hearing his exaggerated actions being praised in his presence felt like a form of embarrassment play.<br /> <br />Haruya suddenly remembered Sara’s ideal male figure discussion.<br /> <br />[Someone who doesn’t use helping others as an excuse for being late is cool… Like, for example, if there’s a lost girl, and you help her. As a result, you end up being late, but you don’t use that as an excuse and hide it.]<br /> <br />(That’s me… and it’s not a fabrication; it’s a fact that can’t be denied.)<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[Someone who puts their full effort into everything, maybe? I also find it cool if the person has a slightly childish side.]<br /> <br />(This might not be self-praise… I think she’s referring to the challenges I proposed. I did put my all into each of them, and I did sweat a bit…)<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Realizing he was talking about himself,<br /> <br />Haruya acknowledged it and felt his face getting slightly warm.<br /> <br />At that moment, the door creaked open, and a loud voice reached their ears.<br /> <br />“Take your seats!”<br /> <br />It was the entrance of their homeroom teacher, Meika Tokoyami.<br /> <br />In her mid-twenties, Meika was the Japanese teacher, a woman with a height of 165 cm, unusually tall for a woman. She always wore a suit that complemented her appearance.<br /> <br />Although it was ten minutes before their usual homeroom time, Meika stood in front of the teacher’s desk, instructing the chatty classmates to take their seats.<br /> <br />“We have an exchange event with another class in the final class today, so I’ll explain that.”<br /> <br />Surely, the early homeroom time was influenced by the explanation of the exchange event with another class.<br /> <br />(Hey, hey… this is news to me…)<br /> <br />(An exchange event with another class… Sounds interesting.)<br /> <br />(There aren’t many chances to interact with students from other classes, so I’m looking forward to it…)<br /> <br />The students’ eyes were full of expectation as they looked at Meika.<br /> <br />Despite the students around showing interest, Haruya casually ignored the teacher’s explanation. However, he summarized the key points of the exchange event with other classes into three:<br /> <br />Gather in the gym within the specified time.<br /> <br />Interact with students from other classes in a rotation format four times (Note: It might also involve interacting with classmates).<br /> <br />Engage in a three-minute conversation.<br /> <br />These were the rough outlines.<br /> <br />While students continued to be excited about the exchange event with other classes, Haruya paid no attention.<br /> <br />He had already dismissed such events as irrelevant to him.<br /> <br />(But I can’t help but be curious about Himekawa-san’s movements more than these events…)<br /> <br />Haruya suddenly turned his gaze to Sara, who was sitting nearby. He sighed inwardly.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>Lunchtime arrived after the morning classes.<br /> <br />After confirming that no one was around, Haruya put extra effort into making himself presentable in the restroom and headed to the rooftop.<br /> <br />Going to the rooftop during lunchtime had become a routine for him.<br /> <br />Upon opening the door, he could breathe in the fresh air and feel a sense of brightness. However, Haruya’s current state of mind was filled only with impatience and despair.<br /> <br />“Oh, Asai-san… I mean, Akasaki-san.”<br /> <br />Approaching the rooftop, he immediately spotted Sara.<br /> <br />She turned around, wearing a bright smile and waving happily.<br /> <br />“…!”<br /> <br />Swallowing hard, Haruya cautiously approached Sara.<br /> <br />Although it wasn’t certain whether his true identity had been exposed, it was clear that it was only a matter of time now that his real name was known.<br /> <br />Until now, Haruya had intentionally avoided sitting next to Sara and even distanced himself from her. However, now he chose to sit next to her,<br /> <br />as decreasing Sara’s evaluation of him and eliminating her interest would not be a wise move.<br /> <br />The most practical thing Haruya could do now was to ask Sara to keep it a secret.<br /> <br />…In other words, he had to make her promise not to reveal his identity.<br /> <br />But why wasn’t she digging into the fake name, even though she knew? Haruya, holding back his thoughts, turned to Sara and–<br /> <br />“…Could you please not tell anyone about me? I’m begging you.”<br /> <br />He pleaded earnestly, and Sara, with a nonchalant expression, nodded.<br /> <br />“As I mentioned in yesterday’s message, I won’t do something like that.”<br /> <br />“…No, but…”<br /> <br />Internally, he thought, “Even though I’m hiding my name in class, you’re talking about me…” But Haruya held back and lowered his gaze.<br /> <br />Then, he asked Sara a simple question.<br /> <br />“But why don’t you inquire about it, even though you know it’s a fake name?”<br /> <br />“Because I don’t want to pry into Akasaki-san’s privacy.”<br /> <br />Sara explained with an added note.<br /> <br />“I thought, instead of actively researching and identifying Akasaki-san, maybe it’s better to know by chance, like we did yesterday…”<br /> <br />Sara was like a dreaming maiden.<br /> <br />In her heart, she longed for fateful encounters and romance.<br /> <br />While she didn’t deny taking action to seize something for herself, she believed that it was better to have opportunities to know things without actively seeking them.<br /> <br />So, Sara decided not to investigate Haruya’s true identity and believed that an opportunity to know would come to her naturally.<br /> <br />Although doubts about Sara lingered, for now, Haruya accepted what she said.<br /> <br />After all, Sara hadn’t mentioned his real name in class.<br /> <br />The fact that she had never done that gave Haruya some relief.<br /> <br />Haruya found solace in his lack of presence, his fading shadow. He was saved by his diminished existence.<br /> <br />“Well then, Akasaki-san. Let’s put that aside and have lunch.”<br /> <br />“Himekawa-san, you’ve really become brighter…”<br /> <br />Whether it was due to her excellent mood or something else, Sara’s impression now was vastly different from the first meeting.<br /> <br />Initially, she seemed like a girl lacking confidence, but now she exuded self-assurance. Perhaps it was because of her newfound cheerfulness.<br /> <br />So, Sara, with a smile full of confidence, said something unexpected.<br /> <br />“…I think it’s because I met Akasaki-san…”<br /> <br />Looking into Haruya’s eyes with full conviction, Sara unintentionally averted her gaze.<br /> <br />(No matter how you look at it, it’s too exaggerated…)<br /> <br />Haruya thought, but revealing this to Sara would likely result in denial. Therefore, with a wry smile, Haruya managed to divert the conversation.<br /> <br />While enjoying Sara’s lunch, the conversation naturally shifted to the topic of the exchange event with other classes.<br /> <br />“─Did you have the exchange event with other classes, Akasaki-san?”<br /> <br />If he were to answer with a simple “yes” or “no,” it would be “yes.”<br /> <br />(Well, technically, we are in the same class.)<br /> <br />It would be easier to say that, but Haruya chose to act like he didn’t know.<br /> <br />“Yes, we did, technically.”<br /> <br />“Is that so? It seems like the exchange event with other classes will be in rotation, but it’s refreshing, isn’t it?”<br /> <br />(That’s just like a complete blind date system… Well, I don’t really know what a blind date is like, though.)<br /> <br />With such thoughts in his mind, Haruya casually said something like “looking forward to it” to cover up his true feelings.<br /> <br />“In rotation, you might end up with someone from the same class, but that would be annoying, right?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I totally get it.”<br /> <br />“Hehe, seems like you really empathize with that part.”<br /> <br />Sara laughed gently, covering her mouth with her hand while shaking her head vigorously.<br /> <br />(…No, mainly because I don’t want to end up with Himekawa-san.)<br /> <br />That’s what Haruya thought, but deep down, Sara, despite thinking, “It’s unlikely,” couldn’t help but have a slight expectation.<br /> <br />(…I hope I can end up with Akasaki-san during the exchange event with other classes.)<br /> <br />While suppressing a snicker, Sara behaved gracefully,<br /> <br />looking at Haruya with a somewhat disappointed expression.<br /> <br />(…Because I won’t go along with Himekawa-san’s plans, for sure.)<br /> <br />While silently wishing for it, Haruya continued to nibble on Sara’s bento.<br /> <br />—At that moment.<br /> <br />” …Ah!”<br /> <br />Haruya accidentally spilled the bento, creating a small stain on his school uniform.<br /> <br />“A-Are you okay? Please use this tissue.”<br /> <br />“Sorry.”<br /> <br />Sara quickly pulled out a tissue from her skirt pocket and offered it to Haruya.<br /> <br />Accepting it, Haruya sighed internally, feeling flustered about how he couldn’t hide his agitation.<br /> <br />(…I must be quite disheartened with my identity being revealed.)<br /> <br />With that thought in mind, Haruya chose not to dwell on the stain.<br /> </p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p> <br />Now, nearing the end of the afternoon classes, the “exchange event with other classes” began in the gym.<br /> <br />Walking towards the lively gym, Windomi, who stood by Haruya’s side, whispered something to his ear.<br /> <br />“…Don’t mind it, right? Our class is filled with S-class beauties.”<br /> <br />“…I didn’t ask.”<br /> <br />“There might be cute girls in other classes, but not as much as S-class beauties, you know?”<br /> <br />“But, he said there might be cases where you end up with someone from the same class, right?”<br /> <br />When Haruya pointed that out, Windomi responded with a somewhat interesting expression, forming a half arc with his mouth.<br /> <br />“Akasaki is aiming for Himekawa-san, huh…”<br /> <br />“Hey, I told you it was a misunderstanding. Besides, we’re almost there, so it’s better to keep quiet.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, you’re right. If you bump into a cute girl, let me know later.”<br /> <br />Brushing off the unnecessary remark from Fuumiya, the group of classmates, including Haruya, arrived at the gymnasium, their destination.<br /> <br />Inside the gymnasium, excitement and apprehension filled the air, but naturally, Haruya’s feelings had settled.<br /> <br />the teacher in charge began explaining the details of the exchange event with other classes.<br /> <br />(…Well, I have no choice but to take it easy. As long as I don’t end up with anyone other than Himekawa-san.)<br /> </p>


<p>In conclusion, Haruya’s expectations were shattered.<br /> <br />The total number of students for the exchange was four.<br /> <br />Whether it was rotation in any direction, as long as he could overcome four rounds, it should be fine.<br /> <br />Due to the large number of students, the probability of encountering Sara was extremely low.<br /> <br />Therefore, Haruya, convinced that there was no way he would end up with Sara, felt relieved.<br /> <br />And so, the result unfolded. ─First person.<br /> <br />Haruya ended up with a male student from another class.<br /> <br />Seems like his hobby is FPS games. His name was Miyai… or something like that. Haruya only remembered being one-sidedly talked about games.<br /> <br />It might be frustrating for someone to witness his memory skills, but Haruya didn’t have the luxury for that right now.<br /> <br />─Second person.<br /> <br />This time, he was paired with a female student from another class. He only remembers that the conversation was hopelessly dull, and the atmosphere became dead.<br /> <br />(Sorry… for ending up with someone like me.)<br /> <br />While apologizing in his mind, Haruya breathed a sigh of relief, grateful that he didn’t end up with Sara.<br /> <br />And then, the third person.<br /> <br />Once again, he was paired with a female student from another class, and she pointed out the length of his hair.<br /> <br />He distinctly remembers her saying, “That’s hilarious, really funny.” Haruya thought, “She’s probably just saying that randomly.”<br /> <br />Finally, the fourth person.<br /> <br />When the last rotation arrived, tragedy struck for Haruya.<br /> <br />Yes, in the last rotation, the girl he faced was none other than Himekawa Sara.<br /> <br />“Nice to meet you…! I’m Sara Himekawa.”<br /> <br />“Nice to meet you… My name is Akazaki.”<br /> <br />While cursing the gods in his heart, Haruya tried to keep his voice low and behaved in a way that Sara couldn’t see his face too much.<br /> <br />He even used “Akazaki” instead of “Akasaki” to add camouflage.<br /> <br />However, it was a desperate strategy, to say the least…<br /> <br />“It was a bit hard to hear because the voice was low, but you’re Akazaki, right?”<br /> <br />It seems like I haven’t been noticed yet.<br /> <br />“Yes, that’s right.”<br /> <br />“Please.”<br /> <br />I really want to escape right now without asking, but it’s not that simple.<br /> <br />Despite sweating nervously, Haruya continues to interact with Sara.<br /> <br />“Your hair is really long, Akazaki-san… Do you like long hair?”<br /> <br />“W-Well, yeah…”<br /> <br />“Wow, but taking care of long hair must be quite challenging, right?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, it is.”<br /> <br />And just when they were trying to get through the situation with small talk…<br /> <br />“That stain…”<br /> <br />Sara opens her eyes wide, frozen.<br /> <br />“Oh, this… I spilled something on the rooftop earlier…”<br /> <br />Forgetting that he was speaking in a low voice, Haruya was caught off guard.<br /> <br />While disgusted with himself for casually answering, his face turns pale.<br /> <br />On the other hand, Sara, with wide eyes and trembling lips, is unable to say anything.<br /> <br />“Wait… are we in the same class?”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />Then, a silent moment between the two.<br /> <br />Haruya is in a daze, feeling defeated. “It’s over…” he thinks, dejected.<br /> <br />Sara, on the other hand, is blushing and can only look down.<br /> <br />…But, despite Haruya being lost in his own thoughts, he manages to speak.<br /> <br />“No, it’s a different person… It’s definitely a different person.”<br /> <br />In response, Sara puffs up her cheeks and leans forward.<br /> <br />“Well, that’s impossible…”<br /> <br />It was impossible to deceive her this time.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />That day, an awkward silence lingered between them until the end of the exchange event.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>(Little did I expect we were classmates… It’s so embarrassing.)<br /> <br />After the event,<br /> <br />Sara, consumed by embarrassment, practically vanished as soon as the exchange program ended. Back home, she flushed red, throwing herself onto her bed.<br /> <br />(That boy, Akasaki-san, turned out to be a classmate I never knew…)<br /> <br />She widened her eyes in disbelief.<br /> <br />However, Sara’s embarrassment was not just about the revelation of Akasaki’s identity. It also stemmed from the fact that she had shared stories about Haruya in class. The concern of him finding out…<br /> <br />(That was almost like a confession… Ugh, it’s so embarrassing.)<br /> <br />With her face buried in her pillow and her legs kicking the bed, Sara’s inner embarrassment erupted silently.<br /> <br />An overwhelming sense of embarrassment attacked Sara one after another.<br /> <br />However, strangely, she didn’t feel too bad. There was a sense of happiness enveloping her, and Sara couldn’t deny that she was increasingly sensing “fate.”<br /> <br />When you think about the sequence of events so far<br /> <br />– being rescued by a handsome guy, coincidentally meeting him again,</p>



<p>discovering they attend the same high school, and even going on a date with a rising affection level</p>



<p>– it felt almost too perfect.<br /> <br />Therefore, Sara couldn’t help but believe in the concept of “fate” and found herself unconsciously drawn to Haruya.<br /> <br />“Sigh…”<br /> <br />Sara let out a warm breath, saying Haruya’s name.<br /> <br />“…Ah, Akasaki-san.”<br /> <br />Just calling his name made her face flush with embarrassment, but Sara was aware of the happiness enveloping her.<br /> <br />There was no doubt now.<br /> <br />After learning he was in the same class, Sara acknowledged her feelings for Haruya.<br /> <br />The thought of being romantically involved with Haruya made her heart thump loudly.<br /> <br />She is filled with an indescribable feeling of elation.<br /> <br />Imagining holding hands, being close, and even sharing a kiss…<br /> <br />She couldn’t help but indulge in these fantasies.<br /> <br />However, Sara’s blissful feelings were short-lived.<br /> <br />Soon after realizing her growing affection for Haruya, her phone vibrated with a low hum.<br /> <br />Checking the notification, Sara’s shy and joyful feelings instantly froze.<br /> <br />It was a message from her father.<br /> <br />Just a brief and matter-of-fact sentence.<br /> <br />“We’ve found a potential match for an arranged marriage. I’ll contact you when it’s time for the meeting.”<br /> <br />Sara had forgotten about it.<br /> <br />No, she had been avoiding thinking about it.<br /> <br />In the midst of these enjoyable moments, she had deliberately suppressed the knowledge of being just the “daughter of the Himekawa family.”<br /> <br />More than that…<br /> <br />(I am who I am… I’ve known it from the beginning.)<br /> <br />Sara felt nauseous at the realization of her own flaws.<br /> <br />She had hoped for a fateful encounter despite knowing about the arranged marriage. Even though a marriage arranged for the benefit of the Himekawa family should be good…<br /> <br />Sara chuckled with a self-deprecating smile, alone in her room on the bed.</p>
