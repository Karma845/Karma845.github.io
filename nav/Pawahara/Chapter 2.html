<h1>Chapter 2: Accidental Interaction</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>The day after Rina’s stream. It was a holiday morning.</p>



<p id="no1">“Hey, Yuu! Want to play <a href="#footnote">shiritori<sup>1</sup></a>? I’ve got some pencils and paper ready.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“What…? Why all of a sudden? This is kinda random…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>The sound of footsteps rushing down the stairs.</p>



<p>The sound of the door to the living room opening and closing.</p>



<p>In the living room, where the TV was on, the voices of a pair of siblings echoed.</p>



<p>“Don’t think too much about it. It’s just to kill time.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“But I’m busy relaxing…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“C-Come on, it’s the holidays! I’ll go back to my room after one or two rounds!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…You definitely won’t let it end after one round. Not to mention, shiritori takes a while to finish.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“If it’s fun, let’s do a second round! Okay?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…<em>Haa</em>. Alright, fine. You won’t be satisfied until we play anyways.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Yes! Thank you!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Seeing Haruto’s desperate look, Yuno had no choice but to agree. It doesn’t look like it was just a way to kill time.</p>



<p>Yuno stood up from the sofa and sat at the dining table with a sullen look. Haruto, looking pleased, sat down opposite her.</p>



<p>“Just so you know, I’m only going to play until I get tired of it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Of course. Can I start?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Go ahead.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s start—” (Haruto)</p>



<p>The difference in enthusiasm between Haruto, who was excited, and Yuno, who was not interested at all, was like night and day.</p>



<p>Still, the younger sister didn’t outright show her displeasure.</p>



<p>Resting her cheek on her hand, she watched intently as her brother moved the pencil across the paper, waiting for him to finish.</p>



<p>“—How about this?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hmm. That’s a pretty good apple (<em>Rin</em><strong><em>go</em></strong>). With just this, you could probably get a 4.0 in art.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Right? Having this skill is also useful for my part-time job sometimes.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Even though it was an apple that anyone could draw well, praising it without pointing that out was a form of kindness.</p>



<p>Yuno took the paper and pencil and began to draw something starting with “<strong>go</strong>“.</p>



<p>At that moment, she didn’t notice Haruto looking at her with a gentle expression.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, isn’t this weird? I don’t have school today, but onii-chan woke up early.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Well, sometimes you have days like that… Yeah.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…Well, that’s true. Alright, your turn.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>She looked up and passed the paper and pencil back.</p>



<p>“Ah, this is pretty good… A gorilla (<em>Gori</em><strong><em>ra</em></strong>), huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I can’t draw it realistically, though.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Well, it looks really cute. You’re pretty good at drawing it this way.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto, impressed once again, started drawing something that started with “<strong>ra</strong>“. (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hey, Onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hmm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Why did you suddenly want to play shiritori so desperately?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“…Huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I mean, there must be a reason, right? You wouldn’t do that for no reason. There must have been something that led to this. Since I’m playing along, I think I have the right to know.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Ahahaha…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>With a wry smile as if to say “You’ve seen through everything”, Haruto slows down the speed of his pencil and gives a simple explanation.</p>



<p>“Just so you know, it’s not like something bad happened. I just have a sudden desire to draw better!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Oh…?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hey, Yuu, what do you think of this?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>He quickly shows what he drew next after finishing the “<strong>ra</strong>“.</p>



<p>“I think you captured the features well. It’s a rought yet cute camel (<em>raku</em><strong><em>da</em></strong>).” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Y-yeah… So, what do you think would happen if you posted this on my stream?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“You’d probably get teased or laughed at.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Exactly!! That’s why I want to get better!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto couldn’t contain his excitement after encountering a celebrity who was one of the faces of ABEX. After finishing his part-time job, he decided to peek into Rina’s archived stream for about an hour.</p>



<p>What he saw was her expressing her thoughts on the new Frappuccino, and then, the reaction from viewers upon seeing the illustration on the cup…</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [LOL]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [What’s with that drawing lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [It’s certainly unique.]</p>



<p>Comments like these were plentiful.</p>



<p>As someone in the streaming business, it was heartwarming to see his own illustrations spark excitement among viewers.</p>



<p>While being laughed at wouldn’t hurt, seeing such reactions made him want to draw something that would make people go, “Wow! You can draw something this good!?”</p>



<p>The likelihood of Rina becoming a regular customer was low, but she had promised to come again next time.</p>



<p>Haruto also felt that if she were to feature his illustration on stream again, it would be easier if the drawing was better.</p>



<p>“In other words, onii-chan, if you’re going to spend more time drawing, might as well play shiritori at the same time, is that right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Of course, there’s also the reason that I wanted to play with Yuu.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…You don’t have to say things like that.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Yuno could tell that Haruto was in a good mood.</p>



<p>“Well, onii-chan, I get why you’re doing this, but you don’t really have to try to get better, right? I’m not saying this because I don’t want to play shiritori.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“What do you mean…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Well, if you get too good at it, your individuality might just disappear. It wouldn’t be fun if your drawings became ordinary.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“That’s… true.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Rather than drawing conventional illustrations that anyone can do, those who do it with unique characteristics tend to be more captivating.</p>



<p>Such things can also make people happy or uplifted.</p>



<p>That was Yuno’s point of view.</p>



<p>“Unless customers complain or feel uncomfortable seeing your illustrations, it should be fine, right? Unless that happens, then I think it’s best to continue doing things with your current style. That’s what I believe, anyways.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“D-Do you really think so…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Yes. That’s why I say that instead of worrying about such complicated things, just spending more time drawing and enjoying would be the best.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I see. If you say so, then I’ll do that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Though he initially had doubts, quickly adopting her suggestion blindly was a testament to how much Haruto trusted Yuno’s words.</p>



<p>“Besides, there are other things to worry about because somebody somewhere is clumsy at everything except for games.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Huh…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>At the moment when Haruto let out a bewildered voice, Yuno finished drawing the illustration of a pill bug (<em>Dangomu</em><strong><em>shi</em></strong>), furrowing her brows as she handed him the paper.</p>



<p>“Hey, onii-chan. You haven’t slept yet, have you? You’ve been studying how to draw better all night, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“O-Of course not.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“You’ve got dark circles under your eyes, don’t deny it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Huh?! That’s a lie! I didn’t have any when I washed my face—” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“—Yeah. I was just kidding. But from that reaction, you can’t hide it anymore.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>With words overlapping, they continued to gaze silently at each other.</p>



<p>“I don’t think it’s good to deceive your family.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s also not good to lie to your family, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Although Haruto attempted some sort of comeback, this was Yuno’s arena. There was nothing the older brother could do.</p>



<p>“<em>Haa</em>. Well, I’ll keep playing shiritori with you until you get bored, so make sure you go to bed properly after that. You’re streaming tonight, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I-I’m planning to, but… you know how sometimes after the peak of drowsiness, you suddenly don’t feel sleepy anymore?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Then let’s just end it once we reach ‘<strong>n</strong>‘.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“O-Okay! I’ll make sure to sleep no matter what!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s a promise. I’ll go check if there are any strange noises in your room at some point.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Got it…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>For Haruto, who still wanted to prolong this time, the better choice was to go with his sister’s suggestion. </p>



<p>And while Yuno is clearly manipulating Haruto, the best course of action, for now, would be to quickly end the shiritori game and usher him back to his room.</p>



<p>Not doing so would imply… well, you know.</p>



<p>“Oh, onii-chan. Later, could you bring the sweet container from the shelf above the kitchen before you go to bed?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“T-The sweet container?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I turned the Frappuccino cup you bought yesterday on your way back from work into a sweet container. I didn’t expect it to be used like this.”  (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Ah… haha.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>As Yuno pointed in that direction, Haruto’s gaze fell directly upon the words written on the cup.</p>



<p>—[Take care of yourself!]</p>



<p>—[Make sure to get some rest!]</p>



<p>Now, like a boomerang, it feels as if the words were redirected back at him.</p>



<p>All Haruto could do now was to smile wryly at the situation.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Time passed, and two days later…</p>



<p>The holiday was over, and it was Monday, the day when school started again.</p>



<p>“Ah, good morning, Yuno-chan.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Good morning. You’re as early as ever, Suzuha-chan. And it’s admirable that you’re studying on your own so early.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Well, the final exams are coming up, so I feel like I have to do my best…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“I see. It would be nice to be praised again by a certain onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“<em>M-Mouu</em>, Yuno-chan…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Hehe.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>As soon as their eyes met, Yuno’s best friend, Suzuha, blushed and let out an embarrassed sigh, her cheeks turning crimson as she clasped her hands together and looked down.</p>



<p>Yuno knew.</p>



<p>She knew the reason why Suzuha wanted to study hard―aside from the desire to go to her university of choice.</p>



<p>“Then maybe I’ll try to come to school a little earlier too. I think I can concentrate better that way.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“…You’re going to come earlier?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“I’d like to say ‘maybe tomorrow’, but lately, I’ve been dragged into playing picture shiritori with my <em>baka aniki</em> since morning. Well, I guess it’s more accurate to say I’m being forced to join in.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Eh, picture Shiritori?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>It was an unexpected game to hear.</p>



<p>Suzuha widened her blue eyes and blinked rapidly.</p>



<p>Realizing that she probably wanted to know ‘why picture Shiritori?’, Yuno quickly added an explanation.</p>



<p>“He said he wants to improve his illustrations for work and he even started to reduce his sleep time for it. He was trying to perfect his drawing skills, but I managed to convince him to focus on expanding his repertoire of illustrations instead.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hehe, that’s really like Haruto-oniisan… Serious and hardworking.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Well, it’s one of the good things about my <em>baka aniki</em>, I guess.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“But it’s good that he’s focusing on expanding his repertoire… I don’t want Haruto-oniisan to push himself too hard with perfecting his skills…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“I know right? He’s already busy every day, and he’s really bad at managing his time. Plus, he tries to act normal even when he’s sick, which is annoying. And his acting is strangely good in that department for some reason.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Yuno complains bitterly, but like Suzuha, it comes from a place of concern.</p>



<p>They’ve started playing picture shiritori in the morning instead of at night, considering Haruto’s tiredness after work.</p>



<p>“He tries to act normal even when he catches a cold because he doesn’t want to worry you, Yuno-chan. I’m sure you can tell.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“…Huh. I’m not particularly worried, though. Really.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Liar.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“I-It’s not a lie…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>At that moment, Yuno’s gaze wandered, and her speech hastened. Her cheeks turned red as if it was right on the mark.</p>



<p>Being bad at such lies must be a trait inherited from her brother.</p>



<p>And――there was something that led up to this behavior between the two.</p>



<p>“On the day Haruto-oniisan had a high fever, Yuno-chan looked like she wanted to rush home immediately.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“!!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“You kept saying you wanted to leave early.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>On that day, Haruto had a fever close to 40 degrees.</p>



<p>Throughout the day, Yuno was restless, showing no signs of concentration during classes. The moment the last period ended, she hurriedly made her way to the bike parking area.</p>



<p>Suzuha had undeniable evidence, enough to refute Yuno’s claim of “not being worried”.</p>



<p>“Well, um, I mean… if you think about it, it’s common to worry about your family in such a situation…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hehehe.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“…I didn’t really have to refute that now, did I?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>The active Yuno and the quiet Suzuha teased each other all the time. That’s how their relationship has always been.</p>



<p>“When I get home, I’ll take it out on my <em>baka aniki</em>. After all, this happened because he caught a cold.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Really?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Really.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Really, really?” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Yeah, really…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>This indeed started with Haruto catching a cold, but catching a cold is inevitable.</p>



<p>Her response is a bit of a pity-driven outburst.</p>



<p>Still, Suzuha can smile because she knows that Yuno won’t vent her frustrations in a way that Haruto dislikes.</p>



<p>She might poke him in the side a bit, take him shopping, or even cook more than usual to vent her frustration.</p>



<p>That’s just how they are.</p>



<p>“Then maybe I’ll send Haruto-oniisan a message later and ask [Did Yuno-chan do anything unpleasant to you?]” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Y-You don’t have to do that…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Knowing each other’s personalities well, once they start poking at each other, there’s no stopping.</p>



<p>“If you do that, I won’t invite you to stay over anymore. I was planning to invite you over for the next weekend.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“T-That’s not fair…” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Then let’s not bring up what we talked about today, okay?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hehe, okay, got it.” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Anyways, let’s talk about the sleepover I mentioned earlier!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Mmn! I’m looking forward to it!” (Suzuha)</p>



<p>“Me too!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>When in a tough spot, changing the subject is often the best move.</p>



<p>But this was something they had wanted to discuss from the start.</p>



<p>Thanks to Yuno’s words, they spent the time until the first period planning the sleepover.</p>



<p>And then, it was during lunch break, after morning classes, and after the final period that they talked about it again.</p>



<p>“…Maybe this is karma.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Yuno spoke these words while on her way home.</p>



<p>She looked at her bike which was stuck because the chain had tangled up.</p>



<p>“I guess it’s not right to vent at someone who’s working hard for my sake, after all…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>It happened on a busy street.</p>



<p>The pedals wouldn’t turn.</p>



<p>“…<em>Haa</em>.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>There was nothing to do but sigh at the unfortunate situation.</p>



<p>Yuno’s only option is to endure the embarrassment of being seen by others and push her bike home.</p>



<p>“Well, there’s no point in staying here forever…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>As she resolved to change her mindset, it happened.</p>



<p>“Oh, is something wrong, miss?” (?)</p>



<p>“!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>A clear, transparent voice came from behind.</p>



<p>Yuno turned around abruptly to see a blonde woman wearing a hat pulled down low and a black mask, slowly approaching.</p>



<p>“Um, well…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Sorry for startling you. I’m not a suspicious person or anything… Oh, saying that might make me seem suspicious instead. Then what should I say… Ah, maybe this?” (Rina)</p>



<p>The woman, who had a clear and beautiful voice, started talking to herself. Then, she adjusted her mask under her chin.</p>



<p>Revealing her stunningly beautiful face like a model, she gave a reassuring wink.</p>



<p>“Oh… I’m sorry, uh, thank you…?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. So, um, did your bike chain come off by any chance?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Yuno, shaken by the sudden approach and the rapid-fire of words, was feeling flustered by the woman’s communication skills, which she had never encountered before. But she also felt a sense of familiarity with this approachable woman of the same gender.</p>



<p>Her guard naturally lowered, and she calmly explained the situation.</p>



<p>“Y-Yes, it just happened out of nowhere…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hmm, hmm. Can I take a look at your bike for a moment?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Oh, sure…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>The way she closed the distance between them felt as if they had spoken several times before.</p>



<p>Yuno, still unable to keep up with her pace, stepped from the bike.</p>



<p>The woman then placed her handbag on the ground and began inspecting the bike.</p>



<p>“Ah, I see. The chain got tangled here. That’s why the pedals won’t turn, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Y-Yes, exactly…!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“This is the most troublesome type where it won’t move unless you lift the rear wheel… Give me a moment. I’ll help you fix it.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Huh…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Even though I’m wearing a mask, back in my student days, they used to call me ‘Rina-nee the bike fixer’, so rest assured!” (Rina)</p>



<p id="imagehere"><a href="#image">Her mouth was hidden behind the mask, but even so, the woman called Rina smiled with her eyes as she confidently grabbed the chain with her bare hands.</a></p>



<p>“Alright… If I remember correctly I had to do this… and this…” (Rina)</p>



<p>With these words, she removed the tightly caught chain and moved it to fit into the ring with her congested fingers.</p>



<p>And―― two minutes later.</p>



<p>“Alright, it’s fixed! Look, the pedal’s turning smoothly now~” (Rina)</p>



<p>“!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Isn’t that great? Now you can go home just like usual!” (Rina)</p>



<p>To avoid getting her dirty hands from touching the chain, Rina spins the pedals to show that it has been fixed.</p>



<p>Afterwards, Rina puts her arm through the handle of her handbag and stands up, showing no change in demeanor.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s fixed for now, but it seems like the chain came off due to deterioration, so I think it’d be better to have it checked by a bike shop. It could be troublesome if it breaks again, so this is just a temporary fix, okay?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina adjusts her hat with her clean wrists and flashes another smile.</p>



<p>“A-Alright. I’ll get it checked at the bike shop soon! Thank you so much…!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it~. From what I remember, it shouldn’t cost too much! Well then, take care on your way home!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ah――” (Yuno)</p>



<p>It’s clear that she wasn’t looking for any repayment, as she’s already about to leave as soon as the matter is settled.</p>



<p>Rina even hides her dirty hands behind her back as she bids farewell to avoid avoid making Yuno feel indebted.</p>



<p>At that moment, any trace of “caution” vanished from Yuno’s mind.</p>



<p>Being helped but not being able to express gratitude was something she couldn’t tolerate.</p>



<p>She had been repeatedly reminded by her now-deceased parents to always say thank you when someone does something for you.</p>



<p>But a mere “thank you” wasn’t enough.</p>



<p>“U-Um!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hm?”  (Rina)</p>



<p>Summoning her courage, Yuno spoke up.</p>



<p>“P-Please, let me thank you properly for this!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Um, you really don’t have to worry about it. I wasn’t inconvenienced by it or anything.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“But still, it doesn’t sit right with me…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Well…” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina could only smile wryly at Yuno’s words.</p>



<p>It was as if she would definitely say the same thing if their positions were reversed.</p>



<p>“But, you know, it wouldn’t be right for an adult like me to let a high school student treat me, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Yuno wanted to repay the favour, but Rina’s adult pride doesn’t let her accept it. </p>



<p>Even if it’s just a 100 yen juice, she can’t let a high school girl she just met spend her hard-earned money on her.</p>



<p>“…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>With both of them unable to yield, they lapse into silence.</p>



<p>Their inability to compromise stems from their kind-heartedness.</p>



<p>“Um… I’m sorry to ask you this, but… are you hungry by any chance?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah, I am! That reminds me!” (Rina)</p>



<p>Upon hearing Yuno’s question, Rina comes up with a brilliant idea and speaks in a particularly cheerful voice.</p>



<p>“How about we go grab a meal together right now? I’ll cover the bill, so you can pick the place! Maybe somewhere with a counter would be good (since we’re meeting for the first time and it’s less intimidating with other people around).” (Rina)</p>



<p>While she frames it as if she was about to eat alone and suggests eating together, Yuno also had a clever idea of her own.</p>



<p>“W-Well, in that case, it would be your treat… So, if it’s not too much trouble, would you consider letting me treat you at my place? It’s not too far from here.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Huh!? No no, that’s a bit too much… you know…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“By the way, um… my parents aren’t around anymore, so there’s no need to worry about imposing on them.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“!?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Thanks to Haruto’s presence, Yuno has managed to overcome the loss of her parents. That’s why she can calmly mention this without darkening her expression. However, Rina interprets it differently.</p>



<p>“S-So, shall we head over then?!” (Rina)</p>



<p>Worried about the idea of a high school girl living alone, Rina quickly agrees.</p>



<p>With both of them having kind hearts, their compatibility is evident as they walk together, chatting and getting to know each other over the course of 15 minutes.</p>

<p><a href="#imagehere"><em>Her mouth was hidden behind the mask, but even so, the woman called Rina smiled with her eyes as she confidently grabbed the chain with her bare hands.</em></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>“Wow, what a nice house!” (Rina)</p>



<p>Upon arriving at Yuno’s home, Rina immediately raised her voice in admiration.</p>



<p>“Thank you. This house was left by my parents.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I’m sure your parents are proud of you. You’re only a second-year high school student, yet you can manage yourself and guests coming over.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ah, I’d be happy if that’s the case.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“As a working adult, I definitely think so!” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina’s personality shone through as she chose uplifting words to prevent any dark atmosphere.</p>



<p>Feeling genuinely warmed by these words, Yuno inserted the key into the lock. Opening the door, she began showing Rina around the house.</p>



<p>“Rina-oneesan, the restroom is this way.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Thank you~! Sorry for the trouble, Yuno-chan.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Not at all. It’s my fault for getting your hands dirty. Feel free to use the towel that’s hanging there. Once you’re done, I’ll be waiting in the living room.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Okay!” (Rina)</p>



<p>After this exchange, they temporarily went their separate ways.</p>



<p>Rina, with a cheerful reply, used the sink to wash off the stubborn chain grease with hand soap. Afterwards, she made her way to the neatly organized living room.</p>



<p>There, she found Yuno already preparing food in the kitchen with the TV turned on in the background.</p>



<p>“Yuno-chan, sorry. I might have used a bit too much hand soap.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Please don’t worry about it! Chain grease is hard to get off, so it’s normal to use that much.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Thank you.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Even though she had just met Yuno and understood the challenging circumstances of her household, Rina felt a growing sense of guilt the more soap she used. </p>



<p>Because of this, she felt relieved by Yuno’s reassuring words.</p>



<p>“Um, Rina-oneesan, do you have any allergies or foods you dislike? I’ll make sure to avoid them.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Honestly, I can eat anything~” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Got it! Then I’ll start cooking. Please make yourself comfortable and watch TV if you’d like.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Yuno smiled warmly as she opened the refrigerator, carefully selecting ingredients. The abundance of food already laid out on the kitchen counter made it clear she intended to offer her utmost hospitality.</p>



<p>Rina, who also enjoyed cooking, understood the effort involved in preparing a meal with so many ingredients.</p>



<p>“Hey, Yuno-chan, why don’t we cook together? I actually love cooking.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Eh!? But, wouldn’t that be…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Letting someone do what they love isn’t a burden at all! You could even say it’s another way to show gratitude.” (Rina)</p>



<p>When Rina added “Let’s enjoy this together”, Yuno found herself unable to refuse.</p>



<p>“If you put it that way, then I hope that you don’t mind…?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>, it’s not often I get the chance to cook with someone else, so I’d actually like to help.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Understood. In that case, let’s do it together!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Sure!” (Rina)</p>



<p>Using her communication skills honed from streaming, Rina convinced Yuno, and she stepped into the kitchen.</p>



<p>“Well then, Rina-oneesan, could I ask you to handle the side dish first? Feel free to use any ingredients or utensils. You’re also welcome to use whatever’s on the shelves and fridge.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Got it! I’ll start by seeing what you have.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Go ahead.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>One of the important things in cooking is organization.</p>



<p>To proceed smoothly, Rina begins to familiarize herself with the location of seasonings and small cooking utensils.</p>



<p>In the midst of this, Rina changes the subject.</p>



<p>“You know, Yuno-chan, you’re really amazing. When I was a second-year in high school, I mostly just played around and only did chores when I felt like it.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“In my case, I think my family environment has a big influence… It’s embarrassing to admit, but I’m filled with a desire to make things easier for my brother (<em>ani</em>) as much as possible.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“—Oh!?” (Rina)</p>



<p>This was new information to Rina. It’s the first time she’s learned about Yuno’s brother.</p>



<p>It was the moment when Rina realized that she misunderstood that Yuno was living alone, but she skillfully hid her surprise by reacting appropriately to the situation.</p>



<p>“By the way, what about your onii-chan? Is he kind?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Well… yes. Honestly, I’m proud of him. Onii-chan’s really amazing, you know?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Heh~ What’s he like?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Well, this might be a bit heavy, but…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>With that preamble, Yuno begins her explanation.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan originally planned to go to university, but after our family situation came to be, he changed his plans to help me attend university in the future instead. Despite being in high school, he adjusted his schedule to meet the minimum attendance and credit requirements for graduation and spent the rest of his time working multiple jobs to earn money.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I see.” (Rina)</p>



<p>At that moment, Rina stopped cooking and focused intently on listening to Yuno’s story, nodding along as she spoke.</p>



<p>“Because of that… well, I shouldn’t phrase things that way, but onii-chan, despite being one of the top students in his grade, ended up at the bottom…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I’m sure he must have gone through a lot… Even when he was exhausted, even when he was sick, he never showed any signs of weakness to me… But, um, that only makes me more worried!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>As she voiced thoughts she rarely shared, she immediately felt a wave of embarrassment wash over her. To cool her heated cheeks, she fanned her face with her hand.</p>



<p>“Well, um, onii-chan has some quirks, like mistaking sugar for salt, but he’s someone I deeply respect… Yeah, that’s about it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Rina-oneesan, are you okay?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry! I got a bit emotional there.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“After hearing all this, I think if you actually met onii-chan, you’d be like, ‘Huh?’ It’s quite different from what I heard… He’s really unique in his own way.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Well, being too perfect isn’t always ideal. Having a few quirks makes someone more special, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Humans are said to be more charming when they have flaws.</p>



<p>It seems like this description fits Yuno’s brother perfectly.</p>



<p>“Listening to your story makes me want to meet your brother sometime…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Just hearing you say that makes me happy. My brother loves gaming, so if you’re into games, you might get along.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“He’s got a good hobby. So, what kind of games does he play?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Um… Sorry, it’s not the kind of game women usually play, but he’s into shooter games… In particular, he’s hooked on this game called ABEX.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. That’s interesting.” (Rina)</p>



<p>The name of the game, ever so familiar to Rina, strikes a chord, causing her to unconsciously raise an eyebrow.</p>



<p>“ABEX is pretty famous, even among my classmates. Do you know about it, Rina-oneesan?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hmm, well… I don’t usually say this, but I’m actually part of a pro team for ABEX.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“—Huh?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Upon hearing this response, Yuno’s eyes widen in astonishment. </p>



<p>Not only was she taken aback by the shocking revelation, but also by her own insensitive comment stating that “I think it’s not the type of game most women play”.</p>



<p>“I-I-I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to say something rude!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“It’s totally fine~ There are a ton of male players in the game, after all.” (Rina)</p>



<p>It’s clear that Yuno did not mean anything malicious, and in such a situation, it’s better to just brush it off.</p>



<p>“…U-Um, changing the subject, Rina-oneesan, you’re really amazing to be part of such a team… Onii-chan mentioned to me before how difficult it is to join one…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Well, there’s definitely an element of luck involved in these things.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Some might say it’s not good to downplay one’s achievements, especially when representing a professional team. However, there are aspects that Rina just can’t easily accept.</p>



<p>“But if Yuno-chan’s onii-chan is into ABEX, there’s a chance he might know about me, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I-I’m sure he does! This is just between us, but… my onii-chan also does streaming.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Whoa, seriously!?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yes! I don’t know his channel name or anything, but he has a silver play button, which you get when you have a lot of subscribers.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“No way! That’s actually pretty impressive!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“It really is! He’s amazing.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Haruto’s streaming activities were something Yuno had never mentioned to anyone before. </p>



<p>This time, she broke that barrier with someone she felt could understand and appreciate it, especially considering her involvement in the ABEX pro scene.</p>



<p>Because of that, Yuno felt like boasting about Haruto, but in a “low-key” kind of way such that it wouldn’t reveal his identity. That’s how proud she was of him.</p>



<p>“You know, Yuno-chan, your onii-san is seriously amazing… Viewers are human too, right? So, it’s pretty hard to attract the same gender when streaming, but despite that, in an environment where the target audience is male for a game like ABEX, he’s pulling in numbers big enough to get a play button. It’s just… indescribably impressive.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Being someone who also streamed, Rina couldn’t help but comment. </p>



<p>With her own research in the streaming market, she found that it was easier to attract attention when streaming games played by the opposite sex which is why she was surprised by the fact that Yuno’s brother was able to get a play button which required at least 100,000 subscribers.</p>



<p>“If Rina-oneesan is saying that, then maybe… he’s even more… than I thought.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“There aren’t that many male streamers who can grow their audience that much with ABEX, you know. He’s undoubtedly an irreplaceable figure in this industry.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“E-Ehhh…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>The person saying this is someone from the same industry. There’s no room to doubt their words.</p>



<p>However, the feeling of surprise is overshadowed by a sense of unexpectedness… Especially considering she had never heard him brag about his streaming career before.</p>



<p>“I have a question… Is Yuno-chan’s onii-san streaming right now?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“No! He’s currently out for work. He’s so busy that he only has one day off a week.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Wait a second. With that many subscribers, he’s not focusing on his streams?!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Well, yeah…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Even without knowing the details of the channel, having over 100,000 subscribers guarantees enough income to make ends meet. Riding the wave, it would be more advantageous to focus on channel management. Describing it as a ‘wasted opportunity’ wouldn’t be entirely inaccurate.</p>



<p>“I’ve actually told onii-chan that I want him to pursue what he loves, even if it means reducing his work hours or becoming a full-time streamer…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I see. So, it’s about ensuring stable income, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Exactly. He believes that having a stable income will allow me to focus more on my studies without worrying about him…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I see. He’s a really good onii-san, isn’t he?” (Rina)</p>



<p>—He could become even more famous.</p>



<p>—He could earn even more income.</p>



<p>Despite knowing that such high probabilities exist, prioritizing family comes first. It’s the safest and most stable option, without risks or uncertainties.</p>



<p>“I sometimes feel like I’m being too harsh on onii-chan… It’s really shameful.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“When the time comes, make sure to express your gratitude sincerely.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yes. If I can’t convey my gratitude to him, I don’t think I’ll ever make it to heaven.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Haha, that might be true.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Although it’s a harsh response that should be denied, but in order to encourage, Rina chooses to agree to some extent.</p>



<p>“Um… What should we do then? Would you like to meet onii-chan? He’ll be back by 7 PM since he’s on shift until the evening.” (Yuno)</p>



<p id="no1">“Well then, I guess it’s better to meet. If we can get to know each other once, <a href="#footnote">it’ll be easier to invite him to future gaming events<sup>1</sup></a>.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Really!?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Of course. I wouldn’t want to miss the chance to have someone as nice as him to join in. Plus, it’d be nice to have dinner together with the three of us later.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Thank you so much for everything!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>The prospect of Haruto having more opportunities to shine is more than anything to be happy about.</p>



<p>With both hands clenched into fists, Yuno expresses her emotions openly, but then immediately catches herself with an “Ah”, as if snapping back to reality.</p>



<p>“R-Rina-oneesan, I’m sorry… Maybe it might be difficult for onii-chan to attend events after all.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Huh? Why’s that?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I can’t really explain it in detail, but… onii-chan, well, he’s sort of… not really well-liked…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Huh?! Is that so?! But he sounds like a great person!?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Even so… that’s how it is…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Yuno felt even more apologetic, having received such an opportunity from Rina.</p>



<p>This is because she knows what kind of stream Haruto does.</p>



<p>It’s precisely because his style doesn’t cater to everyone that she felt the need to inform Rina beforehand.</p>



<p>As the evening sky darkens and stars and the moon begin to appear, they finish cooking and were happily spending the rest of the time chatting.</p>



<p><em>*Teteteteten*</em> </p>



<p>A rhythmic tune begins to play from Yuno’s phone.</p>



<p>“Oh! It’s a call from onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Based on the timing, It seems like he’s finished his work. Feel free to answer!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Should I put it on speakerphone? Hearing his voice might give you an idea of what he’s like.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I’ll leave it to you, Yuno-chan.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“In that case, I’ll put it on speaker. There shouldn’t be any conversation that we wouldn’t want you to hear.” (Yuno)</p>



<p id="no2"><a href="#footnote">It might seem like a dishonest move towards Haruto, but prioritizing the indebted Rina in this situation is crucial.<sup>2</sup></a></p>



<p>After initiating the call, Yuno pressed the ‘answer’ button and then the speaker button to start the conversation.</p>



<p>“(Hello? Yuu?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hello. Onii-chan, did you just finish work?” (Yuno)</p>



<p id="imagehere"><a href="#image">“(Yeah, just finished. Did something happen? I got a message saying to contact you as soon as I finished my shift.)” (Haruto)</a></p>



<p>“It’s about that. My bike chain came off while I was coming back from school today.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“(What!? Are you okay? Did you get hurt!?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hey, your voice is too loud… I wasn’t on a dangerous path so I’m not injured or anything…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Glancing at Rina, she notices her chuckling softly.</p>



<p>There’s nothing to worry about in the conversation, but Yuno still feels embarrassed about it.</p>



<p>“(Well, that’s a relief… Oh, so I should pick up your bike on the way home, right? Where did you leave it?)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“No, actually, I was stuck because my bike wouldn’t move, but an onee-san helped me out. She fixed the chain for me, so it’s at home now.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“(She fixed the chain… Her hands must have gotten dirty, right? Did you ask where she lives? We should go thank her!)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Being taught by their parents to always show gratitude when someone does something for them, Haruto’s response mirrors Yuno’s response.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s why I wanted to let you know in advance that I thought it’d be nice to invite her over for a meal as a thank-you.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“(Yuu! That’s really thoughtful! I’ll buy a thank-you gift, so please keep her there until I get home!)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Naturally, Rina can hear this conversation as well.</p>



<p>Upon hearing the mention of a “thank-you gift”, Yuno looks back at Rina, who was waving her hands left and right.</p>



<p>Despite understanding that she didn’t need the gift, Yuno continued the call at her own pace.</p>



<p>“Thank you, onii-chan. I’m sorry to bother you after work.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“(No problem! It’s not a burden at all. Oh, could you ask her what she likes? I get her something she likes!)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“She mentioned she likes sweets. Since she seems to be into gaming, something easy to snack on would probably be appreciated.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“(Got it! Well, I’m heading into the store now, so I’ll talk to you later! Let onee-san know that your brother will be back soon.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Understood. Take care and come back safely.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“(Haha, thanks. Yuu, good job on finishing school today.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Yeah, see you later.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“(Alright.)” (Haruto)</p>



<p>After responding to Haruto’s final words and ending the call, Yuno turns to Rina.</p>



<p>“So, that was onii-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“He seems really easygoing, but…  You didn’t have to worry about me so much, you know.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Well, that’s just how our parents raised us.”  (Yuno)</p>



<p>“<em>Mou</em>.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, anyone would find it hard to argue back.</p>



<p>Despite showing a slight resistance, Rina raises her hands in surrender.</p>



<p>“Well, even so, it’s really surprising to hear that the onii-chan I heard over the phone isn’t well-liked. It just doesn’t seem like you were talking about the same person.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“He’s really the same person as you heard over the phone, and I agree that it doesn’t suit him. When he does his streams, he always needs a kind of script…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“A script?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“It’s not as formal as one used in theater, but it’s like lines he can use, like aggressive remarks, depending on the situation.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Wow… I see… That makes sense.” (Rina)</p>



<p>At that moment, Rina unconsciously places a hand over her mouth, as if to chew on the surprise and agitation she felt.</p>



<p>“But… I understand now why onii-chan chose something that doesn’t match his personality. After hearing about the tough environment from Rina-oneesan, I realized that he must have thought long and hard about how to survive as a streamer in his own way… It just makes me respect him even more.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Heh, with that kind of personality, I bet your onii-chan is thinking of using the money he earns from streaming for your education.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ahaha, I’ll make sure to remind him not to push himself too hard.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Yeah… You two are a wonderful siblings.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Words escaped from Rina before she could process them. </p>



<p>Just listening to their stories and observing their interactions made her smile.</p>



<p>And now, knowing the person whom Yuno respects so much—Rina, who was about 80% sure of Yuno’s brother’s identity—could hardly wait to meet him.</p>



<p>She had been checking the clock repeatedly, anxiously waiting for what felt like dozens of minutes.</p>



<p>And then, after what felt like an eternity of waiting…</p>



<p>As soon as the front door opened…</p>



<p>“Oh! Thank you so much for taking care of Yu…no…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Wha–!! You’re the guy from the cafe!?” (Rina)</p>



<p>They met face-to-face, revealing that this wasn’t their first encounter after all.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image5164_5e06fc-64 size-large"><div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_v2_8.jpeg?w=1073&ssl=1" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p><em><a href="#imagehere">“(Yeah, just finished. Did something happen? I got a message saying to contact you as soon as I finished my shift.)”</a></em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>After finishing their cheerful greetings at the entrance, they gathered in the living room around an extravagant spread of meals that they definitely wouldn’t be able to finish in one sitting.</p>



<p>“…Y-Yuu, you really invited an incredible person over… You even cooked with her…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“S-She really does have 700,000 subscribers…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Haruto, who was informed beforehand, and Yuno, who had quickly looked Rina up on her phone, faced Rina with awe.</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>, I only reached 700,000 subscribers just yesterday. But outside of streaming, I’m just a regular girl, so I’d be happy if you could treat me normally. Especially you, Yuno-chan, you were doing great just a while ago.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I-I understand!” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Thanks to Rina’s easygoing demeanor and friendly personality, the atmosphere lightened up.</p>



<p>However, one must wonder how her popularity affects her daily life.</p>



<p>Haruto, who knew the extent of Rina’s influence and achievements, could only tremble as he held his chopsticks.</p>



<p>“But I still can’t believe that the person who helped Yuu was Rina-san… It’s unbelievable.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I was surprised too. To think that Yuno-chan’s onii-san was the kind cafe staff who helped me a while ago.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I’m also shocked that onii-chan knew about Rina-oneesan…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>At first, none of them could grasp the situation immediately.</p>



<p>Only now had the conversation begun to unfold.</p>



<p>“Um, it seems you fixed my imouto’s bike chain… Rina-san, are your hands okay? You didn’t get hurt, did you?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Not at all. After I washed my hands, they were as clean as they were before.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“That’s a relief…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto could only feel relieved at her response.</p>



<p>For a game streamer, especially a professional gamer, injuring their hands would be troublesome for their activities.</p>



<p>As a game streamer on a similar level himself, this was something Haruto couldn’t help but worry about.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, Rina-oneesan came to help me and didn’t mind getting her hands dirty at all.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“R-Really!? Hearing that… it feels like our thank-you gifts aren’t enough…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“No, no, no, no! They’re more than enough, seriously.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Haruto had bought two thank-you gifts: a box of assorted chocolates and a box of assorted cookies. Generally, that would be considered a lot, but expressions of gratitude vary from person to person.</p>



<p>“Besides, just cooking together with Yuno-chan felt like a thank-you gift already. I rarely get the chance to cook with someone else.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I feel the same way… So, um, I’d be happy if I could cook together with Rina-oneesan again…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Really!? I’m glad to hear you say that.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina clasped her hands together, her cheeks softening into an expression that matched her words.</p>



<p>“Then why don’t we cook at my place next time? I’ll give you my contact information too.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Really!?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I’d actually like to ask that of you.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Thank you so much, Rina-san. My imouto isn’t the type to cause any trouble, so if you could, please take care of her.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto was banned from the kitchen because he might cause a fire due to his carelessness, so he couldn’t replace Rina in this regard. He bowed deeply, showing his gratitude.</p>



<p>“Wait, you’re not coming along, Onii-san? I’d be happy if you could try the food we make.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I’m glad to hear you say that, but wouldn’t it be a huge problem if it got out that a guy visited Rina-san’s home? Not to mention, wouldn’t it be troublesome for you to reveal your home location to me?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Well, if I invited you over one-on-one and it got leaked, no explanation would hold up. But if Yuno-chan is with you, it’s no problem at all.” (Rina)</p>



<p>The professional gaming team Rina belonged to, Axcis Crown, didn’t prohibit relationships.</p>



<p>Even if there were misunderstandings, it wouldn’t affect the team, or rather, any impact would primarily be on her channel.</p>



<p>Since she could deal with the consequences of her own actions, she was able to make this decision.</p>



<p>“Besides, even if you know where I live, I don’t think Onii-san would cause any trouble.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto’s eyes widen at this statement.</p>



<p>Seeing his surprised expression, Rina quickly adds an explanation.</p>



<p>“Ah, I might look flashy, but it’s not like I’m usually this lax with people. I judged that it was okay based on the kind service I received from you at that time, and also because I heard various things from others.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Both Yuno and Haruto are trustworthy individuals. If she didn’t feel that way, she wouldn’t have invited them to her home.</p>



<p>Despite Rina appearing carefree, she’s meticulously aware of the risks involved when working in the industry, having heard about them in detail from her agency.</p>



<p>“Rina-oneesan, keep what we talked about today is a secret, okay?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hehe, got it.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Um, did Yuu really praise me that much?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, I said it’s a secret, so it’s uncool of you to keep pressing.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“W-Well, can’t you cut me some slack…!? It sounds like something to be happy about, you know.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“If I cut you some slack, I feel like I’ll lose.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Heh.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Considering she’s in her high school years, it’s understandable that she’s not very straightforward with her feelings. </p>



<p>However, thinking back to how Yuno said she tends to be harsh on her brother, Rina couldn’t help but suppress a laugh seeing the contrast between her behavior now and how openly she was sharing her feelings earlier.</p>



<p>Yuno might have her tsundere moments, but she only adopts this attitude towards her one and only family member, Haruto.</p>



<p>“…Ah, Rina-oneesan, this sesame sauce you made is quite good.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Right? The simmered food is also pretty good, so try it! Oh, but onii-san, you should eat more. You’ve just finished work, so you should eat plenty to regain your energy.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ahaha. Well then, don’t mind me, <em>itadakimasu</em>.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Thanks to the gentle encouragement, Haruto finds it easier to pick up his chopsticks.</p>



<p>At this moment, Yuno reaches out her hand.</p>



<p>“Here, Onii-chan, let me serve you.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Thank you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s nothing…” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Hehe.” (Rina)</p>



<p>—(I sometimes feel like I’m being too harsh on onii-chan… It’s really shameful.)</p>



<p>That’s the true feeling Yuno expressed earlier.</p>



<p>It seemed that she reflected on her earlier attitude and wanted to show genuine kindness where she could.</p>



<p>“I was curious about this—does onii-san and Yuno-chan ever fight? I can’t really picture it.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ah… Now that you mention it, we haven’t had any real fights for a long time. Yuu always hits me with solid logic, so we don’t really argue.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Pfft, do you mess up that much, onii-san?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“That’s right, Rina-oneesan. He’s really awful.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>With a strong voice, Yuno entered the conversation smoothly.</p>



<p>“He often forgets to let me know where he is, which worries me, and when left to his own devices, he always overworks himself. Lately, he’s been staying up late and even lying about it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Oh my.” (Rina)</p>



<p>After hearing this, it was clear how peaceful their relationship was, leaving no room for any other response.</p>



<p>“Yuu… couldn’t you cut your brother some slack just this once?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“You’d get carried away if I did.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“—And that’s generally how it goes. By the way, Rina-san, your cooking is also really good.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“<em>Hihi</em>, thank you.” (Rina)</p>



<p>On top of how just receiving this kind of feedback made her happy, Rina appreciated Haruto’s way of adding “also” when complimenting her cooking.</p>



<p>As proof, there was another person subtly showing a satisfied expression.</p>



<p>“So the power balance between Yuno-chan and Onii-san is 100 to 0?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Usually, you could say that, but when I’ve done something wrong, like hiding a cold or an injury, he comes back at me ten times harder.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Oh, I see.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Just between us, it even feels like he wants to hit me for it.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I see. After dinner, let’s go to the police, onii-san.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Oh, come on… You’re saying things that aren’t true…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Muttering to himself, Haruto wore an exasperated yet amused smile. Of course, Rina understood that Yuno was just joking.</p>



<p>“Since he’s usually gentle when onii-chan gets angry, he’s really scary, so please be careful, Rina-oneesan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I don’t think I’ll find him as scary as Yuno-chan does.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I’m sure he’s that way because he cares about you, right, onii-san?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Hahaha, I can say this here… but I don’t want Yuu to have a hard time. I’ve already been relying on her too much and burdening her with chores and part-time jobs.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Even though Haruto hasn’t had any alcohol, he feels comfortable expressing himself to Rina, who listens without teasing him.</p>



<p>“Y-You’re such an idiot… Even though you’re the one who’s been through more.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I’m a healthy young man, so I’ll be fine. I have way more stamina than Yuno, after all.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I really hate that theory that people make.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Don’t be like that~” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehe.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Haruto and Rina laughed together as they watched Yuno effortlessly speak her mind.</p>



<p>How many times has this happened already?</p>



<p>Listening to this heartwarming exchange where they support each other, Rina decides to take one step further.</p>



<p>“…Um, sorry for changing the subject completely, but onii-san, you do streaming just like me, right? When I talked with Yuno-chan about games, she mentioned it, so could you tell me more?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Well, I do stream, but it’s nothing to brag about…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto remains unfazed by this topic, as Yuno is unaware of the workings of his “Oni-chan” channel.</p>



<p>If he ever needs to tell her, he always provides only the bare minimum information. And when he says it’s “nothing to brag about”, it’s because he adopts a streaming style that has mixed reviews and isn’t something he’s proud of.</p>



<p>“Oh, don’t worry. I’m not prying or anything.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Haha, that’s a relief.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“The reason I asked is because I’m interested in other people’s streaming setups. I thought it would be nice if you could show me yours if it’s okay.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Oh, sure, that’s no problem at all. It’s not anything special, but you’re welcome to see it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Really, thank you! How about after we finish eating?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Of course. Could I have a little time then? I want to tidy up the room a bit.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Sure, that’s totally fine.” (Rina)</p>



<p>With a pleasant smile, Rina smoothly negotiates her request.</p>



<p>While Rina’s interest in other people’s streaming setups is genuine, this serves as an excuse—one that Yuno seems to have caught on and acted accordingly.</p>



<p>“In that case, I’ll just relax in the living room for a bit. There are a few shows I’d like to watch.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Since they had been talking about an invitation to an event earlier, she wanted to create an opportunity for them to be alone.</p>



<p>But Haruto was as perceptive as ever.</p>



<p>He immediately noticed the strangeness in prioritizing the TV over the guest she was supposed to be grateful for and recognized that it wasn’t like Yuno to act this way.</p>



<p>“You don’t need to worry so much. Want to join us, Yuu?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s not like that. Oh, and just because the two of you are alone doesn’t mean you can do anything weird to Rina-oneesan. If I hear any screams, I’ll report it immediately.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I obviously wouldn’t do anything like that, right!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hmm~ Onii-san <em>ecchi</em>.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“St-stop it! Yuu, don’t say weird things!!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Rina is exceptionally skilled in this kind of banter.</p>



<p>With a smirk on her face and a hand covering her mouth, Haruto involuntarily blushes.</p>



<p>The lively atmosphere of the meal becomes even more lively than before.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>After enjoying a delightful dinner together…</p>



<p>“Ah! You’ve got a pretty nice computer and mouse. Oh, and that mic, it’s from a famous brand, isn’t it?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“With how popular streaming is nowadays, I figured that a higher quality setup would help me get an edge, no matter how little.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Heh~” (Rina)</p>



<p>Haruto, who had hidden his top-secret script inside his closet, kept his promise and guided Rina to his streaming room.</p>



<p>“I also think that these kind of things matter. Many viewers are accustomed to the good microphones of famous streamers, having a bad microphone can immediately put people off. Some viewers can get turned off just by the computer freezing” (Rina)</p>



<p>“It’s reassuring to hear you say that. I feel like the money spent was worth it. Since I do voice-only streams, I’m particularly picky about my mic.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto and Rina were both among those who analyzed the streaming market to find opporthnities to grow their subscriber count.</p>



<p>You could say they shared a similar sense of these things.</p>



<p>“But, even though you put so much thought into it, it’s so like you not to care about things unrelated to streaming like the desk and chair. Feels like the few tens of thousands of yen here went into Yuno-chan’s future, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…Ahaha, I’ll leave that to your imagination.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I see, I see.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Haruto gave a wry smile and glossed over the words, so Rina quickly caught on.</p>



<p>“Well, if you ever plan to do longer streams, you should pay more attention to the chair. If you want, I can even gift you one.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Nonono! If I were to accept such kindness, Yuu would get mad at me.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“<em>Hihi</em>, then I guess it can’t be helped.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yes. I’ll just accept the sentiment.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>To be honest, he did want to take her up on the offer, but Rina was Yuno’s benefactor.</p>



<p>This was a time to politely decline.</p>



<p>Moreover, for Haruto, the priority of a chair wasn’t that high. He had no regrets for turning it down.</p>



<p>“Besides, I’m still relatively young in the streaming world, so I haven’t had any issues with back pain yet.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“By the way, how old are you, onii-san? You look like you’re in your early twenties.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I’m 20.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Huh? You’re two years younger than me!? You’re really young!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I’m not that different from you, Rina-san. I mean, having 700,000 subscribers at 22 is just incredible.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>By analyzing the market and creating the best persona he believed in, it took him a year to reach 100,000 subscribers. It was only because of a certain incident that he could even reach 200,000.</p>



<p>That’s where Haruto stands now.</p>



<p>To catch up, he would have to more than triple his number within two years.</p>



<p>“Hmm, it’s still a number to be proud of at this age. But recently, there’s an ABEX streamer who has been growing with intense momentum. There’s no time to relax.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Eh?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“If you stream ABEX, you must know, right? The toxic streamer who goes by the name ‘Oni-chan the siscon’.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ah! That person…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Hearing this name from Rina’s mouth, Haruto wanted to correct her. ‘Oni-chan the siscon’ was a separate name born from the streaming incident, but he was originally known ‘Oni-chan the toxic streamer’. However, Haruto let it slide.</p>



<p>Some might argue that as a fellow streamer, he could reveal his identity. However, since his livelihood depends on his channel, and considering the controversial nature of his streaming style, he has to be cautious.</p>



<p>“Well, I do know about him, but… he’s growth is not as impressive as yours.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Oh, really?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeh, definitely. His reputation is too bad, and besides, he’s just a really awful person.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Even though you’re a kind onii-san, you’re really hard on Oni-chan.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-Well, um… That’s because his growth was a result of a streaming incident! There’s no doubt that people will eventually get tired of talking about it and the current momentum will eventually stagnate… or at least that is what I predict.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>He spoke the truth.</p>



<p>Everything he said made sense to him based on his understanding of the streaming market.</p>



<p>As someone who also studies the streaming market, he was sure that she would agree with him.</p>



<p>With these thoughts in mind, Haruto confidently expressed himself, feeling relieved. However, he soon realized he had jumped to conclusions too quickly.</p>



<p>“Heheh. Just as Yuno-chan said, you do have some blind spots, huh, Onii-san?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-What do you mean…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“If you’re tidying up this room, you should probably hide that thing, shouldn’t you?” (Rina)</p>



<p>With a grin, Rina points to a certain object displayed on the shelf.</p>



<p>――It’s a precious silver play button awarded for reaching over 100,000 subscribers, with the channel name engraved on it.</p>



<p>In a panic, Haruto begins to clumsily hide the silver shield, but it’s already too late.</p>



<p>“With this, I can totally see you being involved in a streaming incident. Right, ‘Oni-chan’?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-What are you talking about!? That’s not me…!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Then can you show me the name on that award again?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…N-No!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>He shakes his head with all his strength, determined to prevent her from seeing it.</p>



<p>“Then how about you start up that PC and let me check the ABEX account?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“No, I can’t…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I know that Ayacchi and Oni-chan are in contact with each other, so there are other ways to check.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehe, you might as well give in since you’re already caught, Oni-chan.” (Rina)</p>



<p>With a smile, Rina takes a step closer, then another, continuing in a cheerful tone.</p>



<p>“—Well, it’s an honor to meet the man himself. Seriously.” (Rina)</p>



<p>And she extends her hand for a handshake.</p>



<p>“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…” (Rina)</p>



<p>He lowers his gaze to her delicate hand, then lifts it back up to her face.</p>



<p>Haruto desperately tries to come up with some excuse in his mind, but it’s futile. Nothing comes to mind.</p>



<p>He knows better than anyone that there’s no way to escape the situation.</p>



<p>“Uh, well… Yes. I’m really happy to hear that from you, Rina-san…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>He surrenders sincerely.</p>



<p>He takes her outstretched hand, feeling embarrassed as he returns her words.</p>



<p>“To be honest, before I learned about the streaming incident, I was like ‘What’s up with this Oni-chan guy I keep hearing about?’” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-Well, I think that’s only natural… Yes…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Well, when you consider that 80% to 90% of players in the game are male, and if same-gender streamers want to make numbers, they need to have a strong presence… Especially if you’re not a VTuber or doing facecam streams.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I started streaming normally at first, but as expected…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Yeah, I get it.” (Rina)</p>



<p>If streaming blindly and gaining subscribers worked, Rina wouldn’t bother with trying to analyze the market.</p>



<p>She wouldn’t bother creating a persona either.</p>



<p>“S-Sorry about that, I’ve been holding your hand for quite a while… Man, guys’ hands really are bony and big, huh?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Um, does it feel uncomfortable compared to other men’s?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hmm!? Uh, no, it’s about the same!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ah, that’s a relief. I was worried it might feel weird if it was unusually rough or something…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Haha, don’t worry, it’s just a normal hand!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ah, thank you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Rina’s persona was so convincing that Haruto naturally assumed that she had plenty of romantic experience to answer such a question.</p>



<p>“Hmm… Ah! Give me a moment. I remembered that I wanted to tell you something important but forgot what it was.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“It’s okay, you can tell me when you remember.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“—Ah! I remembered, I remembered now! There’s something I absolutely wanted to ask Oni-chan about today.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Having decided that she wanted to talk about it before, Rina quickly steered the conversation towards the main topic.</p>



<p>“Are you aware of the tournament happening next month for streamers? It’s called the Ebe Festival.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ah, yes! Of course, I’m aware of that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“If I asked you to participate in that tournament, would you consider it?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Huh!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s not confirmed yet, but as a team with me and Ayacchi.” (Rina)</p>



<p>At that moment, Haruto’s mind goes blank.</p>



<p>Being labeled as a toxic streamer, he had never been invited to such a tournament before.</p>



<p>No, it was only natural that he wasn’t invited.</p>



<p>Such an unreachable event—where fellow streamers gather, have fun, and engage with viewers—was naturally something he admired.</p>



<p>Furthermore, he could also fight alongside two players belonging to the prestigious pro team, [Axcis Crown].</p>



<p>It’s understandable to need some time to process everything.</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry. This is not a joke… Is it? I’ve never had such an opportunity before, so it’s hard to believe that I’m actually being invited…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Of course, I’m serious, so don’t worry. And having Oni-chan there would definitely make the tournament more exciting, no doubt about that.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“T-thank you so much! If it’s not too much trouble for you and the others, I’d love to participate…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>, great! In that case, you should be getting a message from the organizers soon. I look forward to working with you… Ah! We’ll also need to discuss Oni-chan’s behavior during the tournament too.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“G-Got it!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Seeing Haruto’s eyes sparkle with joy, Rina feels genuinely happy.</p>



<p>She’s glad she invited him.</p>



<p>“Thank you so much, Rina-san!!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah…” (Rina)</p>



<p>And with that, Rina extends her hand once again, seeking another handshake.</p>



<p>In response, Rina’s hand was enveloped by both of Haruto’s large hands.</p>



<p>“Um, it’s really amazing… the amount of influence you have…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I wish I could say that… but I was just being selfish. This was also the reason I wanted to see you… I think…?” (Rina)</p>



<p>――Her consciousness drifts toward the sensation of her hand.</p>



<p>“Really!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“W-Well, with Oni-chan’s momentum and good impression lately… it would be a shame if he didn’t participate… probably…?” (Rina)</p>



<p>――Her attention is now entirely focused on the sensation of her hand.</p>



<p>Rina hears an imaginary sound of her carefully crafted “experienced person” persona cracking.</p>



<p>“Um, so, that’s that…” (Rina)</p>



<p>As she nervously tries to pull her hand away as if seeking help, she hears a surprised ‘Ah!’ from the person in front of her, then her right hand, which was engulfed in his strong grip, is released…</p>



<p>Normally, Rina would continue with a fist bump, according to her character.</p>



<p>But because she’s not used to having her hand held like this, she feels like her heart might leap out of her mouth.</p>
