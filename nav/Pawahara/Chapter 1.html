<h1>Chapter 1: Encounter with a Famous Streamer</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>It was the day after Oni-chan had ended his lively stream.</p>

<p>“Here you go, Ayacchi. Enjoy.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Wow! Thank you, Rina-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it~ I was going to throw these away if nobody was going to eat them, so I’m really glad you came. Feel free to eat as much as you like.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Okay!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>It was Sunday.</p>



<p>Aya had been invited to a room in a high-rise condominium with floor-to-ceiling glass walls.</p>



<p>And indeed, the person inviting her was none other than Momozono Rina, a member of the professional gaming team [Axcis Crown], and an owner of a channel with nearly 700,000 subscribers. She’s also widely known as the “Otaku-friendly Gal” among her viewers.</p>



<p>The reason Aya was invited over was because of the freshly baked food that had just been served.</p>



<p>“Wow, Rina-san, how did you end with these…?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“I only mentioned briefly during a stream that I wanted to try some baked food, and here we are. However, their expiration date is close, my viewers are seriously merciless.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina, who was smiling wryly while twirling her glossy blonde hair with her index finger, sat on the sofa with her legs crossed.</p>



<p>Though her expression appears somewhat dumbfounded, her gestures of embarrassment clearly show that she is grateful.</p>



<p>“By the way, these fluffy sweatpants I’m wearing right now were also a gift… Ayacchi, do you want them? I don’t know if it’s lucky seven or what, but I received seven pairs and can’t possibly use them all.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“N-No! I’m fine! I can’t wear ones with such short length!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Eh? Don’t they fit you?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Well… This is kind of hard to say, but my thighs aren’t as slim as yours, Rina-san…” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya lifted her skirt slightly, revealing her thighs wrapped in black stockings.</p>



<p>Being of the same gender and well-acquainted with each other, there’s no embarrassment in doing such things.</p>



<p>“You see, mine are thick, right…? Even with stockings, they’re like this.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“If you keep saying that you’re thick, you’ll definitely get some backlash. Besides, from a guy’s perspective, that’s the best size, they say. The softness is just right.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I-Is that so…?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yeah, yeah. I’ve heard it before, so I’m certain.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“In that case, I’ll eat more!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hehe, sure, go ahead.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Aya laughs with a sense of acceptance, showing her white teeth as she squints her eyes, just like Rina.</p>



<p>By mixing truth and sincerity, Rina was able to convince her.</p>



<p>Among streamers, there are those who, for safety reasons, refrain from accepting food and drinks from fans while there are also those who don’t mind.</p>



<p>Currently, their affiliated agencies establish rules that no homemade items, no raw items, and no unsealed items are allowed to be delivered. These rules are enforced by staff conducting inspections, ensuring that gifts are safe and secure.</p>



<p id="imagehere"><a href="#image">Aya, enjoying the baked food as if savoring it, finishes chewing and swallowing before speaking up.</a></p>



<p>“Hey, Rina-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yeah?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I think there’ll be an ABEX scrim tournament next week… What do you think about it?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Oh! Actually, I was waiting for those words.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Scrim” is a term referring to unranked practice matches held with only professionals, simulating real competitions.</p>



<p>With a smirk, Rina continues.</p>



<p>“Lately, I’ve been on fire, you know? It’s as if I have awakened my true power or something. I’m racking up like 10 kills every match.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Wow, that’s really impressive…!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Right? And Ayacchi, you seem to be doing great too. I watched your stream this morning.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Really!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Absolutely.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Although they’ve had fewer opportunities to play together recently, there’s still a way to easily keep up with each other’s growth.</p>



<p>That’s by peeking into each other’s streams.</p>



<p>“I was just preparing a meal, so I watched you play for about an hour. The endgame was really intense, wasn’t it?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“You mean the second game!? We were so close to winning!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yeah, you really were! It’s too bad that your teammate died early into the fight. In the end, it was probably a matter of numbers.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Hmnn. But if I had dealt a bit more damage… Ah, thinking about it makes me frustrated!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>, with that attitude, I can rest assured that our main firepower is in good hands.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rather than blaming teammates for mistakes, they focus on self-reflection.</p>



<p>Above all, they hate losing.</p>



<p>This attitude is necessary to improve in the game.</p>



<p>“The owner is probably busy, but well, it’s Chiyo-san we’re talking about, so there’s no need to worry. She’ll definitely have everything sorted out by the tournament.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Right! I heard that a schedule was already decided for the three of us!” (Rina)</p>



<p>This is the ABEX team, Axcis Crown, who are backed by multiple sponsors.</p>



<p>The main firepower and attacker of the team, 18-year-old Aya.</p>



<p>The main cover and support of the team, 22-year-old Rina.</p>



<p id="no1">The <a href="#footnote">leader (IGL)<sup>1</sup></a> and the owner of the pro gaming team, 24-year-old Chiyo.</p>



<p>This team is unique in that all the members are female, but their chemistry is excellent, and they’re rumored to be the most powerful team this year.</p>



<p>“Don’t forget about team practice this week, Ayacchi.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Of course!” (Aya)</p>



<p>The team practices are geared towards the scrim, and they are conducted with the tournament setting in mind, where each enemy will be highly skilled.</p>



<p>There are no cutting corners; they do their best to prepare meticulously and give it their all to secure a top position.</p>



<p>This is their way of repaying the viewers who supported their team.</p>



<p>“It would be great if we could at least make it to the top 3, but with heavy competition from teams like the Zest Division, it’s going to be a tough fight.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Let’s just play aggressively!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Well, I wonder how that’ll turn out.” (Aya)</p>



<p>While strategies and tactics are decided through discussions among all members, Chiyo, the leader, loves to do something flashy.</p>



<p>She’ll probably say something like, “Oh, that’s a great idea. Let’s go with that.”</p>



<p>“Well, let’s just adjust accordingly such that we won’t have regrets.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeah!” (Aya)</p>



<p>The two exchange a fist bump, unable to hide their excitement.</p>



<p>However, this cheerful atmosphere is about to change soon.</p>



<p>“On a separate note, how have things been lately with Oni-chan? I haven’t received any updates, but is your relationship going well?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“You can’t tell me there hasn’t been any progress, right? I mean, I heard you were even on Oni-chan’s stream yesterday.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“U-Uh—!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>It’s all because of Rina’s question that…</p>



<p>With light gasps, Aya’s gaze wandered around rapidly as her hands trembled while holding the baked food in hand.</p>



<p>She’s visibly shaken.</p>



<p>“I’m just a bit curious, you know? Even just a tiny bit, could you tell your <em>Senpai </em>about it? It wouldn’t hurt, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>With a smirk, Rina licks her lips as if she’s caught her prey, leaving Aya with no escape.</p>



<p>“W-Well, there’s nothing at all, really! And me dropping by yesterday was purely coincidental!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Just a coincidence, huh.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“But, knowing Oni-chan’s face means you’ve met him in real life, right? Surely your relationship has deepened more than before?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I… I’ll exercise my right to remain silent.” (Aya)</p>



<p>With that declaration, Aya covers her mouth with both hands.</p>



<p>Though her actions seem to speak louder than words, it’s a testament to her unwavering determination.</p>



<p>“I see, I see. So Ayacchi thinks he’s a good guy.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah… Actually, I don’t mind saying this, but there was a time when Oni-chan helped me when I was being teased for my dialect… He’s a really good person.” (Aya)</p>



<p>With a narrowed gaze, Aya conveys her thoughts with a nostalgic smile.</p>



<p>“It’s only natural to fall for someone like that.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>, you’re quite firm in ignoring your <em>Senpai </em>like this.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“……” (Aya)</p>



<p>While Aya sits there with sealed lips, giving a stern look and resisting with all her might, Rina, on the other hand, appears to be having a great time, flashing a big smile.</p>



<p>“Well, leaving that aside…” (Rina)</p>



<p>As if to change the atmosphere of the moment and the topic of conversation, Rina claps her hands together.</p>



<p>“If he’s really like that, it’s even more of a shame.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“M-More of a shame?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“I don’t really want to say this, but if Oni-chan’s streaming style were more conventional, he probably wouldn’t have been excluded from various events, and he might have even been able to join a pro team.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ahh, so you think so too, Rina-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Well, yeah. Oni-chan isn’t even part of a team, yet he’s reached the top ranks by himself, all while battling against stream-snipers who hate him.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“From my perspective, his attacking prowess is among the top 5 even among pros.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“That’s not wrong, right? When it comes to combat in the highest level, he’s usually taking out at least one and a half opponents.” (Rina)</p>



<p>As players who both compete in the top ranks, most of their opinions align.</p>



<p>By the way, “stream-sniping” refers to the act of intentionally joining the same match as a streamer and using the stream to gain an advantage in the game. Naturally, this includes their location, putting the streamer at a disadvantage. However, even in such situations, Oni-chan manages to overcome the odds and continue winning.</p>



<p>“Provoking others” isn’t something that works without the corresponding gaming skill.</p>



<p>Oni-chan, who has managed to turn it into entertainment, possesses skills that even pro gamers have to acknowledge.</p>



<p>“Well, I’m not saying he should go pro, but personally, I’d like to see him participate in casual tournaments limited to streamers. Oni-chan has a certain level of charisma, and he easily surpasses the subscriber requirements for such tournaments. Plus, as a streamer, he’d be able to provide some entertaining content for others due to his behavior. I think it’s an environment that suits him.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“T-That’s certainly true!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“The more excitement there is in tournaments, the more the industry as a whole benefits, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Stretching her arms up high and letting out a big stretch, Rina conveys her thoughts passionately.</p>



<p>From her position as a pro, she also considers the industry’s perspective.</p>



<p>“As Ayacchi says, Oni-chan seems to have a good personality, so as long as he sticks to the status quo, everything will probably go well since everyone’s already aware of his character… Ah, the more I think about it, the more I feel like he’d be a perfect fit.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Tournaments limited to streamers tend to be quite friendly. Of course, they’re enjoyable, but since they’re held annually and with multiple straight games, they can become a bit monotonous.</p>



<p>In such situations, just having one person playing the role of the “hated” can spice things up and bring a different atmosphere to the tournament.</p>



<p>“Can you imagine if, let’s say, Oni-chan got sniped while he’s teabagging a streamer he just defeated?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Ahaha! That would definitely be something!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“…I’m tempted to ask the organizers about it. It’s still early in the planning stages, so they might be open to suggestions.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Everyone is well aware that organizers tend to play safe and avoid risks.</p>



<p>The chances of the negotiation succeeding are slim, maybe around 10%, but Oni-chan has over 200,000 subscribers, so he has the numbers to bring in viewers. It’s worth a shot.</p>



<p>“But… do you think there’s someone who would be willing to team up with Oni-chan?” (Aya)</p>



<p id="no2">“We can just team up with him, Ayacchi. The three of us—me, you, and Oni-chan. <a href="#footnote">The owner can’t participate in streamer tournaments anyway<sup>2</sup></a>.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s true!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya and Oni-chan are so close to each other that they’re able to walk home together. There’s no reason for her to refuse.</p>



<p>Furthermore, with two attacker mains and one support main, the team would lack an IGL, but that’s part of what makes casual tournaments unique.</p>



<p>“—Wait a minute, Rina-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“What’s up?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I’ve been telling you all about him, so you must be interested in Oni-chan, right?! You’re trying to create opportunities to interact with him!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“That’s not true at all. It’s just a coincidence.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“T-That’s definitely a lie!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Such voices echo in Rina’s room. Meanwhile, the host herself wears a smile that’s hard to read.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image5111_029f98-0a size-large"><div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_v2_6.jpeg?w=1059&ssl=1" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p><em><a href="#imagehere">Aya, enjoying the baked food as if savoring it, finishes chewing and swallowing before speaking up.</a></em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>The setting remained unchanged, within the same living room.</p>



<p>“<em>Mattaku</em>, you should have told me that you haven’t eaten before coming, Ayacchi. I’ll go whip up something for you right away.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Standing in the neat and tidy open kitchen was Rina, who was rhythmically handling a knife.</p>



<p>And peeking out from the back of the sofa was Aya, who responded with a pleasant smile.</p>



<p>“I appreciate you trying to help clear all my baked food, but filling your stomach with just those is tough, isn’t it?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Um, well… I just wanted to respond to Rina-san’s SOS as much as possible…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“It’s nice of you to say that.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina continued to skillfully move her hands while brightening her voice.</p>



<p>“Well, we’re teammates so feel free to rely on me more, okay? That way, I can talk about it during my stream.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“By the way, every time Rina-san does that, I get messages like ‘It’s unfair that you get homemade food!’ or ‘I wish I was in that position!’!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hehe, well, it’s a kind of trade-off, but feel free to also bring up my topics during your streams anytime.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Thank you!” (Aya)</p>



<p>With a four-year age gap between them, as both a teammate and senpai, Rina plays a big-sister-like role to Aya.</p>



<p>“I’ve been wondering for a while now, but Rina-san is really talented. You can stream and cook by yourself. Meanwhile, I just buy ready-to-eat food from the supermarket or use Uber Eats for my meals.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Actually, I think that’s the most reasonable lifestyle for you, Ayacchi. You’re attending university and streaming at the same time, so you don’t really have time to cook, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeah… but…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Well, I understand that you want to be able to treat someone to your homemade meals, especially when you’re interested in him.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…!” (Aya)</p>



<p>The moment these words were thrown at her, Aya’s eyes widened and she withdrew her face from the sofa.</p>



<p>“Oh, right. Putting that aside…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah?” (Aya)</p>



<p>Feeling like the conversation had returned to a safe topic, Aya once again popped her neatly arranged face back into view.</p>



<p>“When you first interacted with Oni-chan, didn’t you get a message from Chiyo-san? Our team has sponsors, so there’s this concern about public perception, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Given that Aya was still interacting with Oni-chan, it goes without saying that their interaction wasn’t really seen as a problem. However, for Rina, who wanted Oni-chan to participate in the streamer tournament, she wanted to know the owner’s intentions and how to handle the situation.</p>



<p>“Well, actually, right after I matched with Oni-chan for the first time, I immediately contacted the owner. Even though it was just a coincidence, some people might misunderstand and think otherwise.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s smart risk management. What did she say?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I got a reassuring reply. ‘No matter what happens, I’ll protect you, so feel free to keep doing what you’re doing.’ She also said ‘I’m expecting great things from you, just like from Rina-san.'” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Eh, seriously!?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeah!” (Aya)</p>



<p>At this moment, Rina’s hands stopped while cooking.</p>



<p>Even if she never heard it herself, being complimented by the owner, whom she’s indebted to, made her happy.</p>



<p>Moreover, this reminded her of the owner’s consistent stance on protecting the members while letting them grow. This made her feel grateful to be part of the team.</p>



<p>“By the way, I’ve been exchanging emails with Oni-chan for a while now, and we’ve even become mutual followers on social media. After every match we played, I would also receive a very polite message saying, ‘I was just playing my character!’ It reminded me of how nice of a person he was.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“I see.” (Rina)</p>



<p>With a smirk, Rina resumed moving her hands.</p>



<p>Aya is being Aya, while Chiya, the owner, is responding in a way that’s typical of herself.</p>



<p>It’s probably because they trust each other that they’re able to handle things this way.</p>



<p>Also, thanks to Chiya not restricting contact with Oni-chan, Aya was able to maintain her relationship with him, which in turn, helped to grow both of their channels.</p>



<p>This also has the side effect of spreading awareness of their team as a whole.</p>



<p>Currently, Aya, who belongs to Axcis Crown, is the only one deeply involved with Oni-chan, who’s growing at an extremely fast pace.</p>



<p>“If that’s Chiyo-san’s stance, it might come down to the management’s decision… Perhaps the management is curious about how far Oni-chan will push the boundaries, so if we understand that, it might really work out.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Rina-san is really serious about getting Oni-chan to participate in the tournament…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Of course. And, since it’ll be Oni-chan’s first tournament, he’ll get a lot of attention from viewers and other streamers, right? His inexperience might be on full display.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“… ” (Aya)</p>



<p>At this question, Aya, with a puffy thought bubble floating above her head, seems to have no trouble imagining the situation, especially since she knows Oni-chan’s real identity as Haruto.</p>



<p>She can easily picture his high-pitched voice, his nervous fidgeting with the mouse cursor, and even his tendency to drink a lot from nervousness and make frequent trips to the bathroom.</p>



<p>“Hehe, that could be a bit of a problem…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“A problem?” (Rina)</p>



<p>She utters these words with a hint of agreement.</p>



<p>“Well, if Oni-chan becomes even more popular, it might be really hard to schedule collaborations with him in the future…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Oh, don’t worry about that! It’ll be fine!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Huh?” (Aya)</p>



<p>Seeing Aya let out a dumbfounded sound, Rina responded in her usual excitement.</p>



<p>“If it comes down to that, I’ll collaborate in your place!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Why?!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Naturally, Aya exploded with an outburst of retort.</p>



<p>After finishing Rina’s homemade food and chatting for about two hours, and…</p>



<p>“Rina-san, thank you so much for today! Thanks for sending me off!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Oh, don’t worry about it! You can come over anytime. Even if it’s just to eat, you’re always welcome here.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeah! Then, I’ll continue to rely on you!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Sure!” (Rina)</p>



<p>This exchange takes place in front of Aya’s apartment building entrance, where she lives alone.</p>



<p>“Ayacchi, are you going to stream now?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeah! I’m gonna stream like crazy!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“You seem unusually fired up.” (Rina)</p>



<p><a href="#footnote">The reason for glossing over the word ‘streaming’ is primarily to prevent any risk of revealing personal information.<sup>1</sup></a></p>



<p>The risks of such exposure have been extensively explained by the agency.</p>



<p>“That’s right! After eating Rina-san’s cooking, I feel even more empowered!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Got it. Well, in that case, let’s not waste energy here—” (Rina)</p>



<p>“—Huh? I’m not that weak!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>, well, in that case, I won’t forgive you if you throw the game later. Just kidding~” (Rina)</p>



<p>With a smirk and a wink, Rina skillfully deflects the conversation, acknowledging Aya’s response while gently redirecting it.</p>



<p>“Well then, Ayacchi. Good luck with your work.” (Rina)</p>



<p>She probably wanted to stream as soon as possible.</p>



<p>Without waiting for a response, she waves goodbye.</p>



<p>“—Oh, bye! Take care on your way back, Rina-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yep! Thanks!” (Rina)</p>



<p>Responding firmly to Aya’s last words, Rina continues to wave as they part ways.</p>



<p>She lifts her black mask and adjusts her cap, then heads home.</p>



<p>“<em>Fuu</em>. This is still inconvenient, huh… Celebrities must have it even worse.” (Rina)</p>



<p>She murmurs to herself with a wry smile, walking alone.</p>



<p>A professional gamer whose name is known to anyone who’s played ABEX, and whose prowess with support characters is frequently discussed among players of the game.</p>



<p>Affiliated with the major gaming team Axcis Crown, is “Ac_RiNa.”</p>



<p>Not only is she talented at the game, but her streaming style, usually with a face cam, consistently draws an average viewer count of five digits.</p>



<p>Because of her large fanbase, Rina hides her appearance when she goes out.</p>



<p>(…Well, my current lifestyle happened because I showed my face, so I can’t really regret it.)</p>



<p>After graduating high school, Rina entered the world of streaming while working a job.</p>



<p>At first, nobody watched, but ever so gradually, Rina started gaining viewers and was able to build momentum after switching her streaming style to include a face cam.</p>



<p>As a result, she was eventually able to focus on streaming full-time.</p>



<p>(If I showed my past self the current number of subscribers I have, she’d be so surprised… Hehe.)</p>



<p>Feeling somewhat nostalgic about those days, Rina continued walking, but then, she suddenly stopped.</p>



<p>“…” (Rina)</p>



<p>At that moment, what she remembered was an advertisement she had seen on Twitto this morning.</p>



<p>It was a promotion for the limited-time release of the “GOROGORO Peach Frappuccino” starting today at the café.</p>



<p>As a peach lover, this advertisement caught her eye, so she immediately pressed the like button and checked out the details of the product. It was something she wanted to try.</p>



<p>“Wow… I should have remembered this sooner. If I had, I could have gone with Ayacchi…” (Rina)</p>



<p>She mumbled, raising one eyebrow while scratching her head under her cap.</p>



<p>Aya had already declared that she was going to go streaming and with her genuinely straightforward nature, she was probably in the middle of her preparations.</p>



<p>Inviting her now would undoubtedly be rude.</p>



<p>(Well… on the bright side, the café is nearby, and there shouldn’t be many people at this time.)</p>



<p>Rina didn’t often go to cafés, so going alone made her feel a bit uneasy, but she had already set her eyes on the Peach Frappuccino.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s go.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Without further ado, she spun halfway around and started walking towards a book café.</p>



<p>(This might be a little indulgent, but… I’ll work hard on tonight’s stream to make up for it.)</p>



<p>Rina, who usually enjoyed pleasing acquaintances, friends, and viewers more than indulging herself, often spent her money on the former.</p>



<p>For this reason, her first thought was, “I’ll make sure to share my thoughts on the drink during the stream.”</p>



<p>This was a mindset she always had and such awareness has helped her build a large fanbase.</p>



<p>About ten minutes of walking later, Rina arrives at the café she was looking for.</p>



<p>As expected for the time of day, the interior of the café was empty, just as she had predicted.</p>



<p>(Alright, this works out.)</p>



<p>Adjusting her hat once again, Rina enters the café, eyeing the poster advertising the Peach Frappuccino.</p>



<p>“Welc…come…!” (?)</p>



<p>(Hmm?)</p>



<p>She immediately hears a friendly greeting from the staff behind the counter.</p>



<p>(That was… a weirdly long greeting… Did something happen? I don’t think I’ve been recognized, but…)</p>



<p>For a moment, a bad feeling creeps in, but she’s confident in her disguise. There must be another reason for the hesitation.</p>



<p>After all, Rina has only been recognized once before, and that was at the ABEX LEGENDS Pop-up Store, a shop related to ABEX.</p>



<p>With her own experiences and her disguise, she can’t afford to be overly self-conscious all the time.</p>



<p>(Now that I think about it, stylish places like this always seem to have good-looking staff… They practically scream ‘taken’ or something.)</p>



<p>With these thoughts in mind, Rina straightens up and approaches the staff at the counter with a friendly smile.</p>



<p>“Good afternoon!” (?)</p>



<p>“Uh, um, good afternoon~” (Rina)</p>



<p>(He’s so friendly… and he’s smiling like crazy. Aya would totally be into this type, huh? Well, he must be a popular staff member.)</p>



<p>The staff, who wearing a name tag that reads “Haruto”, is beaming with such a sparkling smile that it seems like something good must have happened to him. The manager definitely put him at the register to attract more customers.</p>



<p>“Will you be dining in or taking out?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Oh, takeout.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Got it! When you’re ready to order, please let me know.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Um… I’ll have the GOROGORO Peach Frappuccino in regular size.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“The regular size Peach Frappuccino, got it! Would you like any specific customizations?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Ah… uhh… I’m not really familiar with that kind of stuff. Do you have any recommendations, onii-san?” (Rina)</p>



<p>(If I’m going to buy it, I want to enjoy it to the fullest. It costs 700 yen, after all.)</p>



<p>Even when indulging, Rina doesn’t want to waste a single yen.</p>



<p>Despite earning a significant income from her streaming career, Rina’s mindset hasn’t changed from her past when it comes to things like this.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>“Well, the Peach Frappuccino doesn’t come with syrup, so if you prefer it sweeter, I recommend adding some White Mocha syrup! It’ll cost slightly more, but this is the most popular add-on right now.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Wow~ Do any customers also add citrus pulp to the drink?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yes, we have two customers doing that today. We use orange and yuzu peels, so you can enjoy a variety of flavors.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I see.” (Rina)</p>



<p>(He explained it so politely… If you’re a first-time customer here, you’d definitely feel like you want to come back.)</p>



<p>He kindly explained to me without showing any signs of annoyance.</p>



<p>Though it was my first meeting with him, my first impressions were quite favorable.</p>



<p>(I should probably take note of this in my streams…)</p>



<p>Because she uses facecam when streaming, first impressions are all the more important. In that aspect, there’s something similar to maintaining retention rates and repeat visitors.</p>



<p>Rina’s goal is to reach 1 million subscribers.</p>



<p>To achieve such a milestone, attention to details like this is necessary.</p>



<p>“I hope you don’t mind me asking… but you seem really knowledgeable despite the product coming out today.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Oh, thank you! Well, you see… I’ve actually tested about four different cups today to confirm their taste.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Four cups!? Are you okay?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I-I’m… managing.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“<em>Fuu</em>, that’s definitely tough.” (Rina)</p>



<p>For a brief moment, the staff, Haruto, showed a face of discomfort before reverting back to his friendly expression.</p>



<p>Caught off guard by the unexpected revelation, Rina couldn’t help but laugh while holding back her mask.</p>



<p>(This might be the first time I’ve seen such a hard-working staff.)</p>



<p>He’s not drinking those cups because they were his favorite, but to accurately answer questions related to customizations based on his own experience.</p>



<p>(So, he was smiling so much because he saw me looking at the posters and thought there might be a chance I’d order a Frappuccino?)</p>



<p>He endured the discomfort from excessive drinking just to be able to answer such questions. It’s normal for him to hope that he will have the opportunity to make use of his knowledge.</p>



<p>(<em>Fufu</em>~ That explains why there was a pause during his greeting; he must have been nervous about whether I’d order it or not.)</p>



<p>Thinking about it that way, the cool staff member starts to seem cute. You can even imagine how everyone around him adores him.</p>



<p>“Then, this time I’ll add the White Mocha syrup. Next time, I’ll try it with the citrus pulp.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“We’ll be eagerly awaiting your return. That’ll be 755 yen, including the customization.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I’ll pay with card.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Thank you very much. Please insert your card here.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Mm, here you go.” (Rina)</p>



<p>After being politely guided to the card reader, she lightly nodded and inserted the card inside.</p>



<p>(I want to treat him to something for all his hard work but…)</p>



<p>If his stomach hurts, being treated might end up being more of a hassle than a favor. That can’t be helped.</p>



<p>It was just bad timing… Feeling slightly disappointed, Rina finished the payment and moved to the waiting area.</p>



<p>After a short while, the same staff returned with the drink in hand.</p>



<p>“Thank you for waiting. Here’s your Peach Frappuccino.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Wow! It looks good! Thank you so much~!” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina took the Frappuccino from the staff and prepared to head out.</p>



<p>“Well then, bye-bye, onii-san! Good luck with your work!” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yes! Thank you very much! We look forward to your next visit!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>She waved goodbye to the polite staff and as she was leaving the store, she quickly checked her phone to check something she was curious about.</p>



<p>(Positive word-of-mouth really does make a difference…)</p>



<p>Looking up the store she just visited, there was a total of 123 reviews. With a surprising average rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.</p>



<p>Checking the reviews, as expected—there are many high ratings that seem to be referring to the staff member she just encountered.</p>



<p>There are also reviews stating ‘I’ll definitely be coming back!’ and ‘I’ll be a regular!’</p>



<p>Indeed, customer service and streaming are quite similar.</p>



<p>“Hmm. If that guy went streaming with that kind of skill, I could see him becoming popular.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Rina unintentionally let out her thoughts while bringing the straw to her lips.</p>



<p>“…Huh?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Then, she noticed something written on the container.</p>



<p>When she turned the cup around to read it…</p>



<p>[Have a wonderful day ahead! I’m rooting for you!]</p>



<p>There was such a message accompanied by a cute illustration.</p>



<p>“Hm… Hmm!? ‘Rooting for you’… Me… He knew!? Seriously!? Also, this is delicious!” (Rina)</p>



<p>The shock of the revelation and the deliciousness of the Frappuccino caused her mind to blank out.</p>



<p>(…And this illustration… A cute alien? Jellyfish?)</p>



<p>The quirky and incomprehensible illustration further clogged up her thoughts.</p>



<p>“…” (Rina)</p>



<p>As she tried to clear her mind, she took another sip of the Frappuccino, blinking repeatedly.</p>



<p>(…If he knew about me, that means he probably also plays ABEX. I wonder what rank he is… It would be great if I could play with him…)</p>



<p>While she wished that he could send her a message on Twitto, someone who writes down messages in such a roundabout way and respects her privacy wouldn’t do such a thing.</p>



<p>The only thing way she could make progress was to go back to the store next time.</p>



<p>(…<em>Hihi</em>, oh well. I can talk about this when streaming. Maybe I should name it ‘The Jellyfish Experience’ or something like that.)</p>



<p>With that, she quickly switched gears and shook off any lingering thoughts.</p>



<p>Not only was the customer service exceptional, but the fact that the staff considered her privacy made her happy.</p>



<p>(I’ll tell Ayacchi about the nice staff I met today!)</p>



<p>With a cheerful mood, Rina headed home with those thoughts in mind.</p>



<p>∮</p>



<p>As time passed, it was now 8 p.m., with the moonlight illuminating the streets.</p>



<p>“Now then, let’s see…” (Rina)</p>



<p id="no1">In her stylish and clean soundproof room filled with Axcis Crown merchandise and sponsored products, Rina, whose voice resonated like musical notes, reported on Twitto that she had set up a <a href="#footnote">waiting room<sup>1</sup></a> and was preparing for her stream.</p>



<p>First, a quick tidying of her room. Then, a light touch of makeup.</p>



<p>Rina was one of the rare few in the industry who had grown her channel through the inclusion of facecams.</p>



<p>Since she constantly showed her appearance against the backdrop of her room, she had to pay attention to her appearance and her surroundings.</p>



<p>And then—</p>



<p>“Oh, right, I almost forgot.” (Rina)</p>



<p>She tested the camera she would use for the livestream. After checking the angle, she hurriedly adjusted it such that the sponsored products were facing forward.</p>



<p>“Alright, this should be fine.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Once she finished preparing her surroundings, she sat in her gaming chair and opened a drawer.</p>



<p>“Hmm… Today, I’ll need these.” (Rina)</p>



<p>She took out two items: a notepad and a five-color ballpoint pen.</p>



<p>The notepad contained a list of topics to discuss during the stream. As she thought about new topics, she added them to the list to remind her to talk about them that day.</p>



<p>The most important thing for Rina during her streams is her motto to deliver as many topics as possible to her viewers.</p>



<p>To avoid awkward moments, she made sure to minimize periods of silence.</p>



<p>This was something she had been conscious of since the day she started streaming—so it was surprising when…</p>



<p>(Who would have thought there would be someone else doing the same thing as me…)</p>



<p>Even the troublemaker of the ABEX community, known as “Oni-chan”, had been creating scripts and doing similar things.</p>



<p>While Oni-chan’s streaming style was completely different from hers, the fact that they shared the same mindset naturally evoked a sense of respect.</p>



<p>Thinking about him brought forth more and more thoughts.</p>



<p>(Actually, I don’t think someone who can do this needed to rely on acting toxic as their selling point…)</p>



<p>[Continuous effort to entertain viewers will eventually be rewarded.]</p>



<p>If someone were to call this “idealistic”, there wouldn’t be much she could argue against, but Rina still believes in it.</p>



<p>“…For Aya to get involved to that extent, he must really be a good person. His streaming style really doesn’t match up.” (Rina)</p>



<p>As she sticks a notepad onto the wall, she unconsciously smiles.</p>



<p>She can say this because of the actions she’s observed from Aya so far.</p>



<p>This is especially evident during streamer gatherings or pro-gaming team gatherings she’s attended.</p>



<p>In stark contrast to her friendly demeanor during collaborative streams, Aya was known to cling to female acquaintances, including Rina.</p>



<p>Even if circumstances led to a one-on-one interaction with males, she quickly showed a knack for escaping, like playing tag, and immediately returned to her female friends.</p>



<p>Even if invited to hang out by popular colleagues of the opposite sex in the industry, she would always decline without hesitation.</p>



<p>Her overly cautious nature, which was influenced by her all-girls school background, became apparent only when meeting her face-to-face, but she seemed to have no issue getting along with Oni-chan.</p>



<p>From this, it was clear that Oni-chan was a person who was not the “toxic” person he made out to be outside of streaming.</p>



<p>“<em>Fufu</em>, well, I really resonate with Oni-chan’s approach.” (Rina)</p>



<p>For streamers, it’s crucial to have their own unique strengths, to solidify their character.</p>



<p>To stand out among many others. To leave a lasting impression.</p>



<p>Oni-chan must have thought about these two things when he chose to go down the path he did.</p>



<p>And—Rina, too, has carefully considered her impactful strengths and created her character accordingly.</p>



<p>With a flashy appearance, plenty of romantic and adult experiences. Any such consultations were no big deal to her.</p>



<p>…At least, that’s the fabricated persona she created.</p>



<p>“…Alright, maybe it’s time to get to work.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Glancing at the clock, there are five minutes left before the start of the stream.</p>



<p>Normally, she would wait until the remaining time passed, but Rina decided to start her stream earlier to help establish her character.</p>



<p>“<em>Ahem</em>. Alrighty, everyone, sorry to keep you waiting!” (Rina)</p>



<p>As soon as her voice and face appear—</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [She’s hereee!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Hoorayyyyy!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Nice early stream!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [She’s starting early again lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [You’re cute today too!]</p>



<p>A flood of viewer comments streams in, and she continues to speak while reading them.</p>



<p>“Well, I just couldn’t wait until the reserved time~ Oh yeah, that’s right. For everyone who waited early, I’ll show you something special.” (Rina)</p>



<p>From now until the start of the main stream, she always created this kind of private time.</p>



<p id="no2">Standing up from her gaming chair and showing her whole body to the camera, Rina displayed the <a href="#footnote">mini-bottom<sup>2</sup></a> attire she wore for this stream.</p>



<p>“Wasn’t it been a while since I showed off my legs? And, isn’t this super cute? I’m confident enough that I could wear it for a fashion contest.” (Rina)</p>



<p>As she extended both hands lightly to her viewers, there were immediate reactions.</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Oh, legs!]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Your legs were too beautiful.]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Thighs… that’s nice.]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [<em>Ecchi</em>.]</p>



<p>Comments flooded in, touching only on her body and not mentioning the fashion.</p>



<p>From past experiences, this reaction was expected—and it was something she had intentionally aimed for.</p>



<p>“Heh. It’s because you guys make such naughty comments so quickly that you can’t graduate.” (Rina)</p>



<p>As she lightly dismissed it, she returned to her gaming chair and received passionate comments like “Let us graduate with Rina-chan!”</p>



<p>“Hmm? You want to graduate with me? Well, if I feel like it, maybe it’s not a bad idea. Clumsy people are cute in their own way.” (Rina)</p>



<p>She smirked as she responded, causing a surge of excitement in the comments.</p>



<p>“Well, I don’t have time to entertain everyone individually.” (Rina)</p>



<p>And so, just as planned, Rina spent her time leading up to the main stream establishing her character firmly as she intended.</p>



<p>Then, two hours into the stream, she took a break.</p>



<p>“Ah, right, right. By the way, did everyone try the new Peach Frappuccino at the café? I tried it, and it was seriously good. By the way, I got them to draw something for me. Take a look at this… Isn’t it cool?” (Rina)</p>



<p>Bringing up this topic, Rina shows the cup she finished drinking from on the stream.</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [LOL]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [What’s with that drawing lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [It’s certainly unique.]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [The barista who drew that is cute HAHA]</p>



<p><strong>Comment</strong>: [Wait, isn’t Rina-san just showing off lol]</p>



<p>At that moment, comments started flooding in.</p>



<p>“Hey, hold on everyone. Isn’t this cute? You don’t need to laugh so much.” (Rina)</p>



<p>She continues to enjoy bantering with her viewers.</p>



<p>Little did Rina know, one of her teammates who happened to stumble upon the stream was staring in shock at the unique illustration.</p>
