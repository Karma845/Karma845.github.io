<h1>Epilogue</h1>

<p>Two weeks remained until the start of the exclusive ABEX tournament for streamers, also known as the Ebe Festival. It was to be held on a Sunday.</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [Eh, are they serious about this lol]</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [This is definitely going to cause a shitstorm lmao]</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [I feel sorry for the members lol]</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [A clown has somehow slipped in there!]</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [The organizers are definitely messing around lol]</p>



<p>ABEX players using social media, particularly Twitto, were showing great excitement.</p>



<p>Besides “#EbeFestival”, the trending tags also included “#AxcisCrown” and “#Oni-chan”.</p>



<p>Why did this phenomenon occur?</p>



<p>It happened because the promotional video released on Twitto by the official Ebe Festival management team was unlike any of its predecessors.</p>



<p>To be precise, it was because of the ending. It had too much impact.</p>



<p>At first, traditional Japanese instruments like taiko drums played in the background, while the revelation of Team 1 and their respective member’s MouTube profile pictures emerged.</p>



<p>Continuing smoothly up to Team 19, the team that would close out the event was Team 20.</p>



<p>Two members of the pro gaming team “Axcis Crown”:</p>



<p>[Ac_RiNa]</p>



<p>[Ac_Ayaya]</p>



<p>And then—</p>



<p>[????????]</p>



<p>At the moment the last member shrouded in mystery was introduced…</p>



<p>The BGM of traditional Japanese instruments like taiko drums stopped—replaced by the ominous sound of a deep bass wind, and the screen faded to black.</p>



<p>A few seconds later, the screen transitioned to a place resembling ruins, where a fully black-clad, physically large man slowly walked forward, created in CG.</p>



<p>In a scene like from a movie, as the large man, wearing a hood, began to move out of frame, a gunshot rang out from behind.</p>



<p id="imagehere"><a href="#image">He immediately stopped in his tracks and turned around—revealing what was engraved on his back.</a></p>



<p>For several seconds, the character “鬼 (<em>Oni</em>)” was displayed.</p>



<p>Then, as if using an ultimate move like those seen in ABEX, the large man made a motion and vanished like ashes.</p>



<p>With a thunderous roar, lightning struck, transitioning to the text: “14 days until the streamer-exclusive ABEX tournament, Ebe Festival!!” thus ending the video.</p>



<p>The hidden member with the “????????” username from Team 20 By now, you probably already guessed who it was.</p>



<p>With such a powerful promotion and the participation of such an unexpected individual, the buzz was enormous.</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [Oni-chan’s joining? How’s this going to turn out!?]</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [This tournament is going to be wild.]</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [I’m really hyped for this Ebe Festival now lol!]</p>



<p><strong>Twitto Post</strong>: [Well, to be honest, the organizers have great taste lol.]</p>



<p>With many such tweets like this, several ABEX-related topics trended.</p>



<p>“……” (Haruto)</p>



<p>In the midst of this whirlwind, Haruto, also known as Oni-chan, ignored the excessive notifications he’d been getting and repeatedly watched the PV, his face turning pale each time.</p>



<p>“I-I mean… I did say they could promote it freely, but I never thought the organizers would do something like this…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by the mounting pressure, Haruto let out a weak sigh and collapsed onto his bed.</p>
