<h1>Chapter 3: New Malice</h1>

<h1>TGS – Vol 2 Chapter 3 Part 1 – Consultation and Streaming</h1><p>It had been a little over a week since Haruto and Rina’s encounter on a weekday.</p>



<p>It was just as Aya was about to review a video of her participation in an ABEX scrim at home…</p>



<p>“Ah…” (Aya)</p>



<p>She turned pale as she glanced at the notification that popped up on her smartphone’s schedule app.</p>



<p>With each passing second, Aya broke out in a cold sweat.</p>



<p>At that moment, she remembered something that had completely slipped her mind, and feeling cornered, there was only one thing she could do.</p>



<p>She knew that the best course of action was to consult with someone.</p>



<p>Understanding this, Aya wasted no time in taking action.</p>



<p>Praying for a quick response, she sends the message and stares at the screen, waiting anxiously.</p>



<p>She remained seated on the sofa in a girlish posture, motionless.</p>



<p>“…” (Aya)</p>



<p>Since she would receive a notification when the reply arrived, there was no point in waiting.</p>



<p>It was quite an inefficient use of time, but it just showed how desperate she was for help.</p>



<p>“Ah!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya exclaimed with a bright voice, seven minutes later.</p>



<p>Seeing the reply “OK OK! You can call anytime”, she immediately dialed the number.</p>



<p>The person she relied on was none other than…</p>



<p>“R-Rina-san, Rina-san! I’m really sorry to suddenly call you like this!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s fine. I was just killing time, so it’s no big deal.” (Rina)</p>



<p>She’s none other than her dependable senpai, Rina.</p>



<p>“Oh, yeah. Good job for the scrim the other day. Even though it wasn’t the real thing, thanks to you, we ranked third overall.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Thank you! That reminds me, it might be premature, but we’re having a victory party, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“<em>Nihihi</em>, it’s Chiyo-san’s treat, after all. Let’s eat like there’s no tomorrow, okay?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeah!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>—Celebration for good performance.</p>



<p>That’s the policy of Chiyo, their teammate and the owner of Axcis Crown.</p>



<p>Although it was just a practice match, thanks to the scrim organization committee, it was also a streamed tournament that attracted a lot of viewers.</p>



<p>Taking into account the fact that they were able to further promote the team’s name, they were treated to a feast.</p>



<p id="imagehere"><a href="#image">“Ah, well, let’s get back on track… So, what’s up today? You said you wanted to consult me about something.” (Rina)</a></p>



<p>Seeing an opportunity, Rina smoothly transitioned to the main topic of the call. Aya, feeling timid, hesitantly spoke up.</p>



<p>“Well, umm… It’s embarrassing to ask, but… When you hang out with a guy alone… what kind of places are good?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“…Huh?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-Well, um, what kind of places are good when spending time with a guy alone?!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya herself knew that it was a sudden and completely random topic.</p>



<p>Despite feeling flustered, she reiterated it loudly.</p>



<p>“Heh~ So, does that mean that Ayacchi is going on a date with someone?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-We’re just going to go hang out! To explain briefly, things happened and the other party wanted to ‘thank me’, so I invited him to hang out together…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“That sounds like a date.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“T-The other person doesn’t see it as a date, so it’s not like that!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hmm… Is that so?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“T-That’s how it is!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Despite her firm denial, Aya was secretly considering this to be a date.</p>



<p>“By the way, do you have a set date for the date?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“N-No… It’s not officially decided yet, but I have this selfish desire to make it as soon as possible…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“<em>Hihi</em>, that makes sense.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Some might argue, “If it’s not officially decided, there’s no need to rush”, but stalling could lead to a situation where the other party forgets.</p>



<p>For Aya, who really wants to go on this date, that’s something she absolutely wants to avoid.</p>



<p>“Well, there are two things I want to say. First, it’s better to plan important events sooner. It’s really unlike Ayacchi to make such a big mistake.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah… Lately, I’ve been so busy with work that it slipped my mind…” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya had a lot on her plate, juggling university, collaborations for projects, scrim sessions, and more.</p>



<p>If she continued to neglect her “date plans”, it would only add to her future workload and inconvenience those around her.</p>



<p>As both a streamer and a pro, Aya was aware of this and tried to avoid thinking about it as much as possible.</p>



<p>However, this was the result of her efforts.</p>



<p>“And the second thing I want to say, especially since it’s more of my concern, but… Ayacchi, are you sure you’re consulting the right person? I mean, I seriously have no experience with dating, so when I give advice, it’s like picking up stuff from the internet, just like when I’m streaming…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“It’s totally fine! I’ve seen viewers tweet, ‘Thanks to getting advice from Rina-san, the date was a success!'” (Aya)</p>



<p>“W-Well, if you think it’s okay, then sure…” (Rina)</p>



<p>Viewers somewhat blindly trust Rina’s words, thinking, ‘She’s someone with a lot of dating experience’ but Aya knows Rina’s secret.</p>



<p>So, they’re essentially taking advice from someone who “hasn’t been in a relationship.”</p>



<p>It’s natural for Rina to worry about giving advice.</p>



<p>“Then, shall we brainstorm date plans together? I’ll bring my laptop, so just wait a moment.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Thank you…!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Consider this as a thank you for sharing your thoughts on the date.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Got it! I’ll bring my laptop too!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Sure thing.” (Rina)</p>



<p>After this exchange, they both placed their laptops on their knees and began discussing date plans.</p>



<p>As expected, they hit a roadblock when it came to the destination.</p>



<p>Where should they go as the main attraction?</p>



<p>After exchanging various opinions for about 10 minutes, it was Rina’s words that broke through.</p>



<p>“Oh, come to think of it, wouldn’t the aquarium be the best choice by far? According to online sources, it naturally brings people closer, it’s easy to invite someone for lunch or dinner afterward, and it’s easy to have conversations about the surroundings… It seems like a safe bet.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Wow! That’s true, an aquarium sounds really nice! I want to go to the aquarium!!” (Aya)</p>



<p id="no1">“<a href="#footnote">Hehe, then ask your date if they’re interested in fish, and if they say yes—<sup>1</sup></a>” (Rina)</p>



<p>“—We’ll go to the aquarium!” (Aya)</p>



<p>While there were suggestions like theme parks or amusement parks, they were put on hold due to worries about what to do if conversations stopped flowing.</p>



<p>Just the absence of this worry alone naturally raised the priority of the aquarium.</p>



<p>“They say for a first date, it’s best to keep it to about half a day to not make it too tiring, so you two could meet around noon, do some quick shopping, head to the aquarium, have lunch, and then part ways. That flow seems like the best, don’t you think?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“R-Rina-san, to get all those suggestions from you…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hmm, what should we do? Honestly, it feels unfair that I have to help you plan your date~” (Rina)</p>



<p>“D-Don’t tease me like that…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hehe, just kidding! You’re free to do as you please.” (Rina)</p>



<p>With a mocking laugh, Rina responded to Aya, who let out a feeble voice.</p>



<p>After all, if she didn’t want to help, she wouldn’t have agreed to this in the first place.</p>



<p>“I hope you have fun on your date with Oni-chan.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“Yeah! If it goes wrong, I’ll come over to your place and have you comfort me, Rina-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Well, if it’s Haruto-san, I think you’ll be just fine.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“…” (Rina)</p>



<p>“…………” (Aya)</p>



<p>“…………” (Rina)</p>



<p>After a moment of silence to gather her thoughts, Aya finally realizes something.</p>



<p>“Huh!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>Her surprised voice breaks the silence.</p>



<p>“R-R-R-R-Rina-san?! W-W-Why do you know Oni-chan’s name?!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“It’s actually a crazy coincidence, but I had the chance to visit Oni-chan’s place. I met his cute imouto-san too.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-Why are things progressing so much!? I haven’t even met imouto-san yet!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Just ask Oni-chan for the details. It’s good that you have another topic to talk about, right?” (Rina)</p>



<p>“W-Well, yeah, but…!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Certainly, having more topics to discuss is a good thing, but what Aya feels more strongly than that is anxiety.</p>



<p>Aya has undoubtedly known Haruto for a longer period of time. Yet here’s Rina, who has visited his house and met his cherished little sister already.</p>



<p>“Pfft, there’s no need to feel so uneasy. Ayacchi, you’re the one going on a date.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“R-Rina-san, you’re not… aiming for him or anything, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“If I were, I wouldn’t be willing to help give you advice. Besides, I’m the type who’s too scared to even think about romance, let alone do anything physical.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“You’re really not aiming for him, right!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“I’m not, I’m not.” (Rina)</p>



<p>After confirming twice and hearing the response twice, Aya finally feels relieved.</p>



<p>She knows just how wonderful Rina is.</p>



<p>To become a rival to such a person is indeed a daunting prospect.</p>



<p>“Hey, what did you think of Haruto-san when you met him, Rina-san…?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Well, he’s a really wonderful person, I could tell why Ayacchi would be interested in him.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“I-I see…” (Aya)</p>



<p>To have someone you’re interested in praised like that tickles her heart.</p>



<p>And it’s even more meaningful when it comes from someone as wonderful as Rina.</p>



<p>While Aya basks in the happy atmosphere, her mind quickly returns to rational thinking.</p>



<p>“T-Then, if that’s your impression, you’re definitely aiming for him, right!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hehe, if you think I’m aiming for him, then you better make sure the date goes well, Ayacchi.” (Rina)</p>



<p>“!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“I’m praying for your success, you know.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Hearing that somewhat smug voice, Aya imagines the day of the actual date and nervously responds, “Y-Yes!”</p>



<p>“Well, well, if you’re that tense, you won’t last until the actual day.” (Rina)</p>



<p>Naturally, Aya gets teased by Rina, as usual.</p>

<p><em><a href="#imagehere">“Ah, well, let’s get back on track… So, what’s up today? You said you wanted to consult me about something.”</a></em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>That night.</p>



<p>“Hey, I’m on a roll right now. I’m doing so well, I feel like I can do something crazy.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Haruto, also known as Oni-chan, was streaming a solo session of ABEX, firing bullets into the sky as he raced through the battlefield.</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Stop doing that, you’ll give away your position LOL]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Did you forget what happened last time smh]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [That’s why you can’t win idiot]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [At least heal up all the way first lol]</p>



<p>“Who cares? …Oh, maybe that was a bit much…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>As he continued to shoot aimlessly, Oni-chan let out a rather pitiful voice.</p>



<p>As a result of getting too absorbed, the amount of ammo left in his primary weapon had dwindled from 210 rounds to just 30.</p>



<p>With that few bullets left, it would be impossible to take down enemies if he missed even a few shots.</p>



<p>While it was his own actions that led to this situation, honestly, it was quite a nerve-wracking predicament.</p>



<p>In order to regain his composure, he glanced at the steady stream of comments:</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Nice ammo count lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [How does one even miss that!?]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [You really are a klutz…]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [I think I understand imouto-san’s struggles now… especially with moments like these]</p>



<p>They quickly found something to tease him about.</p>



<p>“Hey, who are you calling a klutz? And my imouto has nothing to do with this.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>The one topic Oni-chan absolutely didn’t want anyone to mention was anything related to his sister.</p>



<p>“I did this on purpose, you know. Just watch. These bullets are more than enough for what the server can handle.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Press X to doubt]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Well, good luck!]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [If you have time to talk, go loot some supplies genius]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [What kind of top-tier gameplay am I looking at lol]</p>



<p>While picking up more ammo was an option, Oni-chan valued the entertainment aspect of his streams just as much.</p>



<p>Doing that would kill the excitement.</p>



<p>The best way to entertain the viewers is to take down enemies with what he has and immediately loot their supplies.</p>



<p>Since he’s playing in the highest rank, the opponents are naturally strong. There’s no way to win while messing around.</p>



<p>“Alright then…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>As if flipping a switch, Oni-chan changed his playful tone to a serious one while healing up.</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Ah, it’s Oni-chan’s serious mode!]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [You should just stay like this all the time lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [My clip button is ready!]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Show us what you got!]</p>



<p>Sensing that he was about to get serious, the flow of comments suddenly sped up.</p>



<p>“Yeah, watch closely! This is gonna be highlight-worthy!!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Just as he glanced at the comments and raised his voice to pump himself up, a dull thud of a bullet hitting him was heard. Then, the sharp sound of a shot followed, and the words “GAME OVER” appeared on the screen.</p>



<p>“Huh!?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>An inexplicable event.</p>



<p>He quickly checked the death log to understand the cause.</p>



<p>A headshot from a Kraber, the sniper rifle with the highest damage in the game.</p>



<p>It was an unreasonable one-shot kill.</p>



<p>“…………” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>As he stared at the screen in stunned silence, the comments flowed even faster.</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [LOL]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [F]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Seriously, what was that lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [This is what happens when you give away your position… again]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Serves you right lol]</p>



<p>Both fans and critics were in high spirits.</p>



<p>While this turn of events was beneficial from a streamer’s perspective, for Oni-chan, who had just switched to serious mode and was ready to fight earnestly, it was frustrating.</p>



<p>He slammed the desk in frustration and was sent to the start screen. </p>



<p>“Alright… I think I’m done for now, let’s just talk for the rest of the stream…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Someone’s in a bad mood]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Cute lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [That’s what you get for doing that lmao]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Classic Kraber moment lol]</p>



<p>True to the comments, Oni-chan was feeling a bit deflated.</p>



<p>Although it wasn’t part of the plan, he decided to use the rest of his time to keep the conversation going until he regained his momentum.</p>



<p>“Come on, feel free to ask me anything!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>He focused on the chat scrolling on the monitor, picking out the comments and tips.</p>



<p>“Let’s see, first one… [I’m rooting for you. Keep up the good work with your streams and your six-days-a-week job.] If you’re willing to pay 5000 yen for that, at least ask me something… I’m waiting. Anyways, I’ve remembered your name, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the regular chat. I’ll respond accordingly.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [He’s embarrassed lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Someone’s happy]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [His private life is totally exposed lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Seriously, this guy’s living such a busy life]</p>



<p>Oni-chan had already exposed quite a lot during the streaming incident.</p>



<p>But what was truly fortunate was that no personal information that could lead to him being doxxed had leaked.</p>



<p>“Next up… [I’ve been here since the beginning.] So what? Come on, ask me something too… Well, anyway, thanks as always. I remember when I won, you were always spamming ‘8888888’ in the chat, I know that.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [He knew lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [I don’t know why, but I’m kinda jealous]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Surprisingly, Oni-chan remembers the viewers’ names]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [That’s definitely not in character lmao]</p>



<p>Oni-chan knew the value of money better than anyone else.</p>



<p>He made an effort to remember the names of viewers who sent him donations in the chat.</p>



<p>“And next… [This is for imouto-san.] Huh. Well… I don’t know what you’re talking about, but I’ll buy a cream puff with that. I’ll post a photo of it on Twitto, so go ahead and check it out.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [We don’t need a proof of purchase lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [You’re the only one who goes to the trouble of providing evidence.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [He says that but he’s gonna then eat it himself.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Doesn’t seem like something he would do lol]</p>



<p>“…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Ignoring the comments from viewers who seem to see through him, Oni-chan continues this for about six minutes.</p>



<p>“――Ah!” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Finally, an actual question arrives.</p>



<p>“[Will you be participating in the Ebe Festival next month?] …Ah, well, I didn’t get anything from the organizers. While everyone’s having a good time, I’ll just grab some food or something.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>This is something that must be kept confidential. It’s still something I’m not supposed to reveal to anyone. His response was also written in his script in advance to avoid any slip-ups.</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Well, that’s to be expected lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [You reap what you sow.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Well… I wish he would participate though…]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Even with 200,000 subscribers… I guess invitations aren’t that easy to get huh?]</p>



<p>There’s no need to respond to the first two comments. Oni-chan has always known that he wouldn’t get invited.</p>



<p>But it’s oddly heartening to see comments expressing disappointment.</p>



<p>“Let’s say I decided to participate, would you guys cheer me on?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Nope.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Not happening.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [No way.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [You’re asking for a bit too much.]</p>



<p>“…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Where did those kind comments from earlier disappear to? Instead, there’s a long line of rejections. It’s truly baffling how the viewers can switch gears like this, and it stings to see such a contrast from before.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s move on. Next question.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>It’s already decided behind the scenes that he’ll participate in the festival.</p>



<p>To avoid slipping up, he changes the topic.</p>



<p>“Hmm, [Have you been hanging out with girls irl lately?]—that’s a bit of a different question from usual…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>It’s something he doesn’t usually get asked, so he can’t help but wonder if everyone’s interested.</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Come to think of it, we haven’t asked about you, Oni-chan!]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Finally, something I’m interested in lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [You sound like you’ve got that handsome vibe.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Hurry up and answer!]</p>



<p>“…How much interest do you guys have in my real life stuff?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Being interested is definitely better than not being interested.</p>



<p>While hiding this joy, Oni-chan answers honestly.</p>



<p>“Well, about that last question, I haven’t been on any dates or anything lately. Seriously.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>He could have easily lied to save face, but considering it’s a question he received after someone generously sent money, he believes it’s important to answer honestly and stick to his principles…</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Haha!]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Not even once!?]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Are you serious lol]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Not popular in real life huh?]</p>



<p>――As expected, the comments roll in.</p>



<p>“Hey, hold on a sec. You guys are making fun of me, but honestly, how many of you have been in the same boat as me? Come on, be honest.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [I’ve actually been on a date.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [I hung out with someone yesterday.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Went on a double date just the other day.]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [I hung out with someone a year ago.]</p>



<p>He checks the comments scrolling on the monitor, noticing that many seem to have more experience than he expected.</p>



<p>“Huh? Are you guys serious about this? You’re definitely lying… Hold on, let me do a quick poll.” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Using MouTube’s poll feature, he sets up a poll asking viewers if they’ve ever hung out with someone of the opposite sex, with options for “Yes” and “No”.</p>



<p>The result: 80% have hung out with someone, while 20% haven’t. There was an overwhelming difference.</p>



<p>“Wait, I-Is this… real?” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>He couldn’t help but speak in his natural tone. He rubs his eyes and checks again, but there’s no mistaking it.</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [You’re seriously cute, Oni-chan LOL]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Probably just too busy to hang out, right?]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [So Oni-chan’s on DT?]</p>



<p id="no1"><strong>Comments</strong>: [<a href="#footnote">DT<sup>1</sup></a> lmao]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Doutei lol]</p>



<p>And then, the worst possible flow arises. Comments flood in, mocking him relentlessly, a situation he absolutely didn’t want to find himself in.</p>



<p>“…I’m done with today’s stream…” (Oni-chan)</p>



<p>Their words hit home.</p>



<p>He’s convinced that continuing the stream would only invite further mockery.</p>



<p>With his farewell, Oni-chan swiftly ends the stream.</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [LOL]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [He ran away lmao]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Guess we hit a soft spot?]</p>



<p><strong>Comments</strong>: [Oni-chan, you’re a funny guy.]</p>



<p>Even after ending the stream, the number of viewers doesn’t decrease, and the comments section continues to overflow with mockery, beyond what he can keep up with.</p>



<p>“<em>Haa…</em>” (Haruto)</p>



<p>With his face buried in his hands, Haruto exhales a sigh as if trying to escape embarrassment.</p>



<p>…Just a little bit left until his time with Aya.</p>



<p>At this moment, Haruto finds himself oddly conscious.</p>



<p>And soon after—clips of the incident are uploaded all over the internet, and Oni-chan’s Twitto gets flooded with chaos.</p>
