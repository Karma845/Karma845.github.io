<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>Nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Nekomata Nuko.</p>



<p>Thank you very much for picking up<em> &#8220;How I, with Zero Otaku Knowledge, Ended Up Enjoying Otaku Activities with a Gal Who Hates Guys.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>This story revolves around a high school boy who never delved into the realms of anime, manga, or games and a hardcore otaku gal, as they enjoy otaku activities and deepen their bonds.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve always been fond of lighthearted stories, and lately, my heart has been yearning for even more lightness. That&#8217;s why I made sure to keep the serious developments in this work close to zero.</p>



<p>I sincerely hope that those of you who read this story can feel a bit brighter and happier.</p>



<p>Now, let me express my gratitude.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to thank many people who lent their support in bringing this work to publication. Everyone in the Dash X Bunko editorial team, including my editor, thank you so much.</p>



<p>A special thanks to Chigusa Minori-sensei for creating wonderful illustrations amidst a busy schedule.</p>



<p>To the proofreaders, designers, and everyone involved in this work, thank you very much.</p>



<p>Above all, thank you to the readers who picked up this book. There is no greater happiness than knowing you found some enjoyment in it.</p>



<p>So, until we meet again somewhere.</p>
