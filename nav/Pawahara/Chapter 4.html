<h1>Chapter 4: Date 1</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Three days later, it was the promised day.</p>



<p>It was Saturday, the only day off for Haruto. The time was just before 1 PM.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, good for you. You got invited to hang out.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Haha, yeah! I’m really happy.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto, who was excitedly preparing to go out, and Yuno, who was working on her high school assignments in the living room, exchanged their usual friendly banter.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, isn’t this the first time in years that you’re hanging out with someone other than Suzuha-chan and me? You’ve been focusing on your work all this time.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Ah, now that you mention it, that might be true.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…Just to remind you, don’t get too carried away and cause any trouble for others, okay?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Of course not!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>During this time, Haruto kept moving his hands without losing his smile.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be strange for one to think that his “getting too excited”, but for Haruto, this was natural.</p>



<p>Since high school, he had always declined invitations to hang out, prioritizing his part-time jobs instead.</p>



<p>Naturally, as more people caught on, this behavior led to fewer invitations.</p>



<p>Eventually, it reached the point where he stopped being invited because “he’d refuse anyways”.</p>



<p>Haruto continued such days and graduated from high school. Even after graduation, he worked hard at the café and started streaming games as a hobby, hoping to somehow turn it into a source of income.</p>



<p>If he dedicated himself to streaming, even on his only day off, it couldn’t be truly called a day off.</p>



<p>Just like in high school, dedicating himself to work wouldn’t be able to let him make friends to hang out with.</p>



<p>“Your enthusiastic response actually makes me worry.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“T-There is nothing to worry about…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Despite his struggles, now that Haruto’s streaming has gained traction, he has more leeway to hang out with others.</p>



<p>In other words, even casual outings were precious to him. It made him feel like he was reclaiming the youth he had missed.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, you don’t need dinner tonight, right?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I’ll be eating out, so it’s fine. Oh, and Suzuha-chan is staying over tonight, right?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Yeah, but is there a problem? Did you accidentally schedule a stream for tonight?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“No, it’s not that. I just wanted to say that tonight, feel free to order delivery or something. It’ll be more fun that way.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Alright, I’ll do that if needed.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Yuno, enjoy your day off too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“You don’t have to tell me that. So, what time are you leaving the house?” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“We’re meeting at 2 PM, so I plan to leave at 1:30 PM. I want to arrive at least 15 minutes early.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Then make sure to double-check your stuff before 1:30 PM. When you’re excited like this, you’ll definitely forget something.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Ahaha, I’ll make sure to check three times.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Yes, do that.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>Yuno’s words may dampen Haruto’s cheerful mood, but she has no intention of putting him down.</p>



<p>It’s simply her goodwill, wishing for him to fully enjoy this precious time.</p>



<p>Of course, that sentiment comes across loud and clear.</p>



<p>“Oh, and onii-chan, on a separate note, let’s go clothes shopping together next time.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“…Huh? Does that mean these clothes look weird?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Why would you think that…? Those clothes look good on you. They’re simple.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“I’m relieved to hear that.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>He wears a T-shirt with a three-quarter sleeve jacket, paired with a shoulder bag, and long pants.</p>



<p>Being tall, he looked quite presentable.</p>



<p>“It’s just that you might have more chances to go out from now on, right? Since you can wear them to work too, it wouldn’t hurt to have a few more sets of clothes.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Got it. While we’re at it, let’s pick up some clothes for you as well. If it’s okay, Suzuha-chan can join us too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Then let me know the date in advance. I’ll contact Suzuha-chan.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Okay!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto made a circle with his hands to respond. Seeing this, Yuno regretted making him even more excited.</p>



<p>“Oops, sorry for talking so much while you’re in the middle of your assignments.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s fine, I can still work while talking. Besides, I was the one who started the conversation in the first place.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Then, can I talk more?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“What kind of question is that…? I’d like to say ‘do as you please’, but first, finish your preparations and check if you forgot anything.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’ll finish right away!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto must have needed something from his room, as he quickly left the living room.</p>



<p>“<em>Haa</em>… Looks like he’s really did forget something.” (Yuno)</p>



<p>In the now quiet living room, Yuno sighed with a slightly exasperated look.</p>



<p>However, she was glad that he wanted to keep the conversation going as much as possible.</p>



<p>Hiding her indescribable feelings, she propped her chin on her hand and continued her homework, using the sounds Haruto made as background noise for a few minutes.</p>



<p>When Haruto returned to the living room, they spent some family time together.</p>



<p>∮</p>



<p>And so, just after leaving the house,</p>



<p>“I never thought I’d really get the chance to hang out with a fellow streamer…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto, having finished his item check, muttered as he headed towards the meeting place at the station.</p>



<p>Due to his unique streaming style, which he himself couldn’t fully defend, he had naturally been shunned in the streaming community.</p>



<p>“I’m really happy.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Even if he relaxed even a little, he felt like his face would slacken into a sloppy expression.</p>



<p>――And there is something he hadn’t told Yuno.</p>



<p>“<em>Haa</em>…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>The moment he thought about what Aya had said before, he felt a tightness in his chest from the nervousness.</p>



<p id="no1">—<a href="#footnote">(Ahhh <em>mouuu</em>~!, it’s over… My life is over… Why is it that the one person I consulted about my love troubles turned out to be Haruto-san…! S-So, um, everything is exposed, right!?)<sup>1</sup></a></p>



<p>Her voice was shaking, and she knew that her own face was bright red.</p>



<p>—(U-Um… it’s not like I like Haruto-san or anything, okay!? Just as I mentioned before, I’m just interested in you!! Understand!?)</p>



<p>In a panic, she rushed to explain.</p>



<p>“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>In high school, due to his family situation, he prioritized earning money. As a result, Haruto thought very little about studying and didn’t have any time to think about romance.</p>



<p>Embarrassingly, he was inexperienced and simply being told that a girl was “interested in him” made him conscious.</p>



<p>When he was invited out by such a person, the word “date” inevitably came to mind.</p>



<p>“A-Anyways, I shouldn’t dwell on this too much…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>It would be a disaster if he got ahead of himself.</p>



<p>He took a deep breath to keep calm.</p>



<p>“I need to stay calm…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>With that mindset, as he approached the meeting place at the station’s north exit—he found her.</p>



<p id="no2">Aya was dressed in a beautiful outfit consisting of a white short-sleeved top, a <a href="#footnote">light cardigan<sup>2</sup></a>, and a short brown skirt.</p>



<p id="imagehere"><a href="#image">She stood with perfect posture, occasionally adjusting her bangs with her hand.</a></p>



<p>Despite her cute appearance drawing a lot of attention, it seemed that she was being thought of as “waiting for a date” by those around her. Even the pickup artist avoided Aya and caught sight of another woman to approach.</p>



<p>“Hehe… So even Shirayuki-san…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Though it might be a cruel analogy, seeing Aya more nervous than him somehow eased the tension in his heart and made him feel relieved.</p>



<p>As the tension eased, he found himself naturally smiling.</p>



<p>“Alright…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>He whispered softly to himself as he mentally prepared himself to greet her.</p>



<p>Once he reached the appropriate distance, he called out to her with “Shirayuki-san”. Aya, who was startled, lifted her eyes to meet his.</p>



<p>Instantly, an audible “ah” could be heard and she approached him with small steps.</p>



<p>“H-Haruto-san! G-G-G-Good afternoon! Um, today’s weather is really nice…!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Ahaha, the weather is indeed nice.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>It was a stiff greeting, almost like they were meeting for the first time, but it was clear how tense she was. It couldn’t be helped.</p>



<p>If the situation were reversed and he had arrived first, he might have been just as nervous.</p>



<p>With such thoughts in mind, he continued speaking.</p>



<p>“Sorry for making you wait.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“N-No, not at all! I just got here too!” (Aya)</p>



<p>She shook her head from side to side in denial, but it was evident from her demeanor that she hadn’t just arrived.</p>



<p>While understanding that these were words meant to be received with gratitude, Haruto couldn’t help but feel a bit awkward about it.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s good to hear… and thank you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Uh, yeah…” (Aya)</p>



<p>As he expressed his gratitude, Aya nodded in acknowledgment, as if she understood his intention.</p>



<p>Perhaps feeling embarrassed about being found out, she covered her red cheeks with both hands and started fidgeting nervously.</p>



<p>Seeing her like this only emphasized her lack of composure.</p>



<p>Despite his unfamiliarity with the situation, Haruto tried to take the lead with her.</p>



<p>“Hey, Shirayuki-san. How about we quickly check out some shops inside the station? It might be easier to talk that way. I’m quite nervous too. Haha.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Y-You’d do that for me…? Wait, Haruto-san being nervous is definitely a lie…! I can feel your composure radiating from you.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“You think so? But it’s true.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Finding someone who was more nervous than himself undoubtedly put Haruto at ease.</p>



<p>However, there were still aspects he couldn’t conceal.</p>



<p>As embarrassing as it was for him as a man, it was something he didn’t want to reveal too much. Yet, he had realized from previous experiences that conveying his own nervousness could help ease Aya’s tension.</p>



<p>“—Look.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“ah…!” (Aya)</p>



<p>When he turned his face slightly to show one ear, Aya’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>



<p>“W-Why are you so red!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Because I’m really nervous…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Even so… Mmm, the contrast between your calm demeanor and your blushing face is incredible, Haruto-san. I bet you must have pinched your ears to make them red before meeting me…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“H-Hey!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>With a puzzled expression, Aya searched for clues, and then unexpectedly took action.</p>



<p>She pinched her own ear with one hand and reached out to pinch Haruto’s ear with the other.</p>



<p>If his ears were red, they should feel warmer. Perhaps she was just confirming, but being touched so suddenly made his heart skip a beat.</p>



<p>“S-Shirayuki-san, if you’re doing that on purpose to make me nervous, I’ll get you back for it, you know?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Eh!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>Glancing sideways, their eyes met as she looked up at him.</p>



<p>When Haruto’s gaze shifted to Aya’s ears, she seemed to finally realize the meaning behind his words.</p>



<p>“A-Ah, th-this, um, I-I mean…! It’s your fault, Haruto-san!? It’s natural to want to check, right!? Y-You’re the kind of person to do something like this! Y-Yeah…!” (Aya)</p>



<p>She quickly let go of his ear, stammering as she tried to explain herself.</p>



<p>While her argument did hold some merit, it was also quite audacious.</p>



<p>“By the way… what’s Shirayuki-san verdict?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“W-Well, I found out what you’re saying was true, so I got even more nervous.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“W-Wasn’t that supposed to put you at ease!?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“That’s just how it is…” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya had correctly deduced the answer, but she hadn’t expected Haruto to suggest getting back at her.</p>



<p>“W-Well then… let’s head into the station right away…! At this rate, I can see myself constantly losing to Haruto-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Ahaha… I agree.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>∮</p>



<p>“Umm… Haruto-san. Are we sticking to the plan I sent in the message? If there’s somewhere you’d like to go, feel free to mention it. I don’t mind.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“No, it’s totally fine. In fact, I was really looking forward to today’s plan.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Amidst the bustling atmosphere of the station’s shopping area, the two of them engaged in a casual conversation while looking at the local confectionery store in one corner.</p>



<p>“R-Really? I mean, I did my best to come up with the plan, so it’s not like I’m not confident about it, but still… I-I’m just a bit… worried… Because, you know, it’s my first time hanging out with a guy like this…” (Aya)</p>



<p>Maybe she didn’t want him to see her current expression too much, but Aya nervously expressed her thoughts while glancing at the displayed sweets.</p>



<p>Honestly, he could understand that feeling.</p>



<p>If he were the one inviting her, Haruto was sure he would feel the same way.</p>



<p>With that thought in mind, Haruto came to one conclusion: to try to ease Aya’s anxiety as much as possible.</p>



<p>“You really don’t need to worry about anything, Shirayuki-san. You might not believe me, but if I hadn’t been looking forward to today, my <em>imouto </em>wouldn’t have warned me before leaving home.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Huh? W-Wait, Haruto-san, your imouto-san warned you!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yeah… It’s pretty embarrassing at my age, but she said something along the lines of, ‘Have fun, but don’t cause any trouble’.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>It wasn’t the kind of warning you’d expect to receive at 20 years old.</p>



<p>Although he said it in a joking manner to cover his embarrassment, it had a remarkable effect.</p>



<p>“Hehehe, hearing that made me feel a bit lighter.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Seeing her soft smile as if a weight had been lifted off her shoulders…</p>



<p>When someone opens up like this, it feels genuinely rewarding to have spoken up.</p>



<p>“Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. I really think that wonderful part of you, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“R-Really?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Yeah! I mean it!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Although Aya had been visibly nervous just moments ago, she seemed to have become quite skilled at giving compliments.</p>



<p>In other words, her ability to praise indicated that her nervousness had subsided.</p>



<p>“Haruto-san, how’s work been lately? Are you managing? Nothing bothering you?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hm? Are you… maybe asking because you saw the stream the other day?” (Haruto)</p>



<p id="no3">“W-Well, I wonder… <a href="#footnote">I mean, you look like you’re going through some tough times lately<sup>3</sup></a>…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hey, that’s totally something someone who watched would say! Ah! So you were checking to see if what I said during the stream was true!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“W-Well, I mean… maybe…?” (Aya)</p>



<p>Despite trying to play it off, Aya turned away with a guilty expression.</p>



<p>It was a reaction that didn’t quite conceal her true feelings.</p>



<p>“Ahh, I’m embarrassed, seriously…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>In other words, it meant that his lack of experience had been exposed…</p>



<p>“W-Well, there’s nothing to be embarrassed about… right?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Really?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Yeah… B-But, you see, it’s also my first time hanging out with a guy alone… I’ve never experienced it before… So, in my eyes, it feels like everyone’s just moving way too fast.” (Aya)</p>



<p>She clenched her fist firmly while leaning her beautiful face closer.</p>



<p>It was a somewhat awkward topic, but her words were comforting.</p>



<p>“That’s reassuring to hear.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I think the survey results also had a lot of ‘yes’ votes just to tease you, Haruto-san! 80% is way too high!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yeah, it is, isn’t it!? When I saw the result, I was shocked!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Their conversations matched so well because they had similar experiences.</p>



<p>“But, um… hehe. Today, we’ll also be joining that 80%, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Thanks to you, Shirayuki-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“And thanks to you too, Haruto-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Their conversation didn’t seem very adult-like, but it stemmed from Haruto prioritizing part-time jobs since his student days and Aya attending an all-girls school.</p>



<p>“Oh, by the way, there’s something I haven’t told you yet, Shirayuki-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hmm?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Congratulations on placing third overall in the scrim. I was so happy for you, it felt like I was celebrating my own achievement because I was rooting for you till the end.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Thank you! But wait, you watched until the end!? The scrim lasted for about three hours, right?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Well, I wanted to cheer for my favorite team” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehe, thank you.” (Aya)</p>



<p>Of course, the favorite team he mentioned was none other than the pro gaming team [Axcis Crown] which Aya was affiliated with.</p>



<p>“This just occurred to me, but Shirayuki-san’s 1v1 skill is really amazing, isn’t it? You probably had about an 80% win rate in such fights.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“That’s cause I feel stronger when Haruto-san is rooting for me!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Ahaha, thank you.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>While it’s exaggerated, it’s undeniable that the support means a lot to Aya. Nevertheless, this banter lightens the mood considerably.</p>



<p>“Hey, I know asking you this might be a bit of a bother, but… what did you think about our decision at the end of the last match, when we backed out from the fight to recover?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Oh, that part…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto had been watching the scrims, trying to see if there were any insights he could learn from.</p>



<p>He could recall the exact moment she was referencing. </p>



<p>“In hindsight, and as someone who was just watching, I’d say maybe trading shots might have been the better call in that situation…? With Shirayuki-san’s skills, there was a good chance you could have taken down the opponent, and if you did, your team could have adjusted to cover a different angle.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah… You’re probably right… I’ve been reflecting on that too.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“But, on the other hand, as the main DPS, if Shirayuki-san had gone down, the team would have collapsed, so that decision wasn’t necessarily wrong. Definitely.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>It’s truly a case of hindsight. If they hadn’t been shot from another angle while recovering, it would have significantly reduced the risk taken and helped to steadily improve their position.</p>



<p>“Well, it might sound a bit presumptuous for an amateur like me to say this to a pro player like Shirayuki-san…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“What are you talking about, Haruto-san? You’re on par with the pros! If we went and fought in a 1v1, I’m sure we’d be neck and neck in the scores.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Wasn’t Shirayuki-san nicknamed the ‘Firepower Monster’ or something…? That’s quite—” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“But you’re called the ‘Firepower Gorilla’, Haruto-san…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Eh!? ‘Firepower Gorilla’?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto struggled to grasp the nickname he heard for the first time.</p>



<p>“Hehe, it means that you’re that strong. One of my fellow colleagues who faced off against you in a ranked match before was really surprised. They were like, ‘Why can’t I outshoot him from there!'” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Really!? That’s incredibly flattering…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell who exactly said it, but being praised by someone who is also a pro like Aya is incredibly uplifting.</p>



<p>And, given his own streaming style… he’s not someone who gets mentioned often, which adds to the embarrassment.</p>



<p>Trying to brush off those feelings, it happened at the moment they both reached for the same item.</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>Their fingertips accidentally touched as they both reached for the same item.</p>



<p>They quickly pulled their hands back, but the fact that they touched couldn’t be changed.</p>



<p>“Ah, s-sorry, Shirayuki-san. I, uh…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s, it’s okay! I’m the one who should apologize!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Just moments ago, they were chatting about their hobbies, but now, that casual atmosphere has vanished.</p>



<p>Both of them stumble over their words, caught in an awkward situation.</p>



<p>“I-I’m really not used to this sort of thing, so sorry…? If I could take the lead, I might make it easier for you, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Nono, it’s mutual, really.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Aya shrinks her shoulders, her face flushed red. Seeing her even more embarrassed than himself, Haruto feels a sense of relief.</p>



<p>“Sh-Should we, um, continue looking around the station?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Y-Yes, please, let’s do that.” (Aya)</p>



<p>Their thoughts aligned once more. Both tried to recover from the awkward moment, but the accidental touch lingered in their minds.</p>



<p>The spot where their hands had briefly met… It continued to radiate a warmth akin to a burning sensation.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-kadence-image kb-image5327_359a80-00 size-large"><div><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.vampiramtl.com/wp-content/uploads/TGS_v2_10.jpeg?w=1168&ssl=1" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p><a href="#imagehere"><em>She stood with perfect posture, occasionally adjusting her bangs with her hand.</em></a></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>After spending about 30 minutes at the station where they had arranged to meet, they were able to calm down.</p>



<p>They began to move according to their plan and headed to a PC specialty shop located in a large shopping center about a 15-minute walk from the main attraction, the aquarium.</p>



<p>Though this shop might not be considered a suitable date spot, it was different for Haruto and Aya because they worked in a job that involved streaming.</p>



<p>They can look out for new products that they can incorporate into their work setup. There were even products made in collaboration with other streamers which they can discuss.</p>



<p>This got them even more excited than when they were at the station.</p>



<p>“Aah, Haruto-san, look, look! It’s a gaming PC made in collaboration with Rina-san!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“O-Oh…!! This is the first time I’ve seen the actual thing!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Aya approached it first, and Haruto quickly followed, rushing to see the product.</p>



<p>The product was displayed in the most prominent spot in the store.</p>



<p>Moreover, there was a black and white poster of Rina in the corner, with her striking a cool pose as the main figure. There was clearly a lot of effort put into the marketing.</p>



<p>“This design is really intricate and looks so cool. It’s got great reviews too, just as expected from Rina-san.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I heard that among all the collaboration products, this is one of the best ones.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Wow…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Seeing it displayed like this made Haruto realize just how influential Rina was. Thinking back to when she had come to his house and shared a meal with him made his hands tremble.</p>



<p>“It’s amazing… really.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>In this industry, there’s always someone better. It’s a highly competitive field, with the amount of success clearly shown in the numbers.</p>



<p>Haruto, lost in various thoughts, was intently looking at the product when Aya whispered in his ear, careful not to let anyone else hear.</p>



<p>“Hey, Haruto-san, don’t you have any plans for product collaborations?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Nah, there’s no way (they’d approach me). Honestly, I don’t think it’ll ever happen in my lifetime.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“You’re putting yourself quite low!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Haha, well, yeah.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Being active in this industry, Haruto admired collaboration products and had a hope that one day it might come true, though, in reality, he had already given up on it.</p>



<p>Collaboration products are born from mutual popularity which tends to generate high demand.</p>



<p>Even though Haruto had a large channel with 200,000 subscribers, those numbers were gathered through controversial methods.</p>



<p>He was said to have the most haters among ABEX streamers, and considering the risk of scandals, the chances of a company choosing him were practically nonexistent.</p>



<p>“I’m just happy that Shirayuki-san is surprised.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehe, I’m different from others because I know so many wonderful things about you, Haruto-san. You even protected me once, remember?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Th-That, I don’t really remember.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“You’re lying again.” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya looked up at him with a softened expression, making it difficult for Haruto to meet her gaze. Feeling embarrassed and unable to look her in the eyes, he quickly changed the subject to something less vulnerable.</p>



<p>“Anyway… if I were to ever get involved in this kind of project, wouldn’t a poster like this probably get torn up?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“In that case, I’d secretly fix it with tape, so don’t worry.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Haha, well, if that time ever comes, please do.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto could only hope he would never face such a situation if a collaboration product ever came out.</p>



<p>And on the topic of collaboration products, the most likely candidate was standing right beside him. Mimicking the way she had whispered to him earlier, Haruto leaned closer to Aya’s ear.</p>



<p>“Actually, Shirayuki-san, have you got any collaborations lined up?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>The moment he whispered this into her ear…</p>



<p>“Eek!!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Aya covered her ears with both hands, her eyes widening in surprise as she tilted her head back.</p>



<p>Seeing her reaction, Haruto quickly realized he had caused a misunderstanding.</p>



<p>“Oh, I’m sorry! I didn’t mean to do something weird!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s okay… I know you didn’t… but… if it’s Haruto-san… I don’t mind…” (Aya)</p>



<p>“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s just that… my ears are really sensitive…” (Aya)</p>



<p>Feeling like she had made an embarrassing slip of the tongue, Aya withdrew her hands to reveal her ears, now bright red as if to prove her weakness.</p>



<p>“S-So, no more of that… okay?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Got it…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>As Haruto responded to Aya, who looked down shyly, her words “If it’s Haruto-san… I don’t mind…” kept echoing in his mind. </p>



<p>The more he thought about it, the louder his heartbeat became, and he shook his head from side to side to clear these distracting thoughts.</p>



<p>“Um, well… about what you asked earlier, whether I’ve been approached for a collaboration… I think it might depend on how hard I work from now on?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Really?!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehe… That’s all I can say for now!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Without directly saying that she hasn’t been approached, Aya’s evasive answer hinted at something more.</p>



<p>“Then, if the product happens to be a PC, I might just get one depending on the timing.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Eh, Haruto-san, you’d buy it?!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“It’s not set in stone yet, but I’m thinking about giving my imouto a PC as a gift when she graduates from high school. Even if she ends up living alone, we could still play games together if she has a PC.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Ohhhh~ You’re planning to buy a more expensive one, right? In that case, I’ll pray that if I end up participating in the collaboration, the product will be to your liking.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Haha, yup, my goal is to buy a high-spec PC, so I’ll work hard to make sure I can afford it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Even if Yuno, a PC beginner, might find a high-spec PC more than she needs, Haruto still wanted to give her the best possible gift. It might seem like a waste to some, but the desire to give the best present is a sentiment everyone can understand.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, if imouto-san goes to university and ends up living alone like me, Haruto-san, you’ll feel lonely, won’t you?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“N-No…? I mean… she would be at an age where she can stand on her own, so I’m actually happy about it, you know…?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehe… Haruto-san, you can’t hide your feelings.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“…Honestly, it’s just something I have to put up with eventually.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>They’re used to living together, just the two of them.</p>



<p>The idea that this routine might change someday is something he can’t help but feel lonely about.</p>



<p>“The best thing would be to ask imouto-san directly about her plans and how she feels about it. If she’s planning to live alone, it’ll help you prepare mentally beforehand.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right. It’s scary to ask for the answer… but I’ll make sure to ask her soon.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“That’s good! But… if imouto-san does end up living alone, I would be worried.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Thank you for caring so much about my imouto. But I’ll occasionally drop her a message to check up on her while making sure to not be too pushy, so I think it’ll be okay.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Feeling grateful for someone who cares about his important family, Haruto naturally smiled, unaware of the unexpected reaction he would receive.</p>



<p>Aya, with a serious expression, nudged Haruto’s arm.</p>



<p>“—Huh? Is it me you’re worried about?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Indeed, it seemed to say, “Yes, it’s you.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. Because even though imouto-san is still in high school, she’s capable enough to handle household chores, right? She probably has better life skills than other students her age, so she’ll be fine.” (Aya)</p>



<p>There’s no need for him to worry, or rather, that’s what Aya believed. It was also the opinion of someone who was living independently and admirably. From Haruto’s perspective, it felt convincing.</p>



<p>“But Haruto-san, you’re different, aren’t you? If you start living alone, your eating habits might become unbalanced… You might forget to run the washing machine or forget to hang up clothes to dry… Oh, and I’m worried you might oversleep too.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“I-I’m not that bad! Really!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>At first, Haruto thought she was teasing him, but when he saw her expression, with her hands clasped and eyebrows furrowed, he realized she was genuinely concerned.</p>



<p>“Well then… if you do start living alone, would it be okay for me to come to check if you’re managing properly…?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“As long as Shirayuki-san is okay with it. If that happens, I’ll show off how perfectly I’m handling things.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“That would be nice, wouldn’t it…? Well then, if you do end up living alone, remember your words, okay?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Of course. I’ll be ready.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehe, yay!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Upon hearing this response, Aya’s face lit up with a big smile, showing how much her worries had eased. And for Haruto, it was also a reminder that he needed to show a bit more reliability as an older person.</p>



<p>“Well, changing the subject… Haruto-san, is there anything you want to see in this store? Since we’re here, if there’s something you’re curious about, let’s go take a look.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“In that case, I’d like to check out some headphones. I’ve been interested in wireless ones, but I’ve never used them before, so I’ve been wanting to try them out if I had the chance.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“By the way, I’m fairly knowledgeable about headphones, so feel free to ask me anything.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Really!? That would be really helpful.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s go then!” (Aya)</p>



<p>Haruto nodded at her words and began to move.</p>



<p>Spotting a sign that read “Audio Equipment”, they entered the aisle, where they quickly found the desired product.</p>



<p>“Oh! Here it is… Wait, Shirayuki-san, look at this. It’s 40,000 yen…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“As expected, that’s quite something.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“I’m not buying it! There’s no way I can afford that!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>His budget for headphones this time was 10,000 yen. The price stated was four times that amount, almost equivalent to a month’s worth of food expenses.</p>



<p>It wasn’t even worth considering purchasing it.</p>



<p>“By the way, are you getting new headphones because your current ones broke?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Nah, I’m thinking of using them for different purposes—like having a main and a backup pair. I also want to try out wireless ones. Normally, I’d wait until mine broke before buying new ones, but this time, it’s partly to motivate myself to work harder and also as a good luck charm.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…A good luck charm?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“My current goal… is to get closer to the numbers the person next to me is hitting. If you help me choose, I’ll feel like I’m getting some extra power.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Ah, I see. Hehe, but it won’t be that easy, you know? Well, I’m planning to work even harder from now on too.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Haha, looks like I have a long way to go.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Seeing her proud and happy profile, Haruto returned the expression with a smile.</p>



<p>At this point, Aya’s channel had twice the number of subscribers, at 400,000. That distant goal was what Haruto was aiming for.</p>



<p>“Well, this is just my opinion, but for someone new to wireless headphones, it’s best to choose ones around 5,000 yen. Some people might not like wireless, and they’re easy to lose because they’re small.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s true… It would be bad luck to lose them when they’re supposed to bring me good luck.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Exactly! So, it’s best to start with something affordable for a trial run.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Thanks for the helpful advice. Then this time, I’ll prioritize design over performance.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Feeling grateful, the two of them then spent a few minutes choosing a product.</p>



<p>“Alright, I’ve made my decision!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Haruto chose a white wireless headphone priced at 4,200 yen. It was the long-awaited wireless headphone.</p>



<p>“Don’t you want to look around more?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“It’s okay! This ‘α’ logo looks cool too.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Your choice seems kind of boyish, doesn’t it?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“W-Well, when you put it that way, it’s a bit embarrassing…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>As he shyly gazed at the wireless headphones he held in his hand, Haruto, who usually didn’t indulge himself, found himself completely absorbed in examining it. </p>



<p>Naturally, he feels more than satisfied with his purchase and even feels like he could work even harder now.</p>



<p>It was at that moment when he was about to immerse himself in his own world.</p>



<p>“Ah, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Sorry to bring this up now, but would it be okay if I went to the restroom?” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Of course. I’ll browse some headphones over there while you’re gone. I’ll stay in this section, so don’t worry.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“I’m sorry. I have to look for the restroom first, so it might take me a little while.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Got it.” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Okay, I’ll be right back.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Take care!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>With a polite farewell from Aya, Haruto watches her walk away with steady steps.</p>



<p>“Oh, wow! They’ve released the latest model of these… They look so cool…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Headphones are useful for listening to enemy footsteps or gunshots.</p>



<p>For Haruto, it’s one of his tools for work, so he quickly switches into concentration mode.</p>



<p>He earnestly looks around, examining each one.</p>



<p>Haruto becomes so immersed in his search that he doesn’t notice.</p>



<p>Right now, the wireless headphones he’s holding are one unit fewer in stock and have sold out.</p>



<p>∮</p>



<p>When Aya returned to the corner where the headphones were displayed and safely reunited with Haruto…</p>



<p>“See! Just as I thought! It looks great on you, Haruto-san.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Well, I really like it. It’s lightweight and stylish…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>Standing next to Haruto, who was checking himself out in the mirror wearing headphones, Aya grinned happily.</p>



<p>“By the way, how much does this cost?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“It’s 45,000 yen.” (Aya)</p>



<p>“What?! Hey! Don’t you dare hand over something that expensive! Come on, put it back!!” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“Hehehe, alright.” (Aya)</p>



<p>What she handed him was a pair of headphones.</p>



<p>It was meant to be tested, but after realizing the price, he hurriedly took it off as if he was being pranked.</p>



<p>Just seeing him so flustered made her happy.</p>



<p>Why did she feel like teasing the person she cared about?</p>



<p>Should she continue?</p>



<p>With those thoughts in mind, Aya decided to take the next step to get more attention…</p>



<p>Returning the headphones back to their place, she reached for the next one and…</p>



<p>“Haruto-san, look at me!” (Aya)</p>



<p>“Hm?” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“<em>Nyaa</em>~ How’s it?” (Aya)</p>



<p>Putting on the demo cat ear headphones, she clenched her fingers like a cat paw and started impersonating a cat.</p>



<p>…Usually, she wouldn’t do something like this.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t even cross her mind.</p>



<p>But at that moment, she was swept up in the moment.</p>



<p>Having successfully achieved the first goal she had set for their date, she was in high spirits.</p>



<p>It was an action driven by emotions she couldn’t contain…</p>



<p>“…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“…Hey, w-wait! I-I-If you don’t react, it’s, it’s really embarrassing for me, you know!?” (Aya)</p>



<p>The reaction she got, however, was unexpectedly none. </p>



<p>As she nervously lightly hit his shoulder and complained, she found herself witnessing an unforeseen response.</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry… It’s just that it really suited you, Shirayuki-san, so I couldn’t help myself…” (Haruto)</p>



<p>“~~~” (Aya)</p>



<p>He muttered weakly, his face turning even redder as if startled by his own words.</p>



<p>Seeing him so embarrassed made Aya feel even more embarrassed herself.</p>



<p>Her heart raced so intensely that she could almost hear it pounding.</p>



<p>“T-This is… my… impersonation skill…” (Aya)</p>



<p>Not even knowing what she was saying, Aya felt lost.</p>



<p>Unable to look at him or think of anything else to say, Aya slowly removed the cat ear headphones and returned them to their original display.</p>



<p>But one thing was clear—</p>



<p>At that moment, she realized that his embarrassed expression had become her weakness.</p>
