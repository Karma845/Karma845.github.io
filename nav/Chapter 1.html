<h2>Chapter 1: Haruya Akasaki and the S-Rank Beauties</h2>



<p>“Alright, this should do…”<br /> <br />Early May.<br /> <br />It was the final day of Golden Week.<br /> <br />Haruya Akasaki was checking his appearance in the mirror before heading out.<br /> <br />His hair casually styled with wax. Accessories from a minor yet popular brand. Clean-looking clothes mainly in white and black, not too flashy or plain.<br /> <br />He moved his limbs and stretched his facial muscles, confirming nothing felt off.<br /> <br />(Posture good, expression good, clothes good…)<br /> <br />Finishing getting ready with a refreshing face, Haruya left home alone.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>About a 10 minute walk from his solo apartment.<br /> <br />Coming into Haruya’s view was a large commercial facility.<br /> <br />He had products he was aiming for today, so that was his destination.<br /> <br />As the tall building drew nearer, Haruya realized his pace was slowing.<br /> <br />(It’s crowded today…)<br /> <br />Being a holiday, and the final day of Golden Week at that, it was no wonder many people were utilizing the large commercial facility.<br /> <br />So the majority of this crowd were probably fellow customers like himself.<br /> <br />Yes, that’s what Haruya deduced.<br /> <br />Overwhelmed by the sheer numbers, he couldn’t help wryly smiling.<br /> <br />Glancing at the people ahead of him, Haruya changed direction.<br /> <br />(Guess I should take the back route…)<br /> <br />Veering onto a side road, he switched direction toward a sparsely trafficked alley.<br /> <br />A short while ago he had discovered this less crowded alley when heading to the large commercial facility,<br /> <br />Haruki dubbed it the “back route”.<br /> <br />He carefully advanced down the narrow, dim back route.<br /> <br />Perhaps because he still wasn’t used to it, his body didn’t accommodate the unique stillness of this road.<br /> <br />Restless and unconsciously tense-faced, he realized.<br /> <br />Amidst his heavy footsteps going through the alley, nearing the exit Haruya sensed an ominous atmosphere.<br /> <br />“C’mon, you should totally model, really, really.”<br /> <br />“…Um, no thank you but…”<br /> <br />Ahead of him, a young woman near his age persistently accosting another young woman caught Haruya’s eye.<br /> <br />Observing them from afar, he watched the scene with interest.<br /> <br />(Model scout? No, he’s too pushy for that. Some new pick-up tactic?)<br /> <br />Seeing a situation he’d only seen in manga, Haruya was inwardly thrilled.<br /> <br />In his 16 years of life, this was the first time he’d witnessed a woman getting picked up.<br /> <br />“No need to say that…look, just hear me out at a cafe nearby! Then you’ll change your mind!”<br /> <br />“…I’m not interested, so…”<br /> <br />“That’s why…”<br /> <br />Even from the side it was clear the man was persistently imposing on the woman.<br /> <br />At this rate, Haruya didn’t feel there was any chance of the man backing down.<br /> <br />While the intent was unclear, whether a scout or not, Haruya could understand the man’s feelings.<br /> <br />(That girl is very high level huh)<br /> <br />The girl in Haruya’s vision was undoubtedly a beauty.<br /> <br />Around Haruya’s age of 16 or 17 he guessed.<br /> <br />Her lustrous hair seemed to shine even in this dim alley.<br /> <br />Retaining some youthfulness yet her features certainly exuded sensuality, evidenced by her ample bust discernible even through her clothes.<br /> <br />But still, Haruya tilted his head.<br /> <br />(Feels like I’ve seen her before…)<br /> <br />The more he gazed at her, the stronger Haruya’s sense of déjà vu grew.<br /> <br />He wanted to grasp the identity of that discomfort, but unfortunately that wasn’t the current situation.<br /> <br />Haruya shook his head and walked toward them.<br /> <br />It seemed he had decided to intervene.<br /> <br />(Well, no way I could just pass by this scene unaffected…)<br /> <br />Leaving a girl in trouble be after witnessing it would pain his conscience, Haruya thought.<br /> <br />“Um, excuse me…”<br /> <br />” Hmm? What is it? You. “<br /> <br />Approaching unnoticed, a stern face entered Haruya’s vision when he called out.<br /> <br />Slicked back blond hair and sharp narrow eyes.<br /> <br />Not to judge a book by its cover, but inwardly Haruya deemed this man looking just like a delinquent.<br /> <br />(This is scary…)<br /> <br />With the man’s awareness turned to him, Haruya reaffirmed why the girl had been trembling.<br /> <br />Actually confronting him, Haruya understood the man emitted an intense oppressive aura, glaring over with a compelling gaze.<br /> <br />Haruya wanted to flee the spot but endured and steadily returned the man’s stare.<br /> <br />Unfortunately, dread was all that allowed Haruya to do so.<br /> <br />If he were a gallant prince on a white horse.<br /> <br />If he were a heroic ally of justice.<br /> <br />Surely he would boldly confront and drive away the man, but Haruya was just an ordinary high schooler.<br /> <br />At most he could stare back like this.<br /> <br />So, feeling pathetic, Haruya couldn’t help but curse his own helplessness inwardly.<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />They stared at each other for a few seconds.<br /> <br />The beautiful girl’s gaze seemed to be focused solely on Haruya, but he paid no attention and kept his eyes on the guy.<br /> <br />(Oh… this is bad. I’ve stepped up, but my mind is completely blank. What should I say in situations like these?)<br /> <br />Although not showing it on his face, Haruya was internally overwhelmed, feeling like he was about to lose it.<br /> <br />Despite his body involuntarily trembling,<br /> <br />Haruya was anxious that the guy, unexpectedly, was the first to speak.<br /> <br />“……Huh!?”<br /> <br />Instantly, the guy let out an unexpected, silly voice.<br /> <br />“Huh…?”<br /> <br />Not understanding the meaning of the guy’s statement, Haruya involuntarily let out a dumbfounded voice.<br /> <br />“Tch. you have boyfriend, huh…”<br /> <br />For some reason, the guy began to shake and retreated from the spot as if fleeing.<br /> <br />Meanwhile, Haruya, who couldn’t do anything, was unable to understand what had happened.<br /> <br />(…What’s going on? Is this some kind of prank?)<br /> <br />If someone said it was a TV show’s plan, he might believe it, but that possibility was denied by the girl.<br /> <br />“Um… thank you very much!”<br /> <br />“…Eh. Ah, haha. No, I couldn’t do anything at all.”<br /> <br />IHaruya wanted to be cool if he could, that would have been great, but all he could manage was to stare back at the guy.<br /> <br />However, the girl seemed to have taken pity on Haruya’s incompetence.<br /> <br />She politely denied his statement.<br /> <br />“That’s not true! Um… facing a scary person without hesitation and driving them away… it was cool.”<br /> <br />“Uh… haha. Thank you.”<br /> <br />With a dry laugh, Haruya shifted his gaze away from her.<br /> <br />In reality, he had hesitated and panicked facing that scary person, but he couldn’t express that. Feeling embarrassed by the girl’s warm gaze, Haruya could only manage a forced smile.<br /> <br />The beautiful girl standing in front of him didn’t take her eyes off him, and Haruya began to feel uncomfortable.<br /> <br />Since he couldn’t do anything cool, he decided to interfere unnecessarily out of consideration.<br /> <br />“This narrow alley, if a girl was passing through alone, it could be dangerous… so please be careful.”<br /> <br />“…Y-yes.”<br /> <br />The beautiful girl nodded vigorously in response to Haruya’s warning and bowed her head.<br /> <br />Haruya smiled wryly at her, then left the scene.<br /> <br />He probably wouldn’t have any more interactions with that beautiful girl, but he couldn’t shake off the embarrassment.<br /> <br />(…But, still, I feel like I’ve seen that girl somewhere before.)<br /> <br />While being attacked by that déjà vu feeling again, Haruya walked towards a large commercial facility.<br /> <br />However, Haruya would eventually come to know.<br /> <br />That the girl he coincidentally helped was a classmate known as an S-class beauty…<br /> </p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p> <br />The next morning.<br /> <br />It was an altogether delightful morning with warm sunshine and birds chirping in harmony.<br /> <br />Arriving at his class in Eika High School, Haruya promptly sat at his seat.<br /> <br />It was currently 8:15 AM.<br /> <br />Awaiting the morning homeroom, Haruya’s lively, noisy classmates were chatting away, the classroom significantly more boisterous than usual.<br /> <br />Understandably, today was the first day back from the long Golden Week vacation.<br /> <br />How they spent their holidays must be the talk of the town for the students.<br /> <br />The quiet tension and anxiety of the entrance ceremony and orientation days now felt nostalgic.<br /> <br />Back then all the students seemed to be observing their surroundings, so there didn’t appear to be anyone who had made friends yet, but now they had uniformly formed friendships, chatting enthusiastically.<br /> <br />Ultimately, after a month of enrollment classmates were mostly set, with almost no loners to be seen.<br /> <br />Amidst the lively classroom, as for Haruya…<br /> <br />“…”<br /> <br />He wasn’t conversing with anyone, just alone resting his head on his desk pretending to sleep.<br /> <br />His conduct had to be called slovenly, and his current appearance influenced that.<br /> <br />Shaggy bangs covering his eyes, and large black-framed glasses.<br /> <br />Plus a loose tie and wrinkled uniform.<br /> <br />Somehow he also seemed hunchbacked, those factors combining to make his presence feeble and unremarkable.<br /> <br />A complete transformation from his appearance when out yesterday.<br /> <br />If Haruya sat here looking as he did yesterday, many classmates would undoubtedly be wide-eyed.<br /> <br />Haruya’s current look could modestly be called that of a gloomy boy.<br /> <br />Though the reason was he wanted to avoid standing out at school as much as possible since that led to nothing good.<br /> <br />(That shoujo manga I bought yesterday was pretty good huh)<br /> <br />At his seat by the window in the back.<br /> <br />Resting his head, Haruya was thinking such, not caring about opinions of him in class.<br /> <br />Haruya had a little secret he didn’t share with anyone.<br /> <br />Collecting shoujo manga.<br /> <br />When new volumes released, he would secretly go buy them and grin enjoying them at home.<br /> <br />Heading to the large commercial facility yesterday was solely to purchase new shoujo manga volumes.<br /> <br />(Main character is rescued from a charlatan, those developments especially excite me~)<br /> <br />Desperately suppressing the urge to smile, that’s how engrossing the shoujo manga was for Haruya.<br /> <br />Engrossed lamenting alone, at that moment an exceptionally cheerful voice was heard.<br /> <br />“Morning Sara-chin and Yuna-rin!”<br /> <br />A bright, cute voice resounded through the classroom.<br /> <br />The voice’s owner, Rin Kohinata, is a cute girl, and central figure even among the classroom’s particularly trendy clique.<br /> <br />Currently the exact opposite of Haruya resting his head at his desk, if his position in class could be called:<br /> <br />Mob, innocuous as air.</p>



<p>Despite a month passing since enrolling in Eika High School, Haruya’s standing in class was so low that even his classmates remembering his name seemed doubtful. A complete opposite to Rin.<br /> <br />With a short skirt and loose collar, Rin had a gyaru-like style, but her small build and somewhat childish features meant she seemed more cute than intimidating.<br /> <br />In any case, the moment Rin entered the classroom, or more precisely when she came to the front of the class’s top clique near Haruya’s seat, the classroom buzzed.<br /> <br />“S-Rank Beauties gathered together really are picture perfect huh.”<br /> <br />“I know right? Even though I thought I was getting used to it, that trio’s like idols, kind of overwhelming…”<br /> <br />“They’re so cute I don’t even feel jealous.”<br /> <br />Classmates who had been chatting about various topics until then unanimously shifted focus when the three girls gathered, voicing admiration.<br /> <br />These three would be regarded with envious gazes by all whenever together, male or female.<br /> <br />“Morning. Rin.”<br /> <br />At Rin’s cheerful voice, Yuna Takamori responded in a transparent, sharp tone.<br /> <br />Her long black hair had gloss, exuding a prim image. Piercings on both ears, and her wrinkled uniform gave a listless air.<br /> <br />With a sharp face yet a hint of boredom and sensuality, anyone could tell she was a rare beauty without being told.<br /> <br />“G-good morning, Rin-san.”<br /> <br />Following Yuna, Sara Himekawa shyly turned slightly late to face Rin.<br /> <br />Looking well-bred from her glossy hair and dignified features. Using polite speech even with classmates, she captivated no shortage of male students with her noble behavior.<br /> <br />Whenever the radiant, glittering Rin, Yuna, and Sara gathered, the boys would flush and girls respectfully make them the talk of class.<br /> <br />In fact, thanks to their extraordinarily exquisite looks, some students called them S-Rank Beauties.<br /> <br />“So, Yuna-rin, Sara-chin, anything good happen during Golden Week?”<br /> <br />“Nothing much this period…what about you, Rin?”<br /> <br />“I was working~ Hoped for some romance but nope~ Sad.”<br /> <br />Somehow dejectedly, Rin shrugged. Rin was obsessed with romance and love stories.<br /> <br />Seeing her like that, Yuna played with her hair while answering listlessly.<br /> <br />“Of course not. Such fortuitous encounters rarely happen right, Sara-chin?”<br /> <br />Seeking Sara’s agreement, Sara jolted at Yuna’s words.<br /> <br />Surprised by Sara’s unexpected reaction, Yuna and Rin’s eyes widened.<br /> <br />Looking closely, Sara’s cheeks seemed vaguely flushed, her composure disturbed.<br /> <br />Sara blushed and lowered her head.<br /> <br />“Really? Sara-chan…”<br /> <br />Rin, driven by excitement, was the first to dig in.<br /> <br />Her eyes sparkled, filled with anticipation, as she directed them towards Sara.<br /> <br />“Could it be that you had a wonderful encounter during this Golden Week?”<br /> <br />“Uh, you’re kidding. …… “<br /> <br />Even the cool Yuna, following Rin, couldn’t help but let out a sigh of admiration.<br /> <br />“Well… um.”<br /> <br />Blushing, Sara averted her gaze from the two.<br /> <br />Though she intended to play it off, she eventually hesitantly spoke, realizing she couldn’t escape.<br /> <br />“Um…actually, I had a fated encounter.”<br /> <br />Somehow abashed yet beginning her confession, Sara’s tale started.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />It was just yesterday.<br /> <br />When I went shopping for clothes, I happened to get caught by someone scouting models.<br /> <br />At first I thought it was model scouting but he was quite persistent, so I judged it must be a lie.<br /> <br />I immediately tried to flee but his looks were so intimidating, I was quite frightened, and…my legs shook, unable to escape.<br /> <br />Looking around, there was no one who appeared willing to help, perhaps due to the unnoticed nature of the situation.<br /> <br />Occasionally, my eyes met with a few people, but everyone chose to look away, pretending not to see.<br /> <br />I felt disappointed in the expectations I had of those around me. However, at that moment, I was scared and could only resort to seeking help, even though it felt futile.<br /> <br />I had no hope because I had seen how people reacted.<br /> <br />Then, unexpectedly, someone appeared to help me.<br /> <br />This person came to my aid with grace,<br /> <br />standing in the dimly lit alley, seeming to glow.<br /> <br />The person who should have been unrelated to me openly expressed anger, thinking about me.<br /> <br />In response to my inner call for help, this person, who should have been intimidating, came to help. Despite the hassle and difficulty of repelling the bad guy, he drove them away with just a glare.<br /> <br />The follow-up afterwards was kind, but I couldn’t properly express my gratitude.<br /> <br />So, I regret that.</p>

 <br />“…That’s why it was a fateful encounter. If I could meet that person again, I would like to properly thank him.”<br /> <br />With that lingering regret, Sara concluded her story, as if implying there was nothing more to it.<br /> <br />At that moment, Rin, unable to contain herself, forcefully embraced Sara.<br /> <br />When you looked, Rin’s eyes were moist.<br /> <br />“Rin-san, what’s wrong?”<br /> <br />“Sara-chan, it must have been scary. If I had been there, I would have driven the bad guy away. I won’t forgive the person who scared Sara-chan.”<br /> <br />“That’s right. I understand what Rin is saying.”<br /> <br />While directing an exasperated look at Rin, who was hugging Sara, Yuna also showed agreement.<br /> <br />Rin, who had hugged Sara for a while, finally released her and, with a glint in her eyes, spoke.<br /> <br />“But still, that guy who helped you… he’s really cool. It’s like something out of a shojo manga! It’s the dream of every girl.”<br /> <br />It would be a dream for any girl<br /> <br />to have a handsome guy rush to her aid like a hero, appearing out of nowhere.<br /> <br />Rin, while pouting enviously, had a happy expression.<br /> <br />“Did you get his contact information? Such situations rarely happen… he might be your destined person!”<br /> <br />“…Uh, Rin-san. It’s not like that.”<br /> <br />Sara wore a somewhat resigned expression.<br /> <br />Then, in a rejecting tone, she firmly stated,<br /> <br />“I have an arranged marriage set due to family circumstances.”<br /> <br />With a gentle smile, Sara explained, and Rin, realizing she had made a mistake, hung her head.<br /> <br />In reality, Sara’s family, the Himekawa family, was a traditional and strict lineage.<br /> <br />In this era, arranged marriages were considered natural for daughters of the Himekawa family.<br /> <br />Therefore, those born into the Himekawa family had their futures determined, and they were taught to take pride in that.<br /> <br />Among her classmates, many felt pity for Sara’s situation,<br /> <br />but Sara proudly embraced her circumstances. However, she couldn’t keep up with Rin and Yuna’s romantic conversations, and at times like these, she felt a bit lonely being left out.<br /> <br />“…I see. Sara-chan, you’re really mature.”<br /> <br />“That’s right.”<br /> <br />Following Rin, Yuna nodded slightly.<br /> <br />Sensing the atmosphere, Rin and Yuna decided to temporarily stop their love talk.<br /> <br />“Hey, hey. Speaking of which, I recently found a recommended cosmetic~”/p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/C5vEb2n.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>To ease the slightly tense atmosphere, Rin began to introduce a different topic.<br /> <br />However, even when Rin tried to change the topic to something other than romantic discussions, the students around lacked the ability to read the air.<br /> <br />The impact of Sara’s story was just too strong.<br /> <br />(…Did you hear Himekawa-san’s story? Seriously like a destined person…)<br /> <br />(That man she talked about is so cool… just like a shoujo manga…)<br /> <br />(A situation like that… it’s rare to have something like a destined person in real life…)<br /> <br />Whispers of students filled the classroom<br /> <br />as they eagerly listened to the S-class beauties’ romantic discussions. Today, Haruya was one of them, which was unusual for him.<br /> <br />The reason was that Sara’s story resonated too much with him.<br /> <br />Normally, he wouldn’t pay attention to the class’s situation, but…<br /> <br />(Huh? Wait a minute. That topic… it sounds familiar. Could it be related to what happened yesterday, where I saved a girl from a pickup? Similar situation… but the guy she describes seems incredibly cool. Unlike me, who couldn’t act like that in front of a wild animal…)<br /> <br />Impressed by the stark contrast, Haruya couldn’t help but marvel at himself.<br /> <br />The way the man Sara described behaved like a hero, while Haruya’s actions yesterday resembled a large beast trembling or a weak small animal.<br /> <br />His legs and feet were shaking, his face was drawn, and all he could do was to hold his breath.<br /> <br />(…The more I hear about it, the more I realize the difference between us. Let’s stop listening to this… It only makes me regret it more…)<br /> <br />Feeling his own pathetic side, Haruya started to think about shoujo manga once again in his heart.</p>



<p>After indulging in delusions about shoujo manga for a while…<br /> <br />With 10 minutes left before the start of morning homeroom, many students start sitting at their desks.<br /> <br />Among them, as if wanting to chat or looking for someone to talk with, the male student behind me suddenly tapped my shoulder twice.<br /> <br />“Hey, Akazaki, did you hear?”<br /> <br />“Hmm…?”<br /> <br />I turned around, heavy body and all, to see a male student with a lively voice and showing his snaggletooth.<br /> <br />While surprised he remembered my name when I have practically no presence in this class, I become filled with an apologetic feeling.<br /> <br />(I’m grateful he remembers my name, but uh, who was he again?)<br /> <br />Seeing my confused expression, he seemed to realize and opened his mouth to introduce himself.<br /> <br />“…Oh right, I’m Kazumiya Yuki. Sorry for suddenly talking to you. I just couldn’t hold back this excitement, you know?”<br /> <br />Even without seeing his face, I could tell from his tone of voice.<br /> <br />The male student who introduced himself as Kazumiya Yuki seemed like he desperately wanted to talk with anyone.<br /> <br />He probably talked to me just because I happened to be sitting in front of him.<br /> <br />Perhaps my attitude made it seem troublesome to interact with me.<br /> <br />For a moment, an awkward atmosphere flowed between us, but as if hating the silence, Kazumiya changed the subject.<br /> <br />“By the way, Akazaki, did you hear? The conversation from earlier.”<br /> <br />“What conversation are you talking about?”<br /> <br />“The one with the S-class beauties!”<br /> <br />“Oh right, the ones getting attention in class now…”<br /> <br />“Why do you make it sound so unrelated?”<br /> <br />“Because it really doesn’t relate to me. I have no interest.”<br /> <br />“Huh, you’re kidding…”<br /> <br />Rather than shocked, Kazumiya narrowed his eyes as if drawing back.<br /> <br />Any guy would want to get close with beautiful girls.<br /> <br />Even if they casually say “I’m not interested,” in reality, it’s often those guys who are secretly very interested.<br /> <br />But after hearing my tone and emotionless voice, Kazumiya seemed convinced I genuinely meant what I said.<br /> <br />He could only hang his mouth open.<br /> <br />“…I think I understand why Akazaki is left alone with no presence now.”<br /> <br />Kazumiya held his head in amazed exasperation.<br /> <br />Because I deliberately act to make that happen, of course that’s how it turned out.<br /> <br />In reality, he was right, but to not reveal what I truly feel, I changed the subject.<br /> <br />“But you know, I did hear about it. Something about a destined encounter, right?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, the story about Himekawa san having a romantic encounter. Man, her partner is so enviable!”<br /> <br />After chatting pleasantly while chuckling for a bit, Kazumiya then cleared his throat. “But you know…”<br /> <br />“I heard Ms. Himekawa has a strict family. I’m really looking forward to how things will develop from here on.”<br /> <br />“Is that so.”<br /> <br />I did hear the talk about arranged marriage or something, but since I felt it was completely unrelated to me, I didn’t show any sign of particularly caring about it and gave an ambiguous response.<br /> <br />However….<br /> <br />“Pfft, even though it’s such big news that most guys in class would be scared stiff, you really can stay disinterested huh, Akazaki.”<br /> <br />Even though I tried not to show it on my face, looks like I was seen through.<br /> <br />The reason I was listening to the talk about the S-Class beauties was because the content was similar to something I had experienced, not because I was interested in those girls themselves.<br /> <br />“…But you know, you should at least know the basics about those S-Class girls.”<br /> <br />“Is that how it is?”<br /> <br />I made a questioning expression, and Kazumiya nodded many times while crossing his arms.<br /> <br />“That’s how it is. Or else you can’t make friends and stuff. Well, Akazaki might be a special case, but you should still take some interest.”<br /> <br />“…Then shouldn’t you take the initiative to approach them instead?”<br /> <br />Kazumiya gave a wry smile as he waved his hands in refusal to my extremely obvious opinion.<br /> <br />“Impossible… it’s scary enough that even going near them is difficult!”<br /> <br />And then, Kazumiya continued.<br /> <br />“Aside from Ms. Himekawa, I heard Ms. Takamori and Ms. Hinode also seem to have guys they’re interested in. Well, they’re just rumors so I don’t actually know…”<br /> <br />Indeed, there were whispers floating around class that Yuna and Rin, two of the S-Class beauties, have “guys they’re interested in.” However, since those two get countless confessions, it was conjectured that they might just be saying that as a guy repellant. The truth of the matter was unclear.<br /> <br />“So yeah, that’s what it is. Anyway, what I want to say is, you should take at least a little more interest in class.”<br /> <br />“I’ll take that to heart.”<br /> <br />“Yeah, make sure you do!”<br /> <br />After butting in a bit, when Kazumiya finished lecturing me, I once again rested my head on the desk.<br /> <br />(In the first place, there’s no way I’d have anything to do with girls called S-Class beauties or whatever.)<br /> <br />While thinking so to myself, I immediately gave up thinking any further.<br /> </p>



 class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p> <br />That day after school.<br /> <br />Having smoothly finished classes, I was on my way home alone.<br /> <br />“I’m home…”<br /> <br />Upon entering the house, I mutter so despite no one being home.<br /> <br />As a high school first-year living alone since this year, there were no other residents aside from myself at home, but somehow it had become my habit to greet like this.<br /> <br />I felt a little lonely without hearing the halfhearted “Welcome back~” I often did back home from my younger sister.<br /> <br />I have a sister one year younger than me. She’s cheeky and annoying but I feel a little down when she’s not around.<br /> <br />But I digress.<br /> <br />After changing clothes and relaxing, I check my SNS account.<br /> <br />There was one new message so I exchanged messages with that person.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Nayu: Hey, have you read that shoujo manga I recommended, Haru?<br /> <br />Haru: Yeah, I read it. It was really interesting.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After sending my reply, I unintentionally loosen my cheeks a little.<br /> <br />While I’m always alone at school, through SNS I have comrades I can talk to about my hobbies.<br /> <br />On a whim, I recalled how I met my shoujo manga loving comrade [Nayu].<br /> </p>



 class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p> <br />My encounter with Nayu goes back about two months.<br /> <br />At that time, having just finished taking high school entrance exams, as a reward for getting through the exam studies, I diligently read shoujo manga, one of my few hobbies.<br /> <br />Reading books after long exhausting exam studies felt supremely comforting.<br /> <br />For most people, once suppressed urges explode the moment they are released. I was no exception.<br /> <br />I held back until exam studies ended, and now I digested the shoujo manga I had stocked up and posted impressions on SNS.<br /> <br />That became my routine.<br /> <br />The reason I posted impressions on SNS was because I wanted comrades to discuss impressions with.<br /> <br />Around this time, I didn’t interact much with others so even though I read interesting shoujo manga, I had no comrades to share with and discuss them.<br /> <br />Due to that frustration of having no one to discuss with, I created an SNS account to post impressions.<br /> <br />I named it [Haru] taking part of my real name [Haruya].<br /> <br />I didn’t actually expect to get replies to my impression posts. It was just to get out feelings I couldn’t contain, to the extent of venting them. But…<br /> <br />Turning points come suddenly I guess.<br /> <br />I read interesting shoujo manga and posted impressions of them.<br /> <br />It happened one day while I was going through that routine. My impressions section was colored.<br /> <br />[Sorry for the first reply. That manga is interesting, isn’t it. I totally get it. The subject is kinda minor but that’s exactly why it’s good and… Haru, you have good taste!]<br /> <br />A comrade sympathizing with my impressions appeared.<br /> <br />Their account name was [Nayu].<br /> <br />In excitement and delight that a comrade had appeared, I immediately replied back, and from then on Nayu also showed sympathy by replying to my other posts.<br /> <br />Through our exchanges, we gradually realized our tastes matched in shoujo manga story developments and genres, bringing Haru and Nayu closer over SNS.<br /> <br />We started conversing more personally, and even found out we live near each other.<br /> <br />Now, while keeping private talks to a suitable degree, we recommend each other shoujo manga and sometimes meet up to talk about impressions face to face.<br /> <br />That’s how we built our relationship.<br /> </p>



 class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p> <br />Nayu: Hey, are you listening? Haru?<br /> <br />Nayu: Helloooo, I know you’ve read it.<br /> <br />Haru:…Sorry, I was lost in thought.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Noticing I hadn’t to reply from Nayu, I hurriedly replied back.<br /> <br />I obviously couldn’t say I was reminiscing about how we met, so I could only ambiguously gloss over it.<br /> <br />Even though it’s through a screen, I can vividly imagine her puffing her cheeks sullenly.<br /> <br />Unintentionally, I smiled wryly there and, as if to change the subject, I started the conversation.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Haru: Speaking of which, something amazing happened today, want to hear it?<br /> <br />Nayu: What, amazing thing…?<br /> <br />Haru: Actually, there was an incredible talk in class today.<br /> <br />Nayu: Oh really, what talk?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After confirming she showed interest, I promptly started sharing the story.<br /> <br />What I talked about with her was a female classmate who got helped by a guy when getting hit on.<br /> <br />Having just yesterday experienced a similar thing myself, coincidentally saving a beauty from a pick up artist, the talk about my female classmate left an impression.<br /> <br />Although, up until now I had convinced myself pick up artists were fictional, so that might also be related to why it made such a strong impression.<br /> <br />When I finished telling that story, she immediately replied back.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Nayu: Pick up artists themselves are pretty common but… this surprised me.<br /> <br />Haru: Hmm? What surprised you?<br /> <br />Nayu: Actually, I heard a similar story from a friend today too.<br /> <br />Haru: Oh really, is that so.<br /> <br />Nayu: Yeah, so it’s an amazing coincidence.<br /> <br />Haru: Maybe pick up artists are more commonplace than I thought.<br /> <br />Nayu: Yeah, seems like it.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />─And at that point, when the conversation naturally hit a stopping point, I put a good mark on her last message.<br /> <br />Just as I try to put away my phone thinking our talk had ended, a notification immediately comes to my phone.<br /> <br />As expected, it was from Nayu.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Nayu: Hey, don’t suddenly end the conversation.<br /> <br />Haru: Sorry, was there something else?<br /> <br />Nayu: …What do you think was the purpose behind contacting today?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I’m asked a question in return.<br /> <br />Her fed up expression transmitted over vividly.<br /> <br />Apprehensively, seeming apologetic, I replied back to Nayu.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Haru: To talk about impressions of shoujo manga… right?<br /> <br />Nayu: Yes. So, come on, you know… that.<br /> <br />Haru: That?<br /> <br />Nayu: Yes, that.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Even though she says “that,” I was completely drawing a blank.<br /> <br />As if she lost patience from me taking time to reply, she sent another reply right away.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Nayu: …The offline meeting, the offline meeting.<br /> <br />Haru: Ah, the offline meeting huh.<br /> <br />Nayu: Yes, don’t make me say it. It’s embarrassing!<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Nayu,” feeling embarrassed to meet face-to-face, replied that way.<br /> <br />Haru apologized with a simple “Sorry,” then they proceeded to discuss the specific schedule for the offline meeting with Nayu.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Nayu: How about next weekend? Are you free?<br /> <br />Haru: Yeah, I’m free, so it works for me.<br /> <br />Nayu: Alright then, let’s aim for next week. Haru-san, make sure to find some interesting shoujo manga during that time, okay?<br /> <br />Haru: Got it.<br /> </p>

<p> <br />Letting out a light sigh, I relaxed on the sofa.<br /> <br />However, he couldn’t help but reflect on the conversation.<br /> <br />(… Is Nayu wearing sunglasses because she’s embarrassed to meet in person?)<br /> <br />I had met Nayu several times for offline meetings, and on each occasion, Nayu always appeared wearing sunglasses.<br /> <br />Therefore, reflecting on the recent chat, I couldn’t help but smile at discovering Nayu’s shy side.<br /> <br />(She’d definitely get mad if I say it but… Nayu, you’re cute, you know?)<br /> </p>



 class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p> <br />That night.<br /> <br />While the moon vividly shone its presence in the night sky, I visited a certain store I frequented to have dinner.<br /> <br />That store is a small cafe.<br /> <br />They have a large selection of menu items and large servings, reasonable prices, an hidden gem for high school boys.<br /> <br />I frequent this cafe up to three times a week.<br /> <br />You could call me a regular customer.<br /> <br />Perhaps due to its location being on the outskirts of the city area, both weekdays and holidays, the store interior gives off a calming, tranquil atmosphere compared to other shops.<br /> <br />Rather than a stylish store, the interior and exterior give off a retro atmosphere, seemingly an old-established shop, possibly selective about its customers too.<br /> <br />What I like most about this store is the coffee they serve.<br /> <br />They apparently extract coffee from special coffee beans. It has richness in both aroma and flavor.<br /> <br />The first thing I felt upon entering the store was the few customers.<br /> <br />Having passed peak hours, a calm, quiet serene atmosphere covers the whole store.<br /> <br />Sitting at a window seat near the back, without even needing to check the menu, I called the server.<br /> <br />“Um, excuse me!”<br /> <br />Hearing me call, an older but familiar female server approached briskly with light footsteps.<br /> <br />“Yes, please wait a moment!”<br /> <br />A voice like bells tolling reaches my ears.<br /> <br />─Clack clack, clack clack.<br /> <br />As the brisk footsteps gradually got louder, I unintentionally turned to face where the sound was coming from.<br /> <br />Despite being accustomed to her appearance, there was an inexplicable surge of excitement, likely influenced by her attire.<br /> <br />She exuded a mature aura with glasses that gave the illusion of a maid outfit, adorned with soft frills in monotone colors.<br /> <br />Her hair, probably reaching down to her shoulders, was neatly tied back.<br /> <br />With a petite and delicate figure, combined with a youthful face, she lacked any overt sensuality.<br /> <br />Though she might seem plain at first glance, she undeniably possessed the appearance of a beautiful girl.<br /> <br />The female clerk’s lips curved into a gentle smile, portraying a friendly atmosphere.<br /> <br />“Hello… sir.”<br /> <br />“…Hello, Kohinata-san.”<br /> <br />We exchanged brief greetings.<br /> <br />Then, clearing her throat, the female clerk politely and somewhat theatrically asked, “May I take your order?”<br /> <br />As evident from the interaction, the female clerk were acquaintances.<br /> <br />“The usual, is that okay?”<br /> <br />“Yes, the Carbonara set with a hot coffee, please.”<br /> <br />“Certainly. Please wait a moment.”<br /> <br />Following the manual-like procedure, she bowed slightly and turned away with a courteous “Peck,” leaving me to reminisce about the encounter.<br /> <br />She whispers softly to me, “Break time is almost here, please wait for me.”<br /> <br />My body involuntarily trembled, but soon I lightly nodded my head, and the shop assistant left looking satisfied.<br /> <br />After some time, around ten minutes later, the food was brought out. I said “Itadakimasu” before happily starting to eat my meal. Then the shop assistant, Kohinata san, sat down across from me on her break.<br /> <br />“Hello again, onii-san.”<br /> <br />“Hello, Kohinata-san.”<br /> <br />“What were you looking around at so curiously?”<br /> <br />Seeing my awkward expression, blinked her eyes wide open.<br /> <br />“I was wondering if it’s really okay for me to just sit down here even though it’s during break.”<br /> <br />“The shop is empty right now, and the manager gave me permission, so it’s fine. Isn’t this normal?”<br /> <br />Kohinata san narrowed her eyes slightly and spoke in a calm voice.<br /> <br />She tilted her head as if to say “What’s wrong all of a sudden?”<br /> <br />It was true that talking with her during her breaks was normal, but that didn’t mean I was used to it.<br /> <br />Smiling wryly while stuffing my face with carbonara, Kohinata san casually changed the subject.<br /> <br />“Hey onii-san, do you have a love interest or anything?”<br /> <br />“Huh, why so suddenly?”<br /> <br />I made a troubled expression at her abrupt question.<br /> <br />“It’s just, onii-san, you don’t really…tell me much about yourself. I figured a popular guy like you must be doing well at school, so I wanted to hear the latest.”<br /> <br />I am careful to keep my private life separate from everything else about myself that I show to others.<br /> <br />I clearly separate my stylish going-out self from my unremarkable at-school self that doesn’t want to stand out.<br /> <br />Additionally…<br /> <br />(I can’t exactly say I keep a low profile at school because it’s too much trouble… Even though people probably think I’m popular.)<br /> <br />On top of the difficulty posed by people assuming I’m popular, I don’t like talking about school.<br /> <br />For those reasons, I avoided telling Kohinata san or even Nayu, whom I met online, about my school life.<br /> <br />“Latest…? Hmm.”<br /> <br />As I was thinking that I don’t have any such love interests or anything, I suddenly remembered something.<br /> <br />One of the girls in my class had been telling a story about getting picked up and helped by someone.<br /> <br />“You seem to have a good lead. Please tell me if you’d like.”<br /> <br />“Well, there is one thing… “<br /> <br />I told Kohinata san about how I heard one of the girls in my class got helped after being hit on.<br /> <br />Kohinata san nodded with great interest.<br /> <br />“I see…cute girls do tend to get hit on, don’t they.”<br /> <br />As if speaking from experience herself, she made a small, bitter expression.<br /> <br />“Actually, one of my friends apparently got hit on too. I heard the story at school today.”<br /> <br />“R-really…?”</p>



<p>My eyes opened wide, and I froze for a moment.<br /> <br />The reason was that right after Nayu, Kohinata san had started talking about “hearing a story from a friend about getting hit on” just like her.<br /> <br />“What’s with that surprised reaction?”<br /> <br />“No, I just didn’t really have an image of getting hit on as something that actually happens.”<br /> <br />Things like getting hit on are a common plot device in romantic fiction like shojo manga, but yesterday was the first time I had actually witnessed it happening with my own eyes.<br /> <br />So the idea that it was just an everyday occurrence came as a shock.<br /> <br />Staring straight at my eyes, she closed her mouth modestly.<br /> <br />“This is hard for me to say, but…onii-san, I wanted to hear about your own romantic endeavors.”<br /> <br />Apparently, she wasn’t satisfied with my story.<br /> <br />Although I gave her an openly reluctant look, she kept her round eyes fixed unwaveringly on me, showing no sign of looking away.<br /> <br />Her purple irises, reminiscent of iris flowers, refused to let me go.<br /> <br />(I didn’t really want to talk about this…but I guess I’ve got no choice.)<br /> <br />I shrugged and decided to go ahead and tell the story of saving a girl who was being hit on.<br /> <br />However, telling it plainly would be terribly uncool, so I carefully presented just the fact that I had saved her from being hit on, omitting the embarrassing details.<br /> <br />“That’s so great, onii-san!”<br /> <br />When I finished my account, her face lit up brightly, and she relaxed her mouth.<br /> <br />Her eyes seemed to shine faintly.<br /> <br />“It does take courage to save someone from being hit on, and there are few people who would actually step in to help. But that’s exactly what I wanted to hear! I hope you can meet that person again…!”<br /> <br />Unable to conceal her excitement, she nodded several times in a composed manner.<br /> <br />“Well, maybe, but…I don’t think I’ll ever see her again.”<br /> <br />(And meeting her again would just be embarrassing anyway, so I don’t want to.)<br /> <br />I smiled wryly and averted my gaze from Kohinata san.<br /> <br />“That’s not true! She probably wants to properly thank you.”<br /> <br />I was even more convinced that would never happen, but at this point,<br /> <br />I didn’t know that I would be meeting that girl again this weekend and receiving her thanks.<br /> </p>



 class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p> <br />Later that night, the time was already past 10 PM.<br /> <br />Sara Himekawa, having finished her bedtime preparations, was restless, tossing and turning in bed, unable to fall asleep.<br /> <br />She stared at the glow of her nightlight for a while.<br /> <br />Sara had a little secret – she couldn’t sleep without the nightlight on.<br /> <br />Of course, even with the nightlight on,<br /> <br />there was another reason she couldn’t sleep tonight…<br /> <br />(I guess I’m still hung up on not being able to properly thank him…)<br /> <br />Yes, Sara’s mind was full of thoughts about that one man.<br /> <br />She held her head in frustration over not having been able to properly thank the frightening person who saved her yesterday.<br /> <br />Not being able to thank the man who saved her from being hit on was weighing heavily on Sara’s conscientious mind.<br /> <br />It was understandable that Sara, with her dutiful personality, hadn’t conducted herself politely to the man who rescued her from being hit on.<br /> <br />Having been relentlessly harassed by the intimidating man right up until then, she had been shaking with fear and dread inside.<br /> <br />(And that man…he was so cool.)<br /> <br />Not only his behavior, but to be totally honest, his looks were just Sara’s type too…<br /> <br />So much so that he made her feel as if she was face to face with a fairytale prince riding on a white horse…<br /> <br />“Ahh, what am I thinking…”<br /> <br />Feeling the heat rising in her body,<br /> <br />she buried her flushed face in her pillow and fluttered her legs on the bed.<br /> <br />(Just because he saved me from an unexpected crisis, it doesn’t mean I’m so easygoing that I’d fall for the guy.)<br /> <br />She strongly reminded herself that she was the daughter of the Himekawa family.<br /> <br />She was concerned about him because she hadn’t been able to properly thank him, that was all.<br /> <br />With a small sigh, Sara started up the chat app on her phone to calm herself down.<br /> <br />Checking the screen, she already had several notifications waiting.<br /> <br />They were all from the same group chat<br /> </p>



<p>The one consisting of Sara, Yuna, and Rin, nicknamed the S-Class Beauties Chat.<br /> <br />Seeing the message contents, Sara’s eyes widened in surprise.<br /> <br />“Huh…?”<br /> <br />In disbelief, she unintentionally let out a confused voice.<br /> <br />Considering that Rin and Yuna don’t usually talk much about romance, Sara was shaken to see them actively discussing it now.<br /> <br />What was unfolding on Sara’s screen was this exchange:<br /> <br />[Listen up you two! So, at my part-time job, there’s this regular customer I’ve kinda had my eye on for a while now. And just like I thought, something happened that made me even more interested in him!]<br /> <br />[Ohh~ What happened, Rin?]<br /> <br />[It’s similar to Sara’s case – he saved a cute girl from being hit on!]<br /> <br />[Huh…hit on?]<br /> <br />[Why the surprise, Yuna?]<br /> <br />[Well, actually, the guy I’m interested in happened to mention a story about getting hit on today too!]<br /> <br />[Wow~ What a coincidence, Yuna!]<br /> <br />Their bright, cheerful conversation was visible on the screen.<br /> <br />Somehow feeling left out, Sara felt her chest tighten sharply.<br /> <br />Perhaps noticing that she had read the messages, Rin sent a reply to Sara.<br /> <br />[It’d be nice if you can properly thank him too if you meet that guy again…!]<br /> <br />[Yeah!]<br /> <br />Yuna’s reply came right after Rin’s.<br /> <br />Sara said [Thank you] and then put her phone away, deciding to just go to sleep now.<br /> <br />(It would be nice if I could meet that man again…)<br /> <br />While Sara was already half-resigned about it,<br /> <br />she didn’t yet know that she would be meeting him again this weekend.<br /> </p>



 class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" />



<p> <br />Well, it’s been a while since then.<br /> <br />And so, time passes quickly. The weekend had arrived.<br /> <br />Haruya could be found in an apparel shop adjoining a large commercial complex.<br /> <br />Dressed fashionably, Haruya had come to replenish his wardrobe.<br /> <br />(It’s clothing sale day today… I found out from a flyer. Luckily there aren’t as many customers as I expected.)<br /> <br />Living alone, he had to be frugal even with parental support,<br /> <br />Therefore, Haruya had no choice but to take advantage of this sale day.<br /> <br />He browsed the sale items, picking out several tops he liked.<br /> <br />Comparing them carefully to his wallet’s capacity, he selected what he could afford and headed to the checkout, when something happened.<br /> <br />A woman passing by Haruya’s side seemed unsteady carrying an armful of clothes, on the verge of stumbling over.<br /> <br />Seeing that she was in jeopardy of falling down at any moment, Haruya couldn’t look away.<br /> <br />And just as expected, the woman began to topple over.<br /> <br />Haruya rushed over and caught her slender shoulder.<br /> <br />“Are you okay?”<br /> <br />Haruya supports the woman by putting his hand on her slender shoulder.<br /> <br />He had helped purely on instinct seeing her about to fall, nothing more.<br /> <br />Just from the glimpse of her back, one could tell this woman gave off a charming air.<br /> <br />The white blouse and black vest she wore over it suited her, but were perhaps too tight, warping the buttons over her ample bust.<br /> <br />“…Oh, thank you.”<br /> <br />The woman peered up at Haruya’s face and spoke in a slightly quivering voice.<br /> <br />“…Huh?”<br /> <br />A few seconds passed.<br /> <br />Haruya blinked in disbelief.<br /> <br />The woman seemed just as taken aback, frozen stiff as she blinked several times.<br /> <br />(Could she be…no way.)<br /> <br />What crossed Haruya’s mind was the girl who had been hit on about a week ago.<br /> <br />Although her outfit was different, there was no mistaking that innocent face, sparkling eyes, and glossy hair.<br /> <br />Standing before Haruya’s eyes was without a doubt the same girl from back then.<br /> <br />“You’re…from that time…”<br /> <br />She was the first to speak.<br /> <br />Inwardly Haruya retorted “What a coincidence!” but it was questionable whether she would take it as a mere coincidence.<br /> <br />An overly contrived development, he worried about seeming like a stalker and tried to slip away from the situation.<br /> <br />(Okay…I’ll pretend I didn’t see anything.)<br /> <br />Smiling wryly, he started to turn his back and leave.<br /> <br />But Haruya felt his shirt hem grabbed by the girl.<br /> <br />“W-wait! Please let me…let me thank you properly…for last time too…”<br /> <br />“I think you have the wrong person.”<br /> <br />Saying that with a gentle smile, she looked bewildered for a moment but immediately turned serious and continued.<br /> <br />“Please…let me thank you…”<br /> <br />(She’s completely ignoring me!?)<br /> <br />Although he thought that, Haruya relented with a sigh.<br /> <br />“I don’t need thanks…I really didn’t do anything special.”</p>

<p>Just like with the previous incident of her being hit on, Haruya felt he hadn’t actually done anything in particular.<br /> <br />And for catching her when she was about to fall just now too, he had only supported her when she seemed unsteady.<br /> <br />There was even a possibility she could have kept her balance by herself, so Haruya may have overreacted.<br /> <br />But the beauty before him showed no signs of averting her moist, trembling eyes peering anxiously at Haruya.<br /> <br />Seeing that, Haruya understood.<br /> <br />(She’s worried about feeling indebted, huh.)<br /> <br />Admittedly, it wasn’t anything worth putting her in his debt, but…<br /> <br />She was, after all, quite a beauty.<br /> <br />It wouldn’t be surprising for some with impure thoughts to want to get involved with her given the chance.</p>




<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3YCdkAQ.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>So this was probably her way of settling things.<br /> <br />“…No good?”<br /> <br />Perhaps it was the coercive pressure of her imploring eyes, but Haruya caved.<br /> <br />“O-okay…I get it…”<br /> <br />“Thank you!”<br /> <br />When he nodded, her face lit up brightly and she flashed an enchanting smile.<br /> <br />“Well then, why don’t we both go buy our clothes first.”<br /> <br />“You really don’t have to worry about it so much.”<br /> <br />And so, transient as it was, Haruya ended up spending time with a beauty.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>What Haruya regretted was not turning down her request earlier, when they stopped by a family restaurant nearby.<br /> <br />(This is awkward… And my stomach hurts…)<br /> <br />Haruya had come with the girl to Cocomi,<br /> <br />a popular dining establishment with reasonable prices and numerous menu items loved by all generations.<br /> <br />But that is beside the point.<br /> <br />now before him on the table sat doria, pizza, fries, salad, and an awkward atmosphere filled with strange tension.<br /> <br />From the side they probably looked like a new couple on their first date.<br /> <br />“Um, th-thank you again for everything before and today too!”<br /> <br />She was the one to break the awkward silence.<br /> <br />Sitting up straight, she bowed her head formally with a somehow strained expression.<br /> <br />From her posture and tone of voice, one could strongly feel how tense she was.<br /> <br />(It just makes me more nervous when she’s the tense one…)<br /> <br />Perhaps embarrassed, Haruya started fidgeting with his bangs.<br /> <br />He was shy about her seeing his reddened face.<br /> <br />“Oh, no need, really…”<br /> <br />Honestly, his feelings hadn’t changed – he hadn’t done anything worth that much gratitude.<br /> <br />But saying so would presumably just make her repeat “That’s not true!” and deny it.<br /> <br />In other words, the conversation ended up at a standstill.<br /> <br />Therefore, Haruya decided to accept her gratitude sincerely.<br /> <br />However, whether it was because he wasn’t used to being thanked or for some other reason, his response seemed awkward.<br /> <br />Seeing Haruya like that, she smiled slightly.<br /> <br />“Hehe… it seems like you’re turning it into a question. But please, do accept my gratitude. And, as a token of thanks, feel free to eat as much as you want today.”<br /> <br />“No, this is more than enough already.”<br /> <br />Earlier, when Haruya tried to settle for just one item from the Doria menu, she insisted, saying, “Don’t hold back,” and as a result, Haruya ended up ordering not only the Doria but also pizza and potatoes.<br /> <br />By the way, the salad was ordered by her, perhaps out of concern for Haruya’s health.<br /> <br />Her chosen dish was Shrimp and Avocado Genovese Pasta.<br /> <br />It seemed like a popular choice among women, and Haruya couldn’t help but smile a bit.<br /> <br />“Well, if you say so. But feel free to eat without holding back.”<br /> <br />She seemed somewhat dissatisfied, but upon seeing Haruya’s awkward smile, she softened her expression a bit, seemingly understanding.<br /> <br />Having finished saying itadakimàsu, Haru noticed that someone was staring at him intently as he prepared to eat.<br /> <br />Presumably, the girl sitting across from him was waiting for him to taste the dishes laid out before them.<br /> <br />Unable to disappoint her expectant gaze, Haru decided to start with the Doria.<br /> <br />“…Delicious,” he remarked.<br /> <br />“Is that so? I’m glad,” she responded.<br /> <br />The taste of the Doria was creamy and pleasantly familiar.<br /> <br />There was no disappointment with the classic menu.<br /> <br />However, being watched so attentively made Haru nervous.<br /> <br />(Eating while being watched by a beautiful girl feels like a form of torture…)<br /> <br />Haru himself didn’t have much resistance to women.<br /> <br />Moreover, the girl sitting opposite him was a considerable beauty with an impressive figure.<br /> <br />Therefore, being observed by her, with her beauty and curvaceous body, was making him quite uneasy.<br /> <br />“…Um, well, you don’t have to hesitate. Please eat without holding back. Also, the dishes might get cold,”<br /> <br />Although he couldn’t express his true feelings, Haru’s genuine thoughts were more like, [Just eat it! It’s awkward!]<br /> <br />“Yeah, let’s dig in,”<br /> <br />As if she had been waiting for him to say that, Haru felt a slight discomfort.<br /> <br />However, that discomfort disappeared as soon as she began eating the pasta.<br /> <br />Her expression brightened, and her cheeks relaxed as she enjoyed the flavors.<br /> <br />Haru found himself captivated by her, but he shook his head and continued to eat.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After the meal, as he contemplated heading to the cashier, he noticed something.<br /> <br />She occasionally glanced at the special sweets menu,<br /> <br />specifically the Lemon Chiffon Cake promotion.<br /> <br />Probably due to it being a limited-time item, the menu was prominently displayed at each table.<br /> <br />Haru realized she might want to order it.<br /> <br />Most likely, she was giving him a hesitant look, gauging his reaction.<br /> <br />(…If you want to order it, just go ahead and ask.)<br /> <br />He thought this, but she was probably trying to be considerate.<br /> <br />Honestly, he was already full, but Haru decided to be considerate in return.<br /> <br />“…Excuse me. I’d like to order that limited-time item at the end. Is that okay?”<br /> <br />“Huh…”<br /> <br />Caught off guard, her eyes widened for a moment,<br /> <br />then quickly returned to normal.<br /> <br />“It’s okay… Well, then, I’ll order it too,”<br /> <br />she said, slightly lifting the corners of her mouth.<br /> <br />And so, the two of them ordered the limited-time dessert, the Lemon Chiffon Cake.<br /> <br />When it arrived, it looked luxurious, with white sauce and mint garnish. Haru was impressed<br /> <br />—it was his first time ordering dessert at a family restaurant, but it seemed high-quality.<br /> <br />Whether she felt the same or not, it wasn’t evident in her expression, but her eyes seemed to sparkle.<br /> <br />Without further delay, the two of them tasted the Lemon Chiffon Cake.<br /> <br />The refreshing lemon flavor and the sweetness of the cake spread in their mouths, creating an irresistible taste.<br /> <br />Haru inadvertently glanced at her, and she was melting with her cheeks flushed, displaying an enchanting expression.<br /> <br />While he didn’t have romantic feelings for her, a beautiful girl’s smile was always pleasing to the eye. It was a visual treat.<br /> <br />However, when their eyes met, her smile dimmed slightly.<br /> <br />For that reason, Haru felt a sense of disappointment.<br /> <br />“Um, is something wrong?”<br /> <br />She noticed his gaze and tilted her head slightly.<br /> <br />“N-nothing. I just thought the cake was delicious.”<br /> <br />Unable to say he was looking at her smile, Haruya brushed it off with an evasive comment.<br /> <br />For a moment, the girl looked puzzled at the flustered Haruya, but then seemed to remember something she had forgotten. She drew a sharp breath.<br /> <br />“Oh, um…thank you. For being considerate.”</p>


<p>Ignoring the silent Haruya, she dutifully continued.<br /> <br />“You went ahead and said you wanted a chiffon cake so I could order it more easily…right?”<br /> <br />“Wha-, what are you talking about?”<br /> <br />“Thank you…!”<br /> <br />Just when Haruya was about to deny it, it turned out she had seen right through him completely.<br /> <br />(I guess I still have a long way to go at being considerate without the other person noticing…)<br /> <br />He awkwardly averted his gaze from her oddly ardent stare.<br /> <br />To dispel the embarrassment, Haruya changed the subject. “By the way,”<br /> <br />“This cake is amazingly delicious.”<br /> <br />“I know, right? I’m pleasantly surprised too. Sweets can be hit-or-miss but this one is a definite hit.”<br /> <br />“Oh, unexpected.”<br /> <br />“Unexpected…? Why do you say that?”<br /> <br />she asked, not understanding his meaning.<br /> <br />“I mean, sorry if this is rude, but you seemed like someone without particular preferences for likes and dislikes…”<br /> <br />To Haruya, she appeared to have been brought up well.<br /> <br />Not because of that but, for some reason he was surprised that he had foods he disliked.<br /> <br />Then she giggled amusedly, covering her mouth with her hand.<br /> <br />“Heehee…what do you mean someone ‘without likes and dislikes’?”<br /> <br />As if to say does such a person exist.<br /> <br />“Things like panna cotta or almond tofu vary a lot depending on the shop. And I also dislike bitter stuff like liver or coffee.”<br /> <br />She said at somewhat high speed.<br /> <br />Looking closely, the corners of her eyes were downturned in a natural expression.<br /> <br />Somehow the tension seemed to have faded away and Haruya couldn’t help but relax his cheeks into a smile.<br /> <br />“Wha-what is it?”<br /> <br />“No, you suddenly got spirited talking about likes and dislikes so it just struck me as endearing.”<br /> <br />Oh, uh, you know… …… I’m sorry.<br /> <br />Embarrassed at being called out, she bowed her head and snuck occasional upward glances, seeming bashful.<br /> <br />“No no, there’s nothing to apologize about. Being able to firmly state your opinions is an important skill, I think.”<br /> <br />“….!”<br /> <br />It was an unexpected remark and her eyes betrayed her agitation.<br /> <br />“That’s…true, huh.”<br /> <br />With a tinge of self-deprecation, she muttered mostly to herself.<br /> <br />Then lowered her face again,<br /> <br />as if lacking the credentials to agree.<br /> <br />Seeing her like that, Haruya couldn’t help but break into a cold sweat.<br /> <br />(Uh oh…did I step on a landmine? No wait, this is awkward…what am I doing?)<br /> <br />He was filled with regret at having touched on a sensitive area he shouldn’t have.<br /> <br />Out of guilt for triggering her landmine and embarrassment and responsibility from the tension, for the rest of the day Haruya went out of his way to curry her favor, carrying her bags, consciously stepping onto the road side…<br /> <br />“Ah, let me hold your stuff.”<br /> <br />“Um, I can walk you partway.”<br /> <br />Thinking back on sucking up to her so shamelessly, Haruya shuddered.<br /> <br />(What the heck AM I doing? This must have weirded her out completely… Ugh I wanna cry.)</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>The next day before morning homeroom.<br /> <br />As usual when the S Class Beauties gathered, romance became the hot topic of conversation and they chatted animatedly.<br /> <br />As always, some classmates were eavesdropping, whispering quietly.<br /> <br />Naturally so,<br /> <br />The subject of conversation from S Class Beauty Sara Himekawa was profoundly romantic.<br /> <br />What Sara had shared with the other S Class Beauties – Yuna and Rin – was [I met and went to eat with the guy I couldn’t thank properly for saving me from getting hit on].<br /> <br />“Sara…that’s like totally fate! Amazing!”<br /> <br />“I really think it’s amazing.”<br /> <br />Having sympathized last week over her regret at not being able to thank the one who saved her from getting hit on, Yuna and Rin who had cheered Sara on [It’d be nice if you meet again] were now equally shocked that they met again so soon.<br /> <br />“I was definitely really surprised…but I’m so glad I got to thank him!”<br /> <br />“I’m happy for you, Sara.”<br /> <br />“Yeah…I’m really glad you got to thank him, Sara.”<br /> <br />Sara nodded happily at their replies.<br /> <br />“And that guy turned out to be such an awesome person, considerate and approachable too, a real gentleman!”<br /> <br />“Completely agree. But still, you took the bold step to invite him to eat, Sara… Gotta say, the more I hear the more I wanna meet him.”<br /> <br />“Hey! I reaaally wanna know which is better, my guy I’m interested in or Yuna’s!”<br /> <br />Then Rin and Yuna started probing deeper into what Sara had told them.<br /> <br />Seeing that, Sara’s face flushed faintly in embarrassment.<br /> <br />Noticing, Rin’s eyes narrowed slightly.<br /> <br />“Hope you get to see that guy you’ve got a crush on again, Sara!”<br /> <br />“Wha-… A crush or anything…it’s not like that!”<br /> <br />Sara immediately rebuffed Rin’s teasing and pursed her lips tightly, but her whole face had turned bright red.<br /> <br />Rin’s words had made her conscious of the guy.<br /> <br />Whether or not Sara was aware of it herself, her reaction from an onlooker’s perspective clearly signaled she harbored special feelings for someone.<br /> <br />She probably wanted Rin to stop going on about this subject, but her reactions were simply too cute that Rin seemed unable to resist the urge to poke fun.<br /> <br />“This embarrassed Sara is way too cute~. If a guy made me feel like that, wow, let’s totally double date! Oh wait, triple date including Yuna!”<br /> <br />“Th…that’s not how it is!”<br /> <br />“So you feel absolutely nothing for him then?”<br /> <br />“Well…I…”<br /> <br />At this point Sara puckered her lips and lowered her head.<br /> <br />“I…I do think he’s charming.”<br /> <br />An extremely tiny voice.<br /> <br />Not wanting her blushing face to be seen, she didn’t meet their eyes but her ears were bright red, impossible to hide.<br /> <br />Rin seemed about ready to burst from wanting to tease her even more, but Yuna who had been watching their exchange silently up to now spoke up.<br /> <br />“Rin, you’re putting Sara in a tough spot so let’s stop there.”<br /> <br />Rin frowned grumpily, going “Ehh~” as she shrugged exaggeratedly, but soon switched to a bright expression.<br /> <br />“Oh all right, that’s a good point. Sorry Sara.”<br /> <br />“Um, as long as you understand…that’s good.”<br /> <br />“Just this one thing though, can you tell us? Did you exchange contact info with that guy?”<br /> <br />“Eh…um…”<br /> <br />Looking perplexed at Rin’s question, Sara clenched one arm tightly, blinking uncertainly.<br /> <br />From that reaction Rin could guess that Sara had not gotten his contact info.<br /> <br />“Well you’ll surely meet again anyway so next time make sure to exchange contact info properly ‘kay, Sara?”<br /> <br />“Th…that’s not…”<br /> <br />Asked to choose between liking or disliking him,<br /> <br />she would pick “like” but still couldn’t decisively say she liked him romantically.<br /> <br />That was likely what Sara wanted to say, but Yuna interjected, cutting her off.<br /> <br />“Just one thing from me. Actually falling for someone doesn’t happen often so…Sara, don’t end up with regrets.”<br /> <br />“Yeah Sara, I’m rooting for you!”<br /> <br />Yuna and Rin were probably conscious of the omiai awaiting in Sara’s background when they said that.<br /> <br />In response to their words Sara tightly pursed her lips,<br /> <br />“That’s not what I meant. …… Really.”<br /> <br />and could only awkwardly look away with a quiet denial.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Now then, some classmates including Haruya were eavesdropping on the S Class Beauties’ talk.<br /> <br />Today too he couldn’t help overhearing in secret while pretending to sleep at his desk.<br /> <br />But this time, too, it was inevitable.<br /> <br />After last week, hearing a story from right by his seat again about an experience remarkably similar to his own, there was just no way he could tune it out.<br /> <br />(Meeting again after getting helped from getting hit on, that’s seriously got to be fate.)<br /> <br />And inwardly Haruya added.<br /> <br />(Then going to eat before parting ways…the more I hear, the more similar it sounds to what happened to me…)<br /> <br />With both last week’s events and this week’s…<br /> <br />Suddenly Haruya grew suspicious that the guy she was referring to was actually him.<br /> <br />…But no way, that would be too full of myself, Haruya rejected the possibility outright.<br /> <br />No matter how alike the stories sounded, the impression given of the guy she described was far too different from himself.<br /> <br />(I went and stepped on the landmine of her trauma, plus all that obvious sucking up I did after…)<br /> <br />Just recalling his pathetic behavior yesterday made Haruya want to retch.<br /> <br />Better stop thinking back on it.<br /> <br />It only made him feel more pathetic. He cursed his own uselessness.</p>

<p>According to Sara, the guy had created an approachable, friendly atmosphere.<br /> <br />With just that, the possibility of it being him was firmly denied.<br /> <br />The more Haruya listened raptly to Sara’s story, the more powerfully he realized what a pathetic man he himself was.<br /> <br />(Hang on…aren’t I too lame!? Totally the opposite of the cool guy she’s describing!)<br /> <br />Such vastly differing impressions despite the similar circumstances, it was nothing short of absurd.<br /> <br />Haruya honestly felt despondent at his sense of inferiority.<br /> <br />(Yeah, better just stop thinking about it…it only lowers my self-esteem.)<br /> <br />With no choice but to forcibly tell himself that, Haruya this time still failed to realize that the cool guy Sara spoke of referred to himself.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>


<p>After school.<br /> <br />While some students energetically rushed off to their club activities, and some lingered behind intending to study more, Haruya belonged to those who headed straight home once classes ended<br /> </p>



<p>Although today he was an exception. His feet carried him not down the stairs toward the entrance but up toward the rooftop.<br /> <br />Since the sunset looked so beautifully vibrant today he wanted to admire the scenery from the rooftop.<br /> <br />In principle the rooftop was forbidden entry and kept locked, but due to the school neglecting inspections the lock had broken leaving it open to access.<br /> <br />Of course that didn’t mean they now had permission to go in…<br /> <br />Having chanced upon the broken rooftop lock while wandering around campus, when Haruya felt like viewing the sunset’s splendor he would sneak up alone like this.<br /> <br />And so, the rooftop.<br /> <br />Pushing open the rusty door he was first wrapped in the warmth of sunlight.<br /> <br />Approaching the railings to better take in the scenic view, Haruya removed his glasses and brushed back his hair that had grown to fringe his eyes.<br /> <br />The sea.<br /> <br />Spreading endlessly before Haruya’s vision was the magnificently beautiful sea, sparkling in the sunset’s reflected radiance. He lost himself admiring the campus scenery illuminated gloriously by the evening light.<br /> <br />Breathing in the crisp air, Haruya had just begun savoring the sights when…<br /> <br />His solitary time was abruptly interrupted in less than a few minutes.<br /> <br />“So…pretty.”<br /> <br />The familiar voice suddenly came from behind, startling him into glancing back.<br /> <br />…Seeing who it was, he couldn’t find any words.<br /> <br />Blinking blankly several times, but clearly no mistake.<br /> <br />A slender waist and fleshy figure, glossy hair.<br /> <br />Her girlish innocence still lingered while exuding a refined air.<br /> <br />Haruya doubted his eyes at first.<br /> <br />The girl standing there was the beauty he had encountered last weekend, then met again the day before yesterday…<br /> <br />She too seemed frozen in surprise, both silently facing each other for a few seconds before she spoke first.<br /> <br />“I’m…shocked.”<br /> <br />Blinking widely her round eyes several times she continued.<br /> <br />“So we…go to the same high school.”<br /> <br />Haruya was equally astonished at this.<br /> <br />But the bigger reason for Haruya’s speechless bewilderment was –<br /> <br />If they were in the same high school, Haruya had no choice but to come to this conclusion.<br /> <br />(No way, we’re…in the same class!? Ahaha…)<br /> <br />His thoughts turned to the female classmate talking about an experience resembling his own.<br /> <br />Getting hit on, then meeting again…moreover her voice sounded similar too.<br /> <br />With so much evidence stacking up, certainty would naturally follow.<br /> <br />(No…that’s crazy.)<br /> <br />Naturally he was shocked at his own obliviousness and ignorance, but being utterly indifferent to matters uninteresting or unrelated to himself couldn’t be helped.<br /> <br />But even more than that, Haruya was bursting to retort –<br /> <br />(There’s no way I’m that cool a guy! I didn’t save her from getting hit on in some cool way, I made things awkward afterwards didn’t I!?)<br /> <br />What on earth was going on here.<br /> <br />Haruya smiled wryly.<br /> <br />Apparently some misunderstanding about Haruya had arisen between him and her.<br /> <br />At the very least, he couldn’t possibly evaluate himself as the cool character she had depicted to the class.<br /> <br />Unable to immediately understand what was going on, Haru refrained from questioning her directly.<br /> <br />Doing so would be akin to confessing that they were classmates.<br /> <br />Moreover, she was already known as a top-tier beauty in the class. Revealing that he was her classmate would only complicate things.<br /> <br />If he were to casually say, “Actually, the person you guys talking about… is a classmate! Teehee♡,” it would likely lead to unnecessary complications.<br /> <br />Just the thought of it sent shivers down his spine.<br /> <br />Right now there were two key points Haruya had to be mindful of here and now:<br /> <br />[Absolutely can’t let her realize my identity]<br /> <br />[Have to lower her overblown impression of me]<br /> <br />These are the two things that Haruya has to do.<br /> <br />Obviously the former was to avoid drawing attention in class if this got out.<br /> <br />As for the latter, he had to diminish her highly embellished…no, downright fabricated…opinion of Haruya, in order to eliminate her interest in him.<br /> <br />Without doing that, she likely wouldn’t realize her idealized image of Haruya was mistaken.<br /> <br />(I felt like I desperately needed her to know that I’m not as cool as I think, for my heart to be at peace. )<br /> <br />“Uh, um, I know this must be surprising but please don’t be too shocked.”<br /> <br />Lost in thought, Haruya realized she had called out to him.<br /> <br />“Huh… ah, sorry.”<br /> <br />“No, I… I’m just really surprised, you know…”<br /> <br />As he averted his gaze from her interested eyes, she changed the subject and started a new conversation.<br /> <br />“The sunset here is so beautiful.”<br /> <br />However, she continued with a preamble.<br /> <br />“But isn’t this place supposed to be off-limits?”<br /> <br />Maybe because she has a serious personality, she narrowed her eyes slightly.<br /> <br />“Well, the lock was broken, so… aha ha.”<br /> <br />“So that doesn’t mean you can just enter someplace that’s prohibited, right?”<br /> <br />(Yes, you’re right. Sorry.)<br /> <br />While apologizing inwardly, Haruya was at a loss for words because she was correct.<br /> <br />However, Haru couldn’t help but think, [You’re saying that?] about the girl who was present with him.<br /> <br />Whether it showed on his face or not, she began to nervously explain herself.<br /> <br />“I, um… T-today, I was feeling a bit unsettled, so I took a stroll around the school. That’s when I witnessed the rooftop being open.”<br /> <br />“I see.”<br /> <br />“However, if the rooftop’s lock is broken, it needs to be reported, right?”<br /> <br />She placed a hand on her chin, deep in thought.<br /> <br />The report she mentioned undoubtedly meant informing the school.<br /> <br />While her actions were undoubtedly correct as a student, Haru had a reason he couldn’t just overlook.<br /> <br />If she reports this, he won’t be able to come here anymore.<br /> <br />In other words, it would mean he can no longer enjoy this beautiful sunset in this place.<br /> <br />Haruya started to panic.<br /> <br />Before he realized it, his mouth opened on its own.<br /> <br />“Um, so, I’ll do anything within my ability, so please keep this a secret…”<br /> <br />He pleaded with his hands together.<br /> <br />His words spilled out from the regret he felt about losing the chance to see this scenery.<br /> <br />Perhaps reacting to his “anything” offer, her shoulders shook slightly.<br /> <br />Then, after a short pause, she acted somehow bashful, wavering her eyes.<br /> <br />Finally making up her mind, she tightly closed her mouth, then timidly opened it to speak.<br /> <br />“Then… I have just one request, if that’s okay?”<br /> <br />She appealed to him with a lonely expression that provoked his protective instinct.<br /> <br />Haruya immediately wanted to refuse since this smelled like trouble, but he couldn’t go back on his word.<br /> <br />He was desperate to defend his ability to see the rooftop scenery at all costs.</p>


<p>“Your request is?”<br /> <br />At his words, she nervously opened her mouth.<br /> <br />“Um… can we exchange contact information?”<br /> <br />“Huh…”<br /> <br />Haruya unintentionally let out a surprised voice at her bold demand.<br /> <br />Her wish was such a cheap favor.<br /> <br />Plus, exchanging contacts would be quite convenient for him in dispelling the fabricated image others had made of him, and making her realize he’s not as amazing as the rumors say.<br /> <br />“No problem at all.”<br /> <br />“Phew… thank goodness, thanks so much!”<br /> <br />When he said that, she let out a relieved sigh, eyes downturned.<br /> <br />They promptly pulled out their phones to exchange info. But as they did so, Haruya noticed something and panicked, saying, “Wait a moment!” to stop her.<br /> <br />The reason he panicked was simple and clear.<br /> <br />His chat app username was “Akasaki Haruya” – his real name.<br /> <br />Now that she knows they go to the same high school, if his real name gets exposed, his identity could also be revealed.<br /> <br />In a hurry, he changed his username to “Asai Yuu,” the name of a certain protagonist from some girls’ comic.<br /> <br />She tilted her head curiously at his flustered state, but they successfully exchanged contacts.<br /> <br />“Asai Yuu… right?”<br /> <br />“Y-Yeah…”<br /> <br />Haruya felt a little guilty about using a fake name. Then her next words turned his mind completely blank.<br /> <br />“Can I ask which class you’re in too… is that alright?”<br /> <br />“Um, my class is…”<br /> <br />And then he realized.<br /> <br />(Even if I bs my way through my name, I can’t do the same for my class…)<br /> <br />Unpleasant sweat formed on his brow.<br /> <br />No matter what random thing he said, she could easily uncover the truth if they went to the same school.<br /> <br />So once again, he agonized over what the best course of action was.<br /> <br />(Well… to lower people’s evaluation of me, giving a random answer might be the optimal solution.)<br /> <br />His original goal was, first of all, to not stand out, and secondly, to have her know that he’s not as amazing as rumored.<br /> <br />Therefore, he decided to give her a random reply to her question.<br /> <br />“I’m in Class 1-I.”<br /> <br />“Class I? …Pfft, what are you saying?”<br /> <br />She giggled happily.<br /> <br />The freshman classes at his school were divided into eight from A to H.<br /> <br />So of course, there was no such thing as Class I. That’s why he gave a random response, but…<br /> <br />“Ahaha, saying Class I with such a straight face… you really are a unique person.”<br /> <br />She had a gentle smile, but Haruya was sure it was just a perfunctory one. No doubt about it.<br /> <br />“Sorry… you don’t have to tell me if you don’t want to.”<br /> <br />With a nuance like “If you don’t want to say your class, you don’t have to,” she peered into his eyes.<br /> <br />“…Yes, there are some circumstances I’d rather not mention. Sorry.”<br /> <br />He honestly bowed his head, feeling guilty about lying.<br /> <br />Then, as he awkwardly scratched the back of his head, she smiled contentedly.<br /> <br />“What circumstances…? But you don’t need to apologize so much. Nice to meet you properly, Asai-san.”<br /> <br />“Ah, likewise…”<br /> <br />After greeting each other, she seemed to realize something.<br /> <br />“Since I’m a first year, you can drop the formal speech with me…”<br /> <br />Sara said, glancing up at him. But Haruya brought his hand to his chin, pondering what the best course of action was.<br /> <br />(What’s the right answer here? Should I keep using polite speech, or shift to casual? The closest distance will be best for making her think I’m not an amazing guy, probably.)<br /> <br />Having decided that, he said in seriousness –<br /> <br />“Got it, nice to meet ya… Sara…”<br /> <br />He was trying to act overly familiar.<br /> <br />(But since I had no experience addressing girls by their first names, an awkward discomfort came out. Dammit, stupid me.)</p>

<p>(But, this is more embarrassing than I thought. What am I doing?)<br /> <br />Thinking that, as he looked at Sara, she was holding her fists tightly in front of her chest, her round eyes focused on Haruya.<br /> <br />And, when she noticed Haruya’s gaze, Sara said,<br /> <br />“Yes, please. …Asai-san,”<br /> <br />lowering her face. It seemed like the effect was excellent.<br /> <br />(she’s pulling away, pulling away… the effect seems to be working. But that’s fine. Yes, continue lowering the favorability. If she lose interest, I won’t become a topic in the class!)<br /> <br />Haruya harboring an evil grin internally, However, Sara had her own thoughts:<br /> <br />(He called me by my name… by my name. And not telling me his class, it must be part of the game, trying to entertain me…)<br /> <br />he was quite a unique person, Sara thought, as she unconsciously felt her heart pounding. Is he really thinking about me this much?<br /> <br />But, in this way, the misunderstandings between the two were not known to either.<br /> <br />In fact, Haruya was trying to lower Sara’s favorability.<br /> <br />However, from Sara’s perspective, it was interpreted in a positive light.<br /> <br />They were both unaware of each other’s intentions.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>



<p>That night.<br /> <br />Since exchanging contact information with Haruya, Sara had been staring at her phone screen, lying on her bed alone, in agony. On the screen was the contact information for “Asai Yuu.”<br /> <br />“Oh… why did I do something so bold?”<br /> <br />Restless, Sara had been pressing her face against the pillow and writhing in discomfort for a while.<br /> <br />Even so, Sara couldn’t help but look back on the time she spent with Haruya.<br /> <br />(I never thought that person… Asai-san would be in the same high school…)<br /> <br />Meeting the person who helped her again, only to find out they attended the same high school…<br /> <br />She hadn’t told Rin and Yuna about it yet, but she could easily imagine their reactions.<br /> <br />(…It’s like something out of a shoujo manga.)<br /> <br />Although she couldn’t read many of them,<br /> <br />Sara felt this way about shoujo manga.<br /> <br />Once again, she felt like she was in the midst of fate.<br /> <br />Because of that feeling of destiny, she was becoming unexpectedly passionate.<br /> <br />Sara opened Haruya’s private chat and started to ponder whether to send a message.<br /> <br />“…I should probably at least greet him.”<br /> <br />Typing and erasing messages repeatedly, Sara sighed and groaned.<br /> <br />“At times like this, formal greetings aren’t preferred, right?… But being too simple is also dull. Maybe I should use stamps? No, but—”<br /> <br />Unable to reach a conclusion, Sara let out a deep sigh.<br /> <br />“Oh…”<br /> <br />She sighed deeply and mumbled to herself, “It’s like this during these times. It’s not good to be too formal, right? But not too simple either. Is it okay to use stamps? No, but—”<br /> <br />Sara couldn’t find a solution and sighed deeply.<br /> <br />So deep that, as if telling herself, Sara muttered:<br /> <br />(…It’s, it’s not like I like him. I just haven’t properly thanked Asai-san.)<br /> <br />—It’s okay, it’s okay.<br /> <br />Repeatedly telling herself, Sara sent a message to Haruya.<br /> <br />After sending it, to prevent herself from deleting the message due to embarrassment, Sara turned off her phone in a rush.<br /> <br />Although Sara denied having romantic feelings, there was an unconscious girl struggling with love beneath the surface.</p>
