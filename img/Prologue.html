<h3>Inteval: Now This Is a Proper Thank You for the Meal</h3>

<p>“——and you know what, Yuzuki-chan seen from the best seat looks so adorable that mere words like ‘angel’ or ‘goddess’ just don’t do her justice. Is it already a myth? Scripture? The era itself?”</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>
<p>“The theme for that talk segment was ‘My Memorable Dish.’ Guess what Yuzuki-chan said? Here’s a hint, it’s Yuzuki-chan’s favorite food.”</p>
<p>“Well, maybe something like a pork bowl?”</p>
<p>“There’s no way Yuzuki-chan would choose a menu fit for a burnt-out salaryman. Remember this well. Yuzuki-chan’s favorite food is galette. Oh, a galette is a French dish made from buckwheat flour. Yuzuki-chan apparently had a friend make her galettes the other day. She was so excited, saying they were so delicious that she couldn’t eat the ones from stores anymore.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>

<p>From across the table, while wolfing down my bento, I nodded along as I listened to the conversational BGM initiated by my homeroom teacher.</p>

<p>Late May. School. Student Guidance Room.</p>
<p>This was the fifth consecutive day I’d been summoned during lunch break.</p>
<p>Mikami-sensei seemed to have no acquaintances who had the same interests other than me, so she kept on sharing her one-sided impressions about the recent fan meeting.</p>
<p>Even as we reached the fifth day, Friday, her enthusiasm showed no signs of waning.</p>
<p>The prospect of being called in again next week was frankly a hassle, so I decided it was time to engage in a proper conversation.</p>

<p>“How was the mini-live concert?”</p>
<p>“Right, that!”</p>

<p>As if to say, ‘I’ve been waiting for this’, she brings her chair closer to me.</p>

<p>“I, member number 000005, declare. The mini-live concert the other day was undoubtedly the highest quality ever! It was just amazing. I could talk about each song for five hours.”</p>
<p>“…How many songs were there again?”</p>
<p>“It was a mini live. Six songs.”</p>

<p>That’s at least thirty hours.</p>
<p>Lunch break is fifty minutes, so by simple calculation, that’s thirty-six days’ worth of content.</p>

<p>“For now, please only give me a one-minute summary.”</p>

<p>With only three minutes left until the end of lunch break, I brace myself and swallow the last of my meal.</p>
<p>Thank you for the meal.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot I want to say, but Yuzuki-chan was the best.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it always like that?”</p>
<p>“No. There were some risky moments at the previous live, so I was honestly worried about her.”</p>

<p>Mikami-sensei lowered her tone and smiled slightly.</p>

<p>“But it seems my worries were unfounded. This time, Yuzuki-chan looked genuinely happy, almost like a different person. Not that she had a fake smile before, but she really seemed to enjoy the moment—it almost made me cry.”</p>

<p>Her tone was gentle, as if she were comforting a student.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she will face various difficulties from now on, but I believe that Yuzuki-chan can overcome them. It’s a fan’s duty to quietly watch over and support their favorite.”</p>

<p>The origin of the word ‘fan’ is said to be ‘Fanatic’, which means ‘an enthusiastic person, a devotee.’</p>
<p>They will continue to follow the light known as Arisu Yuzuki wherever they go.</p>
<p>Entrusted with the wishes, hopes, and dreams of people, Yuzuki will throw herself into a lonely battle.</p>
<p>——If there comes a time when Yuzuki wants to rest her wings, I sincerely wish I could be there to support her.</p>

<p>Well, it seems that Mikami-sensei’s story has come to a pause, so maybe it’s time for me to leave.</p>
<p>I wrapped my lunchbox in a napkin and stood up.</p>

<p>“I’ll head back to the classroom first. Sensei, you’ll be late if you don’t hurry.”</p>

<p>The first class in the afternoon is modern literature, taught by Mikami-sensei.</p>
<p>However, she probably plans to return to the staff room first since she came to the student guidance room empty-handed.</p>

<p>“Well then, I’ll be excusing myself.”</p>
<p>“…Mamori-kun, thank you.”</p>

<p>Just before the door closed, I thought I heard words of gratitude.</p>
<p>Hmm, what for, I wonder—I pretended I didn’t hear it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>

<p>Once the homeroom is over at the end of the day, the classroom becomes lively all at once.</p>
<p>Classmates gather around the teacher’s desk and on the balcony, making plans for the weekend.</p>

<p>“Now, shall we go to the library to review for the midterm test?”</p>

<p>My friend, turning around from the seat in front, made a face as if he had just chugged a bitter drink.</p>

<p>“Get lost, I’ve got a lot to prepare for my date tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Thanks to the after-school study sessions, it seemed that Hozumi had somehow managed to avoid failing.</p>
<p>He had a ‘reward’ date with his girlfriend tomorrow thanks to that.</p>

<p>“Hmph, don’t come crying to me when the final exams come around.”</p>

<p>Just like last year, he’ll come begging on his knees as soon as July starts.</p>
<p>If he asks me to tutor him again, I’ll turn him down twice.</p>
<p>After looking at me intently, Hozumi suddenly asked.</p>

<p>“You… you seemed pretty down just a while ago, but now you seem to be in high spirits. Something good happened?”</p>
<p>“Something’s about to. See you next week.”</p>
<p>“O-oh…about to?”</p>

<p>Passing a puzzled Hozumi, I left the classroom.</p>
<p>With the midterm exams over and the final exams yet to be announced, the atmosphere in the school is relaxed.</p>
<p>As I approach the student entrance on the first floor, the noise grows louder, and the moment I step out of the school gates, a brown-haired gal jumps out from the side.</p>

<p>“Ah, Suzu, what a coincidence!”</p>
<p>“…No, you were totally lying in wait.”</p>
<p>“Ehehe, well yeah. Let’s walk home together.”</p>

<p>Rika and I leave the school side by side.</p>
<p>This might be the first time we’ve walked home together since starting high school.</p>

<p>“Working again today?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’ve got to earn as much as I can before summer break. Oh, don’t worry. I’ll make sure to take care of everything at Suzu’s place every day during the vacation!”</p>

<p>Rika proudly thumped her chest.</p>
<p>Hmm, I wonder if there’s any way to avoid this.</p>
<p>Since becoming a high school student, Rika has been going all out in everything——playing, working.</p>
<p>As her childhood friend, I wish she would put more effort into her studies too.</p>
<p>By the way, I wonder what she plans to do after graduation.</p>

<p>“Does Rika have something she wants to do in the future?”</p>
<p>“Something I want to do…”</p>

<p>Rika puts her hand to her chin and ponders, ‘Hmm.’</p>

<p>“…Maybe I want to have a meal with Arisu Yuzuki again.”</p>

<p>That was unexpected.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn’t think the atmosphere was very good when the three of us had okonomiyaki together.</p>

<p>“When I think about it, I don’t really know anything about her. I’d like to have a proper conversation with her next time. Ah, of course I won’t insist if Suzu wants to keep me all to himself!”</p>

<p>With a wink that wasn’t quite a wink, Rika gave a thumbs up.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the answer I was expecting, but I was somehow moved to see that my childhood friend, who was like a troublesome little sister, had unknowingly become mature.</p>
<p>As I waited for the pedestrian crossing light to turn red, my eyes landed on the corner Favoma.</p>
<p>I suddenly remembered a certain day after school.</p>

<p>“Since we’re here, why not buy some FavoChick to take home?”</p>

<p>Rika’s eyes sparkled like a sky full of stars, but they quickly clouded over like an overcast sky.</p>

<p>“There’s a new menu tasting at the store today… I need to keep my stomach empty for that…”</p>

<p>Looks like they’re rolling out another fair.</p>
<p>That means a large shipment of Dad’s Selection recommended ingredients will arrive soon enough.</p>
<p>I need to organize our fridge.</p>

<p>“Then, some other time.”</p>
<p>“It’s a promise? You have to keep it!”</p>

<p>FavoChick is certainly delicious, but was she that eager to eat it?</p>
<p>Rika said she was heading straight to her part-time job, so we parted ways at the intersection.</p>

<p>I stopped by the nearby supermarket to buy ingredients for dinner.</p>
<p>I only planned to buy what was missing, but various dishes I wanted to make for her kept popping into my mind as I wandered around the store, so I ended up with bags in both hands.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the apartment, someone was just coming out of the entrance. They didn’t seem to be from a moving company, but maybe they came to help someone since they were wearing overalls.</p>

<p>I nodded in greeting as I passed by and took the elevator to the eighth floor.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the elevator, I saw a figure at the far end of the hallway.</p>

<p>——Suppressing my excited feelings, I slowly approached her.</p>
<p>As I came up in front of room 808, the girl seemed to notice my presence.</p>
<p>Her face brightened up rapidly just like the rising morning sun.</p>

<p>“Suzufumi!”</p>
<p>“…I guess you’re living here again starting today?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but feel how insincere I sounded.</p>
<p>How long had I been looking forward to this day?</p>

<p>Yuzuki seemed to see right through me, grinning the whole time.</p>

<p>“I’m home, Suzufumi.”</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Yuzuki.”</p>

<p>Sasaki Yuzuki has returned as my neighbor.</p>
<p>It seems that after the fan meeting, she contacted the owner and had the cancellation of her apartment lease revoked.</p>
<p>Some of the furniture had been removed, so she said she would get new ones.</p>
<p>Apparently, the person I had passed by earlier was a staff member from her office.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a celebration for the fan meeting tonight.” (Suzufumi)</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m looking forward to it.” (Yuzuki)</p>

<p>Her straightforward words of anticipation make my heart leap with excitement.</p>
<p>I want to continue cooking for Sasaki Yuzuki, to bring her comfort and satisfaction.</p>
<p>To become the energy for her idol activities——I want to continue cooking for Yuzuki from now on.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>


<p>In front of the numerous dishes crammed onto the table, Yuzuki was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>“This is a bit… too much…”</p>
<p>“Honestly, I do think I went overboard.”</p>

<p>The venue for the fan meeting celebration was the Mamori family’s living room.</p>
<p>Since all the dishes couldn’t fit on the table, a folding table was also brought out from the closet.</p>
<p>The menu is a mix of Japanese and Western dishes: chicken katsu, fried shrimp, teriyaki chicken, seabream sashimi, mixed rice, chige soup, Caesar salad, and so on.</p>
<p>For dessert, there’s a crepe filled with plenty of cream.</p>

<p>“By the way, there’s also potage, cold shabu-shabu, and fruit punch in the fridge.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m trying to say! The quantity!”</p>

<p>But I’ve been really looking forward to it.</p>
<p>While Yuzuki was away, my ‘list of foods I want to feed her’ just kept growing exponentially.</p>
<p>Although there were many dishes, I made each portion a bit smaller to compensate for the variety.</p>

<p>“…You can eat everything if you want to.”</p>

<p>As I enthusiastically gave a thumbs up, Yuzuki looked utterly dismayed beside me.</p>

<p>“…I mean, I never even said anything about eating in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>An uneasy atmosphere enveloped us.</p>

<p>“You said, ‘I’m looking forward to to the celebration’ earlier.”</p>
<p>“I’m pretty sure I didn’t mention anything about a meal though.”</p>
<p>“And the other night, you also said, ‘The place where Sasaki Yuzuki belongs is here.’ “</p>
<p>“That doesn’t necessarily mean eating…”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait. That obviously means ‘I dedicate my heart and stomach to you!’ “</p>
<p>“My heart and my stomach… Th-That’s almost like a proposal!”</p>

<p>At that moment, Yuzuki’s face turned bright red, and she distanced herself from me.</p>

<p>“Just so you know, I haven’t fallen for you because of your cooking or anything! That day was just… a one-night mistake…!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s face turns even redder as she self-destructs with those ambiguous words.</p>

<p>“Suzufumi, aren’t you the one who became my fan? You wanted to see my heroic figure at the fan meeting, right? The stream is exclusive to fan club members, and the archive ends tomorrow, you know?”</p>
<p>“Too bad. I’ve heard all about it from the ultimate idol-otaku—I understand everything as if I were there!”</p>

<p>Our gazes fiercely clash.</p>

<p>“The food will get cold if we keep this up.”</p>
<p>“That’s… it can’t be helped…”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you’ll be busy with work from tomorrow? You’re starting a regular show soon, right? We might not have a chance to eat leisurely for a while.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“These wrapped crepes are really well-made, though. I prepared a lot of them because I heard they’re Yuzuki’s favorite…”</p>
<p>“Guu…”</p>

<p>A pinpoint attack on appetite and guilt——an efficient assault if I do say so myself.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’ll give up if you really won’t eat them. I’ll just have a lonely celebration by myself…”</p>
<p>“Fine! If you want me to eat them, I’ll eat them!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki bites her lip hard and glares at me with a sharp and intimidating gaze like a noble princess knight caught by a demon—just like the first time I served her a pork bowl.</p>

<p>I seated Yuzuki in front of the low table and sat opposite her.</p>
<p>As we looked over the crowded table of food, Yuzuki’s eyes gradually shifted to anticipation.</p>
<p>Eventually, we both put our hands together.</p>

<p>” “Itadakimasu!!” “</p>

<p>Yuzuki reached for her meal with her chopsticks, fork, knife, and spoon.</p>
<p>My heart felt full as I watched Yuzuki smiling while she stuffed her cheeks with food.</p>
<p>Even though we live next door to each other, we are two very different people.</p>
<p>One is a popular idol, and the other is just an ordinary high school boy.</p>
<p>Yet now, we are sharing the same dining table.</p>
<p>——From now on, I want to stay close to Yuzuki, and I strongly wish to become Yuzuki’s number one.</p>

<p>“Phew… That was delicious…”</p>

<p>The full course seemed to be nothing more than an appetizer in front of Yuzuki who had removed her limiter.</p>
<p>The large plates and bowls were all completely empty.</p>

<p>I put the last piece of food on the table, a wrapped crepe, into my mouth.</p>
<p>Cream oozed out as I bit into it.</p>
<p>Yeah, the tartness of the strawberries and the fresh cream’s subtle sweetness are a perfect match, delicious.</p>
<p>Yuzuki took the chocolate banana and matcha ones, so maybe I’ll make them again for tomorrow’s snack.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I felt an intense.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Yuzuki had come up next to me while staring intently at my cheek.</p>

<p>“…You said it was okay for me to eat everything…”</p>
<p>“Yuzuki? What’s wro──”</p>

<img16

<p>Yuzuki’s lips gently touched my cheek.</p>
<p>In front of the astonished me, Yuzuki licked her lips. There was whipped cream at the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p>“Now this is a proper thank you for the meal.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki smiles teasingly.</p>
<p>I touched the peach-colored warmth on my cheek with my fingertips.</p>

<p>“…That just now…”</p>
<p>“I told you, it’s a ‘thank you for the meal’!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki claps her hands together and looks up at me with upturned eyes.</p>

<p>Which one is it?</p>
<p>——Was it just her being a glutton, or was it an expression of affection for me disguised as a meal?</p>

<p>My head spins rapidly, and without being able to organize my thoughts, I force myself to reach a ‘believable’ conclusion.</p>

<p>“S-so that’s it! This is all a strategy to make me fall as a fan! Man, that was close! I almost fell right into your trap!”</p>

<p>I rattle off words in an excuse-like tone.</p>
<p>That’s right. Yuzuki declared to me that she aims to stand at the top as an idol.</p>
<p>It’s really hard to believe such a future star would harbor romantic feelings for an ordinary citizen like me.</p>

<p>“…Suzufumi you idiot.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki pouted her lips and looked down.</p>

<p>“…Uh…”</p>

<p>As I hesitated whether to speak or not, Yuzuki slowly raised her face. Her amber eyes were fixed straight on me.</p>
<p>Eventually, as she blinked, her expression changed to one filled with determination.</p>

<p>“I’ve decided. I’ll make Suzufumi my top ota!”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>

<p>What on earth is she talking about all of a sudden?</p>

<p>Top Ota (トップオタ, Toppu ota).</p>
<p>Among the numerous fans, it refers to the one who literally reigns at the top, showing the utmost passion for their idol.</p>
<p>Yuzuki rattles on and speaks rapidly as if carried away by her own momentum.</p>

<p>“Looking back, making you a ‘fan’ as a goal was too lukewarm for me. From now on, I’ll be so aggressive that my previous approach will seem timid by comparison. Be prepared. Suzufumi, I’ll make you into a top ota that I can proudly show off anywhere!”</p>

<p>Her challenging smile, tinged with a hint of arrogance, brimmed with confidence.</p>
<p>Yet, far from being surprised, instead of being shocked, I felt an odd sense of reassurance.</p>
<p>…Interesting. That’s so Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Then I’ll make Yuzuki fall for my cooking completely. Not just daily, but every meal, she’ll be begging for it!”</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll make Yuzuki fall for me completely with my cooking next time. You’ll be begging for it not just every day, but every meal!”</p>

<p>I crossed my arms and declared confidently.</p>

<p>“I won’t hold back either. It’s not just three meals a day. Snacks, afternoon tea, and even late-night meals, everything is on the table. As long as I’m Yuzuki’s neighbor, don’t think you can escape from my cooking!”</p>
<p>“Bring it on. I absolutely won’t fall for Suzufumi’s guilty pleasure meals!”</p>

<p>We stared at each other down, eyes locked in a glare.</p>
<p>After a brief interval, our love-food battle moves on to a new stage.</p>
