<h3>Chapter 25 &#8211; The Neat and Tidy Idol Who Fled!</h3>

<div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No good. I can't get a hold of Ayane-chan at all.] (Nana)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I understand.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I receive the report from Kurumizaka-san and sigh unconsciously.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm lying on my bed in a lethargic state, and I throw my limbs out and look up at the ceiling.</div><div class="calibre3">"Haaa ...... seriously?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">After Kiyokawa logged out, I told the situation to Kurumizaka-san and Rinka who logged in.</div><div class="calibre3">I told them that I and Kiyokawa were gaming friends.</div><div class="calibre3">Neither of them asked me about the details of our conversation.</div><div class="calibre3">They probably didn't know what to do either.</div><div class="calibre3">When the four of us spent our lunch break together, Kiyokawa was embarrassed as she confided in us she had a crush on her gaming friend. That must have stuck in her mind.</div><div class="calibre3">After logging out of the Black Plains, the three of us decided to contact Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">We had to talk to her anyway.</div><div class="calibre3">But Kiyokawa didn't respond at all.</div><div class="calibre3">If it was just me being ignored, I can understand it, but even Kurumizaka-san and Rinka were so.</div><div class="calibre3">She had been thoroughly cut off from all contact.</div><div class="calibre3">"If this keeps on like this....... nothing good will happen." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">To be honest, I neither know what to do nor say.</div><div class="calibre3">It was too abrupt.</div><div class="calibre3">No, I've had many chances to notice it before.</div><div class="calibre3">In fact, I feel rather dumb that I hadn't noticed it before.</div><div class="calibre3">But it's inevitable, I suppose.</div><div class="calibre3">How could I possibly didn't imagine that my friend in the game would be a neat and tidy idol?</div><div class="calibre3">Moreover, I've already had an experience where my wife in the game was a cool idol.</div><div class="calibre3">Never even crossed in my imagination that such a divine miracle would happen in a row.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazu-kun. You okay?] (Kurumizaka)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I get a chat from Kurumizaka-san, she's concerned about me.&nbsp;</div><div class="calibre3">I didn't reveal anything about my state of mind, but she seems to have surmised something.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I can't say I am....... But I think Kiyokawa is the one who is most distressed right now.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[You're right. I'm sure Ayane-chan is distressed as well.] (Nana)</b></div><div class="calibre3">After some time, Kurumizaka-san sends me a chat again.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Sorry, but there's something I wanna make clear right now. Ayane-chan's crush is...... Kazu-kun, is that correct?] (Nana)</b></div><div class="calibre3">......It makes me realize it again when I hear it from someone else.</div><div class="calibre3">I get impatient when I'm asked a straightforward question by Kurumozaka-san.</div><div class="calibre3">No, she's the leader of a popular idol group.</div><div class="calibre3">She is usually a cute and energetic girl, but in serious situations, she can be serious.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I know it's hard to answer, but I wanna hear it from you.] (Nana)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......I think it's me.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Yes, I understand. Thank you for answering.] (Nana)</b></div><div class="calibre3">After that, I didn't receive any more chats from Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre3">I was expecting her to inquire more about my feelings, so I feel a bit disappointed.</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe she's just giving me time to think.</div><div class="calibre3">"......"My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend", huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I turn my attention to my desk. There're several hundred sheets of manuscript paper piled up on the desk.</div><div class="calibre3">It is a novel written by Kiyokawa, "My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend". I have already finished reading it.</div><div class="calibre3">The content of the story was simple and very easy to read.</div><div class="calibre3">The story started with a high school girl whose idol career was not going well, and she started playing an online game as a way to escape from reality. When she joined a guild, she was treated kindly by the members, but problems arose in their relationships and she found herself surrounded by enemies. Then, a male player helped her out. As the two of them played nicely together, they learned each other's true identities, and while overcoming various incidents that occurred in real life, they became lovers....... is the story.</div><div class="calibre3">To be honest, I think it's a more royal romance than "To You at The Bend".</div><div class="calibre3">In particular, the main character, a high school girl, had her feelings carefully written, and how much she loved and appreciated the guy was deeply explored.</div><div class="calibre3">And from the guy's point of view, it expressed the manly side of him that tried to support the main character anyway.</div><div class="calibre3">There were other things that made me tingle, such as the first time they met offline before they started going out, I smiled at the two of them meeting in secret at school, I was on the edge of my seat when they got separated because of an incident that happened in real life, and I was happy when they ended up going out at the end of the story............. I found myself drawn into the story.</div><div class="calibre3">"......This is what Kiyokawa...... feels." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It's as if she confessed to me through a novel.</div><div class="calibre3">The main character, a high school girl, said and did things just like Kiyokawa, and the guy said and did things just like me.</div><div class="calibre3">If I have to put it in dating-sim game style, it'll be the route where Kiyokawa and I end up together.</div><div class="calibre3">The life that Kiyokawa wished.......</div><div class="calibre3">"What am I...... supposed to do?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I can't organize the information well in my head.</div><div class="calibre3">Having read "My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend", I understand how much Kiyokawa likes "Kazu". I even sympathized with her despite being a man.</div><div class="calibre3">But as long as I have Rinka, there's no way I can accept Kiyokawa's feelings.</div><div class="calibre3">But wouldn't that be rejecting and hurting Kiyokawa?</div><div class="calibre3">I have never been on the popular side, so I have never thought about the conflicts of the rejecting side. I have never even imagined it.</div><div class="calibre3">But now I have.</div><div class="calibre3">――――Rejecting someone's feeling is terribly heartbreaking.</div><div class="calibre3">It hurts me even more because I understand how serious Kiyokawa is.</div><div class="calibre3">Won't it be mentally easier if I'm two-timing? I can't help but think that.</div><div class="calibre3">But I don't think such a convenience would be allowed.</div><div class="calibre3">Anyway, I want to know how Kiyokawa feels now.</div><div class="calibre3">Is she okay with me as a friend, or she is............</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">The smartphone in my hand rings. It's from Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">Feeling somewhat guilty, I hesitate for a moment and then tap the call button.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Hello?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Your voice sounds gloomy. Are you okay?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Sorry. I've been thinking a lot." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Of course you have. How could you not?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Is she concerned about me?</div><div class="calibre3">Considering her position, Rinka must have mixed feelings.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm going to ask you straight out. How does Kazuto-kun feel about Ayane?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"That is......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ayane definitely likes you, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"How can you be so sure? Until yesterday, I and Kiyokawa-san just regarded each other as friends." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That doesn't matter. What's important is that the person you like is now real." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I know exactly that, because I've been experiencing that myself....... The person you love, who you could have only imagined before, appears in front of you in a tangible form. So you can't help but feel an uncontrollable surge of passion." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Are you saying that's what's happening to Kiyokawa-san right now?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eee. The fact that she suddenly logged out is proof of that. If Ayane had just recognized Kazuto-kun as a friend, she would not have taken the step of logging out and would have continued to chat." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka, who has been calmly analyzing the situation, puts in her words without hesitation.</div><div class="calibre3">It's a cool idol way of speaking.</div><div class="calibre3">"I was expecting...... if a day like this would come sooner or later." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"A day like this?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. The day my friend falls in love with Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Such a............" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun is a wonderful boy, so it can't be helped. But that doesn't mean I have the right to restrict your actions. In other words, it was bound to happen eventually." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're wrong. It's because Kiyokawa and I happen to be friends――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Even if you two weren't friends, Ayane would have taken a liking to Kazuto-kun sooner or later. Because Kazuto-kun and Kazu have the same essence." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Somewhere in the back of my mind, I understand that this might be so.</div><div class="calibre3">Thinking about it, I had been able to have a conversation with Kiyokawa as if it was a matter of course from the first time we met.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm not used to women, but...</div><div class="calibre3">Even though we didn't have any real information about each other, I felt that we were close in our hearts.</div><div class="calibre3">"I've said this many times before, but I don't think I can monopolize Kazuto-kun. Especially when a precious junior of mine is involved." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......You mean you'll condone two-timing?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That is....... No, I don't really know how I feel about it. Kazuto-kun is my husband...... But, I want Ayane to be happy too." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If I endure a little, then Ayane can go out with Kazuto-kun――――" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's not going to happen." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Without waiting for her to finish, I cut off her words.</div><div class="calibre3">There is absolutely no way that I would ever go out with a girl other than Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">"So Kazuto-kun is...... going to reject Ayane? (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun is kind, so you must be worried about rejecting Ayane, right?"</div><div class="calibre3">I see, it seems that my heart has been seen through.</div><div class="calibre3">But that's not kindness in my opinion.</div><div class="calibre3">True kindness is being considerate of others, regardless of one's own gain or loss.</div><div class="calibre3">Right now, I think I'm merely afraid of hurting my own heart by dumping Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"Tomorrow, talk it over with Ayane until you're both satisfied. I'll accept whatever conclusion you come to......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I'll do." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">After my reply, the call is cut off.</div><div class="calibre3">To briefly summarize what she just said, Rinka is going to allow me to date more than one girl.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's definitely a nice thing for men to hear, but......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Even if I'm allowed to have a harem, I don't think I will want to reach my hands out to other girls in the slightest.</div><div class="calibre3">In the first place, I recognize Kiyokawa as a friend.</div><div class="calibre3">So, the chance to go out with her is equivalent to zero, to begin with.</div><div class="calibre3">......No, now that I know how Kiyokawa feels about me, I may be aware of her as a member of the opposite sex.</div><div class="calibre3">"The rest is up to...... Kiyokawa's feelings, I guess." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'll have to talk to Kiyokawa tomorrow.</div><div class="calibre3">If we remain distant for fear of discussing it, distortions will eventually occur.</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Perhaps it's because I have been thinking so much that my consciousness is drifting around, as if I'm lost in a dream.</div><div class="calibre3">I found myself looking up at the ceiling in a daze.</div><div class="calibre3">"Rinka and Kiyokawa......yes?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I was given two choices.</div><div class="calibre3">Do I go out with both of them at the same time,</div><div class="calibre3">Or do I just love Rinka......</div><div class="calibre3">I don't need to worry about it.</div><div class="calibre3">The answer has already been obvious from the very start.</div><div class="calibre3">"Is it sincerity or kindness...... I don't care any slightest. The one I only love is Rinka!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Even if it means hurting Kiyokawa, I want to carry on with this thought.</div>
