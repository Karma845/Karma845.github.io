<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; The Decision</h3>

<div class="calibre3">The next day, Kiyokawa was absent from school. She got a fever.</div><div class="calibre3">It might be a coincidence, but since the incident occurred yesterday, I think it was related to me.</div><div class="calibre3">If she was overthinking to the extent she caught a fever, it's probably best to keep a distance from her for a while.</div><div class="calibre3">While I'm having this conversation with Kurumizaka-san and Rinka over my smartphone during break time, I receive a chat from Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"After school today. Can you come to my house? I'd like to talk to you alone." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa seems to have made up her mind about something.</div><div class="calibre3">Naturally, I reply, "I understand".</div><div class="calibre3">After that, I spend the rest of the class and break time thinking about it, and before I know it, it's after school.</div><div class="calibre3">I go to the convenience store to buy a sport-drink as a gift for Kiyokawa, and then head out to her house.</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I let my incessant thoughts take over and keep moving my feet, and before I realize it, I'm in front of Kiyokawa's house.</div><div class="calibre3">I take a deep breath and press the doorbell.</div><div class="calibre3">Shortly after, I hear Kiyokawa's tense voice replying, "Yes......."</div><div class="calibre3">"It's me, Ayanokouji." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Fwast! I-I'm coming!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">After some unusual and adorable reaction, the door's opened.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa appears there, wearing pale pink pajamas and a cold pita on her forehead.</div><div class="calibre3">Naturally, she's not wearing a wig, so she has her natural bobbed perm.</div><div class="calibre3">Perhaps it's the effect of fever. Her cheeks are red and flushed, and the corners of her eyes were puffy. The atmosphere emanating from her body is also lacking in vigor.</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you okay?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-yes! I don't have a very high fever. Umm, you may come in." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"O-okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I take her at her words and come into the house.</div><div class="calibre3">But there's something wrong with Kiyokawa. She seems to be a little flustered.</div><div class="calibre3">She also says that her mother is away at work.</div><div class="calibre3">I go up to Kiyokawa's room and sit down by the mini-table. As for Kiyokawa, she sits down across from me.</div><div class="calibre3">"If it's too much for you, you can just sleep in the bed, okay? Or perhaps, I'd better go home." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, I do have a fever, but it's nothing serious, so I'm fine." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa must have decided that we need to talk and so invite me to her house.</div><div class="calibre3">But I don't know where to start, so I just hung my head.</div><div class="calibre3">In order to start the conversation, I take out a sport-drink from a convenience store bag and hand it to her.</div><div class="calibre3">"Here, Kiyokawa-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you and sorry for bothering." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">I hand her the drink.</div><div class="calibre3">As I hand it over, Kiyokawa's fingertips and mine slightly touched.</div><div class="calibre3">"――――!"</div><div class="calibre3">Blushing instantly, Kiyokawa pulls her hand back with tremendous speed.</div><div class="calibre3">The sport-drink, which hasn't been taken, falls to the mini-table</div><div class="calibre3">"Ki-Kiyokawa-san? Ummm." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"A-are you going to get me...... pregnant by touching my hand?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"M-mmmmmm?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She hugs herself as if to protect herself, and then shouts something horrible.</div><div class="calibre3">"I can't believe it! You targeted a frail girl!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What the heck kind of idea did you have? I just gave you a normal gift of sympathy!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yet, you touched my hand, didn't you?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It was just a touch of your fingertip!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"P-please stop making me nervous!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Even if you say so!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Good grief! That's why senpai's such an Ayanokouji!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"The heck does that mean? It's like my surname is a swear word!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">After a bit of noise, there's coming another scene of silence.</div><div class="calibre3">A crimson-faced Kiyokawa turns over and rubs her fingertips as he groaned, "Uuu......."</div><div class="calibre3">If I look closely, I can see tears in her eyes. ......Is it my fault?</div><div class="calibre3">As I keep quiet, not knowing what to say or do, Kiyokawa begins to blabber.</div><div class="calibre3">"You can't laugh at people, right?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......About what?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazu...... Senior Ayanokouji told me once. The day after his heart was broken, he had a fever and bedridden for a whole day." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, that was when I was five years old." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It was. Actually, I was laughing at it at that time. I was thinking, "How can a guy get a fever just because he's been dumped?"." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I was just only five. It couldn't be helped, could it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Fufu, guess so." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa smiles unreliably.</div><div class="calibre3">From the way she just said. I knew it, she herself has been suffering it.</div><div class="calibre3">And it was a bad one, a worse one.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, I'm sorry. I forgot to offer Senior Ayanokouji a drink." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay. You don't have to push yourself." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa stands up with her hands on the mini-table.</div><div class="calibre3">And when she takes a step to walk to the doorway of the room.</div><div class="calibre3">"Uh――――" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Her fever-stricken body sways unsteadily, and she falls to the side.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm on my feet as soon as I can, whether I can catch before Kiyokawa fall or not, and I manage to do.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Senior, Ayanokouji?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"As I thought, You're forcing yourself." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa, clinging to my chest, looks up at me with eyes that have a weak light within them.</div><div class="calibre3">The breaths coming out of her mouth are warm and rough. It's obvious that she's unwell.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm very, sorry. I'm just feeling a little weak." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah, you should get some sleep. I'm better going home for the day then." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I say that, but for some reason, Kiyokawa doesn't want to let go of me.</div><div class="calibre3">She squeezes the chest area of my uniform with both hands and presses her forehead against my chest.</div><div class="calibre3">"I hit the nail...... on the head." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What's that?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I told you before, didn't I? I said that Senior Ayanokouji was similar to my friend....... So my mind perceived he was Kazu even without any real information." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"At first, you said we were totally polar opposite, though. You treated me as if I was a womanizer." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That was just a...... preconceived notion. Anyone would be mistaken if he was bringing two girls around......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">I didn't take them around. If anything, I was the one being taken around.</div><div class="calibre3">"Have you read......, My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I have......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Downcasted, I can only see Kiyokawa's head and can not see her expression.</div><div class="calibre3">However, I can feel the heat emanating from her body through the air and onto my skin.</div><div class="calibre3">A few moments ago, there was still a bit of a cheerful, although awkward, vibe in the air.</div><div class="calibre3">But now it's completely different.</div><div class="calibre3">Without a doubt, Kiyokawa's about to step into the heart of the matter.</div>

<br class="calibre3" />
<div class="calibre3">"I like you." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"――――!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">That muttered word is only the beginning.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa raises her head and turns her beautiful, slightly moist eyes toward me.</div><div class="calibre3">"I like, I like you, I can't help myself from liking Kazu." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She's not raising her voice, but simply speaking her true feelings.</div><div class="calibre3">"But I had really given up, you know?　Kazu had Rin, and he also had a girlfriend in real life....... But I didn't know the real Kazu, so I was able to separate the two. Kazu was in a world that was beyond my reach......."</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's hands, which are gripping my uniform, are filled with strength.</div><div class="calibre3">"But when...... he appeared in front of me, I couldn't control my feelings. Yes, I fully understood what Senior Rinka was saying. After I found out Kazu's true identity, I felt so much passion that I surprised myself. And then when I realized the reality. AAAH, I knew I couldn't be with Kazu." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm already aware that. That Senior Ayanokouji is not interested in girls other than Senior Rinka." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Absolutely.</div><div class="calibre3">That's why I was able to regard Kiyokawa as a friend with a genuine feeling.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......What's it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I like you." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's a short and direct confession.</div><div class="calibre3">She's looking straight into my eyes.</div><div class="calibre3">This is why I also have to look back at Kiyokawa's and give my answer.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"I can't accept...... your feelings, Kiyokawa-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I said. I did say that.</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe...... there's an option to accept Kiyokawa's confession. As long as Rinka allows it, that path certainly exists. Maybe there's a future where I can make Rinka and Kiyokawa happy.</div><div class="calibre3">But even if that's the case, I'll still choose only Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">Definitely NO.</div><div class="calibre3">It has to be just Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">If I look at it differently, it can be called co-dependence.</div><div class="calibre3">Just as Rinka loves only me, I love only Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">From now on...........NO, I want to be with Rinka until the day I die.</div><div class="calibre3">I bring all the overflowing thoughts from every part from the surface until the bottom of my heart out and put into my gaze and face those beautiful moist eyes of hers head-on.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa moves her lips, which are trembling slightly, and mutters, "I-I know it, right......."</div><div class="calibre3">She looks at me again, as if she still feels like she can't give up yet.</div><div class="calibre3">"May I ask you one question?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yup." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If you had known my true identity before Senior Rinka did...... would you have gone out with me?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The question is, loaded with obvious expectations.</div><div class="calibre3">Even I, an obtuse guy, can understand what kind of words she was looking for.</div><div class="calibre3">But still.</div><div class="calibre3">I have to tell her.</div><div class="calibre3">"Maybe...... no, I wouldn't." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Her eyes widen and Kiyokawa finally pulls her cheeks together.</div><div class="calibre3">Let's say that I met Kiyokawa before I met Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">And let's say Kiyokawa confessed her feelings for me.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm sure I would have been too concerned about Rin to nod my head.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, I couldn't deny the possibility that I would develop a liking for her after interacting with Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">But I'm going to stick to my feelings, understanding that it will just hurt Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Senior Ayanokouji has a much straighter personality than he looks, doesn't he?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you dissing my looks?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's not what I mean. It's just that...... you have a face that seems to be easily swayed by emotion." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Heck is that?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As I say that in resignation, Kiyokawa gives me a distracted smile.</div><div class="calibre3">Then she slinks away from me.</div><div class="calibre3">After that, she changes her smile to the soft and gentle smile that the public is accustomed to seeing in a neat and tidy young lady.</div>

<br class="calibre3" />
<div class="calibre3">"Thank you for today. I feel so much better and refreshed now that I've gotten all my feelings out." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As if the fragile atmosphere of just a moment ago had been a lie, Kiyokawa's calm and unfazed.</div><div class="calibre3">But that's probably just solely an act. Intuitively, I feel that her smile was distorted.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm fine now, so you may go home, please. I also already received a sport-drink from you......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Kiyokawa-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm really fine, so please leave. If you don't, I'll......!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">In the blink of an eye, the smile she had put on her face crumbles.</div><div class="calibre3">I immediately turn my back to Kiyokawa. I reflexively decide that I must not look.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you for your wonderful thoughts....... Please make sure to cherish Rin......I mean, cherish Senior Rinka." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I respond to her without looking back.</div><div class="calibre3">Her voice's trembling with sobs.</div><div class="calibre3">Absolutely Kiyokawa doesn't want me to look back.</div><div class="calibre3">What I need to do now is to take a step and walk.</div><div class="calibre3">Just keep walking.</div><div class="calibre3">Until I can no longer hear her voice, which is now has become wet with her crying――――.</div>
<div class="calibre3">☆ <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: Mah hat, mah sole!!! Press F to Kiyokawa Ayane.)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">After leaving Kiyokawa's house, I walk down the hallway of the apartment and head for the stairs leading down to the first floor.</div><div class="calibre3">Despite the fact that it was already over, I'm still struggling with my statement.</div><div class="calibre3">I feel that I had been too direct in my rejection.</div><div class="calibre3">Isn't there another, more roundabout way of saying......, or in other words, a gentler way of saying it?</div><div class="calibre3">Isn't this just a way to hurt Kiyokawa?</div><div class="calibre3">She said she felt refreshed, but I think she was pushing herself because I was in front of her?</div><div class="calibre3">I'm so worried that I can't clear my head at all.</div><div class="calibre3">How come I, just a mere nerd gamer, have solved the problem?</div><div class="calibre3">There has never been a day when I have been so frustrated by my lack of prowess.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm about to descend the stairs with a heavy step, feeling something akin to regret.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka is right at the end of downstairs. She seems to have come directly from school, as she's still wearing her school uniform.</div><div class="calibre3">I quickly look around to make sure there's no one else around.</div><div class="calibre3">"Rinka, why are you here?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I came, here." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka leads me to the shade of the apartment.</div><div class="calibre3">The apartment's surrounded by an outer wall, so there's no need to worry about anyone seeing us.</div><div class="calibre3">"That...... What happened, at there?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka asks somewhat hesitantly.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not surprising that she's concerned about it.</div><div class="calibre3">"My girlfriend is...... My dear wife is only Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I dare to rephrase from girlfriend to wife.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka smiles softly, as if she's relieved by my statement.</div><div class="calibre3">However, it lasts only for a moment. She immediately darkens her expression.</div><div class="calibre3">"Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I'm such a terrible woman. I'm a little relieved over my junior got rejected." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's not true. Because I'm Rinka's boyfriend after all." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Husband." (Rinka) <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: I can imagine that now she has a lethally cute expression (with a pout)...... oh god! I must stop imagining! or I'll die from overflowing sugar!!!)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"...... Yes." (Kazuto) <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: OW MANNN!!!)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">Rinka is still correcting me even in this situation.</div><div class="calibre3">In an instant, I loosen up.</div><div class="calibre3">"I predicted that Kazuto-kun would choose only me because he is sincere. But it's also true that I want Ayane to be happy." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"I know that. But the only one I love is Rinka......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">From this somber mood, Rinka seems to be feeling guilty.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm feeling the same way.</div><div class="calibre3">No matter what I do to fix it, it doesn't change the fact that I rejected Kiyokawa's feelings.</div><div class="calibre3">"You're worried about Ayane, aren't you?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka seems to have sensed this from my expression. She walks up to me and speaks softly.</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes, I am. But I don't think I'm qualified to do that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't think I'm qualified to say this as well, but I'm sure Ayane will be fine." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't know what kind of exchange you two had. But I'm sure you made the right choice." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I wonder if that's true." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As if to encourage me in my distress, Rinka gently holds my hand.</div><div class="calibre3">I remember Kiyokawa's last words to me.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">[Thank you for your wonderful thoughts....... Please make sure to cherish Rin......I mean, cherish Senior Rinka.]</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">How great she is to be able to wish someone else happiness after she had been rejected.</div><div class="calibre3">If I was in Kiyokawa's shoes, I don't know if I could say the same thing.</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I can feel the warmth of Rinka's hands.</div><div class="calibre3">My duty here is to keep holding these hands of hers.</div><div class="calibre3">To cherish the woman right by my side until the day I die.</div><div class="calibre3">It's the most important and precious duty in my life.</div><div class="calibre3">And that's what Kiyokawa wanted, too.</div><div class="calibre3">☆</div>

<br class="calibre3" />
<div class="calibre3">The next day after school. I'm summoned to a classroom in the old school building.</div><div class="calibre3">Yes, by Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa had missed school yesterday due to a fever, but she's coming to school today.</div><div class="calibre3">Did she recover in just one night?</div><div class="calibre3">I've heard that the speed of recovery from a broken heart varies from person to person, but I think just one night is pretty quick.</div><div class="calibre3">Moreover, I have made a thorough pretense of pretending that I had no heart.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not surprising if she resented me. ......isn't it?</div><div class="calibre3">It may be an extremely unlikely possibility, but Kiyokawa may be trying to get revenge by calling me to an unpopular place. No, I've been overthinking this.</div><div class="calibre3">"......she still hasn't come yet." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I lean against the window frame and stare blankly at the entrance to the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">That's when it happens.</div><div class="calibre3">I hear a noise coming from a locker in the corner of the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">I walk over to the locker and knock on it.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm inside."</div><div class="calibre3">A cute little girl's voice comes from inside the locker. But...... seriously?</div><div class="calibre3">I hesitate whether to open it or not, but eventually, I decided to open the locker.</div><div class="calibre3">There in the Inside is a neat and tidy idol, sweating lightly. For some reason, she seems to be smiling happily.</div><div class="calibre3">"......What are you doing, Kiyokawa-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Fufu, are you surprised?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm so surprised. I'm really so surprised I forgot how to be surprised." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Really? The surprise was a great success then." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa smiles adorably and comes out of the locker, making a rattling sound.</div><div class="calibre3">From what I can see, she doesn't seem depressed.</div><div class="calibre3">On the contrary, she acts innocently and happily.</div><div class="calibre3">However, when I look closer, I notice that her eyes are red and a little swollen.</div><div class="calibre3">When I notice this, I feel a tightening pain in my chest.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji? What's wrong?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No...... that's......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, are you worried about me by any chance? I'm fine, I'm already over it." (Ayane)</div>
<div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa smiles her brightest smile as she gives a thumbs up.</div><div class="calibre3">...... She doesn't look like she's forcing herself. So there seems to be no lie in her words.</div><div class="calibre3">"If anything, Ayakoji-senpai seems to be the one who is still dragging it out more." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Well, I was just a bit worried." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see. But you don't have to worry about it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"As I said before, I'm completely over it. Eee, anyone can only give up after being rejected with such force. But it's refreshing, isn't it? It was like a demon that shattered my dreams and hopes." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I knew it, you still harbor it, don't you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I can't hide my confusion at her tone of voice, as if she was talking about a happy memory.</div><div class="calibre3">I have expected Kiyokawa to be distressed, so I don't know how to react.</div><div class="calibre3">"The truth is, I ...... cried and cried all night. I was jealous of all the couples in the world, and I wrote a novel about destroying another world with cheats in one night." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa smiles with amusement. It's not as if she's straining herself after all.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Mm that, Kiyokawa-san......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you, Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Why she is, thanking me.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm wondering it and I turn my head to face her, but what at my sight is Kiyokawa having a gentle smile on her face that shows her acceptance.</div><div class="calibre3">"Thanks to you, I was able to move on and forward without any undue expectations. I am really grateful for it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's ......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If he had rejected me in a halfhearted and gentle way, I'm sure it would have left me emotionally bewildered. It is definitely better to be rejected with all might and then cry with all your might as well than to be rejected in such a way." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Is that the way it is?</div><div class="calibre3">I've never been rejected, so I can't imagine it.</div><div class="calibre3">I've heard that women are more resilient to heartbreak than men.</div><div class="calibre3">Men tend to hold onto past heartbreaks, but women are better at moving on, or something like that........</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know either.</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe Kiyokawa is special.</div><div class="calibre3">The experience of becoming a popular idol may have strengthened Kiyokawa's mentality.......?</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, I want to make one thing clear, you didn't find me unattractive, did you?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Of course not. I am just interested solely in Rinka......but if it were any other man, he would have accepted Kiyokawa-san's confession without hesitation." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Fufu, it's certainly. Senior Ayanokouji is a special pattern. Normally, even if someone already has a girlfriend, if an idol confesses to him, he'll be more or less dropped his head over her heels." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">But the girlfriend in question is an idol too, you know.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji can stay as you are. No matter what happens, you must stick to your feelings for Senior Rinka......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Yes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's not the brain nor physique that defines a person in the end. It's the heart. No matter how rational you are, as long as you are human, you will always make choices that are influenced by your emotions." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's statement carries a certain weight with it. It's the significance of being a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre3">"Many people say this. Human beings are right just the way they are. However, people who say such beautiful things hurt others without realizing it. It is because they believe that their way of thinking is the most correct and impose that way of thinking on others." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Am I one of those people?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Not at all, you're not. In the case of Senior Ayanokouji, you accept everything about the other person. Both the masked faces and the real faces....... and it's unconsciously." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"In the first place, people pretend to be something they're not, depending on the situation", Kiyokawa added that, and then she's blabbering more.</div><div class="calibre3">"This is why I feel incomparable happiness when I meet someone who I can reveal myself to him." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">This may be referring to Rinka...... and herself.</div><div class="calibre3">In particular, idols have to be mindful of public perception. In other words, there will be many opportunities to pretend to be something you're not.</div><div class="calibre3">"So, Senior Ayanokouji, please value your own heart. And please don't let yourself be misled by superfluous information from real life, and just look at Senior Rinka as she is." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div>
<div class="calibre3">It seems to me that there is some kind of implication in the way she said it.</div><div class="calibre3">When I try to ask her what she means, Kiyokawa smiles brightly.</div><div class="calibre3">"So, why don't we be friends again?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"The awkward relationship we have now isn't very good, is it? It will make Senior Rinka and Senior Nana feel uncomfortable. Or rather, I don't like it. I'm so sad to say goodbye to Senior Ayanokouji, even though I've taken the trouble to become his friend." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa says such a thing with a smile on her face.</div><div class="calibre3">I nod my head, unable to shake my head at such a statement.</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you very much. This means that Senior Ayanokouji and I can start over as friends without any reservations." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're.......right." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"When I think back, so many things have happened! It started in this classroom, chatting in the game without realizing each other's identity............" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">As she speaks nostalgically, Kiyokawa looks around the classroom. I follow and look around too.</div><div class="calibre3">This is where our days began.</div><div class="calibre3">"I almost noticed it a couple of times, though. That Aaya-san might be Kiyokawa-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's what I did, too. But I thought it was practically just impossible to be true." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Me too. I can't even imagine a neat and tidy idol as a friend of mine in a web game.</div><div class="calibre3">It's just unlikely that any of the students from the same school would even turn out to be my friend in the first place.</div><div class="calibre3">"It was another turning point in our relationship. We've been through a lot, but now we can be pure friends." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Got it. I and Kiyokawa-san are friends." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe this conversation is Kiyokawa's own ritual of...... her way of getting over it.</div><div class="calibre3">Somehow it seems that way to me as I look at her beaming face that seems to be satisfied with everything.　</div><div class="calibre3">"And will you stop calling me like a stranger? Please drop the honorific "-san"." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"All right, Kiyokawa." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you very much. From now on, I'll call Senior Ayanokouji, Senior P*rn-okouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Oka――――isn't that weird? You're definitely making fun of me." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"But it's true, isn't it?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't mess with me. Kiyokawa's the pervy one, you closet pervert HS girl." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm no――――I'm one." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Oh man, you're affirming it. What on earth happens?" (Kazuto)</div>

<br class="calibre3" />
<div class="calibre3">I'm expecting her usual "I'm not a closet!", so I feel at a loss.</div><div class="calibre3">"You're not going to hate me no matter what side of me you find out about, are you, Senior Ayanokouji? That's why――――I'm going to remove my mask in front of you." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's not the face of a neat and tidy young lady.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa says those words with a pure smile that's typical of a girl her age.</div><div class="calibre3">I can't help but gasp as I feel something inexplicably mysterious on her face.</div><div class="calibre3">The next moment, however, Kiyokawa's face has changed into a mischievous smile.</div><div class="calibre3">"You should be grateful. In other words, I trusted Senior Ayanokouji as much as I trusted the members of Star☆Mines." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're looking at me from above, aren't you. Have you forgotten that I'm your senior?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Fufu. No, I haven't. I said that because I understood that you are my senior." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa has a mischievous smile that is not typical of a neat and tidy young lady.</div><div class="calibre3">It's an unmasked expression that I'll see someday――――</div><div class="calibre3">What a cocky junior she is.</div><div class="calibre3">Although I think so, I do not feel uncomfortable at all, which is strange.</div>
