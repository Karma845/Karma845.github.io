<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; the Scene of Riot</h3>

<div class="calibre3">I leave a scared Nonoa in Kasumi's care and head for the front door.</div><div class="calibre3">Three popular idols are taking off their shoes at the entrance. Rinka, Kurumizaka-san, and then, Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">They are wearing short-sleeved shirts and shorts, suitable for summer, and their movements show a hint of fatigue. They must be tired after their lessons.</div><div class="calibre3">By the way, Rinka hadn't told me that Kurumizaka-san and Kiyokawa were coming.</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder if something has happened?</div><div class="calibre3">I approach the girls and say, "Good work".</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, wait, Kazuto-kun!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'm stopped by Rinka with uncanny power, and I couldn't help but stop.</div><div class="calibre3">The other two also have their faces tighten up at my approach....... What?</div><div class="calibre3">"Wh-what is wrong, Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That is...... I'd like you not to get too close to me because...... I've been sweating a lot." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay. I don't care about that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"But I do care about that, Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's right, Kazu-kun! You should be a little more considerate, you know!?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"As expected of Senior Ayanokouji, you dared to pretend to be insensitive and came all the way to smell our sweat. You really were Mr. Pervert." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">I'm berated like a worthless.</div><div class="calibre3">The accusing glances from the girls make me retreat and keep my distance.</div><div class="calibre3">"U-umm...... if you really want to smell my sweat, I'll put up with it." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, thanks. I'll just accept your feelings." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">A blushing Rinka gives me a really interesting offer, but I reluctantly decline after receiving stares from the other two.</div>

<div class="calibre3">"Do you have a sweat fetish, Kazu-kun?" (Nana)</div>
<div class="calibre3">"I don't particularly have." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Was that really true? Senior Ayanokouji had been sniffing around since a while ago. You were Mr. Pervert, after all." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's a false accusation! I'm just breathing normally!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"In other words, you were breathing hard because you were excited." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Your words have been full of malice since just now, Kiyokawa-san! Please give me a break!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I know it, Kiyokawa is coming to crush me. I'm sure of it.</div><div class="calibre3">"Anyway, we're going to take a shower." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Have a good time. I'll be waiting in the living room." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I see off the three idols on their way to the bathroom.</div><div class="calibre3">I'll ask why Kurumizaka-san and Kiyokawa are here later.</div><div class="calibre3">"Do you want come in too, Kazuto-kun?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">Kasumi-san comes from the living room and lightly poked me on the arm and said something like that.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... What if I really come in?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm sure you'll be beaten to a pulp and have your manhood symbol chopped off." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I feel a chill run down my spine. I unconsciously thrust my thighs inward.</div><div class="calibre3">"Well......, I'm going home to my friend's house, so take care of the rest, kay." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"Going home? This is your house, isn't it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, yeah. This house is the first base and my friend's house is the second base." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">Kasumi says with a light laugh.</div><div class="calibre3">I heard from Rinka that Kasumi-san rarely comes home.</div><div class="calibre3">It might be a coincidence that she was at home today.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's why, you have to get along well with Ayane-chan. It's an obstacle that you must overcome if you want to go out with Rinka." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"Somehow, I feel like you're just like a sister-in-law." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ahaha. Well, if it gets hard, just let me know, and as your big sis, I'll pamper you a lot." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">She smiles a little mischievously, but I have a feeling that she'll probably really spoil me if I tell her.</div><div class="calibre3">But she's also gentle and reassuring.</div><div class="calibre3">I watch her walk out of the house with her bag and go back to the living room, listening to the girls' voices coming from the bathroom.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Nonoa-chan?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">In the corner of the room, a little girl is shrinking like a frightened squirrel.</div><div class="calibre3">She is quivering and looks as if she is frightened of her natural enemy.</div><div class="calibre3">"What's wrong, Nonoa-chan?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I sit down beside Nonoa-chan and asked her gently.</div><div class="calibre3">Then Nonoa-chan mumbles fleetingly, "Kazuto-bro......," and looks up at me with her big, moist eyes.</div><div class="calibre3">"You know, Ayane-sis is here." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"I know. You don't like Kiyokawa-san by any chance?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">She nods lightly. Seriously?</div><div class="calibre3">Looks like Kiyokawa is disliked by Nonoa-chan.</div><div class="calibre3">"Why?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Because Ayane-sis gets angry whenever she sees me. She says I shouldn't follow strangers and that I should be more cautious...... She says that Nonoa-chan will get kidnapped because she's cute, which scares me." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Well, maybe it's true.</div><div class="calibre3">On the assumption that I'm not a lolicon, I have to say that Nonoa-chan is really cute.</div><div class="calibre3">It's no wonder Kiyokawa is worried about her.</div><div class="calibre3">"She also nagged me, 'Have you done your homework?' And she's so annoying, telling me, 'You must study now'." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">......Which mouth is saying that, Kiyokawa?</div><div class="calibre3">You even said that studying is unnecessary.</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't like Ayane-sis because she's like a teacher." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">Nonoa-chan puffs up her cheeks appealing her displeasure. It's too cute.</div><div class="calibre3">"I see. That's tough." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I pat Nonoa-chan on the head gently to get her back into a good mood.</div><div class="calibre3">She seems to have calmed down after being patted for a while, and she smiles at me with an innocent, angelic smile.</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey, Kazuto-bro. Play with me!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"Alright, What do you want to play?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Play marriage!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"Buhh! A-are you serious?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yup! I saw it on TV yesterday." (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"I-I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Apparently, her childish curiosity has been stimulated.</div><div class="calibre3">Her eyes are sparkling and she's waiting for my answer.</div><div class="calibre3">As I ponder what to do, Nonoa-chan's face clouds over in shock.</div><div class="calibre3">"............ Is it not okay?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay. Let's do." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She looks up at me anxiously, then I give an answer immediately without hesitation.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, it's child's play, so I guess there's no problem.</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, then, propose to me!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"Propose, huh....... I like you, Nonoa-chan. Please marry me." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Not good! Say it with more feeling and seriousness!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">You're an angel with a lot of unexpected orders.</div><div class="calibre3">I can't help it, then. I'll show her how serious the nerd gamer me is!</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Nonoa. I love you. Please marry me." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Waa――――" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">After receiving my direct proposal (handsome voice), Nonoa-chan's face instantly turns bright red and her eyes are incessant blinking.</div><div class="calibre3">I've learned from my experience of confessing my feelings to Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">That simple words are the best way to convey your feelings to someone.</div><div class="calibre3">"S-senior...... Ayanokouji?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">At the entrance of the living room. Kiyokawa, who has just finished taking a bath, is standing there in a daze.</div><div class="calibre3">She's staring at me and Nonoa-chan, her mouth agape.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kiyokawa-san? Are you imitating a goldfish?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">What's going on all of a sudden? And then I notice a minor discomfort. It's Kiyokawa's hair.</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe it's just my imagination, but it has the exact same texture as before the bath.</div><div class="calibre3">Did she really take a bath?</div><div class="calibre3">But since her cheeks are lightly red and steamy, so I'm sure she had taken a bath.</div><div class="calibre3">As I'm thinking about this, Kiyokawa points her finger at me vigorously.</div><div class="calibre3">"Lolicon! You're a lolicon! Was Ayanokoji-senpai's real target Nonoa-chan?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"H-huh!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I knew you were a womanizer, but to think that you would even put your hands on a little girl...... you were outrageous!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">This is a misunderstanding! This is a marriage game! We're just playing!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Play! You had finally shown your true colors, yes! You were seducing women for fun!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Kazuto-kun. What does this mean?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">The one who appears from behind Kiyokawa is the one we all know, Rinka-sama. Her body is still steamy fresh after the bath. Her hair is lustrous and silky, and her reddened cheeks are either from her bath or her anger at me.......</div><div class="calibre3">"Did you put your hands on my sister?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">The cold stare from Rinka's sharp eyes pierces me.</div><div class="calibre3">"N-no. Please listen to me." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Depending on what you say, I may have to go back to my parents' house." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">But here is, Rinka's parents' house.</div>
