<h2>Round 1: I’ll Make You My Fan!</h2>


<p>The microwave was much heavier than I had imagined.</p>
<p>I rubbed my overworked hands as I got on the elevator and got off on the eighth floor. Then a middle-aged lady caught sight of me and blossomed into a smile when I walked down the communal hallway.</p>

<p>“Thank you for going out of your way to carry it down for me.”</p>

<p>White hair filled most of her head, but her smile was youthful. The lady in front of me is our so-called neighbor.</p>
<p>I had just run into her a few minutes ago in the apartment building’s communal hallway as she was trying to carry a cracked microwave.</p>
<p>She explained, ‘My husband and I were doing an out-of-season spring cleaning when he suddenly hurts his back’ when I asked her why she was handling such a heavy microwave alone.</p>
<p>That’s where a high school boy with lots of energy, me, offered to take on the role of porter.</p>

<p>“Was it just the ventilation fan cleaning and the light bulbs replacement left to do?”</p>

<p>Rolling up the sleeves of her parka, the lady thrust her palm forward in a flustered manner.</p>

<p>“Oh no, that’s not necessary. That side isn’t in a hurry, so don’t worry about it. Weren’t you on your way to go out somewhere?”</p>
<p>“No-no, please let me do it. It will take a while for your husband’s back to recover.”</p>
<p>“B-but…”</p>
<p>“I have plenty of time because I’m on spring break. Besides, we still haven’t greeted your husband when we move in yet.”</p>

<p>Eventually, the lady lowered the ends of her eyebrows eventually and conceded defeat. Then she let me into the house.</p>
<p>Well-well, there’s dust accumulating in the corner of the hallway, and the floor wax is starting to peel off. Might as well help with cleaning the house while I’m at it.</p>
<p>The shine on the leather shoes lined up at the entrance has also faded a little.</p>
<p>Did they have any shoe polish at home?</p>
<p>If the husband can move his body, I might even offer to do some partner stretches.</p>

<p>Ah, I can’t contain my excitement. My palms are slightly sweaty with anticipation.</p>
<p>I swallow hard.</p>
<p>Now, the battle begins.</p>

<p>By the time all the work was done, the sky had completely tinted red.</p>

<p>“It’s not much of a thank-you, but here you go.”</p>

<p>At the entrance, the lady handed me a plastic bag. It’s crammed full of bright orange carrots when I peeked inside.</p>

<p>“Wow, thank you so much. I was actually thinking of buying some today.”</p>
<p>“They were sent from a relative who is a farmer. They might have an odd appearance, but the taste is good.”</p>
<p>“This is a big help. Ah, do you like sweets? I could make a tart and bring it over tomorrow if there’s this much. We could also go over the details of your husband’s back pain improvement plan and then…”</p>
<p>“I-t’s fine, it’s really fine. You should be spending your own time, okay?”</p>
<p>“Don’t be so reserved.”</p>
<p>“I can’t take any more of a young person’s time. Please consider it a request from an old person and listen to me.”</p>

<p>Though I felt reluctant to leave, I decided it was my duty as a junior to show respect to my senior in life and accepted it.</p>
<p>Then I returned to the room next door after a bit of light conversation.</p>

<p>Orikita Residence</p>
<p>Our family moved into this apartment building the other day. The room we live in is number 809 on the eighth floor.</p>
<p>After bringing in the laundry, I looked down from the balcony to see moving trucks still coming and going even in the evening.</p>
<p>It’s early April and spring break is almost over.</p>
<p>Shifting my gaze to the nearby park, I saw cherry tree branches adorned with petals swaying in rhythm with the wind.</p>

<p>Soon, I’ll be a second-year high school student.</p>
<p>I’m not particularly anxious about moving up a grade since I’m attending the same school even after the move. Rather, my current concern is greeting my other set of neighbors.</p>
<p>By the other set of neighbors, I don’t mean the lady. She lives in room 808, next to the elevator.</p>
<p>The one I’m concerned about is on the opposite side, at the far end of the floor—room 810.</p>

<p>It seems that my other next-door neighbor has an irregular lifestyle; they hardly ever come home during the hours I’m awake.</p>
<p>Because of this, I haven’t had the chance to greet them until today.</p>
<p>Ideally, the three members of my family including my parents should visit and greet them together, but their vacation ended yesterday. That’s why it’s up to me, their son, to make the visit alone.</p>
<p>Today was a rare day for me because I heard sounds of life from next door during the daytime, so it seemed that the neighbor was at home.</p>
<p>That’s when I decided to make my move, and just as I opened the front door, I encountered the lady.</p>

<p>I stepped out of my room again and stood in front of room 810 next door.</p>
<p>In my right hand is a white paper bag. Inside is what you’d call a gift, wrapped in a silver-colored cooling pack.</p>
<p>Ah, I’m nervous. Their gender and age are complete mysteries.</p>
<p>Since they live in an apartment, could it be that they’re like the residents of room 808, belonging to the mature age group?</p>

<p>I gather my courage and ring the doorbell.</p>
<p>To avoid causing any unnecessary anxiety to the person inside, I stand directly in front of the door monitor while gripping the strings of the paper bag with both hands.</p>
<p>My outfit is nothing but simple a hoodie and jeans, but I’m sure it will not cause any discomfort.</p>

<p>『…Yes?』</p>

<p>A gentle voice reaches me through the monitor.</p>
<p>It was a woman’s voice.</p>

<p>“I’ve recently moved into room 809 next door. I thought I should come by and say hello.”</p>
<p>『 … 』</p>

<p>There is no response. It’s not that she can’t hear me; she’s probably wondering whether she should respond to me or not.</p>
<p>Well, it’s rare to meet face-to-face for greetings these days. But still, we’ll be neighbors over the coming years, perhaps decades.</p>
<p>I want to take the appropriate steps.</p>


<p>『…Okay. I’ll open it now.』</p>

<p>After a slight pause, a modest tone of approval came in response.</p>
<p>The voice sounded quite young. Late twenties—no, maybe early twenties.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, it’s natural for her to be wary of a male visitor.</p>
<p>If a woman comes out, I’ll increase the tone of my voice by twenty percent and my smile by fifty percent——</p>

<p>The curtain on the stage rises as the door opens.</p>
<p>The slender white hand that appeared through the gap seemed almost too delicate to belong to a human being.</p>
<p>Her eyes, radiant like the sun, seemed to instantly captivate anyone who looked into them.</p>
<p>There is a sweet scent that wafts in from either her house aromatherapy or perhaps it originates from her.</p>

<p>As if the opening of a show had begun, I was enveloped in an extraordinary atmosphere.</p>
<p>Perhaps the door to room 810 was a bridge connecting the stage and the audience.</p>

<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting——”</p>

<p>At that moment, I forgot to force a smile.</p>
<p>Because the person who appeared before me was a very beautiful girl.</p>
<p>She was neither a career woman dressed sharply in a suit nor a party-goer in flashy clothes.</p>
<p>She was a girl with a slender figure well-suited in a white knit and short denim, clearly a girl my age.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I knew that someone had moved into the next room… but I was responding like, ‘Could it be a door-to-door salesman?I thought the apartment had an auto-lock’. I must have come across as rude huh?”</p>

<p>Her long, glossy, and beautiful black hair was flowing like a clear stream over her shoulders.</p>
<p>The light in her pale eyes was a noble amber reminiscent of champagne.</p>

<p>“No, not at all. I didn’t think you were rude…”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Ah, then I’m glad.”</p>

<p>The girl placed her hand on her chest as if to express her relief.</p>
<p>Then she stepped forward and brought her face closer to mine.</p>
<p>With a gaze as vulnerable and endearing as a cat that has let down its guard, she stared at me.</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkled like jewels, her brows suggested a dignified strength, her nose was well-defined, and her lips were a pale cherry color.</p>
<p>The features of her face were arranged in their perfect size and place——She was so beautiful that I couldn’t help but feel as if I were appreciating a work of art.</p>
<p>The girl smiled nonchalantly after meeting my gaze.</p>

<img007

<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>

<p>I felt as if I could hear the sound effect of a smile. It was the perfect textbook example of a smile.</p>
<p>Her natural smile combined a womanly charm with an age-appropriate innocence.</p>
<p>I felt embarrassed about my own calculated attempt to ‘increase my smile by fifty percent.’</p>

<p>“Ah… my name is Mamori Suzufumi and I’ve been living next door in room 809 since the other day. Along with my father and mother, I look forward to being in your care!”</p>

<p>The greeting I had mentally prepared blew away, and in my embarrassment and nervousness, I blurted out my full name…</p>
<p>The girl seemed to sense what was in my heart and smiled modestly.</p>

<p>“My name is Sasaki Yuzuki and I live in Room 810. Mamori-san, nice to meet you.”</p>

<p>I honestly felt my heart flutter at her lovely smile.</p>
<p>There was no sign of her parents coming out. It seems that Sasaki-san is home alone.</p>

<p>“Oh, right, here.”</p>

<p>Feeling my face grow hot, I hurriedly handed over a paper bag.</p>

<p>“I apologize for not including a formal gift ribbon, but please enjoy this with your family.”</p>
<p>“Wow thank you! Is this candy?”</p>
<p>“…It’s…pork…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san’s expression stiffens as she receives the paper bag.</p>

<p>“…It’s pork.”</p>
<p>“Pork…”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san looked bewilderedly into the paper bag. Of course, that’s to be expected.</p>
<p>Normally, giving something like long-lasting cookies or coffee would be the standard in situations like this.</p>
<p>What kind of situation involves offering raw pork to a teenage girl who looks like this?</p>

<p>Now my body started to feel hot for a reason different from excitement.</p>
<p>Then my mouth started moving on its own——</p>

<p>“Ah, you see, my parents run an izakaya (JP pub). It has finally started doing well in recent years, but the apartment we used to live in was demolished. When we talked about renovating the shop for residential use, we realized it was just too small for three people to live in, so we ended up moving here. Right now, we’re actually having a fair at the shop featuring a brand of pork called ‘Platinum Pork.’ Are you familiar with it? It’s a breed that’s a cross between three different bloodlines, known for its tender meat and fine muscle fibers. It’s a brand of pork that has a rich flavor of fat without being too heavy and leaves a refreshing aftertaste. The cut we have this time is pork belly, which is of course great for grilling and also for shabu-shabu or stewing… It’s delicious…”</p>

<p>What am I spilling to someone I’ve just met?</p>
<p>Sasaki-san continued to stare into the paper bag, not uttering a single word.</p>
<p>She gazed intently at the contents as if she had forgotten my existence.</p>

<p>This is bad, she must be totally put off.</p>
<p>Dad, Mom, I’m sorry</p>
<p>It’s probably my fault if things have gotten awkward with the neighbor</p>

<p>“Ginger pork…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Meat-wrapped rice balls… Char siu…”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san was murmuring the names of various dishes with eyes sparkling like a child receiving presents from Santa Claus.</p>

<p>“…Sasaki-san?”</p>
<p>“Ah! S-sorry! I haven’t had a pork belly in so long, I just got carried away!”</p>

<p>I’m completely taken aback by her unexpected reaction.</p>
<p>Does this mean she liked it?</p>

<p>“Thank you very much… I’ll try it next time.”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san’s mood shifts suddenly, and she offers a feeble smile.</p>
<p>I totally understand the feeling of embarrassment after getting carried away in front of others.</p>
<p>I just made the same mistake a few seconds ago.</p>

<p>“…Well then, I’ll be off… I look forward to working with you…”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>

<p>The sound of the door closing was as feeble as her voice.</p>
<p>We parted with a somewhat awkward atmosphere.</p>
<p>Still, it seemed like she was happy with that somehow.</p>
<p>I pray that she’ll show me her usual charming smile again the next time we meet.</p>


<p>“My neighbor was so cute…”</p>

<p>She had a great figure and a great attitude.</p>
<p>Above all, that smile——it was a hundred-point captivating smile that made such cliche comparisons like an angelic smile come to mind.</p>
<p>She must have been very popular with guys.</p>
<p>If she’s a student, there might even be a fan club for her at school.</p>

<p>“Hmm…”</p>

<p>Actually, I felt a sense of deja vu about Sasaki-san.</p>
<p>As a mere ordinary person, there’s no way I could know such a beautiful girl. But to say it was our first meeting… the sense of deja vu has been stubbornly clinging to the back of my mind.</p>

<p>Well, mission accomplished for now, so maybe I’ll go do some grocery shopping for dinner.</p>
<p>Even though I’ve just moved into a new place, it’s not like Dad and Mom will be coming home anyway.</p>

<p>The izakaya run by the Mamori couple is about a twenty-minute drive from the apartment.</p>
<p>It’s a privately owned so-called creative izakaya. Even now, with the business stabilizing, they are actively working on developing new menu items, and they spend most of the month staying in the staff room at the back of the store.</p>
<p>It seems to be well equipped with futons, a TV, a computer, and stuff like that.</p>

<p>Maybe the fact that I’ve become a high school student and have less need to be personally cared for encouraged their frequent overnight stays.</p>
<p>In other words, my life has been similar to living alone lately even though we’re a family of three.</p>

<p>Now, what should I make for today’s meal?</p>
<p>I’ve come to crave pork myself after seeing Sasaki-san’s reaction.</p>
<p>Tonkatsu, braised pork, asparagus rolls… maybe it’s time for some twice-cooked pork?</p>
<p>While letting my thoughts wander, I reached for my wallet to head back and was about to insert the key into the lock of room 809 when——</p>

<p>—Bang.</p>
<p>A sound of something falling, or perhaps something toppling over came from the next room.</p>
<p>I turn back and pressed my ear against the door of room 810.</p>

<p>Inside, there was silence.</p>
<p>If Sasaki-san had returned to the living room, then the sound wouldn’t have leaked out to this common hallway.</p>
<p>That means something must have happened in the hallway.</p>

<p>“…Sasaki-san?”</p>

<p>I call out while knocking.</p>
<p>If she’s in the hallway, she should be able to hear me even from outside. But there is no response even after waiting for a while.</p>
<p>I reached for the door lever, but it wasn’t locked.</p>

<p>A bad feeling came over me.</p>

<p>“…I’m going to open it.”</p>

<p>Entering a woman’s home uninvited is inexcusable, but regretting it later if something happened would be the worst.</p>
<p>If I can confirm she’s safe, then that’s all that matters.</p>
<p>I’ll apologize profusely and do whatever it takes if I’m blamed for it later.</p>

<p>I opened the door. There were neatly lined-up boots and pumps that a young woman might wear in the entryway.</p>
<p>There were no shoes that seemed to belong to her parents.</p>
<p>To the left were the bathroom and toilet, and to the right, there were two rooms. The hallway with wooden flooring probably led to the living room.</p>
<p>The cleaning was meticulous; not a speck of dust in sight.</p>

<p>Instead, there were two lumps lying in the hallway.</p>
<p>One is the gift I had just given to Sasaki-san earlier. From the white paper bag with the butcher shop’s name written on it, pork wrapped in a cold pack is sticking out.</p>
<p>And the other, no, rather——</p>

<p>“Sasaki-san!”</p>

<p>Sasaki Yuzuki was lying face down on the floor.</p>
<p>I couldn’t check for consciousness or facial expressions because she was in a prone position.</p>
<p>Her body is slightly moving up and down, so it seems she’s breathing, but it might be necessary to call an ambulance depending on the situation.</p>

<p>I feel a slight dizziness as a flashback of my past hits me——</p>
<p>No, this is not the time to be flustered. I quickly lift off my shoes and lift her body.</p>

<p>“Sasaki-san, it’s me, Mamori. Can you hear me?”</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>

<p>Her lips move slightly, so I bring my ear close to Sasaki-san’s mouth.</p>
<p>Is she trying to convey something?</p>
<p>Maybe the location of her medication for seizures or the contact information for her regular doctor?</p>

<p>Then Sasaki-san wraps her hands around mine as if to envelop them.</p>
<p>They feel delicate and terribly cold——it makes me almost doubt that she’s the same human being as me.</p>

<p>“…Hurts…”</p>
<p>“What? Please say it one more time.”</p>

<p>I focus all my nerves on my ears and sharpen my senses.</p>

<p>—Grrrroowl</p>
<p>It sounded like an arrow made of air being drawn taut.</p>
<p>Not a voice, but a sound. It wasn’t coming from Sasaki-san’s mouth but from her stomach.</p>

<p>“I’m hungry…”</p>

<p>With words like a dying message, Sasaki-san pretended to faint with her face flushed in embarrassment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>“That’s really embarrassing…”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san apologized to me while munching on a high-protein tofu bar across the low table.</p>
<p>When I checked the fridge while putting away the pork, the most nutritious food available seemed to be this tofu bar. The only other things inside were water, tea, and zero-calorie jelly.</p>

<p>The shared living and kitchen space of the Sasaki household was very simple. There was just a table and some cushions placed around, and even the rugs and curtains were utterly plain. The kitchen area barely had a complete set of dishes. In short, it lacked a sense of being lived in.</p>
<p>If a family were living here, their individual tastes and interests would be more apparent.</p>

<p>“I live alone.”</p>

<p>Sensing my question, Sasaki-san spoke up.</p>

<p>“My father is acquainted with the owner of this apartment building, so we’ve been able to make various arrangements. At first, we moved to Tokyo together and lived together, but my father was transferred back to our hometown at the beginning of this year. Now he lives there with my mother.”</p>

<p>This apartment seemed far too big for a girl like her to live alone.</p>

<p>“Was it okay for Sasaki-san not to come back to your hometown?”</p>
<p>“Yes. My father seemed worried, but I wanted to continue working here.”</p>
<p>“Working?”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san stares at me intently as if sizing me up.</p>
<p>Eventually, she says, ‘…it would be dishonest to hide it after I’ve received help’, and starts searching for something on her smartphone, then turns the LCD screen towards me.</p>

<p>On the screen, there are five girls.</p>
<p>They are dressed in midriff-baring separate-type outfits, each striking a signature pose. The smile of the girl in the center with her hand on her chest looks familiar to me.</p>
<p>It’s the same smile I had seen just a short while ago when I came for a moving-in greeting.</p>
<p>Below the girl in the center, it read, 【Arisu Yuzuki (15)】.</p>

<p>“You were an idol…?”</p>
<p>“We’re still in the process of making our promotion, though.”</p>

<p>Her idol smile was so natural that it was hard to believe she was just starting out.</p>

<p>“No wonder, I thought you were much more put-together than me.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true. Mamori-san, you are quite put together yourself.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no”</p>
<p>“Not at all, not at all.”</p>

<p>A battle of humility had begun.</p>
<p>From experience, I knew that unless I forcefully put an end to it, it would just keep making the other person feel obliged to be considerate indefinitely.</p>

<p>“…At this point, shouldn’t we both stop using honorifics? It seems like there’s only a year difference between us.”</p>

<p>At my suggestion, Sasaki-san hesitated with an upward glance, then opened her mouth slightly.</p>

<p>“…That’s true. Nice to meet you again, Mamori-kun.”</p>

<p>Arisu Yuzuki, her real name being Sasaki Yuzuki, shyly pulled her mug closer.</p>
<p>I recognized the group name that had appeared on my smartphone screen earlier.</p>

<p>【Spotlights】</p>

<p>It’s been about a year since their five-member girl idol group songs and choreography started frequently buzzing on social media.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I might have seen this quintet on music shows or variety programs once or twice.</p>
<p>So this was the source of that deja vu.</p>

<p>“The reason you were so hungry you could faint was to maintain your figure?”</p>
<p>“Well, something like that. I have a body type that gains weight easily, so if I’m not careful, I puff up right away.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Sasaki-san pinches her upper arm.</p>

<p>“Still, I think pushing yourself to that extent is surely going too far.”</p>
<p>“If I gain a little weight, I need to resize my costumes, and of course I also want to look cute. You see, photos and videos are something that stays in everyone’s hands forever.”</p>

<p>Regardless of gender, height and body structure change significantly during the growth period.</p>
<p>Just because your weight has increased doesn’t necessarily mean you’ve ‘gotten fat’.</p>

<p>“But don’t you think you’re way too thin? You just got some pork, so how about making a light dish…”</p>
<p>“No way. Pork belly is full of fat and calories.”</p>

<p>Although the tone is playful, I sense a clear intention to refuse.</p>

<p>“Quality fats are actually nutritious, you know? A certain amount is used up by the basal metabolism rate.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point. Daily carelessness can show up in your weight.”</p>
<p>“It’s a limited edition. Are you really sure you don’t want it?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t need it. I’m full from eating tofu bars!”</p>

<p>What an obvious lie. Does she think I haven’t noticed her glaring resentfully at the paper bag this whole time?</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped. Then I’ll take back the pork belly.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>

<p>Like a child abandoned by their parents, Sasaki-san suddenly looks downcast.</p>
<p>When she makes that face, it makes me seem like the bad guy.</p>
<p>She doesn’t want to eat it, but she also doesn’t want it to be taken away.</p>
<p>In that case, I want to choose to bring joy to Sasaki-san, even if it’s just for a moment.</p>
<p>Since appetite is called one of the three basic human desires, it’s not something that can be solved with just sheer willpower.</p>

<p>“I’ve decided. I will cook it.”</p>

<p>I clenched my right hand and stood up.</p>

<p>“I-I’m telling you I won’t eat it!”</p>

<p>Any further argument is pointless.</p>
<p>Ignoring Sasaki-san, I move to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Perhaps realizing my determination, a scream pierced my back.</p>

<p>“I’m the idol Arisu Yuzuki. I absolutely won’t eat fatty pork belly!”</p>

<p>I can understand her point. However, leaving it in the refrigerator will only waste the food.</p>
<p>If she can neither go forward nor back, then let me be the one to cast aside that hesitation.</p>
<p>Besides——</p>

<p>I don’t want to see anyone collapse again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>First, cut the ‘Platinum Pork’ into thin slices, about five centimeters wide, and blanch them in boiling water. This will remove the excess fat, making even pork belly refreshing to eat.</p>
<p>Next, throw sesame oil, garlic paste, and ginger paste I brought from my house into a heated frying pan.</p>
<p>Once the aroma starts to rise, add in the diagonally sliced green onions, which were also stored in Tupperware from my home refrigerator.</p>
<p>Once they’ve slightly softened, add the pork belly that was boiled earlier and mix everything together with a spatula while occasionally shaking the pan.</p>

<p>Glancing sneakily at the low table behind me, I noticed Sasaki-san observing me intermittently while maintaining her seiza posture.</p>
<p>She resembled a stray cat showing interest in a cat toy, torn between instinct and caution.</p>
<p>It seems it’s true that humans cannot resist the allure of meat and spices.</p>

<p>Now, it’s time to finish up. I drizzle the special sauce—a mix of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and Chinese seasonings—over the sea of meat.</p>
<p>With a sizzling ovation, an appetite-stimulating flavor fills the room.</p>
<p>Glancing back again, I notice that the distance between Sasaki-san and me has closed by about fifty centimeters.</p>
<p>With that, the ingredients are complete.</p>
<p>Next up is the preparation of white rice, the absolute meat companion.</p>
<p>Since we can’t afford to cook rice from scratch now, I will use packaged rice this time.</p>
<p>I microwave the rice and shape it into a bowl form in the center of a pitch-black bowl, not forgetting to sandwich some seaweed in between.</p>
<p>Then, I heap a generous amount of meat from the frying pan onto it and add two slices of pickled daikon as a palate cleanser——</p>

<p>“Sutadon Pork Bowl, done.”</p>

<p>As I prepare the chopsticks and turn around, Sasaki-san hastily retreats and returns to her original position.</p>

<p>“Come on, eat it while it’s hot.”</p>

<p>Steam wafts gently from the bowl as I place it on the table.</p>
<p>Sasaki-san looks up at me while firmly biting her lip, her gaze sharp and intimidating as if she was a noble knight captured by a demon.</p>

<p>“Don’t make me say it again. I absolutely won’t eat it—”</p>
<p>-Grrrowl.</p>

<p>Completely different from when I heard it in the hallway, the beast in her stomach was now baring its true nature. Sasaki-san, as if struck by an electric shock, suddenly clutched her stomach and locked eyes with the pork bowl.</p>
<p>Then, a little devil appeared in the room (Me).</p>

<p>“Come on, come on, it’s a pork bowl made with brand-name meat. The grilled parts smell so good~”</p>
<p>“I must resist…”</p>
<p>“There’s plenty of meat, so you can have seconds~”</p>
<p>“Patience, patience…”</p>
<p>“There’s also mayonnaise and doubanjiang for changing the flavor~”</p>
<p>“Patience——!”</p>

<p>I came to deeply respect a girl named Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>
<p>A teenage girl with a big appetite, struggling valiantly against meat, white rice, and bowls.</p>
<p>The pain of being deprived of the common human pleasure of eating is something I can’t even begin to imagine.</p>

<p>“——Then, I’ll use my trump card.”</p>

<p>I raised the embodiment of white life that I had been hiding in my right hand.</p>

<p>“…!”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san’s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>This five centimeters in diameter object doesn’t possess much power on its own.</p>
<p>However, it is said that its power can increase by dozens to hundreds of times when combined with other food.</p>
<p>Its true identity is a chicken egg.</p>

<p>First, I used chopsticks to make a slight indentation in the center of the rice bowl.</p>
<p>Then, I cracked the egg by tapping it against the edge of the table and placed both thumbs into the crack.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a force pressed down on my arm from the left.</p>

<p>“…No. W-wait, please stop…”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san’s eyes were slightly moist as she took my arm.</p>
<p>I’m sorry, Sasaki-san.</p>

<p>I passed the egg to my right hand and assumed the same stance as a forkball.</p>

<p>“Stop it! Please! Anything but that…”</p>

<p>When I spread my thumb, index finger, and middle finger outward, a yellow devil descends from inside the shell.</p>
<p>-Plop.</p>

<p>An that moment, Sasaki-san’s mentality collapsed.</p>

<p>“Aaaaaaaaaahhh──!!”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san held the bowl with her left hand and plunged the chopsticks into the pork bowl with momentum.</p>
<p>The way she gazes at the clump of meat and rice lifted with the chopsticks evoked the image of a reunion with a long-lost family.</p>

<p>“Ahh… Aaahhhhh…”</p>

<p>Before long, the pork bowl was sucked into her small mouth.</p>
<p>The upper and lower lips met, and chewing began. As if to confirm, as if to remember, it was savored quietly. The abundant fat of the meat glistened and wet the thin, cherry-colored lips.</p>
<p>After swallowing with a gulp, the next moment.</p>

<p>“…Aaaannhhhhhhhh♥♥”</p>

<p>A meltingly tender voice rivaling the braised pork belly escaped from Sasaki-san’s lips.</p>

<p>“…?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t hide my bewilderment at the sudden sweet roar that echoed through the room.</p>

<p>“I can’t… I can’t take it anymore…♥”</p>

<p>Her behavior, her expression, everything was reversed.</p>
<p>Her eating speed suddenly increased, and the egg and sauce richly entwined with the meat &amp; rice were sliding down Sasaki-san’s throat as if racing each other.</p>

<p>“The fatty yet refreshing pork is gently coated by the egg, making it slide down with the rice so smoothly…♥ The bold punch of garlic and the refreshing zing of ginger come at me, accelerating my appetite the more I eat♥——”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san becomes eloquent enough to make a food critics blush. Her eyes are completely enraptured.</p>
<p>Could it be that I have unleashed a terrible monster?</p>

<p>“——The crispiness of the green onions with the aroma of sesame oil is comforting as it wafts up with every bite… The seaweed laid between the rice asserts its presence firmly, with everything enhancing each other… The yellow of the egg, the brown of the meat, the white of the rice. This contrast is practically an aurora. Ahh, who would have thought you could do stargazing inside a bowl of rice…♥”</p>
<p>” … “</p>
<p>“The taste change with doubanjiang is nice♥ The mellow ingredients become spicy and tight, making you want to pick up your chopsticks again♥ …And just when your stomach lets its guard down, the creaminess of mayonnaise comes back♥”</p>

<p>I was sure I had cooked off all the alcohol from the cooking sake, but here’s a pretend drunk in front of me.</p>
<p>I’ve seen many men with this kind of buzz at my parents’ izakaya.</p>

<p>“Hehe, I haven’t forgotten about you Takuan-san (Daikon Radish.)♥ I saved it for halftime♥ Mmm, the crunchy sound that echoes deep in the ears is fun. Since the sweetness and saltiness are mild, you can focus on the texture of the radish♥”</p>

<p>Two chopsticks are overloaded with pork and rice.</p>
<p>Sasaki-san opens her mouth wide and eagerly transports my special sutadon pork bowl into her mouth.</p>

<p><em>Munch- munch- crunch- crunch- chomp- chomp-</em></p>
<p><em>Puff- puff- chew- chew- slurp- slurp-</em></p>
<p><em>Munch- munch- crunch- crunch-, crunch-</em></p>
<p><em>Fluff- fluff- puff- puff- sizzle- sizzle- sizzle-</em></p>

<p><em>Clank-</em></p>

<p>“Give me another serving!”</p>

<p>With an empty bowl in hand, Sasaki-san had a grain of rice stuck to the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>Oblivious to it, Sasaki-san requested a second serving of pork bowl.</p>

<p>An idol who highly values her appearance was looking at me with the innocent and reckless gaze of a child.</p>


<p>“Here you go.”</p>
<p>“Thank you!”</p>

<p>As if she were entrusted with a precious treasure, Sasaki-san received the bowl with both hands.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, like a fan extending their hand to an idol at a handshake event.</p>

<p>It seemed as if I no longer existed in her eyes; her gaze was fixed straight on the bowl.</p>
<p>If she’s that focused on the meal, then that’s all I could wish for.</p>
<p>She licked her lips and adjusted her chopsticks. Even though it was her second serving, her excitement hadn’t faded in the slightest.</p>

<p>“Then, once again, let’s eat… hhnggh~~♥”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san, with her mouth full of pork bowl, fluttered her feet and let her joy explode.</p>

<p>“The pork, the rice, the sauce——everything’s amazing~!”</p>

<p>If you enjoy it this much, then it is worth making it.</p>
<p>I think I’ve finally come to understand why my parents, who run a restaurant, are so devoted to their work.</p>

<p>“Mamori-kun is amazing!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, my name is called.</p>
<p>I thought she had completely forgotten about my existence.</p>

<p>“The moment I ate it, I knew——Ah, this person really wants to make others happy from the bottom of his heart.”</p>

<p>As I widen my eyes, I reflect on the history of how cooking became a habit for me.</p>
<p>Because of my father, I wanted to serve delicious food to people. I wanted to make them happy.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, I have served my cooking to friends and acquaintances many times.</p>
<p>Everyone enjoyed the meals and sweets I made, and I felt a sense of fulfillment.</p>
<p>But it was the first time someone, Sasaki-san, looked at me, not just my cooking.</p>

<p>“…Why did you think that?”</p>
<p>“I understand. After all, I also do my job to make people happy.”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san’s praise doesn’t sound like flattery.</p>
<p>Her expression is filled with compassion that almost resembles the Virgin Mary’s.</p>

<p>“The carefully prepared pork, the bite-sized pieces of leek, the perfectly seasoned pickled radish. Every time I swallow, I can feel Mamori-kun’s consideration.”</p>

<p>I wonder why. Since a while ago, Sasaki-san’s smile and gestures become more vivid every time she praises me.</p>
<p>——I find myself unable to take my eyes off her.</p>

<p>“I’ll say it again and again. Mamori-kun, you are amazing!”</p>

<p>The warmth that was lit inside my chest spread rapidly as Sasaki-san stared at me with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>My heart was racing.</p>
<p>As if asserting its existence, it shouts life loudly at the center of my body.</p>

<p>No way, this can’t be true, right?</p>
<p>All I did was make some food and have her eat it.</p>

<p>Sasaki-san once again focused her attention on the pork bowl… she was completely captivated by it.</p>
<p>She moves her chopsticks frantically, chewing with a smile and narrowing her eyes, even the sound of her swallowing the food seems joyful.</p>
<p>And with the last bite thrown into her mouth, Sasaki-san murmured in an ecstatic voice.</p>

<p>“Ahh, this is happiness…”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san had a relaxed expression as if she had forgotten that she was an idol.</p>
<p>Her cheeks flushed, her mouth slightly open, and her eyes looked dreamy.</p>

<p>Happiness, huh?</p>
<p>The single phrase that must have slipped out of her mouth unconsciously became an arrow that pierced my heart.</p>

<img007

<p>Mamori Suzufumi, sixteen years old. Soon to be a second-year high school student.</p>
<p>The object of my first love was an idol.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>

<p>“Aaaaah, I’ve done it…”</p>

<p>From the height of bliss to a sudden plunge of despair, Sasaki-san was grinding her head against the table.</p>

<p>“Ugh, it’s all because of you, Mamori-kun…!”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p>

<p>While clearing the tableware from the table, I put on the bravest face I could manage.</p>
<p>The pounding in my chest showed no signs of subsiding.</p>
<p>Facing Sasaki-san’s resentful glare, I finally met her eyes and responded with a sigh.</p>

<p>“Don’t overdo it. Besides, other idols must eat normally too, right?”</p>

<p>Before becoming a hobby or a pastime, eating was an essential part of life.</p>
<p>However, at my casually thrown-out phrase, Sasaki-san furrows her brows.</p>

<p>“…it’s because the same effort as other people is not enough.”</p>

<p>Her voice gains a slight firmness.</p>

<p>“What I’m aiming for is the pinnacle of being an idol. It’s a place I might not reach even if I put in tens or hundreds of times more effort than someone else. Effort alone is surely not enough, but that’s exactly why I want to do all the effort I can. I don’t want to make any compromises.”</p>

<p>It was a strong tone, as if she was trying to encourage herself.</p>

<p>“My parents met at an idol event. They both loved idols, and we have a lot of DVDs at home. I grew up watching live concert DVDs since I was little——”</p>

<p>The more Sasaki-san spoke, the more passionate her words became.</p>

<p>“——When I was little, every day was boring. I couldn’t find any interest in the TV dramas or streaming videos that my classmates were obsessed with. So, I would randomly pick an idol DVD from the shelf at home and watch it without much thought after school to kill time. The girls on the screen were always smiling, singing, and dancing perfectly. I eventually became completely engrossed in what started as a way to pass the time.”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san spoke passionately about the idol’s charm. She seemed just like any other fan preaching about their favorite idol.</p>
<p>Even though she herself is an idol, I guess she still loves idols so much that she can’t help it.</p>

<p>“It’s not just about having good looks——A voice that touches the heart, dance that enhances the song, expressions and gestures that embody the lyrics, and a star quality that captivates the people. All of these are important elements that make an idol shine, and because none of them are missing, they are perfect idols, so I can’t help but aspire to be like them. I wanted to shine on the same stage as them——that’s why I became an idol.”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san places her hand on her chest and closes her eyes.</p>
<p>With those closed eyes, the images of thousands of idols must be floating in her mind.</p>

<p>“You see, an ‘idol’ is called ‘guuzou (偶像)’ in Japanese. It means something that is the object of faith or worship or an existence that is admired. An idol is the embodiment of everyone’s ideals.”</p>

<p>Her eyes opened, and Sasaki-san’s gaze was directly fixed on me.</p>

<p>“I also want to be such an idol. An idol that was so dazzling that it clouded anyone’s rationality. For that reason, I don’t want to do anything half-heartedly. I can’t let my appetite get the better of me.”</p>

<p>Sasaki Yuzuki is striving to meet everyone’s expectations as an idol named Arisu Yuzuki.</p>
<p>I sincerely admire that attitude, and as her neighbor, I want to support her quietly in my own way.</p>


<p>“…But neglecting meals is not good.”</p>

<p>My muttered remark was gently picked up by Sasaki-san.</p>

<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>

<p>There was no anger in her voice. She seemed simply perplexed.</p>

<p>“…It’s the usual story. When I was in elementary school, my father was hospitalized for malnutrition. He worked for what you’d call a ‘black company’. He worked late every day and apparently hardly ate proper meals.”</p>

<p>According to what I heard later, his weight was fifteen kilograms less than the average at that time.</p>

<p>“One morning, he suddenly collapsed in the entranceway and was rushed to the hospital. At that time, I was so worried that my father might die that I felt like I wasn’t even alive myself.”</p>

<p>Now, it seems like he’s eating properly, partly because he’s developing new menus, and since mom is with him, I’m not too worried.</p>
<p>If anything, Dad’s been looking a bit chubby lately.</p>

<p>“It’s not like I’m saying you should get much fatter. I just want Sasaki-san to eat three proper meals a day before you start your idol activities.”</p>
<p>“I understand what Mamori-kun is saying. But this is a matter of priorities. For me, the most important thing is to remain the ideal idol. To say that meals are the least of my priorities is not an exaggeration. Rather than spending time on food, I want to practice singing and dancing.”</p>
<p>“Then let me take care of your meals. I’ll prepare them properly for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and I’ll even include snacks. Anyway, you can’t keep pretending you’re not hungry.”</p>

<p>I’m not trying to curry favor or get money, let alone get close to an idol.</p>
<p>It’s simply a matter of there being nothing more important than health.</p>
<p>—But she quietly shook her head.</p>

<p>“This isn’t something I can’t endure. Starting tomorrow, I’ll take supplements to keep an eye on my nutritional balance.”</p>

<p>I can’t just leave a problem child who might collapse again at any moment alone.</p>
<p>If she were to lose consciousness at a train platform or at a busy intersection, her life could be in real danger.</p>

<p>“No, but still…”</p>

<p>Perhaps frustrated by my persistence, Sasaki-san’s gaze turned stern.</p>

<p>“Enough, it’s none of your business. Just leave me alone!”</p>

<p>Tsun-, Sasaki-san turned away her face with a ‘hmmph’ and pushed the empty bowl aside with her hand.</p>

<p>…what, seriously? You’re saying that after eating two bowls?</p>

<p>I sat directly in front of Sasaki-san, gazing intently at her beautiful face.</p>

<p>I’m not a fan of Arisu Yuzuki.</p>
<p>As a neighbor, I’m purely concerned for Sasaki Yuzuki’s well-being.</p>
<p>Especially if it’s someone you like, it’s only natural to wish for their health.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, I’ll force my way in. If you don’t let me in, I won’t hesitate to leave deliveries at your door. Are you okay with that? I’ll leave them at your door, morning, noon, and night. Three meals a day, seven days a week, without fail! If there’s no space left, I’ll cram it into your mailbox! If the mailbox is full, I’ll send it by courier!”</p>

<p>You shouldn’t underestimate me, who proudly took first place in the ‘Likely to Become a Nagging-in-law in the Future’ ranking in the junior high school graduation album, surpassing all the girls in my class.</p>

<p>“That look in your eyes…It doesn’t seem like a joke”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m serious.”</p>

<p>Inside my heart, my fighting spirit is blazing fiercely.</p>
<p>No matter what Sasaki-san might say, I don’t intend to back down one bit.</p>

<p>“…I see. Hmm, I got it. You’re serious, Mamori-kun.”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san nods deeply as if she’s made a decision and closes the distance between us.</p>

<p>Then, she slowly extends her right hand towards me.</p>
<p>It seems my passion has reached her.</p>
<p>She wants to exchange a handshake, a sign of friendship.</p>

<p>The moment I stretched out my right arm—</p>

<p>“Then——”</p>

<p>My right hand’s freedom was lost, enveloped by both of Sasaki-san’s hands.</p>
<p>It was as if it were a scene from a handshake event.</p>

<p>“I’ll make Suzufumi my fan!”</p>

<p>An idol with an invincible smile was right in front of me.</p>

<p>“…Yes?”</p>

<p>When I held her in the corridor, her hand was as white and cold as porcelain, but now it was a mass of heat.</p>
<p>Boiling emotions seemed to surge, flowing from the palm of her hand into my heart.</p>

<p>“I’m saying I’ll make you my fan, Suzufumi.”</p>
<p>“…No-no, I don’t get what you mean.”</p>

<p>Why has she changed how she’s calling me?</p>
<p>Besides, if I had to choose between liking and disliking her, I would say I already like her.</p>

<p>“By the way, Suzufumi, do you know the origin of the word ‘fan (ファン)’?”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san lifted the corners of her lips as if to ask me to try and guess.</p>

<p>“Eh, isn’t from ‘fun (Ｆｕｎ)’ which means ‘fun (楽しい)’?”</p>
<p>“Buzz- The correct answer is from ‘Fanatic (Ｆａｎａｔｉｃ)’, which means ‘an enthusiastic person’ or ‘devotee.’ “</p>

<p>Despite being incorrect, Sasaki-san seemed rather amused.</p>
<p>She wagged her finger and go, tsk- tsk- tsk-</p>

<p>“You can support your idols in any way you like, it’s fine to listen to their music, go to live concerts and handshake events or buy photo books. But you see, a fan never crosses the line. They properly maintain the boundary between the ‘idol as an image’ and the ‘real person’, and enjoying themselves within the rules—that’s the proper figure of a fan.”</p>

<p>Unable to foresee where the conversation was heading, I tilted my head in confusion.</p>

<p>“It’s absolutely outrageous for fans to fuss over their favorite’s health and serve them homemade meals. To put it more bluntly, it’s just meddling. Currently, Suzufumi is a ‘neighbor,’ not a ‘fan.’ It’s because we’re equals that you try to take care of this and that. If that’s the case, you’ll obediently listen to my requests if I make you a ‘fanatic’ , right?”</p>

<p>I see, if you’re a blindly devoted fan, you’d obediently follow along and not try to intrude on the idol’s private life.</p>
<p>Knowing your place and maintaining a proper distance is what exemplifies a model fan.</p>
<p>If someone selfishly oversteps, they’re not a fan but just a stalker.</p>

<p>At least, the logic is sound.</p>
<p>But there was one miscalculation on Sasaki-san’s part.</p>
<p>That is… the fact that I had already fallen in love not with the idol, Arisu Yuzuki, but with my neighbor, Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“…In that case, I’ll make meals for you every day, Yuzuki.”</p>

<p>I gently released the hand I was holding and stood up, calling the idol in front of me by her first name as if interacting with someone close to me in private.</p>

<p>——If you’re going to make me fall as a fan, then I’ll corrupt you with my cooking.</p>
<p>I can’t stand the idea of sacrificing your life just to play the perfect idol.</p>

<p>“I’ll make Yuzuki fall for my cooking so much that she won’t be able to live without my meals!”</p>

<p>Crossing my arms like a stubborn ramen shop owner, I smirked with a hint of nihilism.</p>

<p>“…I see. Are you saying you want to go head-to-head with me in earnest?”</p>

<p>Accepting my declaration of war, flames of fighting spirit began to flicker and rise behind Sasaki-san.</p>

<p>“There’s no way I can let a girl in the middle of her growth spurt go through excessive dietary restrictions. I’ll break Yuzuki’s pride to pieces with my cooking, and eventually, she’ll be begging for a pork bowl on her own!”</p>

<p>Sasaki-san is… Yuzuki stood up, responding to my sardonic smile with the same expression.</p>

<p>“It’s pointless. It’s true that today’s pork bowl was very satisfying, but that means my appetite has been completely fulfilled. I won’t give in again!”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying there’s no problem if I bring you food again?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>I don’t miss the moment of her vulnerability, so I quickly go on the offensive.</p>

<p>“You said you won’t give in, right? Oh, is Yuzuki’s noble conviction as an idol so easily broken just by the temptation of food?”</p>
<p>“O-of course not!”</p>
<p>“You seem a little weak. You don’t have to push yourself, you know?”</p>
<p>“I’m not pushing myself! You’re always welcome!”</p>

<p>Good, I got her word.</p>

<p>“Hmph, are you really okay, Suzufumi? I wonder how long you can keep your composure when a popular idol approaches you?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki pointed at me and then snorted with a smirk.</p>

<p>“Bring it on. I’ll easily deal with those idol moves.”</p>

<p>We stare at each other, eyes locked in a fierce gaze.</p>

<p>“I will make Suzufumi fall for me as a fan with my charm.”</p>
<p>“I will make Yuzuki fall for my cooking.”</p>

<img009

<p>Without a doubt, this is a serious battle.</p>
<p>There will be only one winner, and the loser must bend their beliefs and offer their heart to the other.</p>

<p>The gong for the start of the match rings out.</p>
<p>Thus, the battle wagering stomach and heart between the idol and the high school boy begins.</p>
