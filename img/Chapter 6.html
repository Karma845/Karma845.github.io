<h3>Round 6: Hurry Up And Make It❤️</h3>

<p>The cherry blossoms have completely fallen, and it’s the time when the young leaves are ready for the next light.</p>
<p>The temperature is gradually rising, and even though it’s still late April, the number of days reaching summer-like heat is increasing.</p>
<p>For these past two weeks or so, I haven’t been attacked by a man claiming to be a fan of Arisu Yuzuki, nor have I come across Mikami-sensei nuzzling Yuzuki’s seat.</p>
<p>My classmates teasing about my confessions has also settled down, and my daily life has completely regained its calm.</p>

<p>Every day, as usual, I prepare meals for two and then charge over to the house next door, where my neighbor, while showing signs of resistance, eventually falls.</p>
<p>It’s been quite peaceful days.</p>

<p>On a Sunday before Golden Week, I finished my homework first thing in the morning and was enjoying a relaxing holiday.</p>

<p>Ding- Dong-</p>
<p>The doorbell of my home rings.</p>
<p>I haven’t received any notice about ingredients arriving from Dad, and the couple in room 808 has been out since morning.</p>
<p>That leaves two possibilities for the identity of the person ringing the doorbell.</p>
<p>The brown-haired gal who’s my childhood friend or the popular idol next door.</p>
<p>What appeared on the monitor was the latter.</p>

<p>As I opened the door, I lit a small fire of caution.</p>
<p>The last time Yuzuki rang our doorbell, she was holding a photo book.</p>
<p>That day, I was confronted with her changing into a swimsuit right before my eyes, got to touch her stomach, and the atmosphere turned weird in various ways; it was quite a lot to handle.</p>
<p>I wish she wouldn’t underestimate the fragility of an adolescent boy.</p>

<p>“Good morning, is something the matter?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, dressed in a plain knit top and denim pants, was fidgeting for some reason. With her hands clasped behind her back, she was clearly hiding something.</p>

<p>“S-Suzufumi, are you, like… dumb?”</p>

<p>What is this, some new kind of teasing?</p>

<p>“No, I mean, I was wondering if you’re good at studying?”</p>

<p>Peeking behind Yuzuki, I saw that she was clutching reference books and printouts.</p>

<p>“…Could it be that you want me to teach you?”</p>

<p>Hiding her face with the textbook, Yuzuki mumbled restlessly.</p>

<p>“…I’ll give Suzufumi the right.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“The right to a date with an idol for a day. Yes, this is a strategy to make Suzufumi fall for me as a fan. A sophisticated technique to make Suzufumi’s heart race by studying closely together at a desk…”<br />“Confess honestly.”</p>
<p>“Confess the truth.”</p>

<p>Caught off guard, Yuzuki hesitated for a moment but then began to mumble excuses again.</p>

<p>“That, I haven’t been able to attend school much, and I’ve been leaving early a lot… Technically, I’m allowed to submit assignments as a sort of relief, but despite being called a relief, they have no mercy. By that I mean the volume is not normal, like it’s absolutely impossible to finish alone…”</p>
<p>“Then why not get together with your friends from your class and have a study group?”</p>
<p>“That’s not good. I don’t want to sell myself as a dumb idol character, besides… there are kids I talk to normally when I go to school, but it feels weird to call them up on a day off. If you ask me if we’re close enough to do assignments together, it’s kind of iffy…”</p>

<p>Although the eyes and mouth are hidden, the ears peeking out from the textbook are dyed red.</p>
<p>Because of her embarrassment, she must have hesitated many times before coming to me.</p>
<p>Even now, she’s desperately mustering up courage.</p>

<p>“…Alright. By the way, about your question earlier, I was ranked twentieth in the year-end tests last year.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s expression brightens up instantly.</p>
<p>Seeing such a childlike expression makes me really feel that she’s younger.</p>

<p>“So, from now at my house…”</p>
<p>“Oh, sorry. I have some things I need to do at home right now. Is it okay if we do it at my place?”</p>

<p>A brief pause ensued.</p>

<p>“…what? Ah, yeah, sure?”</p>
<p>“Okay. Then, come on in.”</p>
<p>“Um, I’ll just go get a few things ready…”</p>
<p>“Got it. See you later then.”</p>

<p>Just before the door closed, she muttered to herself, ‘It’s not like there’s anything to worry about now… and probably nothing happened with Kishibe-san either…’</p>
<p>What’s that? Well, whatever.</p>

<p>——The thing is, Yuzuki probably didn’t know that the corners of my lips were turned up into a smirk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p> </p>

<p>“Sorry for bothering you…”</p>

<p>Like a cat wary of strangers, Yuzuki shrinks her body as she enters the living room.</p>


<p>“Your place is kind of simple. It’s so Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>That’s the same for both of us. There were hardly any decorative items in Yuzuki’s room either.</p>

<p>“Well then, shall we get started? Here’s some oolong tea. It’s strong and delicious because I used plenty of tea leaves.”</p>

<p>After placing the glasses, we sat facing each other at the living room’s low table.</p>
<p>It seems English is the main subject.</p>

<p>“So, where do you want to start?”</p>
<p>“Um, it’s this part of the printout but… huh?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki looks around——That was quicker than I thought.</p>
<p>An unidentified sense of discomfort must have enveloped Yuzuki by now.</p>

<p>Whether she liked it or not, she would notice it eventually when she reached the innermost part of the room.</p>
<p>But it’s too late. The front door has been locked tightly with the chain in place, and I’ve subtly moved her smartphone out of reach.</p>
<p>Even if she tried to call for help, it wouldn’t reach anyone; the elderly couple in Room 808 left for a trip to Oita this morning.</p>
<p>No matter how much she screams, her voice won’t be heard by anyone.</p>

<p>“…Suzufumi? Why are you smiling?”</p>
<p>“Don’t mind me. Let’s just start with the assignment.”</p>

<p>As I reached for the printout, Yuzuki quickly withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>“…Maybe I should just go home. I think I have to do this kind of thing on my own…”</p>
<p>“Don’t be shy. Here, why don’t you have some oolong tea and clear your head?”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>

<p>Silence dominated the room.</p>
<p>The sound of the ventilation fan felt unusually loud.</p>

<p>“…Suzufumi, are you…”</p>

<p>As Yuzuki suddenly stood up, I quickly grabbed her arm.</p>

<p>“…how could I let you run away?”</p>

<p>I’m sure my reflection in the mirror must be wearing a vulgar smile.</p>

<p>“N-no, stop… please… let me go…!”</p>

<p>Tears quickly began to pool in Yuzuki’s eyes, and before long, Yuzuki let out a scream-like voice——</p>

<p>“——But you’re making ‘Homemade Jiro’ ramen!”</p>

<p>I gently let go of her hand and moved to the kitchen.</p>
<p>On the stove were two large pots.</p>
<p>In one, a massive amount of vegetables, pork bones, and back fat were boiling vigorously to extract the soup.</p>
<p>In the other pot, chashu pork was boiled together with green onions.</p>

<p>The intense smell, which the home’s ventilation fan could hardly eliminate, violently shook my brain.</p>

<p>“This kind of elaborate cooking can only be done on a day off. The extra-thick noodles made with strong flour, a staple of Jiro-style, also need to be prepared and rested the day before.”</p>

<p>Ramen Jiromaru. Commonly known as ‘Jiromaru.’ A ramen chain that enjoys fervent support from men all over the world.</p>
<p>Its most defining features are the overwhelming sense of volume that can’t be summed up by the word ‘mega-serving’ and the intense flavoring that’s loaded with umami seasonings, putting health second.</p>
<p>The toppings also include a violent lineup of garlic, back fat, and thick-cut chashu. The taste of Jiromaru ramen.</p>
<p>There is also a genre known as “Jiro-inspired” or “Jiro-style,” which revolves around the volume as a basis for unique adaptations.</p>
<p>The original Jiromaru ramen place always has long queues, and the flavor is said to be addictive, leading many to try and replicate the taste and quantity of Jiro-style ramen at home.</p>
<p>That’s the essence of ‘Homemade Jiro.’</p>

<p>“Yuzuki, it’s up to you whether to eat or not, but I don’t know if you can resist the violent visuals of homemade Jiro after you’ve finished your assignments and are completely exhausted.”</p>

<p>Moreover, the smell of meat and fat constantly wafts in the living room while she’s furiously working with the mechanical pencil.</p>
<p>No matter how much she tries to resist, her brain will inevitably submit.</p>

<p>The calorie demon presented as a ‘reward for finishing your assignments’ to someone whose judgment is impaired from study fatigue.</p>
<p>Who could overcome such a temptation?</p>

<p>I declared in front of Yuzuki, who sat down with her legs neatly folded——</p>

<p>“Now, let’s start studying.”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>For the first hour, Yuzuki focused solely on the task without glancing aside.</p>
<p>Perhaps to overcome her instincts, she didn’t let the world outside the table enter her field of vision.</p>

<p>The study session itself was going smoothly.</p>
<p>As expected of someone who usually sings and dances, Yuzuki had a good memory.</p>
<p>She quickly grasped what she was taught and even had the adaptability to solve application problems on her own.</p>

<p>However, studying in an environment filled with the smell of Jiromaru steadily eroded Yuzuki’s mental state.</p>
<p>Her eyes became vacant, and her focus blurred.</p>
<p>When I peeked at her notebook to see what she had been writing so enthusiastically, I was horrified to see ‘Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-Jiromaru-‘, all over the page as if she was copying sutras.</p>

<p>As the sun began to set amidst all this, Yuzuki seemed to have finally reached her limit due to the vast amount of knowledge crammed in and the repeated temptations of foods.</p>
<p>Her eyes, which were in a state of collapse, began to swirl, and she opened and closed her mouth.</p>

<p>“…I… can’t…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I can’t take it anymore!”</p>

<p>With a declaration of surrender, Yuzuki went ‘pop’ and deflated.</p>
<p>She dropped her mechanical pencil and collapsed headfirst onto the table.</p>
<p>Shaking her shoulder did nothing; she didn’t move at all, as if time had been suspended around the table.</p>

<p>“H-hey, are you okay?”</p>

<p>When she finally raised her head, Yuzuki’s eyes were fixed on me.</p>
<p>Like a carnivorous beast, she was emitting a sharp glare.</p>

<p>“…how about we call it a day and have dinner?”</p>

<p>It was the moment my Operation Homemade Jiro succeeded.</p>
<p>However, there was a reason I couldn’t be completely happy about it.</p>

<p>“….Rejected. The deadline is tomorrow, so no meals until everything is done.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t fully enjoy my beloved Jiro-style ramen unfinished assignments hanging over us.</p>

<p>“Eating a meal would be a good change of pace. It’ll boost your motivation too.”</p>
<p>“If you eat ramen, you’ll definitely get sleepy. No way.”</p>

<p>I scolded Yuzuki, who was urging me to eat. Our roles were reversed from usual.</p>
<p>Truth be told, I too wanted to throw the textbooks aside and start preparing dinner right away.</p>
<p>But with assignments still remaining, it was clear which should take priority.</p>

<p>“I’ve been taught everything I didn’t understand, so I can do the rest on my own. Considering the time it’ll take to clean up, shouldn’t we start getting ready now?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a problem. Anyway, the large pot will be soaked and washed tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Come on… even if we leave the washing for tomorrow, there are still plenty of household chores left undone today. Let’s quickly eat and then enjoy some free time…”</p>

<p>Before I knew it, Yuzuki had moved next to me and began whispering in my ear.</p>
<p>My whole body tingled—my thoughts scattered.</p>
<p>Unlike Yuzuki, who has been glued to the table the whole time, I’ve been standing by the pot periodically, so my accumulated cravings are huge.</p>
<p>I’m also desperately holding back my appetite, which can explode at any moment.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you tired? You’ve been teaching me all day. Suzufumi, you’re amazing.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, she patted my head.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I’m not used to being praised, my consciousness concentrates on my head.</p>

<p>“The rich soup that directly stimulates the stomach, the thick and chewy noodles, the strong hit of minced garlic, the meaty shoulder roast chashu… You don’t have to hold back anymore. Homemade Jiro is meant to be enjoyed whenever you like——”</p>

<p>My vision blurs, and a haze forms in my head.</p>
<p>My ability to think fades away—I want to give up.</p>

<p>“I, I am…”</p>

<p>As if delivering the final blow, Yuzuki’s lips come to zero distance from my ear.</p>

<img13

<p>“Hurry up and make it♥”</p>

<p>Accompanied by a light sigh, her sweet voice overwrites the command system in my brain.</p>

<p>“…Yes”</p>

<p>I stand up and stagger toward the kitchen.</p>
<p>The emulsification process that unifies the soup and fat was just about to finish as if it had been timed for our meal.</p>

<p>What I took out of the fridge was the extra-thick noodles I had prepared the night before. They contain a lot of wheat husk, offering a unique flavour.</p>
<p>I throw them into boiling water and cook them ‘al dente’.</p>

<p>For the sauce, I use a ratio of 1 part dark soy sauce, mirin, and umami seasoning to 5 parts emulsified soup.</p>
<p>Into this, I add three hundred grams of noodles, which is about twice the amount used in a normal serving of ramen.</p>
<p>After flipping the noodles to mix them in, it’s time for the toppings.</p>
<p>A generous amount of bean sprouts and roughly chopped cabbage boiled until slightly wilted were added.</p>
<p>A small amount of kaeshi (seasoning) is poured over the noodles to blend the flavors. Then it’s time to crown the noodles.</p>
<p>I ask Yuzuki, who is watching me cook over my shoulder,</p>

<p>“Should I add garlic?” (Ninniku iremasu ka?)</p>

<p>This is a confirmation of toppings at a Jiro-style or Jiro-inspired ramen shop.</p>
<p>Call out “yasai” for a mountain of bean sprouts and cabbage.</p>
<p>Call out “ninniku” for a generous amount of chopped garlic.</p>
<p>Call out “abura” for a graceful sprinkling of pork fat.</p>
<p>If you call out “Karame” to have extra seasoning poured over the top.</p>
<p>Say “Mashi” or “Mashimashi” for an even larger portion.</p>
<p>When you want more meat, you buy tickets like “Buta” or “ō buta.”</p>
<p>Although there are some differences depending on the store, these calls are synonymous with Jiro-style ramen.</p>
<p>Eventually, Yuzuki speaks up.</p>

<p>“——Yasai ninniku mashimashi abura karamé mashi, ō buta daburu(double) de” </p>

<p>It was a very confident call without any hesitation.</p>
<p>First, I started piling up the slightly wilted vegetables into the bowl with tongs.</p>
<p>The peak of this vegetable mountain easily exceeded thirty centimeters in height.</p>
<p>Next to the vegetables, I place a chunk of chopped garlic, about the size of a toddler’s fist.</p>
<p>Then, eight slices of pork shoulder chashu were placed alongside. The boldly cut pork was thoroughly marinated in the sauce.</p>
<p>Finally, the abura. Roughly crushed, melt-in-your-mouth back fat was evenly sprinkled on top.</p>

<p>The ramen, adorned with white specks all over, looked like a snow fairy.</p>


<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting. Here’s your ‘Yasai ninniku mashimashi abura karamé mashi, ō buta daburu(double) de”</p>
<p>(Extra vegetables, extra garlic, extra fat, seasoned extra, large pork double.)</p>

<p>The moment the bowl was set on the table, Yuzuki audibly gulped.</p>
<p>Her hands, gripping the chopsticks, were trembling like those of a junkie.</p>
<p>Her breathing was ragged like a beast starved for flesh and blood.</p>

<p>The bowl that sat before us was like an oasis that had suddenly appeared in a desert.</p>
<p>It was a blessing for both Yuzuki and me, tired from studying.</p>
<p>” “Itadakimasu!!” “</p>

<p>We simultaneously plunged our chopsticks into the bowl.</p>
<p>But there’s no way we’re going to start eating the noodles first.</p>
<p>We started with the vegetables drenched in back fat.</p>

<p>“The vegetables mixed with fat and seasoning really stimulate the stomach.”</p>

<p>The charm of the fat and sauce is brought out even more because of bean sprouts and cabbage, which have a weak flavor on their own.</p>
<p>Yuzuki is silently wolfing down the mountain of vegetables. Even with lips glistening from the oil, there’s no sign of concern, just single-mindedly stuffing her face.</p>
<p>After managing to get nearly half of the vegetables into her stomach in one go, she finally exhales.</p>

<p>“The back fat is packed with sweetness…♥ Even the vegetables alone make a decent side dish…♥”</p>

<p>Next, Yuzuki reached for the thickly sliced chashu.</p>

<p>“Wow, it melts in your mouth the moment you eat it~♥ The flavor is so thoroughly infused that juice and umami overflow with each bite♥ After my mouth gets all creamy, drinking a strong oolong tea will refresh everything—it’s great♥”</p>

<p>I haven’t yet touched the chashu, leaving it submerged at the bottom of the bowl.</p>
<p>Doing this allows it to soak up the soup’s essence, making it even more tender.</p>
<p>I reach the noodles first. As I lift the firm noodles, the soup bursts out.</p>

<p>“This chewy texture is precisely the essence of Jiro-style ramen. They bounce around in your mouth as if they’re alive.”</p>
<p>“They have a smooth texture because they’re coated with a layer of fat. It’s a very filling dish, but they slide right off the tongue like udon♥”</p>

<p>Halfway through the meal, sweat started to appear on my forehead.</p>
<p>No matter how much I wiped it off with a handkerchief, it kept coming out, so eventually, I started wiping it with my arm.</p>
<p>Yuzuki sitting opposite me seemed to feel the heat too. The large sweat beads on her face looked somewhat glamorous.</p>
<p>The mountain of garlic, a symbol of Jiro-style ramen, is said to promote sweating and stimulate adrenaline secretion.</p>
<p>Before we knew it, we were grinning strangely while devouring the ramen.</p>
<p>Tired from studying, the long-awaited homemade Jiro ramen and the intake of a large amount of garlic on an empty stomach were enough to lead us into a trance state.</p>

<p>Then, in the latter half of the meal, an incident occurred.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Yuzuki put down her chopsticks and traced her lips with her finger.</p>
<p>Even the usually unfazed Yuzuki find it difficult to finish this Jiro-style ramen?</p>
<p>Just when I thought something like that, Yuzuki crossed her arms and grabbed the hem of her T-shirt.</p>

<p>“…?”</p>

<p>I recognized this move—It was the same one she made during the ‘Yakisoba Incident’, when she changed into her swimsuit.</p>

<p>“Nnmh, there we go.”</p>

<p>Of course, she wasn’t hiding a swimsuit underneath this time.</p>
<p>Instead of the light blue bikini, what appeared was a pale pink camisole. The only thing supporting her upper body were two thin straps.</p>
<p>Her shoulders and the area around her armpits were exposed, glistening with sweat.</p>

<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>Damn, a noodle went into my windpipe. I quickly wash it down with oolong tea.</p>
<p>Calm down. It’s not like it’s a bra or anything.</p>
<p>The area of skin it covers is much larger compared to the midriff-baring Y2K fashion I see around town.</p>

<p>“It’s so hot…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki fans herself with her hand, and a faint sheen of sweat glistens under her arms and on her skin.</p>

<p>“…What? Stop peeking.”</p>
<p>“Ah, s-sorry.”</p>

<p>Impossible!</p>
<p>For an adolescent boy who has never properly seen the underwear of the opposite sex, a camisole might as well be a huge target like a bra.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yuzuki, unconcerned with my flustered state, resumes eating.</p>
<p>The gesture of tucking her hair behind her ear, the glimpse of her side, the sweaty ‘décolletage’——</p>
<p>——Even though I try to concentrate on my ramen, my gaze is irresistibly drawn to the person across the table.</p>

<p>As Yuzuki bites into the tender chashu, soup and meat juices burst out.</p>
<p>She wipes the drips from her chin with the back of her hand and licks it off with the tip of her tongue.</p>
<p>Her slurping of the noodles is vigorous, puckering her lips and sucking them up in one go.</p>
<p>The glossy noodles leave a mark of oil like rouge on her lips.</p>
<p>The noodles in front of me had completely lost their firmness.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the meal!”</p>

<p>Gulping down the glass of oolong tea in one go, Yuzuki let out a big sigh.</p>
<p>Apart from the soup, not a single bean sprout was left in the bowl.</p>
<p>I, too, managed to finish eating while fighting off my worldly desires——then we both collapsed into the living room.</p>

<p>“We ate again… But it couldn’t be helped today…!”</p>

<p>As she fell, Yuzuki’s camisole flipped up, revealing her navel.</p>
<p>Despite eating so much, her stomach isn’t swollen at all.</p>
<p>Yuzuki then gently stroked her stomach from top to bottom, covering it with a pale pink cloth.</p>
<p>Lying on her back, Yuzuki slowly crawls towards me and lies next to me on my left.</p>

<p>“Is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, just thinking… I never imagined I’d be eating at your house until just a little while ago, Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>She’s so close.</p>
<p>The contrast between her flushed cheeks and white neck, her chest rising and falling with each breath, is all clearly visible.</p>
<p>If I reach out, I can easily touch her.</p>
<p>I feel an urge to break the invisible thin barrier between us.</p>


<p>I feel an urge to break the invisible, thin barrier between us.</p>
<p>To disguise my feelings, I asked a simple question.</p>

<p>“…Do you think you can start studying again?”</p>
<p>“It’s such a hassle~ I just want to sleep like this~”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s eyes were droopy, and it seemed like they could close at any moment.</p>
<p>That’s why I said we should eat after finishing the assignments.</p>
<p>Despite a wry smile, I didn’t force Yuzuki to get up.</p>

<p>“… I think it’s been a while since I’ve spent a holiday like this.”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Yuzuki had always gone to work on Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>Since her last break, she might have had only a few full days off.</p>
<p>Doing assignments, eating meals, and lying down. Such an ordinary day-to-day life can be so enjoyable.</p>

<p>“——Hey, if I can get another day off.”</p>

<p>While lying down, Yuzuki casts a glance my way.</p>

<p>“Next time, I’ll finish my assignments in the morning, so in the afternoon, maybe we could go somewhere…”</p>

<p>But then, Yuzuki seemed to come to some realization—her eyebrows furrowed as she turned away her head.</p>

<p>“…Never mind, it’s nothing.”</p>

<p>Her usually proud long hair seems to have lost its luster, draped listlessly.</p>

<p>She can’t casually invite school friends, and the neighbor in the apartment who’s ‘easy to make plans with’ is a guy.</p>
<p>Even though we’re not dating, it would be game over if we were seen out together and someone snapped a photo of us.</p>
<p>Even on her rare days off, Yuzuki might not be allowed to play openly in public. She has to keep wearing her idol persona.</p>

<p>“…Actually, I’ve been interested in board games lately.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“There are some pretty serious board games that you can get for under a thousand yen for home use. But you need an opponent for those, even if it’s just a two-player game. My classmates don’t seem interested, so if you have some free time, why don’t you play with me, Yuzuki? It’s fine if it’s just in the gaps between your workouts and other practice.”</p>

<p>As I patiently wait for her response, Yuzuki strokes her hair and murmurs softly.</p>

<p>“…Well, if I have the time.”</p>
<p>“…Yep, if there’s time.”</p>

<p>Somehow, the phrase ‘home date’ popped into my head. But thinking it would be bad to tease her, I decided not to say it out loud.</p>

<p>“By the way, Golden Week is coming up soon. Do you have any plans, Suzufumi?”</p>
<p>“Me? I’m planning to finish all my homework in the first half and maybe hang out with some classmates for a day.”</p>

<p>Now that I’m aware of Yuzuki’s situation, I feel a little guilty for making plans to go out and have fun. But mentioning something like this might only make her worry, so I keep these thoughts to myself.</p>

<p>“Also, I’m planning to accompany Rika to the aquarium because she wants to see the penguin show.”</p>
<p>“…Oh? With Kishibe-san?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s unusual for her to ask me to take her somewhere other than on her birthday. Ever since the day we ate okonomiyaki, she’s been frequently sending messages to invite me out. She wants to eat sweets from a certain shop or says that a certain movie looks interesting. Maybe she wants to have all the fun she can before she starts studying for entrance exams.”</p>

<p>Up until last month, Rika was my neighbor, so instead of going out, we usually spent our time chilling at either of our houses, quietly reading manga or making okonomiyaki.</p>
<p>The distance that’s come between us might be changing the way we interact.</p>
<p>Once Rika graduates from high school, our contact will likely decrease. If she gets a boyfriend, I might not be able to contact her as easily.</p>
<p>That thought feels somewhat lonely.</p>

<p>It’s the same with Yuzuki.</p>
<p>The only reason I, just an ordinary high school boy, can have any connection with an active idol is because of the coincidence that our houses are next to each other.</p>
<p>Glancing briefly at Yuzuki, who was murmuring something to herself—she eventually sat up, slurped the soup infused with garlic and back fat, and then opened her mouth as if making a decision.</p>

<p>“…Make sure you tell me all about the aquarium.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I mean, tell me everything. Where you went, what you ate, every detail. Send me a message every fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>What’s that about? Maybe Yuzuki also likes penguins?</p>
<p>Or perhaps she can’t go out anywhere during the long weekend, so she wants to experience the aquarium through my live updates.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, I’ll send you a video. Rika might be noisy in the background, though.”</p>
<p>“…just photos are fine. Selfies.”</p>
<p>“Selfies? Aquariums are usually dimly lit, so my face might not show up well.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay. Besides, I’m not really interested in penguins, dolphins, or sea anemones anyway—!”</p>

<p>So what are you interested in?</p>
<p>Yuzuki was pouting angrily for some reason. In times like this, it’s best not to pry too much and just offer dessert as a peace offering.</p>
<p>After lifting my heavy body, I ask Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Which sherbet do you want, vanilla or orange?”</p>
<p>“Orange… and…”</p>
