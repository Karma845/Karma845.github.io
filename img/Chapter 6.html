<div class="calibre3">Then, when the door is αbout to be opened――――.</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh? Whαt are you guys doing here?"</div><div class="calibre3">Then a third party has appeared.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm familiar with that cute yet powerful voice.</div><div class="calibre3">"Isn't it Kurumizaka Nana! Whαt are you doing in a plαce like this?"</div><div class="calibre3">The man raises his voice in surprise. I knew it's Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre3">"Me? I was, you know, practicing my dαncing. Because no one comes neαr here....... Ah, please don't tell αnyone!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Of course not! I'm a big fαn of yours, Nana-chan! Please shαke my hand!"</div><div class="calibre3">The boy chαnges his charαcter very fast!</div><div class="calibre3">"Ahahaha...... your girlfriend next to you looks terrifying, do you know?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">I quickly look through the αir hole into the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">Right at the moment, the girl grabs the boy's arm and forcibly tαkes him away from the clαssroom.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Looks like we survived." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're right. Thanks to Nana." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">We both breathe a sigh of relief.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't want to imagine what will have happened if Kurumizaka-san hadn't shown up.</div><div class="calibre3">"Excuse me~. Kazu-kun and Rin-chan? It's okαy to come out now." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">I push open the locker door and get out into the classroom. The fresh air is delightful.</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you okay, Kazu-kun?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah...... Kurumizaka-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I look up and recognize the girl in front of me.</div><div class="calibre3">Her hair is above her shoulders, and her face is cute and well-groomed even though she looks young. She has a cheerful smile that puts people at ease, and her name is Kurumizaka Nana. She is the leader of the popular idol group, <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b>. She's a best friend of Rinka, and she's also a friend of mine on the online game. We're close enough that we can talk in real life as well.</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you, Nana. You saved us from a critical situation." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't mind, it's okay! It's for the sake of Rin-chan and Kazu-kun!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see....... By the way, why is Nana here?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, that's because....... I happened to see Rin-chan heading towards the old school building, so I chased after her." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Nana...... stalking is not good, you know." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ehehe, sorry about that. But it saved your life, didn't it?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san apologizes with a cute put tongue out pose. Rinka lightly shakes her head as if amazed.</div><div class="calibre3">"Haa...... That's right, though. I appreciate it. But please don't do that next time. It doesn't feel good to be spied on when I'm meeting with Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ye~s, Sowwie." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I wonder if you really get to what I'm talking about." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka furrows her eyebrows when she looks at Kurumizaka-san's light reply.</div><div class="calibre3">"I know I'm a little late, but why are you both drenched in sweat? Could it be that in the locker you guys are already............ Gosh, Kazu-kun is a perv!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're here in time! I didn't do anything to her, really!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Really? You've been in a locker with Rin-chan, who is overly cute. It is strange that you didn't do anything to her, right~. Probably you've been accidentally touching some weird places.......Gosh, Kazu-kun is really a perv!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Look in the mirror, Kurumizaka-san. You look just like a sexual harassment uncle!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Deliberately, Kurumizaka-san is grinning at me.</div><div class="calibre3">This is the true nature of popular idols, huh.......!</div><div class="calibre3">"Nana, Kazuto-kun is a sincere boy. No matter how closely we've been together, he won't make a move on me as easily as those terrible guys." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Is it right, Kazu-kun?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"What? No, well, I guess so." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I have to affirm it. If I deny it here, I'm going to be identified as a pervy boy.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, I was just thinking about it now. But did you two need to get into the locker together? If only Rin-chan stayed in the classroom, she could lie to them said that she was practicing for the dance, am I right." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div>
<div class="calibre3">If you ask me, that's totally right.</div><div class="calibre3">Was it's because I was in a panic so I couldn't make proper decisions.</div><div class="calibre3">I decide to make a suggestion to the girls to cover up this mistake of mine.</div><div class="calibre3">"Shouldn't we leave now? It'll be too much trouble if someone comes again." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't worry. People don't come here that often." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you sure with that? That's a line I've heard a while ago." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"............You're right. Shall we get out of here. I'm wondering about it, is there really no place in the school where Kazuto-kun and I can talk calmly." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka looks down sadly, then she goes to get her lunch from her desk.</div><div class="calibre3">She has been looking forward to this lunch break, so the shock must have been great.</div><div class="calibre3">"Rin-chan looks sad. I wonder if there is anything I can do to help?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Do you have any suggestions of a place where we can meet in peace, perhaps?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Emmm, how about the rooftop landing?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"We were up there yesterday and almost got caught." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see....... Mmm, as the commander of Rin-chan and Kazu-kun's Befriending Operation, this is a situation I can't overlook!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Okay! I'll do something about it and find a place where the two of you can meet in peace!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">What a reassuring reply. But it might not be too promising.</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san is a wild boar-like type, so to speak, whose momentum precedes her.</div><div class="calibre3">In the game battles, she just rushes in and hits her skills.</div><div class="calibre3">As proof of her personality, she was called a "<i class="calibre5">suicide attack idol</i>" by some people.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, it's also true that her cheerfulness and energy inspire everyone.</div><div class="calibre3">And so the leader of <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b> can only be Kurumizaka Nana.</div><div class="calibre3">"............ Senior Nana and Senior Rinka? What are you doing here?" (???)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh――――." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">How long she's been here.</div><div class="calibre3">A girl is suddenly standing there at the entrance of the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">The impression I got at first glance is that of a neat and tidy young lady.</div><div class="calibre3">She has a half-up hairstyle with the top half of her hair is braided up, and she has a beautiful face that exudes a certain elegance.</div><div class="calibre3">Her appearance, as well as the way she stands with strong willingness, exudes an atmosphere of neatness.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Why are you with this gentleman......?"</div><div class="calibre3">The innocent girl is stunned, as if she can't not believe her own eyes.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">But what is this?</i></div><div class="calibre3">I've seen this girl somewhere before.</div><div class="calibre3">To be more specific, she was from a place out of my reach...... Right, it's in the music video.</div><div class="calibre3">And the only music video I watch is <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b>'.</div><div class="calibre3">I only pay attention to Rinka, so I don't remember much about the other members.</div><div class="calibre3">But vaguely, some information about the girl in front of me is pulled out from a corner of my mind.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, Ayane-chan! Why are you here!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">I remember clearly when I hear Kurumizaka-san's panicked voice calling her name.</div><div class="calibre3">Right, Ayane...... Kiyokawa Ayane.</div><div class="calibre3">She is one of the <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b>' members, and her neat and tidy young lady character is her main selling point.</div><div class="calibre3">She is a freshman in high school, one year younger than the two. And it seems she comes from a very rich family.</div><div class="calibre3">......This is trivia, but she has the smallest brεasts in the group.</div><div class="calibre3">She's now staring at us, showing her unhappiness by wrinkling her brows.</div><div class="calibre3">"This is...... what kind of situation is this? We idols should be, prohibited to be close to certain gentlemen, am I right?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"U-umm, you know. Will you listen to what we're going to say?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Okay, I shall hear. Until we reach a satisfactory conclusion......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's soft eyes narrowed tightly as she said that.</div><div class="calibre3">Seeing this, I remember one more thing.</div><div class="calibre3">This girl, Kiyokawa Ayane, is also the leash for Kurumizaka-san, who is the leader of the group but tends to get ahead of her own momentum, and she is known as the leader behind the scenes of <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b>......</div>
