<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; The True Identity of Kiyokawa Ayane ④</h3>

<div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">――――would you like to be friends with me?</i></div><div class="calibre3">When Kiyokawa asks me that question, she has a weak smile on her face. I can sense her resignation.</div><div class="calibre3">"As long as you can keep my secrets, you can just forget the befriending thing earlier, okay?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa probably thinks that I'll refrain. That's why she said those words.</div><div class="calibre3">"I won't do it. It's not the neat and tidy young lady that I want to be friends with, but, it's the Kiyokawa Ayane herself." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">To be honest, I don't care what Kiyokawa's status is.</div><div class="calibre3">Whether she is a young lady or poor, it doesn't change the fundamental nature of Kiyokawa.......</div><div class="calibre3">However, Kiyokawa seems to be surprised by my unhesitant reply, and she has a surprised expression on her face.</div><div class="calibre3">"Th-this's strange....... You won't get any benefit from being friends with me, you know. It's indeed I make a lot of money as an idol, but I'm not going to use...... I'm going to save it for the future." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's not about money. Friendships are not based on profit and loss, are they?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's true, but......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you in a relationship with the members of Star☆Mines for profit, Kiyokawa-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, of course not! We are friends and colleagues who have gone through a lot together! There is no profit or loss involved." (Ayane)</div>

</div><div class="calibre3">With her tone becomes rough, Kiyokawa strongly denies it.</div><div class="calibre3">"Right? I'm not expecting anything from you either. I'm just genuinely hoping to get to know you better." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I convey my honest feelings to Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">I find out through this conversation that Kiyokawa thinks of her colleagues as very special existences.</div><div class="calibre3">Some people may think that's way overdramatic.</div><div class="calibre3">But if that's Kiyokawa's perspective, I think we should understand it respectfully.</div><div class="calibre3">"I, am a troublesome, pain in the ass girl, you know. I'm stingy, I'm shy, I'm nitpicky, and I'm a meddlesome person......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's fine. I'll accept everything. No matter what Kiyokawa-san has been doing to me, no matter what side of her I find out...... I will never dislike her." (Kazuto) <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17">(PTW/N: Whatta killing lines, sasuga womanizer.)</span></i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji......!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's eyes moistened as if she's moved. Isn't it a bit of an overreaction?</div><div class="calibre3">If I'm a person who dislike a girl like Kiyokawa, I would have cut ties with Tachibana and Saito a long time ago.</div><div class="calibre3">......Those guys, they've left me behind and advanced to the next stage.</div><div class="calibre3">"......It's just as Senior Rinka said. Senior Ayanokouji accepts all the good and bad points of the others......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Did Rinka say such a thing?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. At that time, I thought that there was no way such a broad-minded gentleman existed......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3"><br class="calibre3" />
<div class="calibre3">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</div>
</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">"It was a misunderstanding, yes."</i>, Kiyokawa says in a small voice.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know what's going on, but it seems that Rinka was complimenting me when I was not around.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm flattered, though, yet I'm embarrassed as well, I want her to stop it. They overrate my value.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kiyokawa-san. Just so you know, I'm just a normal guy, okay? It's not like I'm particularly open-minded or anything like that, you know?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Senior Rinka also said something like this. Senior Ayakoji is not conceited of his prowesses and lives a humble life. I didn't think that there was such a gentleman..... but it seems that I was wrong, yes." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Enough already, regarding those aforementioned, I'm not half as good as you guys just buttered me up." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">My reputation has begun to skyrocket, especially with Rinka. I guess this is what you call influence. Of the so-called misunderstanding.</div><div class="calibre3">And after she asks me to be her friend, Kiyokawa's attitude suddenly changes. She has become a girl who is insecure about herself. Is this what Kiyokawa really like?</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, so that young-ladylike character I saw earlier was just an act?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It was. As I said earlier, I'm a shy person....... I was able to talk normally with others by pretending to be a neat and tidy young lady." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"The character of the neat and tidy young lady is a mask. It's meant to conceal the real me and bring out the other me." (Ayane)</div>

<br class="calibre3" />
<div class="calibre3">......A mask, huh?</div><div class="calibre3">That's strangely a fitting analogy.</div><div class="calibre3">If you hide your true self, you can act boldly.</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe it's the same way that people who are weak and reserved in real life become cocky on the Internet.</div><div class="calibre3">"When I think about it, it's no wonder I can't make friends with my classmates. I've been pretending to be someone I'm not." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"But you can be friends with me. After you've already told me everything, though." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......You are somewhat similar to my 'friend', Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Friend?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Right, I remember that Kiyokawa said she has an online gamer friend that she's willing to marry.</div><div class="calibre3">The other day she have said we were totally different, but her assessment of us has changed quite a bit.</div><div class="calibre3"><br class="calibre3" />
<div class="calibre3">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</div>
</div><div class="calibre3">"Then, umm...... from now on, I and Senior Ayanokouji are friends, is that all correct?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah, of course." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Was this what it was like to be friends with someone?</div><div class="calibre3">I nod deeply as I think about it.</div><div class="calibre3">"U-umm, Senior Ayanokouji. As a friend...... Can I ask you for a first favor." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Sure. Ask me anything you want." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Full of weakness and reserve, Kiyokawa looks up at me and asks.</div><div class="calibre3">"If you don't want to, I won't force you." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I am wondering if you might be interested in reading one of my novels once in a while? I've gotten feedback from the members of Star☆Mines, but I've never gotten feedback from any male readers." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's a walk in the park. I'll read any novel you write." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you sure? Thank you so much!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's face lights up with happiness.</div><div class="calibre3">The smile on her face is that of a girl who has shed her neat and tidy young lady's mask.</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you not going to post it on the Internet?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I am not. If I was to be criticized by anonymous people, I would have suffered a mental breakdown. If that happens, it will affect my idol business, so I decided not to post on the Internet. And instead, I write by hand." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As expected of a popular idol. She does not forget to control her own mental state.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, this is not good! I'm going to be late for my lesson! I'm, taking my leave now!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Looking at the clock hanging on the wall, Kiyokawa raises her voice.</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-yeah. Do your best." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you very much!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa walks out of the room in a hurry. The sound of footsteps descending the stairs becomes distant at a great speed.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Ha ha. What a strange girl." (Kazuta)</div><div class="calibre3">I feel like I've gotten a lot closer to Kiyokawa in just one day.</div><div class="calibre3">We've even become friends.......</div><div class="calibre3">I'm starting to think Kiyokawa is a little cute.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, I mean it as a friend (junior), okay?</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"WHOA! I thought you had left!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Out-of-breath, Kiyokawa is standing at the entrance of my room, leaning against the door.</div><div class="calibre3">"I forgot my wig!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">The wig, which has been abandoned on a chair, is glinting in the sunlight streaming in through the window.</div>
