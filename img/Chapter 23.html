<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; The Neat and Tidy Idol</h3>

<div class="calibre3">"So this is Kiyokawa's house......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Sweat drips from my forehead by just walking around the city after school. The sun is biting.......</div><div class="calibre3">I didn't go home first, I went directly from school to Kiyokawa's house.</div><div class="calibre3">I stopped at a vending machine on the way, but it took me about 10 minutes to arrive at Kiyokawa's house.</div><div class="calibre3">It's a two-story wooden apartment. It has a long horizontal structure. The walls are blackened and have a slightly shabby appearance.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"......This is not a house where the neat and tidy young lady lives." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">If the fans find out about the house, it'd certainly ruin her image.</div><div class="calibre3">No, on the contrary, I'll put my bet that her popularity will increase because of the gap.</div><div class="calibre3">Thinking about this, I walk up the stairs and put my feet on the second floor.</div><div class="calibre3">Remembering the number of Kiyokawa's room, I follow it in order and arrive at the last room. The name Kiyokawa is written on the doorplate. This seems to be the place.</div><div class="calibre3">Incidentally, Kiyokawa's mother is away on business. So she's the only one at home.</div><div class="calibre3">So, what's the problem?</div><div class="calibre3">I and Kiyokawa are friends. Things are never going to get worse.</div><div class="calibre3">I think Rinka and Kiyokawa trusted me and allowed me to go to his house.</div><div class="calibre3">I let out a deep breath and push the doorbell.</div><div class="calibre3">I hear a jingle, and a few seconds later, I hear Kiyokawa's voice say, "Yes".</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, it's me, Ayanokouji." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. I'm coming." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Immediately, the door is opened with a bang.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, the person there is Kiyokawa Ayane. She has taken off her wig and now has her natural bobbed perm welcoming me.</div><div class="calibre3">And for some reason, she's wearing a gym uniform.</div><div class="calibre3">"Good day, Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Good day......, why are you wearing a gym uniform?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's my loungewear." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Pardon me?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's my loungewear." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The same words are repeated tediously. She looks at me as if it's an obvious thing.</div><div class="calibre3">"Is there, something wrong with my appearance?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, there's nothing wrong." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'll give that answer for now.</div><div class="calibre3">Is it normal for girls to use their gym clothes as loungewear?</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know either. After all, I've never had a conversation with a normal girl before!</div><div class="calibre3">"Is it really? If you have something to say, please say it clearly." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You don't look like a neat and tidy young lady at all." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You really said it really clearly, huh....... Well yeah, I'm aware of that as well." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's like, ah, that. You've become a very pretty girl who can be found anywhere." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"E-eh, what? I don't know whether I'm being praised or disparaged.......?" (Ayane) <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: Once again, that's a womanizer for ya!)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa tilts her head in a curious manner. It's just a normal cute gesture.</div><div class="calibre3">She has halted acting like a neat and tidy young lady.</div><div class="calibre3">And now, she's just being herself.</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, that's fine. Please come in." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">At Kiyokawa's urging, I step into the doorway.</div><div class="calibre3">This means that I have not only visited the home of a cool idol, but also the home of a neat and tidy idol.</div><div class="calibre3">If their fans find out about this, I'm definitely going to be crucified, no doubt.</div>
<div class="calibre3">☆</div><div class="calibre3">"This is my room. Please make yourself at home." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The size of the room was about four or five tatami mats.</div><div class="calibre3">A pale pink single bed is placed along the wall, and a laptop is placed on a mini table. I wonder if she's playing Black Plains by that.</div><div class="calibre3">Other cute dance props are placed on the chest of drawers, and deformed plushies of Star☆Mines members were sitting near the pillows of the bed.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know, but I guess I could say it's a typical high school girl's room.</div><div class="calibre3">It feels more modern and girlish than Rinka's calm room.</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't stare around too intense. Or I'll pinch your arm." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Sorry. I'm just curious about the neat and tidy young lady's room." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"The neat and tidy young lady is just an act." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Then you're a closet high-school girl." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not! I'm just your normal high school girl!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She denies it firmly there.</div><div class="calibre3">She pinches my right arm just enough to keep it from hurting.</div><div class="calibre3">"Please sit down wherever you want." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I sit down near the mini-table. I feel the comfortable elasticity of the carpet on my butt.</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, here's the novel I wrote. I'll give you the first part of it. You should be able to read it in about ten minutes." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I receive a stack of manuscript papers from Kiyokawa, which she pulled out of her desk drawer. It's really handwritten.</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's see, the title is......, "To You at The Bend". It sounds like a story about a man and a woman colliding at a bend." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. They do." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, they do, huh. What, is the woman having a loaf of bread in her mouth?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. She is, why?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">With this conversation, I was able to predict the story to some extent.</div><div class="calibre3">It's probably just a rigid template story.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, I like both templated and non-templated stories, so anything is fine with me.</div><div class="calibre3">I pick up the manuscript paper and start reading.</div><div class="calibre3">The introduction of the story is quite familiar. It's started with a scene of a high school girl...... Miyuki (the main character), who is late for school, running through the city with a loaf of bread in her mouth.</div><div class="calibre3">And soon, there comes the bend.</div><div class="calibre3">The moment Miyuki comes to a bend, she collides with a handsome high school boy who suddenly appears, and Miyuki is blown away like a projectile and hit by a truck to her death――――!!! <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: A la mak~, sanity-al damage!)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"Wait a minute! The main character died!? And more importantly, what the h*ll that kind of repulsive force is? She just collides with a person, you know!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes, she's dead." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, Dead is a bit.......eh? What? Are you kidding me? Is that all you have to say?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, it's fine. Please just read on." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay my a*s! The protagonist is dead here......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">But the straight-faced Kiyokawa urges me to read on.</div><div class="calibre3">When Miyuki dies, she finds herself as a baby, and from her surroundings, she knows that she has been reincarnated as a villainous noble's daughter――――</div><div class="calibre3">"Man, it's a reincarnation pattern huh! And a villainess one! I thought this was a real-life romance⁉︎" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Who said it was a real-life romance? I didn't say a word about it, did I?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You certainly didn't! But the title sounds like a real-life romance!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's merely Senior Ayanokouji's assumption. Please don't put the blame on me." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She tells me crisply. I'm not convinced, though.</div><div class="calibre3">I feel like I've been caught in a title scam.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not just a rigid template story, but a monster one that specializes in betraying expectations.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji. Are you reading it?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-yeah. I am." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Anyway, let's read through the first part as Kiyokawa told me.</div><div class="calibre3">It's nonsense to assume a work is worst just within the first few pages.</div><div class="calibre3">Miyuki learns that she is a villainess and tries to get along with the people around her in order to get over the bad-end that will eventually happen to her. This scene continues until about the end of the first part of the story, when Miyuki is walking through the city, she collides with a boy at a bend, blown away, and is run over by a carriage――――and, it's the ending of the first part of the story. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: Duh gusti~, I'm dead. [Villainess*(Isekai)^2].)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"How's it, Senior Ayanokouji? Did you read it all the way through?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah, I did. I have mixed feelings about it, but I'm anxious to see what happens at the end! How many more times is Miyuki going to be killed by the guy at the bend?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, this is not that kind of story. This story is a legitimate love story about a villainess." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Legitimate? Which the h*ll is the part that legitimate? Miyuki-chan, she's getting killed all over the bend by those bend-men. It's not a romance anymore, okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's the shocking encounter element." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That encounter element gives the physical impact that brings her to death." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Well, I've said a lot, but I've never read a work about a villainess.</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe this kind of development has been established as a template?</div><div class="calibre3">I think it's hard for people to accept such heretical novels.</div><div class="calibre3">"It's only the prologue. From here on, it's going to be a sweet pure love story." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I can't imagine that at all......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Would you like to read the rest?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, I'd be happy to read it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I understand. Then――――ah." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's when Kiyokawa takes out a stack of manuscript papers from her desk drawer. A sheet of manuscript paper that has been stuck underneath flutters down to my hand.</div><div class="calibre3">"Hmm?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I casually pick it up and look it over.</div><div class="calibre3">The title is "My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend".</div><div class="calibre3">"No, you can't do that! Please don't read it!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Why not?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You can't do means you can't do!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Feeling impatient, Kiyokawa snatches the manuscript out of my hands with a quick movement.</div><div class="calibre3">She puts it in the drawer, taking care not to rip it.</div><div class="calibre3">The way she looks at the manuscript, it's clear to anyone who looks at her that it's a novel that has been treated with more care than "To You at the Bend".</div><div class="calibre3">"I'd rather read that novel." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, you can't. Because, this one is...... written by full-blown delusion......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Aren't all novels delusions?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, it's different. The muscles brain used to write an interesting story are completely different from those used to create a delusion." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Huuh, is that so." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I've never written a novel before, so I don't know much about it, but it seems to be different anyway.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't have a good analogy, but I guess it's like a tank and a healer are aware of each other's feelings.</div><div class="calibre3">"I want to read your delusions, Kiyokawa-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No! It's really embarrassing!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She raises her voice and rejects me seriously.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't even make any slightest movement, but the red-faced Kiyokawa is trying hard to hold down the drawer.</div><div class="calibre3">"So can you tell me what it's about?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's embarrassing to tell you what it's about." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Come on, just a little." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No. I've never let anyone read this, so I'm not going to....... I didn't write it on the assumption that anyone would read it in the first place." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, if you insist, I won't push you. But I've seen the title......, so I can guess what it's about. You're talking about flirting with your online friend, right?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ugh. ...... Shall I hit you with a blunt object to erase that memory?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Stop it please, you sound serious." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">When I see Kiyokawa thinking about it rather seriously, I start to feel fear. I'm really going to get killed.</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, can you please keep this novel a secret from my seniors?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay, and I don't think it's something you should be so embarrassed about. It's much more like a romance novel than "To You at The Bend"." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, you can't. This is not...... a novel to others read......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder what she's thinking. With a weak smile on her face, Kiyokawa gently strokes the drawer where she keeps her manuscript.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa is thinking about the person she'd never be able to meet with, and she expressed her world in the form of words.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know if I can call it a delusion, but I think the driving force is pure and innocent thoughts.</div><div class="calibre3">"......You really like that your friend, don't you, Kiyokawa-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes, I do, is that wrong?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"There's nothing wrong with that. It's just that you don't know...... his face, do you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. But it has nothing to do with the face. I don't like a person because of the face, I like the face of the person I like." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I can't help but fall silent.</div><div class="calibre3">It's just too pure and innocent.</div><div class="calibre3">I like the face of the person I like....... That's a wise saying coming from Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"What's it......? Do I have something on my face?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, I was just wondering what kind of player would be able to get that much favor from Kiyokawa-san. Can you tell me the name of your friend?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't wanna." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"W-why not?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If I tell you, you'll definitely search him." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, I'll probably." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's why I won't tell you. Senior Nana and the others have asked me a few times, but I haven't taught them." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">You don't tell Kurumizaka-san and Rinka either? Then there's no way she'll tell me. Let's just give up.</div><div class="calibre3">"Then tell me the name you use in the game, Kiyokawa-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't wanna." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Why not? It doesn't matter, does it! The four of us will be online together soon enough!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I won't tell you even if it is. It's my way of getting back at Ayanokoji for bullying me." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa turns away from me with a pout.</div><div class="calibre3">It's a far cry from the neat and tidy young lady's gesture, but it's a very cute gesture.</div><div class="calibre3">"Did I do something bad to you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eee, many times. You've called me a closet person." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Da~mn...... I've been teasing you for a while now, and it's starting to pay off......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Oh well. I can be sure that I'll find out about it sooner or later.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm looking forward to the day when the four of us play online games together.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'd like to ask you a question, what is the name of yours, Senior Ayanokouji?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's Kazuto." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, it's not what I mean! I mean your game username!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I won't tell you." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Are you trying to get back at me by any chance?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yup." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're such a kid, yes." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Shut up." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know who's more annoying.</div><div class="calibre3">But this atmosphere is not bad either.</div><div class="calibre3">I feel like we're able to talk to each other without reservation.</div><div class="calibre3">The other person is of the opposite sex, but I don't think of her as the opposite sex in a weird way.</div><div class="calibre3">It seems that Kiyokawa is the same way, and while she expresses her emotions honestly, she doesn't become grumpy in the true sense of the word. I guess this is what friends do.</div><div class="calibre3">I guess.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">*Chirp* *chirp*!</b></div><div class="calibre3">A cute little bird chirps from Kiyokawa's smartphone on the table. From the sound quality, it sounds like an alarm. Kiyokawa picks up her phone and turns off the alarm.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm sorry. It's time to go to my lesson." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"All right, I'm leaving then. Thanks for the novel." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If you don't mind, Would you like to take it home?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh, can I? I'd like to read your novel, "My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend", then." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's not that one, it's the "To You at The Bend"." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's a no, huh. How unfortunate." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Oh, you want to read it that badly? The "My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend"......?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She clutches the manuscript in her hands and asks in a quiet voice.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, and I give her a nod.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm genuinely curious, but more than anything, I want to read the novel that Kiyokawa had put her heart and soul into.</div><div class="calibre3">"Just so you know, the names of the characters are original. You won't be able to recognize my friend's name when you read it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"D*mn, I think I'd find out who Kiyokawa likes, but......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I haven't thought of that, but I dare to be frustrated.</div><div class="calibre3">When Kiyokawa sees me, she takes out the manuscript of "My Web-Game's Friend My Boyfriend" from her drawer and says "Geez, can't be helped then......".</div><div class="calibre3">"P-please don't laugh at my work." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"All right. I'll enjoy reading it to the fullest." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't give me any pressure either." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa looks somewhat dissatisfied, but she hands me a stack of manuscripts as if she's pushing me. I take it and look at the last sheet to check the page count. And it said 508 pages in the corner. It might be longer than I thought.</div><div class="calibre3">"Let me tell you, it's only because you're Senior Ayanokouji, who I've accepted as a friend, that I'm allowing you to read it. Don't tell anyone else, and don't tell my seniors either." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't worry. According to my calculations, the probability of me keeping this novel a secret is 2000%!" (Kazuto) <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: I missed the bell-pepper &amp; probabilities guys, somehow. (their craziness).)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"That smells like a lie! As I thought, please give it back!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm kidding. I'll absolutely never show it to anyone." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......If you show it to anyone, I will be very angry, okay." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa, who seems to be trying to make a strong face, distorts her face into a pout and glares at me as best she could.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm troubled because it's just normally cute.</div><div class="calibre3">"Haa~......, that's enough. Senior Ayanokouji, thank you very much for today." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Me too. It was fun." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Are you really?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I nod, and Kiyokawa, who is fidgeting with her fingers in some way, looks up at me anxiously.</div><div class="calibre3">"Then, Umm......, would you like to come to my house sometime?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Sure." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you very much. You don't have to mind your friends Senior Ayanokouji, so it will be easier for us to hang out." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Did you forget that I'm your senior?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Fufu, of course I didn't. I'm taking it easy because I know you're my senior." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa smiles mischievously, it's unlike that of a neat and tidy young lady.</div><div class="calibre3">What a cheeky junior she is!</div><div class="calibre3">Even though I thought so, I don't feel unpleasant at all, which is strange.</div>
