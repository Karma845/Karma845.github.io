<h2>Round 7: Thanks For Walking Me Home</h2>

<p>It’s been about a month since the start of my second year of high school life.</p>
<p>Golden Week passed by with speed reminiscent of the rapid turnover at the Jiromaru Ramen shop.</p>
<p>I spent my nights enduring Hozumi’s lengthy phone calls (mostly him bragging about his love life), helping with duct cleaning at ‘Aien Kien,’ and living a slow-paced life—while my neighbor seemed to be working full shifts regardless of weekends and holidays.</p>
<p>By the way, I couldn’t go to the aquarium with Rika.</p>
<p>It was because Rika fell ill just before. Apparently, she had played too much in the first half of the holiday and ran out of HP quite early.</p>
<p>She sent me an apology message, so I went to visit her instead.</p>

<p>『I’m sorry for being a bother… Even though I’m Suzu’s Onee-san…』</p>

<p>Rika was quite downcast, but she perked up and slurped happily when I made her some udon with plenty of spices.</p>
<p>With mid-term exams coming up in May and the next holiday more than two months away, the mood in Class 2-A is pretty low.</p>
<p>Hozumi, in particular, seemed as downcast as a river clogged with years of accumulated sludge because he had been told he’d be banned from dating if he failed the next test.</p>
<p>For the record, Hozumi had failed more than half his subjects in the final exams last year.</p>
<p>I agreed to help him study after school, but I wonder how long he’ll keep it up.</p>

<p>As for me, I haven’t been able to share a meal with Yuzuki for a week, so I’m not exactly in high spirits either.</p>
<p>Yuzuki’s group, 【Spotlights】, has been seen on variety shows lately, but their main gig is performing as idols, singing and dancing in front of people.</p>
<p>They’re apparently preparing for a big live show in Tokyo soon, and Yuzuki, along with the other members of 【Spotlights】, has been rehearsing late into the night every day.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I’ve never actually seen them perform live since I’ve known Yuzuki.</p>
<p>I hear streaming tickets are available, so maybe I’ll buy one.</p>

<p>As the homeroom session ended, I spoke to a classmate slumped in the seat in front of me.</p>

<p>“Come on, you said you’d study. Let’s go to the library.”</p>
<p>“…Let’s start next week instead.”</p>

<p>A declaration of giving up on the first day, but I’m not so irresponsible as to back down now.</p>

<p>“It’s important to turn this into a habit. Come on, get up quickly.”</p>

<p>While other classmates were leaving the classroom one after another, Hozumi stubbornly clung to his desk.</p>

<p>“Suzufumi, you should learn to say no to people’s requests more often.”</p>

<p>He’s the one who asked for help, and now this attitude.</p>

<p>“Since our first year, you’ve always been the one to help out. Taking on committee roles no one else wanted, helping other groups with their campfires during the school trip, distributing sweets to classmates on Valentine’s and White Day, sewing a girl’s uniform button the moment it came off…”</p>
<p>“…It’s fine. I like doing those things.”</p>

<p>When someone close to me is in trouble, I want to lend a hand as much as I can.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the neighbor in the apartment next door or a classmate, I help because I want to, that’s all there is to it.</p>

<p>“It’s your freedom to take on whatever you want, but you should learn to rely on others sometimes. You don’t ask for opinions, which is why you end up confessing your love to an idol you fell in love with at first sight on the first day——”</p>
<p>“——Let’s forget about that.”</p>

<p>This story will probably haunt me even when I become a third-year student or maybe even at class reunions.</p>

<p>“Listen well, Hozumi. Just fifteen minutes today, that’s all. Just get over this first hurdle, and then studying becomes easier.”</p>

<p>I pulled Hozumi’s arm and forcibly dragged him to the library.</p>
<p>It’s sad to think that poor grades could prevent him from going out on dates with his girlfriend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, I managed to make Hozumi study for an hour today.</p>
<p>As expected, once he starts, the rest follows with momentum.</p>
<p>By the end, he was excited, saying, ‘I’ve finally realized the profoundness of studying!’ But it’ll probably be reset by tomorrow.</p>

<p>I leave the library early and head out of school.</p>
<p>Now, which supermarket should I stop by today?</p>
<p>Maybe I’ll take a look at the individual stores in the shopping district for a change.</p>
<p>Also, I need to buy detergent, a toothbrush, and drain cleaner at the drugstore. It’s about time to pick up my coats from the dry cleaners…</p>

<p>Hozumi might have said that, but I like doing household chores.</p>
<p>I like being helpful to others. I’m not forcing myself, and I’m well aware of my own limits.</p>
<p>At first, Yuzuki seemed bothered by me cooking for her, but lately, she seems more accepting.</p>
<p>Is it too much to hope that we can continue like this forever?</p>

<p>“…I want to see you, Yuzuki.”</p>

<p>That wish came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Just having a face-to-face chat with her would be enough. But as she mentioned, the day of the live concert is approaching, and it seems like there’s also a fan meeting right after that.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll just keep missing each other in May——</p>

<p>“Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>—Yuzuki’s parents live in their hometown, Niigata. I wonder if Yuzuki is keeping in touch with her parents—</p>

<p>“Suu-zuu-fuu-mii!”</p>

<p>—With Mother’s Day approaching, she would probably make her parents happy with a video call.</p>

<p>“Hey Suzufumi!!!”</p>

<p>My thoughts suddenly were blown away, like a house made of straw blown away by the wind.</p>
<p>——The one who appeared from that straw house was Yuzuki.</p>


<p>“I’ve been calling you for a while now, don’t ignore me!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki was in her school uniform: A brown blazer, a bright red tie, and a black skirt.</p>
<p>No matter how many times I see her, Yuzuki in her high school girl mode is always cute.</p>

<p>“…Sorry. I was lost in thought. Are you heading home?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I only had classes in the afternoon today. Want to walk home together?”</p>

<p>Without waiting for my response, Yuzuki started walking ahead.</p>

<p>“But we agreed to act like strangers at school.”</p>
<p>“We’re already outside the school. Plus, we’re quite far from the school building, so it should be fine.”</p>

<p>Indeed, there were no school-aged kids in uniforms on the streets and hardly any cars passing by.</p>

<p>“Still, shouldn’t we be cautious of weekly magazines and stuff?”</p>
<p>“It’s a fact that our houses are next to each other and we go to the same school, so they wouldn’t write an article just for that. Unless, of course, we hold hands in public or something.”</p>
<p>“If Yuzuki says so…”</p>

<p>Despite being quite cautious during our secret meeting in the Resource Room, I wonder if there was a change of heart within her.</p>
<p>I slow down my walking pace to align with Yuzuki while keeping a two-person gap between us. It’s always better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>However, Yuzuki shows a somewhat lonely expression as I try to keep my distance.</p>

<p>“…You could walk a little closer…”</p>

<p>The distance from school to the apartment is about a twenty-five-minute walk.</p>
<p>I had been thinking of buying a bicycle, but with such good fortune, maybe I’ll continue walking to school a bit longer.</p>

<p>On the way home, we engaged in small talk.</p>
<p>We talked about how classes suddenly got harder, how a girl in our class got hit on by a third-year senpai, how I ended up teaching a friend, or how someone increased their workout because another person started cooking for her every day, just like regular friends.</p>

<p>“Ah, there’s a Favoma here.”</p>

<p>It seemed to have just opened, with a ‘Grand Opening’ banner fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>Favorite Mart, commonly known as ‘Favoma’, is a convenience store chain boasting the second-largest number of stores in the industry.</p>
<p>Their seasonal sweets and hot snacks by the register are highly popular.</p>

<p>Among them, the most popular item is the boneless fried chicken named after the store, ‘FavoChick.’</p>
<p>Since its launch in 2006, it has been loved as Favoma’s signature hot snack.</p>
<p>Jokingly, I made this suggestion.</p>

<p>“Should we grab some after-school snacks like typical high schoolers? I’ll treat you.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>

<p>I expected an immediate word of rejection, but Yuzuki is frozen in a strange posture. It seems like she’s using all her resources to think it over.</p>
<p>Maybe if I push a little, she’ll cave?</p>

<p>“It’s a new store, so I bet they have freshly fried, crispy chicken lined up.”</p>
<p>“…Hmm-hmmhh.”</p>
<p>“Yuzuki, you’ve been working hard lately with all the live rehearsals and everything, so I want to reward you. I think you need to build up your energy while you can. Let me pamper you.”</p>

<p>From the side, the sleeve of the uniform is sharply tugged.</p>

<p>“…you’ll treat me?”</p>
<p>“…Mmm.”</p>

<p>Her demeanor reminds me of a grumpy child just woken up.</p>

<p>“Yeah, I’ll buy it for you. Choose whatever you like.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki then spent well over ten minutes staring down the official website’s product list on her smartphone.</p>
<p>In the end, she chose the classic menu item, the ‘FavoChick’.</p>
<p>By the way, I picked the equally classic product, the croquette ‘FavoKoro.’</p>

<p>“Here, be careful not to burn yourself.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki gleefully tears open the wrapper, revealing the crispy chicken.</p>

<p>“T-this is the famous FavoChick…”</p>

<p>Holding the chicken high with both hands, Yuzuki had a look of bliss on her face.</p>
<p>‘The famous FavoChick…’ she says, though her reaction seems a bit too exaggerated.</p>

<p>“…Don’t tell me, is this your first time trying FavoChick?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. There weren’t many convenience stores in my hometown, and since moving to the city, I’ve been avoiding hot snacks, so I’ve always been longing for it…”</p>

<p>Despite her excitement, Yuzuki is reluctant to start eating.</p>

<p>“I-I knew it, eating something this greasy is like a crime for an idol…”</p>
<p>“It’s too late for that now. If you really won’t eat it, then I’ll──”</p>

<p>As I reach out for the FavoChick that Yuzuki is holding, it is swiftly moved out of reach.</p>
<p>When I chuckle smugly, Yuzuki blushes and finally brings the FavoChick to her mouth.</p>

<p>“I know convenience store snacks are a no-go, but…!”</p>

<p>The moment she bites into it, juice spurts out with the force of a fire hose at a fire scene.</p>

<p>“Wow~♥ The juicy thigh meat combined with the crispy coating just explodes with flavor in your mouth~♥ It’s so tender and flavorful. It’s fried chicken, but it’s as easy to eat as if it were steamed chicken♥”</p>

<p>True to her words, half of it quickly disappears into Yuzuki’s stomach.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I show off the knowledge I just picked up from the internet.</p>

<p>“I saw on a recipe site that there’s this variation called ‘FavoChick Donburi’ or something like that.”</p>
<p>“Wow, I’d love to try that, but the calories must be insane~”</p>
<p>“For example, you could simmer the FavoChick with onions in noodle soup base, and then finish it off with beaten eggs to make it fluffy, kind of like an oyakodon.”</p>
<p>“…<em>gulp</em>-.”</p>
<p>“Or, stir-fry sweet and spicy pork, top it with bite-sized pieces of FavoChick, sprinkle white sesame and shredded perilla for a double punch of rich and refreshing flavors.”</p>
<p>“…<em>gulp- gulp-</em>.”</p>

<p>—Grrrrowl</p>
<p>Yuzuki skillfully manages to eat FavoChick while still being hungry.</p>
<p>She holds her stomach and blushes as she bites into the chicken.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I feel an intense gaze on my hand. Yuzuki is staring intently at my hand.</p>
<p>There’s only one bite left of my FavoKoro. I throw the last piece into my mouth.</p>

<p>“Ah───! Thief!”</p>
<p>“No, I simply didn’t give it to you.”</p>

<p>In response, Yuzuki quickly devours the remaining FavoChick in one bite.</p>

<p>“Sigh, it’s over… I wonder how many years it will be before I can eat this again…”</p>

<p>With a look of longing, Yuzuki gazed down at the wrapper in her hands.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other delicious convenience store foods.</p>
<p>Steamed buns, potatoes, cup desserts…</p>
<p>Next time I run into Yuzuki on the way home, which one should I suggest?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After finishing our snacks, we were walking side by side along the school’s route.</p>
<p>We make our way home, keeping as much distance as possible from passersby.</p>
<p>After all, it’s always better not to be seen together with Yuzuki. Better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>On open streets, it’s easy to spot people from afar, but the problem is in areas crowded with stores and houses.</p>
<p>The buildings and walls obstruct the view, so we need to proceed carefully.</p>

<p>This time too, I sensed someone’s presence around the corner.</p>
<p>I gestured with my hand and hid with Yuzuki behind a nearby vending machine.</p>
<p>The ones who appeared from around the corner were a group of boys in uniform. Moreover, these uniforms were from Orikita High School.</p>
<p>We held our breath and waited for them to pass by.</p>

<p>“…you know, there’s this second-year student named Mamori who confessed to Arisu Yuzuki on the day of the entrance ceremony.”</p>
<p>“No way, that’s like hero-level courage. So, are they dating?”</p>
<p>“As if. The other person’s an idol, okay?”</p>

<p>They were so engrossed in their chatter that they didn’t seem to notice us at all.</p>
<p>It’s still hot news even after a month since the entrance ceremony.</p>
<p>The rumor that I confessed to a popular idol seems to have become common knowledge in our school.</p>
<p>It seems our efforts to move around secretly have paid off.</p>

<p>Once the group of boys was completely out of sight, I rebooted the search engine in my brain.</p>
<p>From the routes I’ve taken to and from school, for detours, and shopping, I calculate the places with the lowest population density and convey the strategy to Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Let’s take a detour through another block. This street has too many convenience stores, and we might have another close call with students from Orikita.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>

<p>We crossed the road and moved to the next block.</p>
<p>This street has fewer shops, so the risk of running into someone we know should be significantly lower.</p>

<p>Just as I think this and step onto the street, an unexpected figure emerges from a house on our right——</p>

<p>“Hozumi…!”</p>

<p>It’s a friend I know well, and he’s in casual clothes, meaning this is Hozumi’s house.</p>
<p>Whenever we hung out, we always met at the nearest station to our destination, so I never imagined he lived within walking distance from my apartment.</p>

<p>“Yuzuki, hide!”</p>

<p>We quickly retreat and decide to take cover in an alleyway between buildings.</p>
<p>After ushering Yuzuki to the back, I peek out from behind the building, keeping an eye on Hozumi, who is focused on his smartphone.</p>
<p>Yuzuki also popped her head out from behind, trying to take a look at the street.</p>

<p>At that moment, Hozumi suddenly looked up.</p>
<p>I turn around and try to push Yuzuki further into the alley, but in doing so, I stumble and instinctively grab her shoulder tightly.</p>

<p>This is bad.</p>
<p>At this rate, I might knock Yuzuki to the ground and cause her to get hurt.</p>

<p>In an attempt to correct our posture, we ended up doing a half-turn like some sort of bizarre dance.</p>
<p>As a result, Yuzuki ends up with her back against the wall, and I find myself with my hand placed near her face——a classic ‘wall slam (kabedon)’ pose.</p>

<p>Yuzuki, clearly surprised—blushed while opening and closing her mouth without making a sound.</p>

<p>“…Sorry.”</p>

<p>I turned my face away and observed the street again. Hozumi was already gone.</p>

<p>“A-alright,, let’s just dash through it all at once.’</p>
<p>“…But, won’t we run into someone else again?”</p>
<p>“That was an ultra-rare case. Given the time, we might only bump into the housewife crowd going to the supermarket if we move carelessly now.”</p>
<p>“I think that’s better than running into someone from Orikita…”</p>
<p>“That’s not necessarily true. There could be parents from Ori High among the housewives. You shouldn’t underestimate the parent network. Information like who was walking with his girlfriend (彼女) can spread like wildfire. It could turn into a situation like that Resource Room incident.”</p>

<p>As I turned around to lead the way, I noticed Yuzuki had a somewhat dazed expression on her face.</p>

<p>“…you said ‘girlfriend’…”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, that was kind of a slip of the tongue…”</p>
<p>“…Hmm”</p>

<p>Yuzuki glances at me——Not teasingly, but seemingly not convinced either.</p>
<p>I wonder what she was feeling.</p>

<p>“A-anyway, Yuzuki, just focus on protecting your image as an idol.”</p>
<p>“…Okay, got it.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki nodded slightly.</p>
<p>For some reason, her gaze was directed at my hands.</p>

<p>About fifteen minutes later, we somehow managed to get through the crisis and returned to the apartment.</p>
<p>Along the way, Yuzuki kept glancing at me. Yet, without starting a conversation, we just walked side by side in silence.</p>

<p>We passed through the entrance and got into the elevator together.</p>
<p>The distance between us is less than ten centimeters.</p>

<p>“Right, I’ll dispose of the FavoChick wrapper here. Sorry for making you hold onto it.”</p>
<p>“…Thanks.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, standing to my left, handed me the wrapper with her right hand.</p>
<p>I take it with my left hand, crumple it up, and stuff it into my coat pocket.</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s right hand and my left hand are now free.</p>
<p>——In an instant, a spark shot through my brain.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>——It might have been my imagination or just a coincidence.</p>
<p>But I don’t have the courage to confirm it with my eyes.</p>

<p>I could feel a faint warmth at the tip of my left little finger.</p>
<p>Yuzuki, without a word, stared straight ahead.</p>
<p>The connection of just a pinky finger—There is no conversation between us.</p>

<p>The elevator arrived on the eighth floor, and we exited at the same time.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, our walking pace was perfectly in sync, and the position of our hands did not shift.</p>
<p>Even though I know it’s meaningless, I couldn’t help but wish that this moment would never end——</p>

<img14

<p>——I savor the few meters past room 809, up to the corner, room 810.</p>

<p>“…Thanks for walking me home, Suzufumi.” </p>
<p>“Do you need to say it at this distance?”</p>

<p>As I make a light joke, Yuzuki giggles softly. I also let out a smile.</p>
<p>—Our fingers, they part.</p>

<p>“I have rehearsal tonight and then I’ll be staying over at the office’s nap room. See you later.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, see you.”</p>

<p>As I raise my left hand, Yuzuki responds with her right and then heads back into her room.</p>

<p>“…Seriously…”</p>

<p>I squat down on the spot.</p>
<p>I remembered the sensation that had lit up in my left pinky finger.</p>
<p>——Like just after waking up from a happy dream, only a vague warmth remained.</p>
