<h3>Chapter 20 &#8211; The Leeway from Wife</h3>

<div class="calibre3">As soon as I arrive at school and take my seat, Rinka, who is sitting in the front row, looks back at me.</div><div class="calibre3">Our eyes meet for a few seconds.</div><div class="calibre3">Without taking any particular action, she turns her head forward. And resumes her usual routine of reading.</div><div class="calibre3">Recently, we have been seeing each other less and less during breaks, and we don't spend our lunch break either.</div><div class="calibre3">Could it be that she is lonely?</div><div class="calibre3">The reason why Rinka hasn't said anything to me is probably that we almost got caught by the other students a few times.</div><div class="calibre3">Or maybe Kurumizaka-san or Kiyokawa have said something to her without my knowledge.</div><div class="calibre3">But I think this is unavoidable.</div><div class="calibre3">If we meet again and again like before, someone will really find out.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka is a popular idol and stands out easily.</div><div class="calibre3">No matter where she goes, rumors will start, and just talking to a guy will be the topic of conversation among the students.</div><div class="calibre3">If I and Rinka are going to meet, we have to be very careful.</div>

<div class="calibre3">".......Mm." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I feel a slight vibration in my pants pocket. It's from my smartphone. So, I take it out and check it.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazuto-kun,&nbsp; Can we go online tonight?] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3">It's from Rinka. She can't talk to me directly, so she has to use the smartphone to communicate with me.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, it's enough as long as I can get in touch with someone I like.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Sure. Let's do.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Thank you, Kazuto-kun. Also, can you please come to the back of the old school building for lunch today? Nana guarantees that no other students will ever come there.] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Okay.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3">By the way, Kurumizakazaka-san said she would find a place where no one would find us.</div><div class="calibre3">She promised so the day I and Rinka hid in the locker.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't think she will actually go looking for one for us.......</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Nana will also be present....... Is that okay?] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Of course.] (Kazuto)</b></div>
<div class="calibre3">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div>
<div class="calibre3">Today, it seems that the three of us, Kurumizaka-san, Rinka, and I, will be spending lunch together.</div><div class="calibre3">It will be the first time the three of us having lunch together since the first time Kurumizaka-san and I had a conversation in the cafeteria.</div><div class="calibre3">The talk about lunch break is over, and Rinka continues to bring up some topics.</div><div class="calibre3">We exchanged some unremarkable chit-chat, like...... how a cockroach had appeared in her house yesterday and Nonoa-chan had happily tried to grab it with her hand, or how Kasumi had asked her about her progress with me.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Senior Ayanokouji. I have a request.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3">It's from Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">Normally it'll be a warning or a nagging, but this time is unusual.</div><div class="calibre3">Thus, I stop chatting with Rinka for a moment and reply to Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Okay. What's your request?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Would you read the novel I wrote? It's a romance novel for women.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[If it's a novel for women, it'll be better to ask Rinka and Kurumizaka-san, won't it?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I've been getting feedback from Senior Nana and the others on a regular basis. So I'm hoping that Senior Ayanokouji, who is a man, can give me his opinion and feedback as well.......] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I see.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3">If that's the case, I'll be glad to help her.</div><div class="calibre3">The fact that Kiyokawa asks me for my opinion on her novel is probably a sign that he accepted me as a friend.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Am I a bother to you? Do I suddenly get too close? I'm very sorry. I may be a member of Star☆Mines, but I don't know how to interact with older male friends......] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Don't worry, You're not bothering me at all.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's writing exudes anxiety. That's exactly what a loner feels like.</div><div class="calibre3">I know exactly how Kiyokawa is feeling right now because I myself have a loner tendency.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Are you sure I'm not a bother to you?] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[You're not a bother, so please rest assured. But I don't know if I can be of any help, though.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I'd be more than grateful for your opinion and feedback.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Roger that. When do you want me to read it?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[May I visit Senior Ayanokouji's house after school today? Actually, I left my novel at home and I'd like to go back and get it.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Ah, sorry. My parents are at home today.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[In that case, how about you come to my house instead? It's just about a ten-minute walk from the school.] (Ayane)</b></div>

<div class="calibre3">You're inviting me to your house?</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa trusts me more than I imagined. She seems to be the type of person who opens her heart to people she recognizes as friends.</div><div class="calibre3">However, what should I do?</div><div class="calibre3">As for me, I have no problem going to Kiyokawa's house.</div><div class="calibre3">I just wonder what Rinka will think.</div><div class="calibre3">That's what I'm worried about.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm somewhat anxious about going to her junior's house without telling her.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, it's not like I'm going to do anything wrong, but.......</div><div class="calibre3">"If I'm going to report this to Rinka, I need to tell her about my interactions with Kiyokawa." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As for Kiyokawa, she maybe does not want to be reported to Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">If I keep my mouth shut, it might not be a problem....... No, I must not.</div><div class="calibre3">I feel bad for Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">But it'll be a shame to miss the chance to get to know Kiyokawa better.</div><div class="calibre3">After much deliberation, I decided to tell Kiyokawa about my concern.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I have no problem going to Kiyokawa-san's house, but I can't keep it a secret from Rinka.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I receive a reply from Kiyokawa right away.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I've already told Senior Rinka and Senior Nana about us.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What!?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I told Senior Ayanokouji about my true self, didn't I? That day, I also told them about everything. Including the fact that I've been monitoring you.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......Did you not get scolded?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I got a mild scolding. But Senior Rinka said to me, "I don't mind as long as Ayane acknowledges our relationship".] (Ayane)</b></div>
<div class="calibre3">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div>
<div class="calibre3">I immediately take a glance at Rinka, who is reading.</div><div class="calibre3">She is still sitting with her back straight and her posture as graceful as ever.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I've already received permission to invite Senior Ayanokouji to my home.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I haven't heard anything about it from Rinka.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't have any idea about that. Maybe she decided she didn't need to say it?] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Eeerm......] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Ah, but Senior Rinka said something like this. "It is natural for Ayane to be curious because Kazuto-kun is a wonderful boy. But I'm not worried, and I don't need to make a fuss about it. Because I am his wife. No matter how many girls there are, I will always be the number one."...... that is.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3">......Those are the lines that I can afford to hear in my brain. And certainly sounds like something Rinka would say.</div><div class="calibre3">I also wonder what's up with that line, it sounds like she was approving of me and Kiyokawa having that kind of relationship.</div><div class="calibre3">Am I overthinking this ......?</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't think this is possible, but does Senior Ayanokouji have permission from Senior Rinka to go out with more than one girl?] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Well, I've been told something like that a few times.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I knew it, with Senior Nana, you has.......] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I told you, I'm not a two-timing. The only one I love is Rinka, now and in the future.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I am relieved to hear those words. So, I'll ask for your cooperation after school today. I'll send you my address.] (Ayane)</b></div>
<div class="calibre3">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div>
<div class="calibre3">I receive Kiyokawa's address. It's an apartment not far from this school.</div><div class="calibre3">It'll only take about 10 minutes to get there by bike from my place.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[And I'm going to stop monitoring you from today. I apologize for the inconvenience I've caused you.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I see. So the surveillance is finally over. The period is shorter than I thought.</div><div class="calibre3">...... I don't know why, but when it comes to an end, I feel a little sad.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Hey Kiyokawa-san. If okay, why don't you spend lunch with us?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Eh?] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Today's lunch break, I, Kurumizaka-san, and Rinka, the three of us are planning to have lunch together. The place is located behind the old school building.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Behind the old school building? ....... It's a long way from here, but it's the best place to make sure no one finds you.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I know right?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3">It's a place that Kurumizaka-san found, though. But, for some reason, I was proud of it.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......Am I not going to be an intrude for you guys?] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No, you aren't. It's not like you and Rinka don't get along, right, Kiyokawa-san?] (Kazuto)</b></div>
<div class="calibre3">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div>
<div class="calibre3">If it is just me and Rinka, she might have let out one of her complaints.</div><div class="calibre3">However, since Kurumizaka-san will be there as well, it will be a lively gathering with her friends, won't it?</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Yes, of course we are. I understand. I'll be joining.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3">This is how the four of us will be spending lunch together today.</div><div class="calibre3">I casually invite them, but these three popular idols and I are going to spend lunch together.......</div><div class="calibre3">If the Star☆Mines' fans find out about this, I'm going to be beaten to a pulp.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazuto-kun, what's wrong?] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Rinka asks, probably she's feeling anxious after the chat had stopped for quite some time.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I invited Kiyokawa-san to lunch today, is it okay?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Of course, it's fine. Nana will be there as well today.] (Rinka)</b></div>
<div class="calibre3">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div>
<div class="calibre3">I'm relieved to get Rinka's approval.</div><div class="calibre3">If she said no, I'll have lost my face.</div><div class="calibre3">No, I have known that Rinka will willingly approve.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[But I wonder if Ayane will come. She seems to have a lot of friends, doesn't she? So, I think her lunch schedule is already fully booked.] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa...... You didn't tell them you're an all-alone girl?</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[And I'm going to her house today, is it okay?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It's fine.] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Does it not bother you?] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It bothers me a little, though. But...... you two are friends, right? It's fine then. I don't want to shackle Kazuto-kun's or Ayane's activities with something like this.] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I understand. You put great faith in us, yes.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Eee. This is just the leeway a wife can afford, okay.] (Rinka)</b></div><div class="calibre3">......It's the usual Rinka.</div>
