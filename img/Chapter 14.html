<h3>Chapter 14 &#8211; Who We're To Each Other</h3>

<div class="calibre3">I'm just a regular guy and a nerd gamer, so there's no way I could give proper thoughts.......</div><div class="calibre3">In any case, the unveiling of the new costumes ended with me just saying it was cute.</div><div class="calibre3">After that, the five of us, including Nonoa-chan, had a casual conversation and finished the day.</div><div class="calibre3">The original plan was for Rinka, Nonoa-chan, and I to spend the day off together, but it's nice to have a day like this once in a while.</div><div class="calibre3">It is a different matter, however, if the existence of Kiyokawa can be considered positively.......</div><div class="calibre3">No, it's not that I dislike Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">I just wish she would be a little more tolerant of me.</div><div class="calibre3">I also wish she would do something about her subtle harshness.</div><div class="calibre3">She's a neat and tidy young lady with a reputation for being kind to everyone, but her words are harsh only to me.</div><div class="calibre3">So I get a little pis*ed off and argue back....... It's a negative chain of events.</div><div class="calibre3">I want to get along with Kiyokawa somehow.</div><div class="calibre3">"It's best if I can just get along with Kiyokawa normally without having to do anything difficult." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">What should I do to make that happen.......?</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa thinks that I'm a womanizer.</div><div class="calibre3">The reason why she thinks I'm a womanizer is that Rinka, who hates men, is in deep love with me.</div><div class="calibre3">In addition, it's also because Kurumizaka-san has complete faith in me.</div><div class="calibre3">In other words, she has doubts about my humanity.</div><div class="calibre3">The other reason is...... she's keeping an eye on me because someone was about to catch out my and Rinka's rendezvous.</div><div class="calibre3">"No good, on second thought, maybe Kiyokawa's right." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Time will probably take care of the womanizing thing. It's easy to see that I don't have a relationship with women.</div><div class="calibre3">It's just that Rinka, who is very affectionate towards me, and Kurumizaka-san, are special. ......It makes me sad to say it myself.</div><div class="calibre3">In that case, the problem would be the our almost caught-out relationship.</div><div class="calibre3">It was irrefutably my fault. But in fact, Kiyokawa is naive enough to only monitor us.</div><div class="calibre3">"The only way is to steadily build up trust......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It takes 20 years to build up trust, but only 5 minutes to lose it.</div><div class="calibre3">There is even a quote like that. If I want to be trusted by that Kiyokawa, I have to work hard.</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's just go play a game while thinking about it!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I click on the icon of Black Plains with my mouse without hesitation.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm so impressed with myself that I'm a complete nerd gamer.</div><div class="calibre3">"Has Rin logged in...... she hasn't, Sturm Angriff has not either." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I mutter to myself as I check my friend list. I don't have any proof, but I'm pretty sure neither of them will be logging in today.</div><div class="calibre3">I also check the login status of my other friends.</div><div class="calibre3">......was there.</div><div class="calibre3">Only one person is logged in. It is Masked☆Aaya-san</div><div class="calibre3">As I'm thinking about whether to talk to her, she sent me a nicely-timed chat, "Want to do dailies?". And without hesitation, I immediately reply, "Let's do!". She immediately sends me a request for a party, which I accept.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It's been a while, Kazu. How are you?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't feel so good. I've been through some pretty rough times lately.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Is there a reason for that? I don't mind listening to your story.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I see, just a chat before doing the daily. It's not bad.</div><div class="calibre3">I chat with Masked☆Aaya-san about the recent events, including today.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, I don't mention my personal name or identity.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Isn't it awful? Kazu's junior girl. She's a real a**hole.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I'm talking about Kiyokawa. When I tell her that I was being watched by a junior (Kiyokawa) while keeping it a secret that Rinka and the others are idols, she was acting like some kind of stalker and tailing me.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't think she's a bad guy, though......] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No, it is terrible. She unilaterally treats Kazu like a womanizer and tails him around in school, right? Definitely a bad girl.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Well, I mean, there are some certain circumstances, too...... I can't tell you the details, though.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Why the tone of yours is defending that junior? I mean, I'm surprised that Kazu in real life had a girlfriend.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Right? I'm surprised too.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What the heck... </b><strike class="calibre23">awokwokaok</strike><b class="calibre4"> LΜFΛΘ.] (Masked☆Aaya) </b><i class="calibre24"><span class="calibre17">(PTW/N: sorry, just joking around)</span></i></div><div class="calibre3">I've kept Rin's true identity a secret from Masked☆Aaya-san.</div><div class="calibre3">So I haven't told her how I came to have her as my girlfriend.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I know it, Kazu is popular, after all~. Right~.....] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I feel like she's saying it with some kind of ruefulness.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What's wrong?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Nothing in particular. Considering what happened in the guild days, I thought it made sense that Kazu would be popular.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Guild days...... It was a time when I (a middle school student) and Aaya-san were members of the same guild.</div><div class="calibre3">One day, there was an incident in the guild centered on Aaya-san, a female player.</div><div class="calibre3">That was a really tough time.</div><div class="calibre3">The incident started with the idea of having an offline meeting.</div><div class="calibre3">It all started when Aaya-san refused to have an off-line meeting because of her policy of withholding information about her real life.</div><div class="calibre3">Apparently, the guild members were starving for women and were desperate to invite her to an offline meeting.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, Aaya-san didn't mean to do that, then they ended up arguing about something, and somehow I got involved in the commotion....... Before I knew it, I was in a position to defend Aaya-san.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, objectively speaking, the crazy ones are the people in the guild.</div><div class="calibre3">They must have been crazy to forcibly invite her to an offline meeting.</div><div class="calibre3">So, it was inevitable that I would take Aaya-san's side.</div><div class="calibre3">As a result, Aaya-san and I left the guild and became unaffiliated players......</div><div class="calibre3">Since then, we have been active as independent players without belonging to a guild.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[So, is everything okay with Aaya-san? I mean, that handsome guy.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It's not okay at all. That guy might be a lolicon.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Seriously? A two-timing guy, then a lolicon as well, how terrible!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Ah, about it, he wasn't two-timing. I've been watching him lately and I figured it out. Also, he seems to really like my senior who looks like Rinka-san.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Heeh. But he's a lolicon, right?] (Kazu]</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Probably. He was trying to put his hands on her younger sister (1st grader).] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Oh, man! Let's exile him to a deserted island!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It's still a possibility, okay? I haven't confirmed that he's a lolicon yet, though.]&nbsp; (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[He's definitely a lolicon! Let's get rid of that handsome guy!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......you really hate handsome guy much, yes.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I can see Aaya-san has a dumbfounded expression on her face. I've never seen her face before, though.</div><div class="calibre3">I mean, I've heard such a story before. And it's like what I experienced today.</div><div class="calibre3">But in my case, I only proposed to Nonoa-chan in a playing. And I didn't put my hands on her.</div><div class="calibre3">After all, that lolicon handsome bastard and I are polar opposites.</div><div class="calibre3">After that, we forget about the dailies and just complain about our real-life things.</div><div class="calibre3">Aaya-san curses my junior (Kiyokawa) as a terrible girl, and I curse that lolicon handsome bastard.</div><div class="calibre3">The chat of ours is very lively.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......I got a feeling that the junior of Kazu is kinda familiar, somehow. I wonder if it's just my imagination.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Is there someone close to you who looks like her?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't know if I should say it "close to me", but....... No, the situation is completely different from this one.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Aaya-san, who seems to have solved the problem herself, continued to send me a chat.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What kind of life does that girl usually lead?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[She seems to have a busy life, but I don't know much about her.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">The only thing I know about Kiyokawa is her reputation on the Internet.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know her friendships and I also don't know her standing in the school.</div><div class="calibre3">And I, realize that now.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know anything slightest about Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Oh no! The date is about to change! I should go to bed! Good night, Kazu!] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Good night!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Aaya-san is logging out. So I am.</div><div class="calibre3">"I wonder what kind of girl Kiyokawa really is." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She's a neat and tidy young lady and rich. She is a popular idol. And she is also the background leader of Star☆Mines.</div><div class="calibre3">So what kind of standing does she have in the school?</div><div class="calibre3">Up until now, I've only thought of Kiyokawa as an annoying presence who keeps monitoring me, and I've never been interested to know her real self.</div><div class="calibre3">But after chatting with Aaya-san, I feel like I want to know more about Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Let's do a little investigation." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">If you want to get to know people, it's not a bad idea to start by gathering information.</div><div class="calibre3">Tomorrow is reverse, I'll be the one who monitors her...... No, I mean, I'll observe Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm rather curious to see what the school life of a neat and tidy idol is like.</div>
