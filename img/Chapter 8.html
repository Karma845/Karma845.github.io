<h3>Round 8: If I Weren’t an Idol</h3>

<p>I close the lid of the bento box and take out two types of napkins.</p>
<p>The navy blue one is what I usually use. The other one, a yellow napkin, is something I pulled out from the closet after a long time.</p>
<p>It also happens to be the favorite color of a certain idol.</p>

<p>The time is just past six in the morning.</p>
<p>Normally, I would still be in bed dreaming at this hour.</p>
<p>Originally, I had to wake up early because I was on day duty today, but if that were the only reason, setting the alarm a little earlier would be enough.</p>

<p>The true reason for waking up early is to hand over this bento to my neighbor.</p>
<p>Today is finally the day of the 【Spotlights】 performance.</p>
<p>The live show starts in the evening, so it seems they will be entering the venue around noon.</p>

<p>This bento is a gift, so to speak.</p>
<p>I’m sure the venue will be lined with luxurious catering that puts this humble homemade bento to shame.</p>
<p>Still, my body moved on its own. Waking up at four in the morning, I imagined Yuzuki’s happy face as I packed each ingredient one by one into a three-tiered bento.</p>
<p>It might be a bit bulky to carry, but I hope she’ll overlook that.</p>

<p>The problem is how to hand it over.</p>
<p>I stare at my left little finger.</p>

<p>“…”</p>

<p>I haven’t seen Yuzuki once for three days since we had an after-school snack together.</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of face I should make.</p>
<p>What was the intention behind that?</p>
<p>Was it just an accidental touch? Or just a whim?</p>
<p>Could it be that Yuzuki sees me as a member of the opposite sex…?</p>
<p>No, that’s jumping to conclusions.</p>

<p>Yuzuki is an idol.</p>
<p>At handshake events, she exchanges handshakes with hundreds, even thousands of fans.</p>
<p>Just like the day I first met her, part of her job is to gently envelop the hands of those who come and support see her.</p>
<p>Getting excited over just connecting little fingers is too much.</p>
<p>This is why boys with no dating experience often get carried away.</p>

<p>I don’t have the courage to hand it to her directly.</p>
<p>But then again, leaving it on the door lever at home doesn’t feel right either.</p>
<p>Time to head to school was approaching. So I left the house with my thoughts still in disarray.</p>

<p>The room next door was quiet.</p>
<p>She couldn’t have left earlier, could she?</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, Yuzuki said she would head to the venue from home.</p>
<p>I heard that some members stay at a hotel, but this time, due to the event being in a large venue, Yuzuki wanted to prepare mentally at home.</p>

<p>As I was considering sending it by bike courier, I heard the sound of a key turning, ‘click’, unlocking the door.</p>
<p>Room 810’s door slowly opens.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki was casually dressed, as if she were about to head out to a neighboring town for fun.</p>

<p>“O-oh, g-good morning.”</p>
<p>“What? Are you nervous about something?”</p>

<p>She giggles. Yuzuki probably meant it as a joke, but it wasn’t entirely untrue.</p>

<p>“…The live starts at seven in the evening, right? I bought a streaming ticket.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I’ll make sure Suzufumi falls for me as a fan today!”</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Yuzuki was as usual.</p>
<p>Maybe I was overthinking it. When you live away from your parents, there are days when you long for the warmth of others.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was just a coincidence that I was nearby at that time.</p>
<p>Seeing Yuzuki looking cheerful, I shouldn’t feel lonely; that must not be right.</p>

<p>“Right… Here.”</p>

<p>I extended a bright yellow square package towards her.</p>

<p>“Oh, this is…”</p>
<p>“This is… you know. Live performances are a battle of stamina, so don’t go overboard with the food restraint on the day of the show, that’s what I mean… The contents are centered around fish and vegetables. I’ve also thought about the nutritional balance, so it’s healthy. Make sure you eat well at lunch.”</p>
<p>“Ah, lunch… all of this for lunch!?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s eyes widen. I, too, am now reflecting on it.</p>

<p>“Just put it in the freezer if there’s any leftover. I’m heading out first.”</p>
<p>“Wait, just a minute!”</p>

<p>I pressed the bento, or rather the stacked food boxes, against Yuzuki and hurried toward the elevator.</p>
<p>I stepped into the elevator and peeked at her face/</p>
<p>Yuzuki narrows her eyes, looking down gently at the heavy box she’s holding in both hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Yuzuki looked up, and our eyes met.</p>

<p>“Look forward to the live show!”</p>

<p>Her smile was clear and carefree, like a serene blue sky.</p>
<p>I waved back gently and pressed the ‘close’ button.</p>
<p>The moment the door closed, I covered my eyes with my palm.</p>

<p>It’s no good.</p>
<p>Just seeing Yuzuki happy over a meal makes my heart race.</p>
<p>I want to see your smiling face even more, Yuzuki—I want to take care of you even more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Thanks to overexerting myself in first-period basketball in gym class, I was somehow able to switch gears and focus on the lessons.</p>
<p>I don’t like studying at home much, so I consciously try to concentrate as much as possible in school classes.</p>
<p>By the way, my friend in the seat in front of me seemed to be working hard on sleep-study.</p>
<p>If he could just stay awake here, he could have spent less time studying after school.</p>

<p>The classes went smoothly until the fourth period, and then it was lunch break.</p>
<p>Normally, I have lunch with the sleep-study guy, but he had been summoned by Mikami-sensei earlier.</p>
<p>Well, you’re bound to get scolded if you sleep until noon every day.</p>
<p>For many students, being alone with Mikami-sensei feels like a reward though.</p>
<p>Maybe even I would have been secretly happy about it a month ago if that happened to me.</p>

<p>By the way, Mikami-sensei seems to have purchased a local ticket three months ago for today’s live concert, which is a fan club privilege.</p>
<p>If she leaves work on time, she’ll just barely make it.</p>
<p>She joked that if the evening staff meeting drags on, she’s planning to be suddenly struck by a headache, stomachache, and back pain all at once.</p>

<p>“If you always work diligently, you won’t be suspected at times like this.”</p>

<p>This morning, when I went to pick up the class journal, Mikami-sensei boasted about it.</p>
<p>Well, normally I’d eat my lunch at my desk, but since I’m alone today, maybe I’ll try using the bench in the courtyard.</p>
<p>The sunlight shining through the leaves looks pleasant.</p>

<p>I put on my shoes, walked around the school building, and headed to the courtyard.</p>
<p>Orikita’s school is divided into the learning building and the club building, arranged like the number ‘two (二)’.</p>
<p>The longer horizontal line is the learning building, where the classrooms for each grade are located. The courtyard is situated between the two lines.</p>
<p>Though called a courtyard, it’s just trees and benches spaced evenly apart, quite far from the vending machines and the school store, so there are hardly any students during lunch break.</p>

<p>Today, as always, there’s not a soul in sight, and I have the place all to myself.</p>
<p>I unfold the navy blue napkin and am about to open my lunchbox when my smartphone in my pocket vibrates.</p>

<p>“…Whoa.”</p>

<p>The LCD screen displayed ‘Sasaki Yuzuki.’</p>
<p>I took three deep breaths before tapping the call button.</p>

<p>『…You’ve done it, Suzufumi…』</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s voice from the other side of the smartphone was ominous.</p>
<p>I had a pretty good idea why.</p>

<p>“Did you like the special healthy bento I made for you?”</p>
<p>『There is nothing healthy about it!』</p>

<p>I turn down the volume before putting on the wireless headphones.</p>

<p>『The first tier is a meat medley of tonkatsu, fried white fish, and meatballs. The second tier is a trio of heavy hitters: spaghetti salad, potato salad, and mashed pumpkin salad. The bottom tier is packed with fried rice. There’s not even a trace of healthiness in it!』</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? I also prepared a chopped salad with green and yellow vegetables.”</p>
<p>『That’s my point, it’s too much for one meal! Even the staff were dumbfounded, they said it’s bigger than a sports day bento!』</p>

<p>I hear the sound of chopsticks being split as she talks in an exasperated tone.</p>

<p>“Have you already arrived at the venue?”</p>
<p>『Yep, I’m in the dressing room. The other members haven’t arrived yet, so I’m alone right now.』</p>

<p>I see, she wants to finish eating before anyone spots her.</p>

<p>“You didn’t have to thank me right now. To think you’d take time out of your busy schedule to call—that’s very considerate.”</p>
<p>『It’s not a thank-you call! You know, it’s like those purchase bonuses, ‘the right to a one-minute phone call with your favorite idol’! It’s a fan service that allows for two-way communication with an idol who’s usually out of reach while also satisfying your desire for possessiveness!』</p>
<p>“Desire for possessiveness? But we always talk in person.”</p>

<p>This kind of casual conversation with her makes my heart feel at ease.</p>
<p>Despite being in different places, there’s a comforting feeling as if we’re sitting together.</p>

<p>“I might be the one who gave it to you, but you don’t need to worry too much about finishing everything.”</p>
<p>『Well, it was forced on me, right? It would be a waste to throw it away.』</p>

<p>The way she’s lining up excuses——she’s clearly eager to eat it.</p>
<p>Cute.</p>

<p>『Then, itadakimasu. Starting with the auspicious tonkatsu…』</p>

<p>Starting with meat is so typical of Yuzuki.</p>

<p>『Wow, it’s still crispy even though it’s already cold♥ Because it’s thinly sliced, the texture is light and it doesn’t make your mouth feel heavy.』</p>
<p>“When making the batter, I mix in just a little bit of vinegar. It’s said to have an effect in suppressing the production of gluten, which can cause stickiness in your mouth.”</p>
<p>『The white fish is crispy and fluffy♥ I also like how the chunks in the tartar sauce are nice and big.』</p>
<p>“I made the tartar sauce myself. Boiled eggs and pickles are coarsely mashed.”</p>
<p>『The meatballs here are dense, giving you that ‘eating meat~’ feeling♥ The aftertaste of black vinegar is refreshing and light.』</p>

<p>I don’t bother pointing out that more than a minute has passed.</p>
<p>More than anything, I wanted to hear more of Yuzuki’s voice.</p>

<p>『I also like to nibble on the salad on the second tier for a break~♥ The spaghetti salad is creamy with plenty of mayo, and the potato salad looks heavy at first glance, but it’s refreshing and well-balanced with cucumber and a strong hit of black pepper, and the mashed pumpkin is sweet enough to be a dessert♥』</p>

<p>I also taste each of the salads. Although the ingredients are similar, each has its own charm, and I find myself reaching for more.</p>

<p>『Finally, the fried rice… Yeah, the robust flavor of the diced chashu and the refreshing sensation of the green onions are in harmony. The aroma of soy sauce is refreshing as it passes through the nose♥ It goes well with the other dishes since the ingredients are simple.』</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s smile comes vividly to mind.</p>
<p>As I eat my bento, I can’t help but think about what appetizers to prepare for the post-concert celebration.</p>

<p>“…Ah”</p>

<p>The sound of the bell for the next class weaves through the gaps in the trees and reaches my ears.</p>
<p>I don’t want to, but it’s about time to head back to the classroom.</p>
<p>More than half of my bento is still left.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I have to go back; the afternoon classes are starting.”</p>
<p>『Fuguhymi hoho ho fuhyou hanhahhehe』(Suzufumi, gogo no jugyō ganbattene)</p>
<p>“Make sure you swallow before you talk.”</p>

<p>Gulp-, then I heard a particularly loud sound.</p>

<p>『Suzufumi, do your best in the afternoon classes.』(Suzufumi, gogo no jugyō ganbattene)</p>
<p>“Yuzuki, you go and increase your fanbase too.”</p>
<p>『Leave it to me. I’m in perfect condition.』</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>『 ….. 』</p>

<p>Even though we need to end the call, only the sound of each other’s breath resonates through the phone.</p>

<p>『Hey, I’ve been wondering… Suzufumi——』</p>

<p>A strong wind blows, and the trees rustle loudly.</p>

<p>『——Does Suzufumi like me?』</p>

<p>The bell rings once again. Afternoon classes have started.</p>

<p>As an idol? Or as a person of the opposite sex?</p>
<p>I wonder which of the two she is referring to.</p>
<p>But either way, my answer has always been the same from the beginning.</p>

<p>“…I am…”</p>

<p>Yet, my mouth won’t move as I want it to.</p>
<p>Crossing this line will undoubtedly change our relationship.</p>
<p>At the very least, it will place a psychological burden on Yuzuki.</p>

<p>『It’s okay, you don’t have to answer.』</p>

<p>Calm like trees swaying by a lakeside—a gentle voice comes back to me.</p>

<p>『You know, every day has been fun lately.』</p>
<p>“Was it different before?”</p>
<p>『Of course, it was also fun. Singing on TV shows, variety shows, voice training, dance practice, all of it. After all, I became the idol I always wanted to be. There are many hard days, but I have never once regretted becoming ‘Arisu Yuzuki’. That’s why I thought I would live my whole life as Arisu Yuzuki.』</p>

<p>Rika, Mikami-sensei, Hozumi, everyone calls her Arisu Yuzuki.</p>
<p>In fact, Yuzuki may be pleased playing the role of ‘an idol’s private life’ at school.</p>
<p>But currently, the person eating a volume-packed bento on the other end of the phone is not the ‘Arisu Yuzuki’ who prefers French cuisine but the ordinary ‘Sasaki Yuzuki’ who adores junk food.</p>

<p>『I like eating bento while talking on the phone. I like snacking after school. I like having someone explain things to me when I don’t understand my studies. I like watching okonomiyaki cooking on a hot plate. I hate pretending to be someone else at school. I was trying to make you nervous with a swimsuit, but I ended up getting nervous myself. I like the time when you come over to my house. I like the pork bowl you made for me as a gift. If I weren’t…』</p>

<p>I heard the sound of a deep breath being taken.</p>

<p>『If I weren’t an idol… I wonder if I could have said what I wanted to say next.』</p>

<p>The call ended, and the smartphone’s display switched back to the home screen.</p>
<p>No more voices could be heard from the earphones.</p>
<p>I let my hands hang down and looked up at the sky from the bench.</p>

<p>“…It’s too dazzling.”</p>

<p>The sky was clear without a single cloud. I wanted to bask in this light for a while.</p>
<p>——On this day, I skipped class for the first time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The time was 6:50 p.m.</p>
<p>I sat on my bed in my room while intently staring at my smartphone.</p>
<p>The live performance of 【Spotlights】 was about to start soon.</p>

<p>As I logged into the streaming site, I saw that hundreds of fans were already waiting, interacting with each other in the chat section.</p>
<p>On the screen, the fixed camera at the venue showed a variety of glowing light sticks. Green, blue, red, orange… Among the various colors, yellow was the most prominent.</p>
<p>The member associated with the yellow image color was Arisu Yuzuki.</p>

<p>After getting home, I scoured the net for videos of 【Spotlights】.</p>
<p>This included music videos, clips from official accounts of singing programs, and dance videos that went viral on social media.</p>
<p>I also watched a certain footage from their early days.</p>
<p>The location was a plaza inside a department store, apparently for a debut song showcase event.</p>
<p>Five girls were singing in a simple space bordered only by partition boards.</p>
<p>It must have been summer because the audience was all in short sleeves, and there was a special sale on electric fans at the edge of the screen.</p>

<p>Such trivial information caught my attention because their performance was, well, pretty awful.</p>
<p>It felt like they were amateurs, to the point where you could believe they just gathered random people on the spot and tried to pass them off as idols.</p>

<p>Except for one girl. That girl was on the right end.</p>
<p>She sang with a lively bounce, never missing a pitch, and her choreography was flawless.</p>
<p>She alone had a sharpness that was on a different level, naturally drawing the eyes to follow her.</p>
<p>Despite the beads of sweat on her forehead, her smile never faltered.</p>
<p>Above all, her attitude of wanting to entertain the audience was clear. Every gesture and movement seemed to be filled with passion and soul.</p>
<p>The girl’s name was Arisu Yuzuki, who would later become the absolute idol at the center of the group.</p>

<p>Back on my smartphone, the lights in the venue dimmed.</p>
<p>It seemed the performance was about to begin.</p>

<p>After a grand introduction, spotlights shone on the stage, illuminating five idols.</p>
<p>They stood with their hands on their chests, eyes closed in silence.</p>
<p>The live performance began. The song was the hit that had brought 【Spotlights】 into the limelight. Of course, the center is Arisu Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Everyone, let’s go!”</p>

<p>With Yuzuki’s shout, the performance started. Even the chant of ‘Oi! Oi!’ as she waved her arms towards the audience was mesmerizing.</p>
<p>The voice that came through the microphone was so powerful that it seemed to break through the dimensional barrier. Even through the screen, it sent a tingling sensation to my heart.</p>
<p>Not just the singing and dancing——What also amazed me was the richness of her expressions.</p>
<p>Smiling, posing, winking. Seeing her face constantly changing as if possessed by the lyrics captivated me.</p>

<p>The first song ended, and thunderous applause erupted.</p>
<p>I found myself clapping unconsciously, too.</p>

<p>It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p>Despite frequently visiting her house, sharing meals together, and being just a few meters apart in private——at this moment, Yuzuki felt incredibly far away from me.</p>
<p>An ordinary high school girl doesn’t fill halls with people. She doesn’t sing or dance in front of thousands. She doesn’t blow kisses to the crowd.</p>

<p>The turmoil in my chest won’t settle down.</p>
<p>It’s as if Yuzuki has gone far away.</p>

<p>No, I actually understand.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Yuzuki always belonged to a different world than mine.</p>
<p>It just so happened that, by various coincidences, our paths accidentally crossed.</p>

<p>──If I weren’t an idol…</p>
<p>No, that’s not it, Yuzuki.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t strive for such perfection if you weren’t an idol.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t have struggled to manage your appetite if you weren’t a perfectionist.</p>
<p>You wouldn’t have collapsed at home and been found by me.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have fallen for you, and we probably wouldn’t have developed such a close neighborhood relationship.</p>
<p>It’s precisely because Yuzuki is an idol who pursues perfection that I made a pork bowl, and you desperately resisted, creating a connection between us.</p>

<p>The second song quickly began.</p>
<p>Yuzuki moved to the right end of the stage as the intro played.</p>
<p>I recognize this melody. It’s their debut song. The one they must have performed hundreds of times, the one they’ve practiced the most.</p>
<p>Even the girl to Yuzuki’s left, who seemed less adept at dancing, moved with confidence.</p>

<p>The camera occasionally switches, showing close-ups of each member in turn.</p>
<p>The leader girl, the tall girl who sweated a lot, the one who seems to struggle with dancing, the girl who sings well, and then Yuzuki——</p>

<p>“…Hm?”</p>

<p>It was just a brief moment, a split second. Or perhaps it was just my imagination.</p>
<p>I thought I saw Yuzuki’s expression falter slightly.</p>

<p>The camera captures all five members.</p>
<p>Their unison dance was perfectly synchronized. Pitch, lyrics, smiles——everything was spot on.</p>
<p>However, I felt a strange discomfort in my heart, as if something was off.</p>
<p>It was probably my imagination.</p>
<p>If there was any trouble, the other members or the audience would have reacted.</p>
<p>The live performance is proceeding without a hitch.</p>

<p>By the time the third song ended, I was once again engrossed in the live performance.</p>

<p>The girl who seemed to struggle with dancing turned out to be great at talking, stealing the show every time she spoke during the MC segments.</p>
<p>The girl with a good singing voice seemed quick-witted, adeptly playing along with both the jokes and the responses depending on the audience’s mood.</p>
<p>The leader, always a step back, smiling and watching over the scene while subtly adjusting the members’ positions with gentle body touches.</p>
<p>The tall girl who sweated a lot was constantly wiping her sweat, eliciting calls of ‘Are you okay?’ from the audience.</p>
<p>To which she replied with the puzzling comeback, ‘It’s not sweat, it’s citrus orange!’</p>
<p>It seemed to be a standard exchange, apparently a play on her image color of orange.</p>
<p>Each of the four members showcased their charm, not just through their songs but also in other aspects.</p>

<p>But still, I was completely captivated by Yuzuki.</p>
<p>That talk segment, I remember her practicing over and over in the living room while I was cooking.</p>
<p>That gesture of tracing her lips with her finger reminds me of homemade jiro ramen.</p>
<p>Even when she changed into a slightly more provocative outfit for the finale, it was nothing compared to seeing her in a swimsuit right in front of me.</p>
<p>—The more Yuzuki shone as an idol, the more the real Yuzuki came to my mind.</p>

<p>The nearly two-hour-long live concert came to a finale in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Even after all the performances, including the encore, were over, there was no sign of the venue’s energy dropping; the stream ended still wrapped in cheers and excitement.</p>

<p>“Yuzuki is amazing…”</p>

<p>I placed my smartphone beside the bed and sat there in a daze for a while.</p>

<p>I want Yuzuki to come back soon.</p>
<p>I was eager to share my thoughts with her as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>But there’s probably a wrap-up party after this, so she would return home late.</p>
<p>It’d be a nuisance to drop in at midnight, so maybe I should message her when she gets home.</p>
<p>No, it’s going to turn into an absurdly long text. Things like this are best said in person. I’ll wait until first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Let’s do it first thing tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>That night, I fell asleep enveloped in a sense of happiness.</p>

<p>——From this day, Yuzuki did not come back home.</p>
