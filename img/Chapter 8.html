<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Masked☆Aaya</h3>

<div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">[Well, I'd better log out. Good night, Kazu.] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[Yeah, good night.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">The blonde elf disappears from the screen.</div><div class="calibre3">"Rin-san has logged out" is displayed in the chatbox.</div><div class="calibre3">It's almost 22:00., the time of Rin's to log out.</div><div class="calibre3">"Now......, what am I going to do?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Normally I would stay online until 23:00.</div><div class="calibre3">But today I'm tired.</div><div class="calibre3">I holed up in a locker with Rinka during the lunch break and even became acquainted with Kiyokawa.......</div><div class="calibre3">So, I'm emotionally exhausted.</div><div class="calibre3">The only saving grace was that Kiyokawa was supportive of the relationship between me and Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">Normally, it would have been denied.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinko, a popular idol, is backstreet dating a man...... is a newsworthy topic.</div><div class="calibre3">If I'm not careful, the name of Star☆Mines will be damaged.</div><div class="calibre3">Despite this, Kurumizaka-san is supporting us with all her might, and even Kiyokawa, whom I met today, was skeptical at first, but in the end, she was convinced.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't mean to sound bad, but I can only describe her as a soft-hearted person.</div><div class="calibre3">If that's the case, the right thing to do would be to get even angrier.</div><div class="calibre3">"... I have nothing to do other than online games." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As I'm wondering if I should log out or go mining, the chatbox shows a notification of, "Masked☆Aaya-san has logged in".</div><div class="calibre3">Her age is unknown (like Rin, she doesn't give out any information about her real-life, but she often talks about her real-life occurrences).</div><div class="calibre3">She has a strong personality and her hobby is writing novels.</div><div class="calibre3">We've been friends since I was in middle school, and we're very close.</div><div class="calibre3">At one point, Rinka suspected her of being a hode old man and almost unfriended her.</div><div class="calibre3">......She is definitely a good person. She gave me advice on many things.</div><div class="calibre3">When I asked her about marrying in the game, she kindly gave me advice.</div><div class="calibre3">[It's been a while. If you're free, can you help me with my dailies?] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">She has just asked me.</div><div class="calibre3">What she means by dailies are the daily quests that are given out every other day. If you complete them, you get a good reward. Some of the daily quests include defeating field bosses, so she probably wants me to help her with that.</div><div class="calibre3">[All right. I'll help you for 100 million yen.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[You're as unique as ever. By the way, where's Rin?] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Rin has logged out. Don't worry about it.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Ooo~kay.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">Whenever I'm playing with Rin, Aaya-san stops interacting with me. It seems she's paying attention to it.</div><div class="calibre3">In fact, she doesn't want to have any contact with other players besides me.</div><div class="calibre3">It's obvious that trying to play together with the three of us wouldn't go well, so I didn't force her to join us.</div><div class="calibre3">While Rin was away, I would play with Aaya-san and my other friends.</div><div class="calibre3">Or I'd just go mining by myself.</div><div class="calibre3">Or rather, I spent more time mining alone (crying).</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm going to the field boss.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[I understand. Leave it to me.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">Masked☆Aaya-san's occupation is a witch. She is a typical wizard who wears a pointy hat and a shabby robe. It's an excellent occupation to be able to use powerful attack and recovery magic, but there are gaps when chanting magic.</div><div class="calibre3">In other words, the person in charge of the vanguard has to protect Masked☆Aaya-san.</div><div class="calibre3">Yes, it's my role as a Warrior.</div><div class="calibre3">As someone who had been playing online games since I was in elementary school, I will definitely protect Masked☆Aaya-san!</div><div class="calibre3">☆</div>
<div class="calibre3">[What the h*ll it meant, Aaya-san?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[W-what is it?] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[It was about the boss fight we just had! You were just watching from behind!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">I was seriously surprised. I'd desperately attacked the target, but the boss's HP didn't go down at all.</div><div class="calibre3">When I turned around to see what was going on, Aaya-san was sitting in the corner of the arena. She's got to be kidding me.</div><div class="calibre3">[I was cheering for you, okay? "Hurray~ hurray~ Kazu~", like that.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Did that cheer help me in any way? It didn't even give me a buff in the slightest!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[But you won. It's no problem, then.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[I defeated it single-handedly! I fought with the intention of dying, you know!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Sorry. I suddenly got a phone call...... It was about work, so I couldn't ignore it.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[It can't be helped then! I'll forgive you, this time!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">I don't have the right to say irresponsible things like, "You should prioritize gaming over your work".</div><div class="calibre3">......But still, I'm not convinced!</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm busy with real life right now....... And there was a serious incident that occurred today.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Hee~ What kind?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">She probably wants me to listen. Thinking so, I ask her.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm used to hearing people complain about their real lives several times before.</div><div class="calibre3">In the meantime, any information that could identify the individual was withheld.</div><div class="calibre3">The relationship between Aaya-san and I is that of a good friend who discusses and complains to each other about real life and online game.</div><div class="calibre3">[Actually, one of my seniors at work has been dating a guy without telling anyone!] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[So, what's wrong with that?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[I can't tell you details, but in our line of work, if you go out with a guy, you're in trouble.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Hee~ Is she out of line?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Mm. But more like, romance is not allowed.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Somehow, it's just like an idol.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[It's not an idol. It's a different jbo.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">......Is she upset? She has a typo.</div><div class="calibre3">[Maybe senior is, being deceived by that guy.......] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Why?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[My senior's female friend praises the guy. There's a big possibility that it's a consensual two-timing. Even if it's not, the guy seemed to be experienced with women.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[I see. Is the guy good-looking?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[I think he's handsome in an inconspicuous way. The type that would be popular in the shadows.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Hee~.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">Sometimes, there are guys like that.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not flashy, but it's the type that makes a good impression on women.</div><div class="calibre3">[And by the way, my senior is Mizuki Rinka-san-like. Ah, do you know Star☆Mines?] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Yes, I do. I'm a fan of Mizuki Rinka.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Hmm. So Kazu likes idols too?] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm more of a fan of Rinka than the idol itself.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Waa, that sounds serious.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm dead serious, so what?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">No matter what anyone says, I'm a fan of Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">And, a girl who looks just like Rinka is dating a handsome stranger.......</div><div class="calibre3">Just thinking about it is enough made me so pis*ed off.</div><div class="calibre3">If that handsome guy is right in front of me, I might punch him.</div><div class="calibre3">[And also, my senior friend is Kurumizaka Nana-san-like.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Seriously? That handsome bastard is surrounded by too many beautiful girls!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">I think, but I'm in a similar situation, though.</div><div class="calibre3">However, I'm not handsome. Also, I'm not two-timing. I guess that makes a big difference between us.</div><div class="calibre3">[During the break at work, my Rinka-san-like senior kept merely talking about him lovingly fondly, and it was really frustrating, you know.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Okay, I'll give you a pass. Sink that handsome bastard.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[What's wrong with you all of a sudden⁉︎] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[The thought of Rinka and a random handsome guy making out is making me want to kill him.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[I'll say it again, she's a senior who looks like Mizuki Rinka-san, do you hear me!] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[But it still pi*ses me off, you know!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Geez, really, you're dead serious, aren't you!] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">Oh man, this is bad. I'm going to awaken a dark personality.</div><div class="calibre3">The hand gripping the mouse is getting stronger, and there is a mish-mash of screams coming from the mouse.</div><div class="calibre3">[Not only dating Rinka, but he's also dating Kurumizaka-san, huh? I have no choice but to sink him in Tokyo Bay.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[The two-timing is just my own presumption. So, calm down a bit.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">Sh*t, It's true, after all, good-looking guys are popular......!</div><div class="calibre3">But even so, a two-timing f*cking bastard isn't worth living in the same world as Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">[It seems that several times other people have almost found out that my senior and the guy are dating. It's dangerous to let it go on like this. Besides, the problem is the guy's personality.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[You're right. He may even be a handsome bastard who doesn't mind two-timing.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[I want to know more about the guy to protect my senior, but what should I do?] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Why don't you try hitting him with a blunt object for now?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[You're too pis*ed off, Kazu.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[......Why don't you try checking the identity of the guy?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know Aaya-san's age or identity, but I think she can do that.</div><div class="calibre3">[I'll do that. I'll also check to see if he's two-timing.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[I see. Don't overdo, okay.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Thank you, Kazu. You're the only person I can talk to about this stuff in real life or online.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[That sounds quite problematic.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[I can't help it. I'm a masked woman after all.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Mmm, What do you mean by that?] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Nothing. I don't think it has any deep meaning. Okay, let's do again for the next daily.] (Masked☆Aaya)</div><div class="calibre3">[Okay.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">Masked woman.......huh?</div><div class="calibre3">It must have some sort of meaning behind it, since she even put "mask" in her name.</div><div class="calibre3">......No, let's not over speculating about it.</div><div class="calibre3">No matter what kind of person Masked☆Aaya-san is, she's still a good friend of mine.</div>
