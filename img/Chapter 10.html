<h3>Round 10 – Please Continue to Be a Fan of Mine</h3>

<p>Arisu Yuzuki is a popular idol.</p>
<p>Since her breakthrough last year, she has shown a variety of faces, not just as a singer but also as an actor and a model.</p>
<p>With her outstanding looks and the demure presence befitting an idol, she behaves with an understanding of the theme of the program and the role expected of her.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that she is popular with both viewers and industry insiders.</p>
<p>In addition to her idol group activities, it seems her solo work is also flourishing now.</p>

<p>I borrowed a live DVD from Mikami-sensei.</p>
<p>Just as she said, Yuzuki was perfect at all times. She never missed a note, and her choreography was always correct.</p>
<p>Sometimes smiling, sometimes passionate—always making a face that matched the tone of the song.</p>

<p>Wondering if I could catch up with her latest activities, I checked Yuzuki’s SNS account.</p>
<p>However, the posts were nothing but casual morning greetings and quoted comments about her appearances.</p>
<p>I’ve been losing sleep and sparing no effort in following Arisu Yuzuki’s activities these past few days.</p>
<p>Although we were only physically a few meters apart before, now she seems so much farther away.</p>
<p>I always prepared meals for two, unable to give up hope that one day she might unexpectedly come back.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, the freezer was packed full.</p>

<p>Still, I never managed to catch a glimpse of her at school.</p>

<p>“…I should get going soon.”</p>

<p>Stepping out into the hallway, I lock the door.</p>
<p>I glance at the room to the left.</p>
<p>No one lives in Room 810 anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“…kun, Mamori-kun”</p>

<p>Someone is calling me. If they’re using my last name, I guess it must be a classmate.</p>

<p>“Wake up, Mamori-kun”</p>

<p>When I lifted my face from the desk, Mikami-sensei was standing there with her eyebrows furrowed and her hands on her hips.</p>

<p>“Class is still in session. Please try to hang in there until lunch break.”</p>
<p>“…huh, who?”</p>

<p>Having a strong impression of Mikami sensei in her ‘fan mode’, I inadvertently let out my honest thoughts upon facing her teacher mode after waking up. Laughter leaks from the seat in front of me.</p>
<p>“Pffthahaha-“, the student who sat in front of me couldn’t help but let out a burst of laughter. (Hozumi)</p>

<p>“You seem to be half asleep. Why don’t you go wash your face?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>

<p>Falling asleep during class was something I hadn’t done since starting high school. It seems my consecutive days of sleep deprivation are taking their toll.</p>

<p>Through the screen, I’ve been chasing Yuzuki’s shadow.</p>
<p>I hated the thought of being separated from her, so I tried to find some connection to her. But no matter how much I followed the idol Arisu Yuzuki, it seemed pointless.</p>

<p>Washing my face at the bathroom sink, I stare at the mirror and see a man with a haggard face.</p>
<p>Lacking vitality, with slightly rough skin and severe dark circles due to lack of sleep.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I caught sight of students who seemed to have just finished their physical education class outside the window.</p>
<p>Some were kicking a black and white ball as they walked.</p>
<p>It looked like they had been playing soccer.</p>

<p>There’s still just under ten minutes left until lunch break.</p>
<p>Did the game end early, or was it a teacher’s whim? The jersey is red, so they must be first-year students.</p>
<p>As several groups went into the school building, a lone female student standing a bit apart caught my eye.</p>

<p>“…Yuzuki!”</p>

<p>My body moved on its own.</p>
<p>Not only was I on the verge of falling asleep, I was considering skipping the class altogether.</p>
<p>Yet, my feet wouldn’t stop.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the school building’s entrance, I found Yuzuki just as she had finished changing into her indoor shoes.</p>
<p>She widened her eyes at the sight of me.</p>

<p>“…There’s a lot I want to ask you. Please come with me.”</p>

<p>I took Yuzuki’s hand and moved to the usual Resource Room.</p>
<p>Classes are still in session, so there shouldn’t be any worry of intruders this time.</p>

<p>“…What’s going on? You suddenly disappeared.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, leaning gently against the window, doesn’t answer.</p>

<p>“You don’t reply to messages, you don’t answer calls, and on top of that, you even suddenly move out of the apartment. Isn’t it too abrupt? Couldn’t you at least say something to me?”</p>

<p>Although I didn’t intend to confront her like this, my tone became accusatory once we were face to face.</p>
<p>I’m happy to see her… but why?</p>

<p>“Why don’t you say anything… Why did you suddenly disappear…”</p>

<p>After a heavy silence, the girl in front of me quietly smiled.</p>

<p>“I’m really sorry, I accidentally forgot to contact you.”</p>

<p>It’s as if ‘the curtain rises on the stage’.</p>
<p>A chill runs down my spine as the memory of our meeting a month ago flashes through my mind.</p>

<p>“Work suddenly got busy after the live performance. The agency is quite far from the apartment, so I thought it might be a good opportunity to move into the company dormitory. I apologize for not contacting you. Also, during the compliance training, the instructor said, ‘You never know where messages can leak from, so it’s better to avoid exchanges with men other than family members.’ “</p>
<p>“…What are you saying…?”</p>

<p>At first, I suspected amnesia. But she recognizes that I’m her former neighbor.</p>
<p>In other words, she’s playing dumb.</p>
<p>She’s severing our past relationship and acting like a complete stranger.</p>

<p>“By the way, I haven’t returned your bento box yet. I’ll send it via courier next time.”</p>
<p>“…No, that’s not important.”</p>
<p>“Oh, didn’t you buy a ticket for the live stream? How did you find my performance?”</p>

<p>With her hands clasped in front of her chest, she glances upward at me—stirring a protective desire.</p>

<p>The person in front of me is not Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>
<p>She’s the flawless idol—Arisu Yuzuki.</p>
<p>As I stared at her blankly, Yuzuki’s face blossomed into a perfect, courteous smile.</p>

<p>“…You know, Yuzuki, I’ve watched a lot of your shows and live performances. They were all amazing, and you were cool in all of them. I totally get why people become your fans.”</p>

<p>That’s why I have to say it now, my honest feelings.</p>

<p>“Let me answer the question you asked me the other day. I am—”</p>

<p>During a phone call some time ago, Yuzuki had asked me this.</p>

<p>──Does Suzufumi like me?</p>

<p>“I like you, Yuzuki. I want to be your strength.”</p>

<p>My feelings haven’t changed. If anything, they’ve grown even stronger.</p>
<p>Yuzuki then beamed an exceptionally radiant smile.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your support. ‘Please continue to be a fan of mine’, okay?”</p>

<p>My voice didn’t reach the idol.</p>
<p>The bell rings, pulling me back to reality.</p>

<p>“…I have to change and head back to the classroom soon. I’ve promised to have lunch with my friends. Well then, excuse me.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki passed by me and left the Resource Room.</p>

<p>“…ha, haha…”</p>

<p>I couldn’t even muster a self-deprecating smile.</p>
<p>——I stood there, motionless, and ended up skipping the afternoon classes as well.</p>


<p>That night, a courier service delivered a package to my house.</p>
<p>The contents of the package were a beautifully washed bento box.</p>
<p>The sender was ‘MIYATO Production Office,’ the name of the agency to which Yuzuki belongs.</p>
<p>With this, my connection with Yuzuki was completely severed.</p>

<p>It seemed pointless to do anything now.</p>
<p>After our real-life relationship was settled and a wall called ‘idol’ erected between us, there was nothing more I could do.</p>
<p>In fact, I should probably withdraw quietly if I truly care for her.</p>

<p>I lie on the living room sofa, staring blankly at the ceiling.</p>
<p>I have no intention of holding a grudge. In fact, I plan to continue supporting her idol activities quietly.</p>
<p>I’d like to go to a live concert at least once, and I’m curious about the handshake events.</p>
<p>Someday, after a long time, we’ll exchange a handshake that lasts only a second——Without any mention of our past as neighbors.</p>
<p>The situation hasn’t worsened at all. It’s just returned to how it was before we met.</p>

<p>──I’ll make you my fan!</p>
<p>Good for you, Yuzuki. You’ve achieved your goal.</p>
<p>──Itadakimasu!</p>
<p>Despite resisting so much, you’re all smiles once the meal starts.</p>
<p>──Yasai ninniku mashimashi abura karamé mashi, ō buta daburu de</p>
<p>There’s no other idol who would make such a homemade Jiro order.</p>
<p>(TN: Chapter 6, Extra vegetables, extra garlic, extra fat, seasoned extra, large pork double.)</p>

<p>──If I weren’t an idol… I wonder if I could have said what I wanted to say next.</p>
<p>It’s precisely because Yuzuki is an idol that we could become close.</p>

<p>The fact that I’ll never meet Sasaki Yuzuki again weighs heavily on me.</p>

<p>“…Yuzuki…!”</p>
<p>“I’m not Arisu Yuzuki—”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Next to the sofa, a brown-haired gal was sitting.</p>
<p>The beauty mark under her right eye, the earrings by her ears, and her pink lips were all too high-resolution to be just a dream.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rika? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“I rang the doorbell several times, but no one came out. I’m worried that they might be sick in bed or something. As your Onee-san, I can’t just not check you, right?”</p>

<p>No, I don’t mind that she’s entered the house.</p>
<p>What I’m confused about is why Rika is wearing an apron.</p>

<p>“You probably haven’t had dinner yet. I’ll cook for you today.”</p>

<p>With an innocent grin, Rika moves to the kitchen and turns on the stove under the frying pan.</p>
<p>There’s a pack of eggs on the counter, so it seems she’s planning to make something with eggs.</p>

<p>Wait, even though it’s a Teflon frying pan, did she put oil in it? And is she going to beat the eggs now?</p>
<p>It looks like some shell got in, but she doesn’t seem to notice.</p>
<p>She hasn’t sprinkled any salt or pepper either. Smoke is starting to rise, so she should turn on the ventilation fan quickly.</p>
<p>See, she’s coughing, “Ehh, it’s sticking in my nose!”. She should have used oil or butter first.</p>
<p>The smoke is getting darker. “Suzu! Help me! Fire, it’s a fire!” Ah, now the smoke detector goes off.</p>

<p>My concern overcomes the gloominess I felt before, so I involuntarily stand up from the sofa.</p>
<p>I first opened the small kitchen window and stopped the fire alarm.</p>
<p>Then I turn off the stove and place the frying pan on a wet cloth, and a hissing sound can be heard.</p>

<p>“Rika, can you wipe the table?”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>

<p>I remove the burnt egg onto a plate and take out another frying pan.</p>
<p>I use three eggs extravagantly, cracking them into a bowl and seasoning with salt, pepper, and granulated consommé.</p>
<p>Then I add milk, which will add moisture and create a fluffy texture.</p>
<p>I make sure to stir the eggs well to avoid uneven cooking.</p>

<p>Only now do I turn on the stove again, first heating the pan on high heat, then reducing it to medium.</p>
<p>Once the butter melts, I pour in the egg mixture, stirring from the outside to the inside.</p>
<p>When they’re half-cooked, I shape the edges with a spatula. The residual heat will finish the cooking, so I turn off the stove and tap the tilted pan to form an oval shape.</p>
<p>Lastly, I cook the seam briefly, and <em>voila</em>, a plain omelet is done.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s eat”</p>

<p>I haven’t cooked rice today, so packet rice will have to do.</p>
<p>Wanting a salad as well, I sprinkled chopped lettuce and frozen avocado, then drizzled it with Cobb salad dressing.</p>
<p>We sit opposite each other at the table, each with an omelet we made.</p>

<p>“Suzu, that…”</p>

<p>Rika points to what’s in front of me.</p>
<p>Lined up with her index finger is something that was once called an egg.</p>

<p>“Itadakimasu.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>I reach for the crumbly omelet that Rika made for me with my chopsticks.</p>
<p><em>Crunch- crunch-</em></p>

<p>“This is a new texture that overturns the common sense of egg dishes. It seems like rock salt would go better with this than ketchup.”</p>

<p>I sprinkle some coarse salt with a mill and take another bite.</p>
<p>Yeah, the bitterness of the egg pairs surprisingly well with the saltiness.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to force yourself…”</p>
<p>“I’m not forcing myself.”</p>

<p>I truly mean it. There’s no way I wouldn’t eat a meal that someone spent time and money preparing for me, especially when that someone is my proud childhood friend.</p>

<p>“More importantly, Rika, you should eat while it’s hot. Leaving it too long might overcook it.”</p>
<p>“Th-Then… Itadakimasu.”</p>

<p>As she cuts into it with her chopsticks, steam wafts softly from the center of the omelet.</p>
<p>Rika’s eyes widened when she hesitantly brought it to her mouth.</p>

<p>“Wow, it’s so creamy… Suzu is really amazing…”</p>

<p>That’s not true. Talent isn’t necessary for an amateur’s home cooking.</p>
<p>It will turn out fine ninety-nine percent of the time if you follow the recipe properly.</p>
<p>Rika’s just a bit too enthusiastic, but she’ll improve quickly once she gets the hang of it.</p>


<p>“…It’s tastier than it used to be.”</p>

<p>Rika put down her chopsticks and fixed her gaze on me.</p>

<p>“Hey, do you remember? The first dish you ever made for me was an omelet.”</p>
<p>“Was it? Honestly, it’s a bit hazy.”</p>
<p>“…I figured. It probably wasn’t anything special for you… But for me, meeting Suzu was a life-changing event.”</p>

<p>Kishibe Rika used to be my neighbor.</p>
<p>By chance, the Kishibe family lived next door to our apartment, and we became friends since we were close in age.</p>

<p>“I mean, I was way more rebellious back in elementary school than now, wasn’t I?”</p>
<p>“Well, I won’t deny that.”</p>

<p>Rika had health issues from birth, namely ‘severe asthma.’</p>
<p>It was so bad that she couldn’t even participate in physical activities or walk to school in a group, always relying on her mom for transportation.</p>

<p>“I was always absent from PE, and I couldn’t go on field trips or to forest school camps either. I got so frustrated wondering, ‘Why can’t I live like everyone else?’ Gradually, I stopped going to school and lashed out at Mom and Dad. I was completely at loss, I just wanted to stop living like that.”</p>

<p>Walking, running, going on trips—what was normal for others was as challenging as competing in the Olympics for Rika back then.</p>

<p>“That day, I was holed up in my room when suddenly the doorbell rang. I ignored it, but it kept ringing over and over. I was about to yell at whoever it was when I opened the door, and Suzu just barged in.”</p>
<p>“Well, no harm intended.”</p>

<p>I started to remember various things.</p>
<p>Until then, I had occasionally overheard conversations among the parents in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The gist was that Kishibe-san’s only daughter had been cooped up in her room for a long time.</p>
<p>It’s not like I had any grand ambitions to help her escape from being a shut-in or reconnect her with the world.</p>

<p>At first, I was glared at and pushed away, and we couldn’t have a proper conversation.</p>
<p>But as I continued to visit, I was promoted to someone who could be ignored even when I was in the room.</p>

<p>As usual, I was reading manga one Sunday in Rika’s room.</p>
<p>Then I heard a stomach growl from a distance.</p>
<p>Since Rika’s mom had previously told me to ‘make yourself at home’, I borrowed the kitchen and prepared lunch for two.</p>
<p>That’s when I made an omelet for her.</p>

<p>“You gave me the better one that time too.”</p>
<p>“I remember I got scolded later for using the stove without an adult around. But you remember that well.”</p>
<p>“I remember. I always remember. After all, all my classmates were annoyed with me, you know? Some even said, ‘If Kishibe-san doesn’t come to school, we can get seconds on dessert at lunch, so please don’t come.’ During that time, Suzu went out of his way to make food for someone like me and gave it to me. There’s no way I could forget that.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know much about what Rika’s school life was like before she became a shut-in. I never actively asked.</p>
<p>No matter how much others disliked her, it had nothing to do with the relationship between me and Rika.</p>

<p>“Suzu didn’t abandon me. I could keep myself from rotting away because I had those days with Suzu.”</p>

<p>For Rika, maybe that omelet was a paradigm shift.</p>
<p>After that, she started replying one out of three times, and eventually, she started coming over to the Mamori house to play.</p>
<p>By the time we entered junior high school, the frequency of her asthma symptoms showing up had decreased.</p>
<p>Whether it was the medicine working or her immunity increasing with her growth, I’m not sure.</p>
<p>Now she participates in PE classes unless she’s feeling particularly sick, and she can even work in our family’s izakaya.</p>

<p>“Whether it was housework or taking care of your personal needs, I wanted to repay Suzu in some way… Well, I think I’ve been spinning my wheels a little too much, though.”</p>
<p>“Just a little bit.”</p>
<p>“I want to be useful as Suzu Onee-san this time. Suzu never complains or shares his worries, so right now, I’m the only one who can push you forward, even if it’s a nuisance, I’ll ask… Did something happen with Arisu Yuzuki?”</p>
<p>“…That is”</p>

<p>Rika walked around the table and took my hand.</p>
<p>Her eyes were alight with a strong determination.</p>

<p>“…Various things happened, and now Yuzuki is avoiding me.”</p>
<p>“Did Suzu do something bad?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean to, but maybe I was just tormenting Yuzuki all along. In the end, I was just ‘meddling.’ “</p>

<p>Wanting her to eat delicious food, not wanting to repeat Dad’s mistakes, and all that stuff I said… It might have all just been my own one-sided struggle.</p>

<p>“…I don’t think that’s the case.”</p>

<p>Rika doesn’t let go of my hand. On the contrary, her grip gets even stronger.</p>

<p>“No, Rika, you can say that because you don’t know what happens between us.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I hardly know anything about Suzu and Arisu Yuzuki’s relationship. But you know, when Arisu Yuzuki was eating the okonomiyaki Suzu made, she was smiling. She was smiling from the bottom of her heart. I’m sure that wasn’t an act. People can’t lie while eating delicious food.”</p>
<p>“…Was Yuzuki happy then?”</p>

<p>Despite the distant attitude she had in the Resource Room during the day, the Yuzuki that comes to my mind is always smiling.</p>
<p>That time, and that time, and that time too.</p>

<p>“Besides, the Suzu who saved me when I was young didn’t care about others’ judgments or whether he was bothering them, right? Did you ever hold back against the rebellious me?”</p>
<p>“That is…”</p>

<p>Why did the young me persistently approach Rika, who was often gloomy and viewed the world as an enemy due to her poor health?</p>
<p>The answer came quickly.</p>

<p>I just didn’t want to leave Rika alone.</p>
<p>If she preferred to be alone, that would have been fine. But I was sure that wasn’t the case for Rika.</p>
<p>The words that come out of the mouth, the attitudes that appear on the surface——they don’t necessarily reflect the truth.</p>

<p>“Hey, how did you see that girl through your eyes, Suzu?”</p>

<p>I reflect on these past few days once again.</p>

<p>Yuzuki is a perfectionist.</p>
<p>Apart from maintaining her figure, she has high standards in her behavior in class, scandal prevention, and other areas beyond singing and dancing.</p>
<p>Being the ideal idol at all times is part of Yuzuki’s identity.</p>
<p>According to Mikami-sensei, Yuzuki made a mistake during the live performance.</p>
<p>Even I, who was new to the scene, felt something was off, so it must have been true.</p>
<p>And since the day of the live performance, Yuzuki has disappeared from my sight.</p>
<p>Even when we meet at school, she interacts with me in her ‘idol mode’, as if our past interactions never happened.</p>

<p>In other words, Yuzuki might think that the cause of the mistake lies within her daily self… that is, within Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>
<p>She may have concluded that she let her guard down while eating junk food or sharing parts of her life with me, leading to the mistake at the live performance.</p>
<p>Therefore, she’s trying to return to her former self by distancing herself from me.</p>

<p>“Yuzuki’s decision isn’t necessarily wrong. If Yuzuki came to that answer on her own, then it’s not my place to interfere… but——”</p>
<p>“Suzu must have realized it by now, right? What you to do.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>The ideal answer would probably be to respect Yuzuki’s wishes and never approach her again.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, I’m neither obedient by nature nor am I just a ‘fan’.</p>

<p>“…I want Yuzuki to eat my cooking again.”</p>

<p>This much I can assert──Yuzuki really loves the food I make.</p>
<p>Whether she’s an idol or not doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>Because on the day she ate the pork bowl, Yuzuki said──</p>
<p>──Happiness</p>

<p>Is it really happiness for Sasaki Yuzuki to push herself to the limit by refraining from what she loves?</p>
<p>To be in idol mode all the time, keeping away from her favorite food──how could that be happiness?</p>
<p>The Yuzuki I know is easily swayed by food, quickly flustered, and her emotions are so transparent they show right on her face.</p>
<p>The forced smile she showed me in the Resource Room was not that of an ideal idol but more like an inorganic robot.</p>

<p>“I want to help Yuzuki. I want her to be happy with my cooking.”</p>

<p>…Ah, that’s always been the case.</p>
<p>Has Yuzuki ever once honestly accepted my cooking?</p>
<p>Making a show of drinking protein drinks or trying to escape from homemade jiro.</p>
<p>The stronger the rejection, the more it’s the opposite of her true feelings.</p>
<p>While verbally rejecting, in reality, she’s craving the meal.</p>

<p>What’s this, it’s just the usual Yuzuki.</p>
<p>Then I should just do as I always do.</p>
<p>It’s not like me to back down easily after being told ‘no’ once or twice.</p>

<p>“…Rika, thank you. I’m glad you’re my childhood friend and a reliable Onee-san.”</p>
<p>“Right? Look forward to what I’ll do next♪”</p>
<p>Rika tried to wink as if striking a pose but ended up closing both eyes—just blinking.</p>
<p>This lack of finesse is so typical of Rika that it made me burst into laughter.</p>

<p>That’s right. It’s not over yet.</p>
<p>I’m going to do things my way and bring out Yuzuki’s true feelings.</p>

<p>Wait for me, Yuzuki.</p>
<p>I’ll show you. My ultimate meddling.</p>
