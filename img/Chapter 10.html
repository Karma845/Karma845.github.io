<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Questioning</h3>

<div class="calibre3">"So this is...... a gentleman's room. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">*sniff* *sniff*</i></b>." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Can you stop sniffing? It's embarrassing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I invite Kiyokawa into my room, which is of average size.</div><div class="calibre3">Slightly nervous, Kiyokawa steps into the room and looks around, which is a bit cluttered with my game and LN collections.</div><div class="calibre3">My house is a very ordinary house. An average two-story house. To a rich young lady like Kiyokawa, it must look poor.</div><div class="calibre3">I think so, but when Kiyokawa sees my house, she says with admiration, "It's a magnificent house, yes".</div><div class="calibre3">It isn't sarcasm or flattery, but an honest tone of voice.</div><div class="calibre3">Although Kiyokawa is a neat and tidy young lady, she may also have general sensibilities.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ayakoji-senpai. Where would you like me to sit?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Anywhere is fine, like on the computer chair there or the bed." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Bed!? What the h*ck are you thinking!? You are after my body after all!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, I'm not! you're really a closet as I thought!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, I'm not a closet! I'm a neat and tidy young lady!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Then don't say anything weird! Come on, sit down in the chair." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa whose face is reddened, sits on the chair while muttering "......I'm not a closet." in a small voice.</div><div class="calibre3">I also sit down on the bed and face Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"So...... why were you stalking me?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"What do you do when you see a rare animal, Senior Ayanokouji?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well...... I'll observe it closely or take a picture of it, probably?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's. That's it..... I saw a rare animal, so I went to observe it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'll report to Rinka right now――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm sorry, it's to get to know Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The moment I send a glance at my smartphone, Kiyokawa spills the reason without hesitation.</div><div class="calibre3">Looks like she doesn't want Rinka to know about it.</div><div class="calibre3">"To get to know me?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. I wanted to know more about the gentleman who is dating Senior Rinka and Senior Nana." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wait a minute! I'm not dating Kurumizaka-san!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Is it true? But Senior Nana has an extraordinary trust in Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That is......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Nana is indeed a friendly person to everyone. But she would never show such a defenselessness towards a gentleman." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's because of it you know. Because I'm going out with Rinka, right? I'm sure you've heard a lot of stories about me from Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Probably, she was being told about me in a goodly exaggerated way.</div><div class="calibre3">If you think about it, Kurumizaka-san might be a victim of hers as well.</div><div class="calibre3">"......I understand. For the time being I'll be convinced about your relationship with Senior Nana." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Just for the time being, huh......?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes, for the time being. I never know when Senior Ayanokouji's poisonous fangs will assault Senior Nana." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No! What kind of man do you think I am!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"A womanizer." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She just simply replies with one word.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm hoping she's joking, but she has a very serious face.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji, you're a type of popular guy, aren't you? From your face and the atmosphere, you seem to be a "plainly popular" type." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What do you mean by "plainly popular"? Let alone the plain part, I'm not even popular in the slightest." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I glare back at her lightly, and Kiyokawa's eyes widen as if she hasn't expected it.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's surprising. If that is the case, then either Senior Ayanokouji's behavior in the classroom is quite strange, or his words and actions are too modest." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's probably the latter. And flamboyant words and actions will certainly not make you popular." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Unfortunately, I've come to realize that.</div><div class="calibre3">That I'm not on the popular side.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's impossible. You're the gentleman who boned Senior Rinka, so you're definitely popular." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What do you mean by "boned"......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Do you know that Senior Rinka hates men?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, I've heard rumors about that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Rinka is really beautiful, right? She's fed up with being pestered by all kinds of men." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I-I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">A certain scene comes to mind.</div><div class="calibre3">"That Senior Rinka has fallen head over heels with Senior Ayanokouji............. No, how should I describe it, it's not even close. She's so in love with him that she's willing to give everything she has to him." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't know if....... She's gone that far" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">For some reason, there's a part of me that can't deny it.</div><div class="calibre3">As a person who receives Rinka's affectionate expressions on a daily basis, I feel it.</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't know how Senior Ayanokouji seduced Senior Rinka. But the fact that he was able to seduce Senior Rinka means that he is definitely a womanizer!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"There's a mistake! I've never even talked to a girl before I met Rinka, you know!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're lying, of course!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Sorry, I'm lying!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I knew it!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"But that's how long I've lived without having any contact with girls!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I desperately pleaded. The misconception that I am a womanizer is humiliating...... in many ways.</div><div class="calibre3">But Kiyokawa looks down at me with calm eyes.</div><div class="calibre3">"I see, so that's what is it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wh-what is it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji, you were pretending to be a naive guy to attract girls' attention, weren't you?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's not what I meant! How should I explain this to you so that you will understand......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Then please tell me how you managed to make Senior Rinka fall for you." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not trying to make her fall or anything. We've just been playing an online game together for a long time." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You are saying the same thing as Senior Rinka. Are you saying that Senior Ayanokouji is such an attractive player in the online games?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't think so myself....... Well, if that makes you more convinced, then you can go with it." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ridiculous. You must talk to my friend first before you can call yourself an attractive player." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I-I don't get to what you mean!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I also have a wonderful friend who I would like to marry with. Sorry, but there's an overwhelming difference between Senior Ayanokouji and my friends!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Is that so?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">To Kiyokawa saying it in a needlessly arrogant manner, I replied in amazement.</div><div class="calibre3">I have no problem with being compared to Kiyokawa's friend, it has nothing to do with me.</div><div class="calibre3">"Phee~w..... Shall we end the talk about Senior Ayanokouji? This is where the main topic comes in." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh, This wasn't the main topic. even though this's a long talk." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I've heard that your relationship with Senior Rinka has almost been exposed to other students several times." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Well, yeah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's not good. If they find out about it, it can jeopardize Senior Rinka's idol activities and even Star Mines'." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're...... right." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You lack a sense of crisis, don't you? (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ugh. I've just started dating, and I was a little carried away, I guess you could say that....... But I'm trying to be more careful now." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I feel deflated by the accusatory way she talks to me, like a teacher. Of course Kiyokawa is right.</div><div class="calibre3">"So I'll be keeping an eye on the two of you from now on." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"............Huh!?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"In the past, I've been responsible for supporting Star Mines. I've had to remonstrate to Senior Rinka, who tends to overwork, and control Senior Nana, who tends to go ahead with her momentum....... The relationship between Senior Ayanokouji and Senior Rinka is very dangerous. So I will intervene." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, please don't do that! I'm aware that it's dangerous, but monitoring is way too much!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No. This will affect the future of Star Mines. And it will also lead to an opportunity to expose Senior Ayanokouji's womanizing behavior." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No way......! I'm going to report this to Rinka!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's your choice. If you do, I'll retire from idol life and live the rest of my life in loneliness." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"How dare! How dare you threaten me! Threatening to make me feel guilty! You're wicked, black-hearted!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Have you not overstated it? It's painful to hear you say that." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa says that, then she gets up from the chair and makes to leave the room.</div><div class="calibre3">"Well then, Senior Ayanokouji. I'll take my lea――――" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wait a minute!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I quickly grab Kiyokawa's slender arm.</div><div class="calibre3">Then Kiyokawa's cheeks flushed and his shoulders quiver slightly.</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-you finally showed your true nature, yes." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If you can't convince me verbally, you'll do physically, right?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"N-no, no, no!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You can hear the voice of Ayanokoji-senpai's mind saying, "I'll dye this pure white young lady who knows nothing into the colors of this me".......!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Alright, I get it. You should stop reading er*tic manga. And you're not a pure white lady at all." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She may be pure to an extent, though!</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji is a womanizer! Pervert! Molester!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I didn't go that far!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If you don't let me go, I'll hit you with a blunt object!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Why a blunt object?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I can't help it if she makes this much fuss. So I let go of Kiyokawa's arm.</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't know if Senior Ayanokouji is really a womanizer or not. But if he does anything to make Senior Rinka sad...... I will do everything in my might to take exact revenge on Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's a strong statement that is filled with a firm will in it.</div><div class="calibre3">I can feel that Kiyokawa respects and cares a lot for Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">"I understand. If I make Rinka sad, you can boil me or burn me or whatever you want to me." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's powerful gaze meets my eyes straight away.</div><div class="calibre3">It isn't the silly look she has had just a moment ago. The air around her is also sharp and tense.</div><div class="calibre3">"......The thoughts of senior Ayakoji have been conveyed to me." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't forget what you just said, okay. Because, I'll always be monitoring you, Senior Ayanokouji......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Showing a thin smile, Kiyokawa quietly walks out of the room.</div><div class="calibre3">That is the style of a popular idol. She left a strong lingering impression in the room and went away.</div><div class="calibre3">"She'll always be monitoring.......huh. I've caught the eye of a troublesome idol." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Remembering those Kiyokawa's words, I can only mutter to myself.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji. I almost forgot of it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Uwaa! I thought you'd left!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's exchange contacts. It'll be more convenient for us if we do." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">This is the moment when I unexpectedly obtain the contact of a popular idol for the third time.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know why I'm not happy at all.</div><div class="calibre3">And Kiyokawa tells me with a gentle smile like a neat lady.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm going to all-out without holding anything back from now on, so please do your best. Senior Ayanokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Thus, the worst――――new daily life is about to begin.</div></div>
