<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; Star☆Mines' Costumes</h3>

<div class="calibre3">We have all moved into Rinka's cleanroom.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm forced to sit on the floor, thinking that something similar has happened to me before.</div><div class="calibre3">Currently, I'm suspected of having an affair with Nonoa-chan.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't have any guilt. But, I'm desperately trying to explain the situation to Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">In any case, Nonoa-chan just asked me to play marriage and propose to her.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... So that's what happened." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you convinced?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eerm." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Are you angry?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No. I'm not so small-minded as to get upset over child's play." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka lets out a breath of relief. The matter seems to be settled now.</div><div class="calibre3">"As expected of Senior Rinka. You were broad-minded, yes." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Of course. I'm Kazuto-kun's wife. If I get angry over every little thing, I'm going to disgrace my husband's name." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka says in an unwavering tone.</div><div class="calibre3">When Kiyokawa hears it, she smiles, but I don't know what she's thinking inside.</div><div class="calibre3">"I mean, if Kiyokawa-san hadn't made a fuss, there wouldn't have been any problems." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">''I apologize. I was surprised to see Senior Ayanokouji making a passionate proposal to Nonoa-chan." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, I don't understand why you would be very surprised......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">When I get out of the bath and go to the living room, I find that a high school boy is seriously proposing to a first grader.</div><div class="calibre3">It is certainly anyone will be surprised.</div><div class="calibre3">However, the reality is that it was just child's play. So, I didn't want her to make a fuss.</div><div class="calibre3">"Come here, Nonoa-chan. I'll play with you a lot." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No! I want Kazuto-bro!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"Gaahh!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa is shocked to the point of she leaks a "Gaahh" after being full force rejected by Nonoa-chan.</div><div class="calibre3">It looks like she doesn't even know she's hated.</div><div class="calibre3">Although, Kiyokawa herself seems to like children.......</div><div class="calibre3">"It's strange...... why she would choose Senior Ayanokouji over me." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's because she thinks perverted and dirty thoughts on a daily basis. Children are sensitive to dirty minds." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not a closet, okay! As the name of Kiyokawa suggests, my mind is as clean as a pure river!" (Ayane) <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17">(PTW/N: 清川 [kiyokawa]; 清 [kiyo, sei, saya, etc.] means pure, purify, cleanse, exorcise; 川 [kawa, gawa] means river, stream.)</span></i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"I doubt it. She looks like she's pure, but there may possibly be hidden er*tic books laying underneath." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If that's the case, the one who threw the er*tic books is Senior Ayanokouji. It was Senior Erokouji." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't own a single er*tic book." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Then it's e-books. I'm sure you have tons of er*tic images on your smartphone." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Aren't you talking about yourself? Lady Closet." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not a closet! I'll pinch your arm if you don't stop it!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">*Spark* *spark*!　</div><div class="calibre3">The two of us collide head-on, sending sparks flying.</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh? Kazu-kun and Ayane-chan have gotten along very well somehow, haven't they?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Which part of we have gotten along? It's more like we in a relation of cats and dogs." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"True. Even if it was Senior Nana, there were things I disliked to be told, did you know?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa and I immediately deny it, but Kurumizaka-san does not retract her words.</div><div class="calibre3">"Even though you guys say that. You gust are perfectly synced. And also, you're not hesitant to say it to each other...... I know it, you guys are really getting along well, yes?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"We aren't." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"We were not." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Then, at exactly the same time Kurumizaka-san mutters, "I knew it, you guys perfectly sync.......", we simultaneously deny it.</div><div class="calibre3">What Rinka is thinking as she watches us, but she let out a small grunt of "Muu~" and sits down next to me on the floor, squeezing my shoulders tightly.</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm...... Rinka? What's wrong?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's nothing." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, but..." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's nothing." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah...... okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe she is getting pis*ed off, but all Rinka said is that it's nothing.</div><div class="calibre3">She also hugs my arms tightly and holds me close to her as if to claim me as her property. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17">(PTW/N: GODDAAAMMMMMNNN, THE HONEY IS WAY TOO VISCOUS!!! OVERSWEEETTT!!!)</span></i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"Rin-chan. Are you trying to compete with Ayane-chan, by any chance?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't know what you're talking about. It's normal for a wife to snuggle up to her husband, isn't it?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"It is, but it's too sudden......." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san is right. There is too much incoherence in Rinka's actions.</div><div class="calibre3">If that's the case, was Rinka...... jealous of the exchange between me and Kiyokawa?</div><div class="calibre3">If so, it's terribly not good.</div><div class="calibre3">She's way too cute.</div><div class="calibre3">To put it another way, it's fiercely cute that she's trying so hard not to let people know that she's jealous.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Nana. It's time to get down to business......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, you're right. The reason Ayane-chan and I are here is that we have a favor to ask Kazu-kun." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"A favor?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. We've got Rin-chan's permission, so don't worry." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder what the request is. I don't have a good feeling about this.</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay, Kazuto-kun. All you have to do is look at our new costumes and tell us your thoughts." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"New costumes......? Could it be Star☆Mines'?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eee, we've just finished our new costumes for the summer concert. We've decided that we'd like to get some opinions from the public before we release them." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I nod my head at Rinka's flowing explanation.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'd like to mention that the costumes we were about to show Senior Ayanokouji haven't been announced to the public yet. So, please don't tell anyone." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I-I understand." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Seriously? I can't believe I'm going to get to see Star Mainz's new costumes before anyone else.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm going to change now then!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Okay." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"......?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The three idols' gazes converge on me.</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder what they are looking at me for.</div><div class="calibre3">"Sorry, Kazu-kun. Can you please leave the room? We're going to change here now." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"A-ah! So that was it means, My bad!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't have a problem with Kazuto-kun seeing me, but." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's not a problem for Senior Rinka, but it is for us." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ahaha...... I'm embarrassed too." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm sorry. I'm leaving right now." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I leave Rinka's room. It seems that Nonoa-chan will stay in the room.</div><div class="calibre3">I close the door and go to the living room and sit down on the couch.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Seriously? New costumes?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I never think I'll get to see Star☆Mines in costume. Moreover, those are brand-new glittering costumes that haven't been announced to the public yet.</div><div class="calibre3">It'll be foolish not to get my hopes up.</div><div class="calibre3">☆</div><div class="calibre3">After a while, the girls who have finished changing came to the living room.</div><div class="calibre3">I sit down on the couch and look at them with an air of entitlement.</div><div class="calibre3">The three of them are wearing separated top and bottom costumes. Those are summer costumes, so are a little more revealing. Their arms are in full view, and their stomachs are showing. The thighs stretching out from the skirt have a healthy amount of flesh.</div><div class="calibre3">The colors are mainly white, with Kurumizaka-san's costume being white and light red, while Rinka's white and light blue, and Kiyokawa's only white. In the case of Kiyokawa, her selling point is neatness, so all white suits her image better. Personally, I think a light pink is fine. She's a closet pervert after all. Although, she's rather open.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Senior Ayanokouji. Didn't you think of something rude?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She gives me a glare. She has a keen intuition.</div><div class="calibre3">"What do you think, Kazu-kun? Is there anything strange?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ther isn't. You look cute, Kurumizaka-san." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">That's my honest opinion. I can't think of anything other than cute in my vocabulary.</div><div class="calibre3">The new costume has a refreshing atmosphere that shows off Kurumizaka-san's cheerfulness to the fullest. and Kiyokawa's costume has a coolness suitable for summer without sacrificing her neat and tidy image. So there's nothing I'm going to complain about.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun, you're spoony." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun, you're looking at a girl other than me and you're spoony." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka pouts lightly and she complains her dissatisfaction.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not. I just flatter her that she's cute......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay, particularly. I brought Nana and Ayane here because I was prepared for that." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Although she speaks very calmly, it's also sounded somewhat sulky.</div><div class="calibre3">This is the kind of thing that can lead to a riot.</div><div class="calibre3">"This is not a flattery, but you know, Rinka is the cutest." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It's neither a lie nor flattery. The new outfit is more revealing, though not as revealing as the school swimsuit, but not as vulgar. Rather, it's a refreshing image. This kind of costume suits the cool type of Rinka very well.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Really?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah, you're by far the cutest. Honestly, you're so cute that the other two become blurry." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazu-kun, if you say that much, we'll lose our position." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">This's my honest opinion, even though Kurumizaka-san is giving me a glare.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka is by far the cutest.</div><div class="calibre3">I've been always a big fan of Mizuki Rinka for a long time now, so, it's only natural that I think so.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm sorry to Kurumizaka-san and the others for saying it, but I'm not a fan of Star☆Mines.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun. How cute am I?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Very cute that I would like to ask you to marry me again and again." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"G-geez. We've been married for years." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka's cheeks flush with red. Well, we're officially lovers, after all.</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey, Kazuto-bro. How about me?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">Nonoa-chan, who has changed into a polka dot dress, shows me her outfit.</div><div class="calibre3">"You look super cute. Like an angel." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Really? Make you want to propose to me again and again?" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah! Of co――――." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I feel a chilling gaze on my neck, which makes me unable to finish my lines.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't need to check to see who is gazing at me. It's obviously Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">She tolerates child's play, but in this case, it seems to be different.</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, Senior Ayanokouji. Could you please give your thoughts not only to Senior Rinka and Nonoa-chan, but also to me?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">A dumbfounded Kiyokawa demands in dissatisfaction.</div><div class="calibre3">I take a second to run my gaze from Kiyokawa's head to toes.......</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, yep, doesn't it look cute?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's a way too mundane reaction! It's a humiliation!" (Ayane)</div>
