<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; The True Identity of Kiyokawa Ayane ①</h3>

<div class="calibre3">In order to observe Kiyokawa, I first need to get her to stop monitoring me.</div><div class="calibre3">So as soon as I wake up, I send a chat to Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I'm not going to have a talk to Rinka. So don't tail me today.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3">A few minutes later, I get a reply from Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I couldn't believe it. Rejected.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Please. I just want to have an easy day without being monitored sometimes. If I talk to Rinka, then I'll take responsibility and shave my head.] (Kazuto)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I understand. It was only just for today, okay? I'd start monitoring you again tomorrow.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">An so, I succeeded in escaping Kiyokawa's surveillance for today.</div><div class="calibre3">In hindsight, I wonder why I'm being so cautious to a younger one.</div><div class="calibre3">Should I be more dignified?</div><div class="calibre3">But I'm hesitant to act like a pompous a** to a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre3">No, even if the person isn't a popular idol, just the fact that the person is a girl makes me feel self-conscious. I'm really a chicken.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kiyokawa's classroom is...... right this way, isn't it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It's lunch break. I'm visiting the first-year floor after Saito had told me which classroom Kiyokawa belonged to.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm filled with nostalgia somehow. Is it my imagination, or do I feel like an adult when I see first-year students passing through the hallways?...... It's probably just my imagination. I'm a nerd gamer, after all.</div><div class="calibre3">I walk down the hallway, while thinking self-deprecating thoughts.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's classroom is the third class of the first year. When I arrive, I take a peek inside the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">So far I haven't taken lunch, and I haven't taken any detours to make the way here.</div><div class="calibre3">If Kiyokawa has something to do and is planning to go somewhere I'll know it, so she must be in the classroom right now.</div><div class="calibre3">My prediction is hitting the nail on the head, and Kiyokawa is sitting in the middle of the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">She's sitting in a seat near the center of the classroom with a straight back and a beautiful posture. Even though she's just sitting there, she's full of grace.</div><div class="calibre3">Some of the remaining students in the classroom look at her with a sparkling mixture of respect and admiration.</div><div class="calibre3">While some of the male students who seem to be fans of Kiyokawa, are secretly taking pictures of Kiyokawa's back with their phones from the back of the classroom. ......It's voyeurism, isn't it?</div><div class="calibre3">"............!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">There's a tense atmosphere hanging in the classroom. And then, Kiyokawa stands up.</div><div class="calibre3">With just that, the atmosphere in the classroom completely changes.</div><div class="calibre3">She takes out a small lunch box wrapped in a white cloth from her bag, unconcerned about the attention she's drawing. Holding the lunch in her hands, she slowly walks towards the doorway of the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">This is bad.</div><div class="calibre3">I move away from the classroom and hide myself in a nearby corner, sneaking a glance down the hallway.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa has just left the classroom and is walking down the hallway with her back to me.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm lucky to get a good position to observe.</div><div class="calibre3">But I'm witnessing for a surprising sight not long after.</div><div class="calibre3">"It's Kiyokawa-san......." "She looks beautiful today~" "Look at those fingertips and legs of hers. Really beautiful, aren't those." "Moreover the way she walks, it is so elegant~" "She must have grown up in a really rich family."</div><div class="calibre3">She is the envy of not only boys but also girls. She is very popular.</div><div class="calibre3">And Kiyokawa is smiling softly at them.</div><div class="calibre3">It's no wonder she's so popular. If I'm in a different position, I'll have become a fan of Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">The most amazing thing is that the other students moved to the side of the hallway to give way to Kiyokawa, who was walking the hallway down.</div><div class="calibre3">It's as if the commoners are bowing down to a noble young lady who's visiting the city.</div><div class="calibre3">An image of a young lady who has the overwhelming support of the commoners.</div><div class="calibre3">Neither rebellion nor riot is likely to occur.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... it's magnificent." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">My true feelings leak out. They reacted completely differently compared to Rinka and Kurumizaka-san.</div><div class="calibre3">In the case of Rinka, her cool and serious personality tends to make other students keep their distance.</div><div class="calibre3">While in the case of Kurumizaka-san, she is cheerful, friendly, and enjoys spending time with other students.</div><div class="calibre3">Whereas Kiyokawa, however, is neither of these.</div><div class="calibre3">She is extremely popular with the people around her, but she is kept at a distance.</div><div class="calibre3">Even though she is not the type of person that people can get close to, she is still a high-class lady that people admire.</div><div class="calibre3">That's Kiyokawa Ayane, the neat and tidy young lady.</div><div class="calibre3">"I wonder where's she going?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder where she'll go with her lunch now that she's no longer being watched.</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe she has lunch plans with one of another class or one of the upperclassmen.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa seems to have a lot of older friends.</div><div class="calibre3">I continue to follow Kiyokawa down the hallway.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm tailing her and finally, I'm brought to the next school building. This is the school building where the special classrooms are located. And there's no one around.</div><div class="calibre3">"Could it be......?"</div><div class="calibre3">A boy? Might Kiyokawa actually have a guy that she's been going out, and they're going to have rendezvous?</div><div class="calibre3">If not, there's no reason for her to come to such a deserted place.</div><div class="calibre3">It doesn't even look like she's going to meet up with her friends, either.</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">For some reason, Kiyokawa is looking around to check the area.</div><div class="calibre3">When she's sure that no one's around, she enters the nearby women's lavatory.</div><div class="calibre3">"Did she stop there to use the lavatory?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Does she have a sudden urge? I wonder where Kiyokawa's original destination is.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, she'll be sure out of the lavatory soon.</div><div class="calibre3">Taking it easy, I hide myself in the corner and wait with my back against the wall.</div><div class="calibre3">Five minutes later.</div><div class="calibre3">"Still not yet?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa still hasn't come out of the women's lavatory yet.</div><div class="calibre3">But, there's a fact that women are known to take a long time to use that room, so I guess that's how it is.</div><div class="calibre3">I decide to wait a little longer.</div><div class="calibre3">Another ten minutes later.</div><div class="calibre3">"......still hasn't come out yet." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As I thought, isn't that indeed too long?</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe there's an incident inside there.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm getting a little worried.</div><div class="calibre3">However, there's no way I can go in and check.</div><div class="calibre3">So I decided to wait a little longer.</div><div class="calibre3">Another ten minutes later.</div><div class="calibre3">Finally, Kiyokawa comes out of the women's lavatory.</div><div class="calibre3">On the edge of her mouth, there's a grain of rice――――</div><div class="calibre3">"......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">A certain expectation comes to my mind.</div><div class="calibre3">No, I don't believe it, and I don't want to think it, but.......</div><div class="calibre3">She, was she having lavatory meal?</div><div class="calibre3">Yes, a lavatory meal. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17">(PTW/N: 便所飯 [benjomeshi], Toilet Meal, has a meaning: "having lunch in a toilet cubicle by oneself".)</span></i></b></div><div class="calibre3">There's a grain of rice on the edge of her mouth, and she's patting her stomach in some kind of satisfying way.......</div><div class="calibre3">"N-no, no! There's no way that could be! It's Kiyokawa we talk about, you know? It's impossible." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Normally, lavatory meal is for a loner.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not something that a girl like Kiyokawa, who is the envy of everyone, would do.</div><div class="calibre3">However, there's not the slightest hesitation in Kiyokawa's steps on the way to the bathroom here.</div><div class="calibre3">In other words, she was used to going there.</div><div class="calibre3">"......I still need to observe more." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I follow Kiyokawa as she begins to walk. She's walking back to the school building.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, Kiyokawa-san. Hello."</div><div class="calibre3">"Hello~ Kiyokawa-san."</div><div class="calibre3">A duo of girls walking down the hallway stop to give Kiyokawa a cheerful greeting.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa also stops and returns the greeting. I wonder if they're classmates.</div><div class="calibre3">"There's a grain of rice on your mouth, Kiyokawa-san."</div><div class="calibre3">"My, that's embarrassing......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ahaha. Kiyokawa-san have klutz side, too, yes?"</div><div class="calibre3">The female students let out a friendly laugh. This is one more thing that has increased Kiyokawa's popularity.</div><div class="calibre3">"Where did you have lunch?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, that's......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's in the lavatory.</div><div class="calibre3">"Is it the courtyard?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-yes. In the courtyard." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">No, it's in the lavatory.</div><div class="calibre3">"I see. This school's courtyard is unusually clean, isn't it?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Yup. It's a place that suits a neat girl like Kiyokawa-san, yes~"</div><div class="calibre3">The two girls nod admiringly.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa, on the other hand, has a soft smile on her face.</div><div class="calibre3">However to me, who knew what was going on, it looks like she's straining himself.</div><div class="calibre3">"Who did you eat with on the courtyard?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh?" (Kiyokawa)</div><div class="calibre3">I'm having lunch alone in the lavatory.</div><div class="calibre3">There's no way she's going to answer that, so Kiyokawa's at a loss for an answer with her mouth agape.</div><div class="calibre3">Looking at Kiyokawa's loss for words state, one of the girls asked fearfully</div><div class="calibre3">"Maybe...... by yourself?"</div><div class="calibre3">"N-no. I'm not." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa denies it. The way she's upset is clearly proving that she's alone.</div><div class="calibre3">"T-that's obviously, yes. Kiyokawa-san seems to have a lot of friends. I'm so sorry for asking such a strange question."</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay. I'd be happy if you could continue to treat me without hesitation." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The two girls are relieved when Kiyokawa gives them an elegant smile.</div><div class="calibre3">But, my hands were shaking.</div><div class="calibre3">I have just learned a shocking fact about Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa might be an all-alone girl.</div><div class="calibre3">That Kiyokawa is...... I assume, but considering the beginning of the lunch break, it makes sense.</div><div class="calibre3">None of her classmates had invited Kiyokawa to lunch.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not that they don't like her by any means, but they don't invite her out either. She's that kind of type, huh?</div><div class="calibre3">If Kiyokawa is an all-alone girl, it's no wonder she was able to keep monitoring me all the time.</div><div class="calibre3">In addition, she was forbidden by Kurumizaka-san to practice dancing in the old school building.</div><div class="calibre3">The more I think about it, the more my theory of Kiyokawa as an all-alone girl gets stronger.</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey, what are you doing, Ayanokouji?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Tachibana......and Saito, huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'm skulking around a corner when I hear someone talking to me from behind, so I turn around.</div><div class="calibre3">"What's wrong, Ayanokouji-kun?" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's nothing....... What are you guys doing here?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"We're just returning from the library." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Heeh." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Would you like to read this book, Ayanokouji-kun? It's an er*tic light novel with some pretty explicit descriptions, you know!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Why the h*ll would they put such a light novel in a school?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Look, Ayanokouji! Look at these illustrations!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"I-I don't care!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Tachibana opens the book and shows me the illustrations. This is not something to talk about in the hallway, you know.</div><div class="calibre3">Look. A female student who just passes by gives a look as if she's looking at filth.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">*BZZZZZT!*</b></div><div class="calibre3">I feel a slight vibration from my smartphone that I have in my pants pocket.</div><div class="calibre3">I take out my smartphone and check the screen. There's a chat from Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[How long have you been following me?] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">I look back in the direction where Kiyokawa had been. There's already no one there.</div><div class="calibre3">She continues to send me chat.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[After school today. I'll be visiting Senior Ayanokouji's house.] (Ayane)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Mha gosh.</div><div class="calibre3">"Suddenly you looked at your smartphone and got a faraway look in your eyes, what's wrong with you?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"......It's your fault guys." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa must have noticed this because of the noise they made. She must have figured out that I was following her.</div><div class="calibre3">I feel like I've been spotted by a last boss. It's no doubt that Kiyokawa will be angry with me. And for sure she'll treat me like a pervert.</div><div class="calibre3">No, depending on how I think about it, I can set up a place where we can talk one-on-one.</div><div class="calibre3">I wish I can take this opportunity to understand Kiyokawa better.</div><div class="calibre3">......It's impossible, right? As I thought.</div>
