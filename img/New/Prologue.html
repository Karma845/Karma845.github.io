<h2>Prologue</h2>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">In the classroom shared by Fujiwara Sandai and Yuizaki Shino, an unlikely pair of an introverted loner and a lively gal, there hung an indescribably heavy atmosphere.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The shocking revelation came on the first day of school after winter break, that their class was the only one which had not yet decided on a destination for the school trip. It should have been determined in the fall of the previous year. However, just around that time, the relationship between Sandai and Shino had just come to light, capturing everyone's attention. And with the arrival of the cultural festival, various problems arose, causing the topic to be completely forgotten by everyone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">And so, the current situation had unfolded. In short, the cause could be traced back to the start of Sandai and Shino's relationship. However, the fault doesn't lie with the two of them. It's the oversight of those around them, who carelessly neglected important matters.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c13">"What are we going to do about this?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c13">"</span>
      <span class="c13">Nakaoka</span>
      <span class="c5">-sensei is staring out the window with a dead-fish expression."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Class rep, are you okay? You're just sitting there, drenched in sweat, with your head down."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Shihouin-kun..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Class rep, you're the type who feels a great sense of responsibility, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"This feels similar to when our class was the only one to have its event canceled at the cultural festival, Class Rep. It’s on us for forgetting, so there’s no need for you to take the blame."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c13">"Wait, the class rep also has some responsibility. It's their job to facilitate these discussions and keep tabs so as not to forget, but once they do, they themselves become the culprit. The same goes for Nakaoka-sensei</span>
      <span class="c13">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hey, you didn’t have to put it like that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Anyway, whatever happens, I wouldn't like it if our class ends up being the only one without a school trip."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"We have no choice but to make a decision right now!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">In a classroom filled with a chaotic buzz, Nakaoka-sensei, the homeroom teacher, gazed outside the window with a melancholic expression, while the class rep tightly pursed his lips, seemingly burdened with something heavy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Amidst this atmosphere...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It feels like something serious is going on..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I heard, like, they totally forgot and haven't decided on the school trip destination yet!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Is that so? Well, it doesn't really matter to me. Besides, I don't have any friends in this class, so I don't mind if I can't go on the trip."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hehe, y’know, that's just so like you, Sandai!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"But don't you have friends, Shino? Maybe you should participate in the discussion."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, um, it's, like, no biggie for me either... I mean, it's a school trip for the whole class, right? Wherever we go, it's probably gonna be, like, the same vibe, the same atmosphere..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Meanwhile, Sandai was completely detached, standing aside as an observer. He had little interest in going on the school trip with Shino, and he didn't see any problem if he couldn't go at all. It seemed that Shino shared the same view as him. She showed no particular interest to join the class meeting and simply let out a small yawn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">This attitude of the two further frustrated their classmates, and they furrowed their brows in irritation. However, Sandai and Shino's nonchalant demeanor was nothing new, so their classmates swiftly shifted from frustration to exasperation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c13">Amidst these changing sentiments among their peers, Sandai and Shino remained oblivious to the impact of their actions.</span>
