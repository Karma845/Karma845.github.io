<h2>February 15th - February 28th: The School Trip Is Starting</h2>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">１</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">School was noisy on Monday after Valentine's Day. This is because some had managed to give chocolates privately on Sunday, while many others did not and shifted to today.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As they passed through the school's entrance, Sandai immediately saw girls confessing to boys, their eyes closed, along with chocolates in hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ S-Senpai! I love you!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Me?! Eh... Am I in the middle of my popularity phase!?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Wait, that voice is different... Oh no, I made a mistake! I'm sorry! Please give the chocolate back!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Ugh...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ What's with that face? Fine, I'll give you one!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Thank you... Do you like me?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ I think I'll take it back after all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">How Valentine's Day was observed varied from person to person. Some couples used it as an opportunity to deepen their relationship, while others found their feelings reciprocated or their distances closed. On the other hand, some experienced nothing or faced heartbreak.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, Valentine's Day was an event that everyone, for better or worse, cared about. Inside the classroom, the topic of conversation revolved around Valentine's Day. As soon as they entered, Shino was bombarded with questions about Valentine's Day from Takasago, her friends, and the other gals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Yuizaki-san!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">─ </span>
      <span class="c3">Mahiro-chan. Did you manage to give your chocolates?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">─ Y-Yes! Yesterday, I sent Shihouin-kun a chat saying, “There's something I want to talk to you about... If you don't come, I'll...” and he came rushing to me in seconds, so I gave it to him then! He said, ‘Don't be hasty!’ I was a little confused, but... I just wanted to say that I would be sad if he didn't came, that's all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ I-I see.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Good morning, Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Good morning.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">─ </span>
      <span class="">Hey, hey, Shino, you know what? I promised my kohai some chocolates when I was making them, right? Turns out he had club stuff on Sundays, so I went to school in regular clothes yesterday and gave them to him. He was so happy, almost got teary-eyed. Teaching me how to make these chocolates was a great help. Thanks a bunch!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ I'm so happy for you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ It's great, you know, for those who have someone special like that. Especially those of us who don't, we just shared chocolates among ourselves and called it a day. But, you know, making them was fun, so that sense of accomplishment was priceless.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sitting behind Sandai, Shino and her friends chatted away, and no matter what, Sandai couldn't help overhearing their conversation. It seemed like everyone who participated in the chocolate-making had enjoyed their respective Valentine's Days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Still, Sandai felt a little sorry for the Class rep, who was being pushed around as a result, even though Takasago probably had no intention of doing so. The Class rep had already taken a seat at his desk and was diligently studying with his reference books, but there was a strange sense of melancholy in the back of her head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Most likely, the Class rep was the type who was easily pushed around. Unlike Sandai, who had surprisingly good balance, the president was awkward and inevitably destined to be in that situation, whether he liked it or not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Anyway, it was time for the morning homeroom. Nakaoka, yawning, came to the front of the classroom and looked over the students from the pondium.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Everyone's here, huh? Let's start the morning homeroom...... Well, there's basically nothing to tell you. The first thing you need to do is to get ready for the school trip at the beginning of the month."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With Valentine's Day now behind them, the next event on the horizon was the class trip. While Sandai and Shino weren't particularly looking forward to it, many of their classmates were excited about the event and discussions about the trip started to fill the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Some were already looking up tourist spots in Hakodate, and conversations about that could be heard. By the way, regarding the class grouping, Sandai and Shino didn't really mind being in any group as long as they were together, and Shino had said the same. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Their classmates had been bewildered by this decision, but they didn't dare complain, fearing Shino's potential wrath if they were separated. It seemed their classmates had a </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">slight fear of Shino going off if they forcefully separated her and Sandai, so they kept quiet.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">However……..</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Even if one receives the consideration they desired, it's not always guaranteed to lead to a satisfying outcome, as is often the case in life. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai and Shino's flirting was so embarrassing to watch that everyone in the class said they did not want to be in the same group with them. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In the end, the Class rep reluctantly joined their group, saying, "I guess there's no other choice." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino, who openly admitted her dislike for the Class rep, looked very uncomfortable when she found out she would be in the same group with him. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino and the Class rep didn't get along, and their personalities clashed. Sandai couldn't help but feel that it was going to be quite exhausting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">If there was any silver lining, it might have been when the Class rep raised their hand, and Takasago followed suit. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Takasago didn't have any issues with Shino and was fond of the Class rep, making her a suitable mediator despite her somewhat airheaded nature. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Regardless of the circumstances, there was no choice but to accept the group assignments that had been decided.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">While it was possible for Shino to raise objections, Sandai had firmly decided to stay silent about the matter. Objecting would almost certainly lead to Nakaoka intervening, which would only heat things up with Shino and make it unmanageable. Avoiding conflicts as much as possible and smoothly managing the current situation to stabilize her emotional state was Sandai's duty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Being in the same group as the class rep...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Don't worry, Takasago will be there too. The class rep probably won't bother us much. And if things get tense, Takasago might get emotional and quiet things down. Even the class rep wouldn't want Takasago complaining about the trip being ruined. He seems like the type to be mindful of that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ah, I see..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Remember when Takasago asked for your help with the class rep's birthday present? How did things change when Mahiro-chan started crying?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, when Mahiro-chan cries, suddenly the class rep gets nicer?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, I'll just hang back and offer support quietly. I don't really have much to talk about with the class rep anyway."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai remembered that the reason Shino disliked the Class rep was her jealousy, which she displayed regardless of gender. That's why he made sure to offer reassuring words at key moments, and lately, it had started coming naturally. Incidentally, Shino also understood that these were words of consideration, giving her a sense of being "number one" for Sandai. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With a smirk, Shino playfully poked Sandai in the back with a pencil. "Ouch!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"There you go~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Ow..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">２</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After parting ways with Shino, Sandai headed to his part-time job. On the way there something unexpected happened. A junior female student who had confessed to him before suddenly appeared out of nowhere, spreading her arms wide and blocking his path with a "halt" gesture. Caught off guard by this sudden intrusion, Sandai instinctively tensed up. "Um, do you need something?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In response to Sandai' question, the junior student nervously gulped. "I'm a day late, but... here's some chocolate!" She held out a cute, wrapped chocolate as she inched closer to him. Sandai took a step back. "No, I'm not really into this kind of..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No need to be scared to accept it since Yuizaki-senpai isn't around! I timed it so she wouldn't see me giving it to you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Regardless of what Shino thinks, having someone suddenly appear and give me chocolate is still kind of scary..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Boys are simple creatures who get happy and grin when they receive chocolate from any girl, you know. So don't be shy! It's handmade with love!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I wouldn't be happy to receive it from anyone except my girlfriend... Well then, see you later."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"N-No! You can't go!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai tried to walk past her, the junior student immediately circled in front of him and maintained her "halt" stance. "...Could you please move aside?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I'll move once you accept the chocolate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I can't accept it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Then I won't move!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I have a part-time job too. I don't have time to hang out. If you want to give chocolate to someone, find someone else."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It has to be Fujiwara-senpai!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino will get mad, you know."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"T-That's why I made sure Yuizaki-senpai wasn't here and came out like this."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If I tell Shino, she will also find out."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The girl swallowed hard and her eyes welled up slightly. It was evident that the memory of being intimidated by Shino had left its mark.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"This is the moment," Sandai thought, feeling it was a decisive moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I prioritize Shino above all. If you don't back down, I'll tell her about today... There's no doubt there will be a storm."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With his resolute attitude, Sandai successfully put a brake on the girl's persistence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The girl bit her lip, turned away from Sandai, and mumbled something under her breath as she walked away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...What's wrong with me? I'm quite cute, and I've always been able to win over guys, even those with girlfriends. I'm confident in myself..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai didn't possess the special skill of being able to hear what people muttered to themselves, so he couldn't quite make out what the girl was saying.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In any case, he was just relieved that the storm had passed. All he could do now was hope that this girl wouldn't approach him in a strange way anymore. It was over, done with, so it would be best to forget about it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai collected himself and headed to his part-time job at the aquarium. However, as soon as he arrived, Assistant Manager Komaki approached him with a somewhat apologetic expression, informing him that Hajime had to take an urgent leave due to a family matter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It seems there was a sudden situation at the Saeki residence..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I understand."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As he punched in on the time card, Sandai nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If you ever find it too tough doing this on your own, just let me know. I'll come to help... I'm sorry."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Komaki bowed with both hands clasped together. While it was understandable for someone to take time off due to family circumstances, it wasn't anyone's fault, and Komaki didn't need to bow like this. However, as Assistant Manager, it was probably part of his job.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You don't need to bow like that... I might have urgent matters to attend to someday too, so I'd appreciate your understanding when that time comes. So, don't worry about it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That's a relief to hear!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Alright, I'll go to work then."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Have a good day!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With Komaki seeing him off, Sandai began preparing for work alone. Handling the responsibilities of two people for the first time was challenging, and he ended up being a bit hasty due to time constraints. Nonetheless, with effort, he managed to get things done. It was just tiring.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">During his break, Sandai let out a sigh unintentionally.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While sipping canned coffee from a vending machine, he started checking for new light novel releases for next month on his smartphone to make the most of his break. That's when a notification chimed in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He initially thought it might be a message from Shino, but it turned out to be a chat message from Hajime.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— It's about time for a break... right?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— Yeah, I just started my break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— That's a relief! Um, sorry for taking the day off today….</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— It's okay, it couldn't be helped with some urgent matter. No big deal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— You're so kind... You're not trying to make me fall for you, are you?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— We don't need jokes like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— I see. Well, um, I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you sometime! See you!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Even though Sandai is the kind of person who doesn't mind even if nothing is said, Hajime seemed to have decided that he should say something, at least a few words.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Hajime ended the chat with a stamp of a mysterious creature poking its thumb up, which Sandai interpreted as a sign that the conversation was over. He then continued checking for new light novel releases.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As he compiled a list of titles he found interesting, his break time came to an end. Sandai decided it was time to return to work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Now then….."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The absence of the usually noisy Hajime made the atmosphere strangely peaceful. However, it also allowed for moments of increased concentration, and Sandai thought that occasionally having days like this might not be a bad thing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">３</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As the days passed, the school trip was approaching next week. By this time, students were starting to divide into two groups: those who had already finished their preparations and those who hadn't. Sandai and Shino belonged to the latter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">They hadn't been planning to put too much effort into the preparations, but they also didn't intend to go completely unprepared. So, they decided it was time to start getting ready.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai went to pick up Shino after his part-time job, and then the two of them went shopping together. They were buying things like hats and travel bags. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"How about this cap? Or the fluffy one over here?" Shino compared a cap with a fluffy hat and asked Sandai for his opinion. Sandai wasn't particularly knowledgeable in this area, but since she asked him for his opinion, he couldn't avoid it. He thought for a moment and gave his own perspective.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...If you want to stay warm, the fluffy one seems better."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"The fluffy one does look warm."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The hats they were calling "fluffy" had an official name written on their tags, but neither of them bothered to read it. They stuck with the visual impression of "fluffy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Functionally, I think the fluffy one is the best, but design-wise, it has a certain cuteness to it. It gives off a somewhat childish vibe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's childlike, huh... Then I'll go with the cap," Shino decided, showing that she didn't want something that looked childish. So, instead of the fluffy hat, she chose a cap.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After paying, Shino immediately put on the cap and gave Sandai a quick glance, her lips curling into a small smile. She was silently asking for his opinion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You give off the aura of an energetic girl," he remarked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"An energetic vibe... Wait, does that mean I seemed kinda childish too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Not childish, but more like cheerful, lively, or unisex. I didn't mean 'childish' at all."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, I see! It’s all good then."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Within the realm of gyaru fashion, there were different styles, including those who went all-in on a cute and youthful look. However, Shino didn't lean towards that type; she preferred a more mature appearance. Of course, her mannerisms and behaviors might have a hint of cuteness, but that was separate from her fashion sense. Humans are complex and multifaceted beings, so it's natural to reconcile seemingly contradictory aspects.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino was no exception in this regard. Afterward, they continued to discuss and buy new bags and various small items, preparing for the upcoming school trip. Now, all they had to do was wait for the day of the trip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">４</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The day of the school trip had arrived. They had been told beforehand to "gather directly at the airport," so Sandai decided to go to the airport with Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">First, he went to pick up Shino, and then they took a train that connected to the airport station. It was around 9 a.m., a time when the rush hour had already passed, so the train was relatively empty.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's been a while since I've been on an airplane," Sandai murmured with a sense of nostalgia. The last time he had been on one was during his childhood when he returned to Japan from overseas. Since then, he hadn't had the opportunity, and it felt like a distant memory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Have you ever been on an airplane?" he asked Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You know we're not well-off, and my family has never taken me on a trip or anything, so I've never been on an airplane," she replied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Like, where have you been on an airplane?" Shino asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, it's not exactly a trip; it's more like coming back to Japan," he clarified.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh? What do you mean?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I mean, I returned to Japan."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino was startled by this revelation, and Sandai, puzzled by her reaction, tilted his head but quickly realized what was going on. He hadn't talked much about his childhood, even though he hadn't hidden the fact that his parents lived overseas.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I used to live in England when I was little."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, that's news to me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I never really had the chance to bring it up."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai could be classified as a "returnee," but he didn't really have a strong awareness of it. In total, he had spent much more time in Japan, forgotten most of his English, and, most importantly, he hadn't had any particularly interesting or humorous experiences to share. When his parents' acquaintances tried to take care of him, he had often turned away, and he vaguely remembered playing with kids of similar age during some local childcare activities, but as usual, he hadn't really fit in and mostly played alone. He had never had those kinds of experiences where he could proudly tell anyone that he had expanded his worldview through unknown experiences.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's England like?" Shino asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No matter how you ask what it's like... well, conversations are in English," he replied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Can you speak English?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I wonder... I've forgotten a lot. Well, I think I can manage simple communication, but it's true that my way of speaking is still childlike. The other person would feel pretty uncomfortable. I can't confidently say that I can do it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If you can communicate even just a bit, that's something to be proud of. You should own what you can do." Shino encouraged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, if I freeze up when unfamiliar words or phrases come up, it'll be extremely embarrassing. It's better to say I can't do it, so I don't raise false expectations, and it's easier on me too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Mmm..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Or rather, whether I can speak English or not, it's not a big deal. I live in Japan. Well, if there's ever an opportunity to go on an overseas trip or something, just consider that I'll be there to help to some extent."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The term "overseas trip" caught Shino's attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"An overseas trip..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's wrong?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, I was thinking that even for something like a honeymoon, you'd find a way somehow, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, to a certain extent."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I know you have, like, a pretty vague definition of 'to a certain extent,' huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">It seemed that Shino accurately understood the implications of Sandai' statement. He couldn't help but smile at how well she knew him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">５</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The first person they spotted when they arrived at the airport was Nakaoka. She had dark circles under her eyes, and a complexion that showed her determination not to make a second mistake as a teacher. When she noticed them, she waved them over.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, Fujiwara! Yuizaki! Over here, come on!" Following her call, they approached, and they could see a few of their classmates had already gathered. They were all excited for the school trip, and cheerful conversations could be heard all around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, amidst the lively atmosphere, one person stood out with an unusual air of tension, the class rep</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I've already messed up once before. I can't afford a second mistake. But staying up for Sandai straight is starting to show on my face. Plus, if I don't mutter to myself like this, I feel like I'll lose my focus. It's no good. I can't sleep yet. At least not until we're on the plane..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">People kept their distance from the Class rep, who seemed on the verge of losing it as he was muttering and chanting like reciting a Budhist prayer. Clearly, he looked like a dangerous person. But there was one kind-hearted soul who approached him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was Takasago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Takasago nodded in agreement with the Class rep's ramblings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">I guess it's the weakness of falling in love, they thought. When you fall for someone, you embrace their quirks and flaws along with their virtues.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"So, you'll get some rest once we're on the plane, Shihouin-kun?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That's right. It's just a nap, though….."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Please, take your time to relax!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I shouldn't have made you say that. I'm sorry, Takasago."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As the departure time drew near, the rest of their classmates gradually arrived, and soon everyone was assembled. Guided by Nakaoka, who seemed a bit unsteady on her feet, they proceeded with various check-in procedures, like getting their boarding passes and checking in their luggage.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was at this point that Sandai and Shino realized they weren't seated next to each other.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh... seems like I'm not gonna be sitting next to Sandai."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It seems that way... It seems like changing our seats now might be impossible."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Um... Who's gonna be sitting next to me then?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I... am" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Takasago timidly raised her hand, confirming that she would be sitting next to Shino. But who would be sitting next to Sandai?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai glanced around anxiously, one of Shino's friends, a gal, called out to him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, I'm sitting next to you, Fujiwara."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Is that so?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Is that a problem?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Not exactly a problem, but I was hoping to sit next to Shino."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You know, you're pretty straightforward, huh? Well, if we switch seats, I'd end up sitting next to Takasago, right? We did get a bit closer during that chocolate-making event, but even so, Takasago is still pretty wary of anyone other than Shino, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The gal's words were not entirely unfounded. While Takasago had grown accustomed to Shino, her friendship with Shino's gal friends was more along the lines of casual conversation, not quite reaching the level of being close friends.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai stole a quick glance at Takasago, who responded with a somewhat awkward smile. Shino, who had been observing the situation, eventually gave up on sitting next to Sandai.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'll bear with it 'cause I gotta, but... just don't pull any weird stuff on Sandai, alright?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I won't do anything weird. Shino would totally flip if I did, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, I’ll totally get mad"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino whispered to Sandai to let her know if anything happened, and Sandai nodded in agreement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Now, the gal who had confidently assured Shino that she wouldn't </span>
      <span class=" c15">do anything weird</span>
      <span class="c3"> to Sandai, found herself unable to endure the boredom once they boarded the plane. She quickly broke her promise with Shino and started striking up a conversation with Sandai.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, I heard from Shino that you guys have already, you know, done it. Is that true?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I mean, it got me curious, you know? Wondering if it's real or not."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Do I really need to answer that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Not really, but if you don't, I might start thinking Shino's lying. She's a bit of a fibber."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino doesn't lie."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Okay then, did you do it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai knew he was being teased, but even so, being called a liar when it came to Shino was something he couldn't tolerate. So, he calmly and expressionlessly replied,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"We did."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai's resolute response startled Shino's gal friend, who then cautiously poked his hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Oh... So, with this hand, you touched and, you know, fondled and, uh, got all close with Shino, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, I guess so. Do you have any complaints?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No, I don't, but when you put it out there so casually... I can't help but think, 'Man, Fujiwara's got some nerve, huh?'"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I don't know what you mean, but I'm just telling you the truth"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm just impressed by your honesty. Trying to hide stuff can sometimes seem, like, shady from Shino's point of view. By the way, your hands... Oh, I get it... they're kinda rough and unexpectedly manly...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The gal suddenly froze as she was about to playfully poke Sandai's hand. Slowly, she peeked into the aisle and looked toward the back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Her gaze landed on Shino, who was seated a little farther away. Shino squinted her eyes, and her expression was chillingly cold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Although it should be impossible for Shino to discern their subtle movements at this distance, it seemed like she had sensed something and was exerting her presence.</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww6.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The gal quietly turned her attention forward and started humming as if nothing had happened. It seemed like her plan was to let things cool down a bit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As a result of this sequence of events, the atmosphere inside the plane became indescribably heavy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Hey, what's with this suffocating atmosphere? It was a fun and enjoyable school trip until a few minutes ago."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "It's Yuizaki-san, right? Look, her friend seem to be teasing Fujiwara-kun."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Don't tease Fujiwara, seriously."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "That’s funny."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Feels like a funeral."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "In times like these, it's usually Nakaoka-sensei who'd be useful….. wait, she's fast asleep!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">— </span>
      <span class="">"ZzzZzz..…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Next in line to be useful would be the class rep, who's in the same group as Fujiwara-kun and Yuizaki-san, but he is also sleeping with a grim look on his face."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Normally, Sandai would just ignore situations like this, but given that they were causing a disturbance in this enclosed space, he couldn't continue to ignore it as he usually would.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai rose from his seat, casting a brief glance at Shino before making his way to the restroom. Shino, realizing the intent behind his actions, hurriedly followed him into the restroom.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"....You had a scary look on your face, didn’t you?" Sandai asked within the confines of the small restroom, and Shino pouted in response.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Because that girl keeps teasing you and it's, like, getting on my nerves.."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It probably feels like she's not good at keeping quiet. I don't think there's any weird meaning to it like Shino thinks."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I get it, but just seeing you chat with another girl makes me feel kinda down, you know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Just bear with me for a little while."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah. But in exchange for holding back... Okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Shino closed her eyes, Sandai gently pressed his lips against hers. As a result, Shino's demeanor gradually softened, and she began to relax.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Both of them just went into the restroom."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "What are they doing...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "I bet they're doing boyfriend-girlfriend stuff, like, totally. Probably why they're acting all shady on a plane, you know..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Do you think these two, who are not afraid to make out in public even in the classroom, would not do anything?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "....."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Someone should go check on them."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "I don't want to. I'm pretty sure I'd collapse in shock if they were actually doing something naughty."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Are there any brave souls on board?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "The hero is dead."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— "Saying it like Nietzsche's 'God is dead' won't solve anything, will it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Exiting the restroom, Sandai returned to his seat. While walking down the aisle, he couldn't help but notice that all his classmates were looking down, but dwelling on it wouldn't change anything. In any case, Shino's imposing presence had dissipated. Sandai thought that if everyone noticed this, things would return to normal, and indeed, after 10 minutes had passed, they did.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">The heavy atmosphere from earlier had disappeared, and the plane was now filled with the liveliness of high school students genuinely enjoying their school trip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">６</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">The school trip was one of the school's events, and at its core was, of course, the pursuit of knowledge. That's why the first place they headed to upon arrival was </span>
      <span class="">Goryokaku.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The first day was dedicated to history learning. They grouped up as prearranged, forming lines, and boarded the private bus provided by the school one by one. Unlike the plane, the bus seats were allocated based on the assigned groups, which allowed Sandai and Shino to sit together. The class rep and Takasago were seated in the front.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shihouin-kun, you must be tired..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"....."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The class rep also woke up briefly when he got off the plane, but as soon as he took his seat on the bus, he was asleep again. Similarly, Nakaoka, who was seated in the front row, was snoring away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai and Shino didn't do much; they just continued as usual. they were passing the time with idle conversation, saying things like, "I knew there was snow," or "The hot springs we both traveled to had more snow on them than the one in Hakodate.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Being able to sit next to each other instead of being separated, like on the plane, made Shino much calmer, and she didn't exude an intimidating aura.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Before they knew it, they had arrived at Goryokaku. At that point, even the class president and Nakaoka, seemingly recovered from sleepiness and fatigue, had regained their energy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Now, at Goryokaku, they were greeted by a historian that the school had comissioned, and the explanations about the structure and history began right away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">— "It's hard to tell from ground level, but Goryokaku is a castle shaped like a star. Now, as for Goryokaku, I think it's especially well-known within the scope of Japanese history that you all probably learned at school around the Meiji Restoration. Do you remember what happened?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">— "Ah! The Boshin War!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">— "Correct. More accurately, it's one of the battles in the Boshin War. It's also called the Hakodate War, or the Battle of Goryokaku. During this conflict, a famous person died. Does anyone know who he was?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">— </span>
      <span class="c8">"You haven't learned that much, have you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">— </span>
      <span class="c8">"Well, we did study it, but..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">— "Here's a hint: the Shinsengumi."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">— ".....Toshizo Hijikata?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">— "That's correct. He's one of the famous Shinsengumi members whose names are often used in games, anime, manga, and so on which are familiar to young people."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">For high school students, their exposure to history often comes more from creative works than from classroom lessons. Sandai was no exception. While he certainly had studied historical periods like the Bakumatsu-Meiji Era in textbooks and reference materials, he encountered them more frequently in light novels and similar works. He had a particular fondness for a series called </span>
      <span class="">"Bakumatsu Tensei: My Unrivaled Journey as a Shinsengumi Foot Soldier," which concluded last spring.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Of course, not everyone delves into creative works. Shino was one such person. She wasn't the type to get into creative works, and given her lack of enthusiasm for studying, she seemed completely unaware of Goryokaku itself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I had no clue that Goryokaku was, like, some fancy historical place or whatever…."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino... just to clarify, what did you think Goryokaku was?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Um, the name of a Chinese restaurant or something?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"A Chinese restaurant? Did you perhaps think it was one of those 'Dragon Tower' places?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai couldn't help but think that Shino would probably ask him to help her study for the upcoming final exams. However, he knew that wouldn't happen immediately.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai and Shino's high school had three long vacations during the year: spring, summer, and winter. However, the school followed a two-semester system, and the final exams that significantly affected promotions and such were held only twice, in summer and winter. So, even if Shino started to make a fuss, it wouldn't be until around that time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Still, Sandai believed it might be a good idea to start preparing gradually around April to ensure that Shino wouldn't panic at the last minute. He knew from experience that Shino's inability to study was quite severe.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The last time, they had resorted to a Spartan-style cramming session just before the exams, and while it had worked, Sandai didn't want to go through that again. Shino had been on the verge of tears, and Sandai had been wracked with guilt. It would be much better to build up their knowledge gradually when there was time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“Shino, by the way, let's change the subject a little.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“Eh?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">“What would you do if I told you to start studying a little bit in April ......? I'm thinking that maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to do a little bit of studying for the final exam in the summer.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Shino stared at Sandai' face for a moment, then turned her gaze away without saying a word. Her attitude clearly screaming ‘I don’t want to study’.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, if Sandai gave in now, it would only mean that Shino would start panicking again right before the exams. So, he continued to stare at her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">At first, Shino pretended not to notice Sandai's gaze, but eventually, she couldn't withstand the silent pressure. She pursed her lips and furrowed her brow but nodded.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well... I think it should be totally cool to kick off the studying around June or July, but... yeah, better not risk any last-minute rush."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I'm really happy that you understand"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Shino's roundabout agreement brought a bright smile to Sandai' face. When she saw him smile, Shino pouted, lowered her head a little, and fiddled with her bangs. Even though </span>
      <span class="">he</span>
      <span class=""> hadn't intended it, it seemed Shino liked seeing her beloved boyfriend's happy expression, and seeing him smile made her weaker.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Fujiwara-kun and Yuizaki-kun, you two don't seem interested in hearing about the historical buildings and facilities at all. What the hell do you think a school trip is for?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The class representative, who was in the same group as them, complained and muttered something. Takasago, who was also nearby, tried to calm him down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"They're lovers, so they're a bit..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"If this were a private matter, I wouldn't intrude. In that case, it's within the scope of personal freedom. However, this school trip is not private, but one of the school's educational events. Yet... wait…. Now that I look closely, it seems like no one else from our class is showing any intention of wanting to learn either... huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I understand what Shihouin-kun is saying is correct, but since this is a special school trip, I can’t help but want to have a bit of fun and I'm not very focused on studying either…." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"W-What!? Even Takasago is on their side!? We're required to write about what kind of learning we gained from this trip individually!" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"N-No, I'm not on their side or anything! But I thought it might be okay to have fun..." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“N-Ngh...”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">The presence of Takasago clearly helped with keeping the class rep in check. The class rep seemed to be single-mindedly focused on studying and wasn’t used to dealing with girls. Moreover, there was a past incident where a girl ended up crying because of him, so a considerable amount of his attention was directed towards Takasago. Thanks to that, there were no signs of conflict between Shino and the class rep, and Sandai felt relieved, allowing him to look forward to the school trip without any worries.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">７</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After Goryokaku, the tour continued on to similar facilities and buildings, ending with a visit to a government office to hear about the history of Hokkaido as a whole. After that the first day's itinerary came to an end, and the bus headed back to the hotel. Despite wandering around an unfamiliar place, my classmates' energy remained high, and there was a lively atmosphere inside the bus.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— I wasn't really interested in that educational stuff, but I did spot some nice shops along the way, so I'd like to check them out during our free time on the last day."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— Look, a tram!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— Is a tram rare? My parents' hometown is Hiroshima, and they have trams there. I used to see them a lot when I visited my grandparents during summer vacations, so I'm not too surprised.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— Speaking of which, wasn't there a tram near our school? It's a really short route, and it seems like it's been forgotten even by the locals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— Look at all that snow. Hokkaido really is cold.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— I saw Mi-chan's snow sculpture at the Sapporo Snow Festival... I think.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">— There was this really slippery part on the pavement, and I almost fell just now!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Setting aside the suspicion that there might not be anyone besides the class representative who truly grasps the original purpose of this school trip, the bus arrived at the hotel. They all got off from the bus and checked in as a group, then made headed to their the assigned rooms. Two people shared each room, and Sandai ended up sharing with a male classmate whom he had never met before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yo, Fujiwara!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Who?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's me, your classmate Umeda!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3 c37">Even though he introduced himself as Umeda, Sandai had no idea who he was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c37">Well, to begin with, Sandai had spent such a long time as a loner and hadn't interacted much with his classmates, so aside from a few exceptions, he couldn't remember most of their faces or names. However, he had also learned that openly showing that he didn't remember someone could make him come off as a jerk, so Sandai decided to pretend that he knew him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Umeda... Oh, that Umeda!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Isn't it funny how you say 'that Umeda'? You didn't recognize me at all, did you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That's not true. Umeda, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"....."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's wrong, Umeda?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Try saying my first name."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Since I can recognize you by your last name, that should be enough, right? Umeda."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"You definitely didn't recognize me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Sandai was almost depressed that he had failed to communicate. B</span>
      <span class="c3">ut it appeared that he had always been perceived as such and Umeda didn't seem too bothered by it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Anyway, let's go drop off our bags in the room first……huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda lightly patted Sandai on the shoulder and then suddenly tensed up, glancing around nervously.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Umeda, what's wrong?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Nah, it just felt like I was hit by some intense resentment or something..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The source of the resentment Umeda felt was Shino. While chatting with her gal pals and Takasago, she occasionally directed sharp glances that could shoot lasers at Umeda.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Quickly realizing this, Sandai discreetly distanced himself from Umeda to protect his friend's well-being.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh? Fujiwara, why are you moving away from me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Don't come near me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh? What's going on? Wait... you didn't see some kind of vengeful spirit or something behind me, did you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Just stay away from me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Stay away."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Aaah... Aaaaahhhh! Now I'm really curious!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Getting involved in the wrong place at the wrong time with Shino's eyes on you could lead to a repeat of the disaster during the school festival. In other words, Umeda might end up kicked to the curb like the class president.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">To avoid such accidents, Sandai left Umeda, who was scratching his head, behind and headed to the room alone. After placing his luggage in the room, he sat on the bed and took a short break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Umeda arrived in the room few minutes later. </span>
      <span class="">Apparently, he had purchased some strange merchandise at a nearby store, as he had a headband with a candle stuck to it and was waving a mysterious flag that read "Exorcism of Vengeful Spirits and Destruction of Evil Spirits".</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai, who was generally insensitive to others, did not want to sleep in the same room with a person who had turned suspicious, so he had no choice but to tell him about Shino's jealousy and other things.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda, who had learned that the vengeful spirits were a misunderstanding, plopped down flat on the floor, looking completely worn out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"So, what I misunsderstood for vengeful spirit or evil spirit was just Yuizaki’s jealous gaze, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Probably."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Jealousy over a friendship between guys... And, is it also why the class rep and Yuizaki seem to have some bad blood?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That's right. During the school festival, the class rep got a front kick from Shino when he tried to touch me, and since then, he starts twitching when he sees her."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Scary... So, even Yuizaki isn’t cute in her personality?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No, she's got a cute personality too. If you never make a single mistake, she'll become like a spoiled child."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Never making a single mistake sounds pretty impressive... Well, with that kind of skill, no wonder Yuizaki fell for Fujiwara."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Who knows. The intricacies of her feelings are something only Shino herself can understand."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You sound confident. You're really good at handling women, aren't you, Fujiwara?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda's tone contained a hint of envy or some other underlying nuance as the conversation progressed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, um... I wanted to talk to you about something..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda began but then abruptly cut off with, "Nah, forget it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Stopping the conversation halfway left Sandai feeling somewhat curious, but he decided not to press further. If Umeda wanted to talk, he would talk eventually.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Leaving Umeda aside, Sandai realized that bathing had designated hours, and he needed to go in before dinner. Carrying his change of clothes, he passed through the curtain to the large bathhouse.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">No one was in the changing area. As he undressed and stepped into the bathing area, it was nearly empty, almost as if he had it all to himself. For Sandai, who didn't particularly like crowded places, it was a dream come true. He took the opportunity to wash himself without worrying about prying eyes and then immersed himself in the spacious bathtub.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ah..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He let out an unintentional sigh, feeling truly relaxed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">However, such moments of relaxation never seemed to last long. Gradually, his male classmates began to appear, signaling the end of his solitary bathing time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─First one here... Well, not with Fujiwara around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─It's just like Fujiwara to be there before you even know it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─He was the first to capture Yuizaki's heart and become her boyfriend without everyone knowing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─True that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">─He may have a low profile, but he manages to seize the moment and take the lead. Sometimes I wonder if Fujiwara is like an assassin or a ninja.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As population density rises, so does stress. For those who are extroverted and have many friends, crowded places might even be relaxing. But for Sandai, who has spent years cultivating a career as a loner, such situations are nothing short of hell.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">...It's about time to head back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Sandai quickly stood up, neither slouching nor strutting, just walking away from the crowded bathhouse as he always did. Those around him casually glanced at his departing figure and then widened their eyes in surprise.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—Hey, hey, what's that scar on Fujiwara's back? It looks like claw marks, but it doesn't seem like it was from a cat or something,.....right?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—It feels like someone scratched his skin directly with their fingernails several times.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—Being scratched while naked like that... doesn't that...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—........Is that Yuizaki's fingernails??</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—So, you're saying... they had sex!?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—Seriously? What's going on in the world? It's weird. Why is Fujiwara climbing the stairs to adulthood when I'm a virgin?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—Wait a minute, how many non-virgins are there in this class? Is Fujiwara the only one?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—I've already had my fair share! I've satisfied more women than I can count!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—Don't lie. You don't have the time to satisfy countless women when you're spending your days hanging out with me on weekends.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—Physical relationships... illicit relations between the opposite sex is forbidden! As the class representative, I'm filled with deplorable feelings......!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">—</span>
      <span class="c8">Isn't Class Rep in a position where he can't say anything about Fujiwara? He's always giving off the vibe of flirting with Takasago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">—T-That's a huge misunderstanding. I'm just friends with her...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">The claw marks on Sandai's back were from the first time he and Shino had engaged in physical intimacy.</span>
      <span class="c3"> Shino had been nervous for her first time, so Sandai had told her, "Go ahead and scratch me." He thought it might ease her fear a bit. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Although it was Sandai's first time having physical intimacy with the opposite sex as well, he had said it with the intention of making it a memory that Shino wouldn't feel uncomfortable about.</span>
      <span class="c3"> And Shino had truly scratched him quite vigorously.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As for how the remaining scars might appear to others, Sandai didn't particularly care. There was nothing embarrassing about the scars he got for the sake of her. In fact, he felt proud of them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In any case, Sandai finished changing and decided to head to dinner. Along the way, in the lobby, he encountered Nakaoka who was bowing and speaking on the phone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ Nakaoka-sensei, I asked you to call at the scheduled time when we got on the bus... but I never received any calls, and I was worried. Is something wrong?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ I'm sorry, Vice Principal. It seems the phone was turned off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ The call signal kept ringing, you know? If it was turned off, shouldn't there have been an announcement saying 'The phone is turned off' instead?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ ......</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ I won't be angry, so please tell me the truth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─...I was asleep.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ Nakaoka-sensei, don't you have a sense of responsibility as a teacher to set an example for the students and guide them?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ You said you wouldn't get angry...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─Did you say something? You know, you've been panicking since the beginning of this year without deciding where to go on the school trip. Did you not reflect on that?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">─ I'm reflecting on my actions...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">─If you’re really reflecting on your actions, then you wouldn't have been able to sleep on the bus...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai thought that Nakaoka was a troublesome adult, but he didn't dislike her, so he couldn't help but feel sorry for her when she was being scolded. He wished he could offer some help, but the one scolding Nakaoka was on the other end of the phone, beyond his reach. There was nothing he could do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">All Sandai could do now to support Nakaoka's dignity as an adult was to not witness Nakaoka getting scolded.</span>
      <span class="c3"> In his heart, he silently cheered Nakaoka on, then left the scene and headed to the dinner hall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">The dinner was the same in the mornings and evenings over the course of three days, and was what is called a buffet or a buffet-style meal.</span>
      <span class=""> There were no assigned seats; instead, friends or clubmates gathered together to eat as they pleased.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai naturally sat with Shino at the dinner, and as usual, they occasionally fed each other with a playful "aahh." This kind of behavior was not uncommon for them, as they sometimes did it in class with bento boxes. Their classmates would usually just overlook them with a "There they go again," which they appreciated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, this casual attitude of overlooking them was limited to their classmates; regular customers at the hotel's restaurant couldn't help but notice. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"They're watching us... aren't they?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino sighed, as if to say, What a bother, but there was a satisfied look on her face. Sandai immediately understood what Shino was thinking. She seemed to be happy with the idea of flirting in public, even relishing it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Well, young couples flirting in public was quite common, and the two of them, being students on a school trip, were clearly in that category. So, it seemed like the general public quickly accepted and understood the situation, and the attention gradually faded away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Suddenly, they could hear their classmates' conversations. They were talking about the hands-on learning activities scheduled for tomorrow or the plans for the last day’s free time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was clear that they wanted to enjoy their once-in-a-lifetime high school trip to the fullest. Sandai and Shino, on the other hand, were different in that they viewed the school trip with a more relaxed attitude, to the point where they wouldn't even have cared if it were canceled. It was normal for classmates their age to react this way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">About thirty minutes after they started their dinner, some students began to leave their seats, feeling full. Sandai and Shino followed suit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Since they didn't have any specific plans, the two of them decided to explore the hotel. They looked for anything interesting but couldn't find any noteworthy facilities or sculptures.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After walking for a while, they got tired and decided to sit on a bench in a corridor overlooking the courtyard and passed the time with casual conversations.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"By the way, what were your plans for tomorrow, like, again?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I think there was something like a bookmark with the schedule, but I lost it. I can't remember. I think it was a hands-on learning activity or something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Get a grip~!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Do you have the bookmark, Shino?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I totally lost mine too! Like, I can't even remember when we got it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see. Well, we'll find out what it is tomorrow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You’re right."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...It's about time for me to go back to my room. We were supposed to not leave our rooms after lights out."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"...When we were on our solo trip, we were totally free to do our own thing, so this school trip feels kinda bland, you know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's still a school event. There's no helping that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I get it, but even so, make sure you give me a proper goodnight kiss!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino pouted, extending her lips in a clear request for a kiss. Sandai wanted to respond reflexively, but since they were on a school trip, he decided to first glance around to check his surroundings. It was fine if their teacher, Nakaoka, who had previously ignored them, saw them, but he preferred to avoid being witnessed by their classmates. They had been affectionate with each other in public before, but kissing was a more overt display of romantic affection and could potentially draw more attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It would be terrible if they got reported to the school board or parent-teacher association for their actions, so Sandai felt it was necessary to exercise some caution. He nervously checked his surroundings and confirmed that their classmates weren't nearby. With that reassurance, he pressed his lips against Shino's.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">After the kiss, Sandai looked at Shino. He whispered, "See you tomorrow," and then kissed her one last time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Feeling a sense of reluctance, Sandai returned to his room. Upon entering, he noticed Umeda was already fast asleep, snoring loudly. Finding it a bit noisy, he rolled up a tissue and used it as makeshift earplugs. With that, Sandai peacefully drifted off into the world of dreams.</span>
