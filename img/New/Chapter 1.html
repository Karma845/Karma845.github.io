      <span class="c5"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Time is a finite resource. They had little time left to decide on the school trip destination, and they needed to have an answer by the weekend. This was the moment when the class should unite as one. However, with a group of students who were usually so independent, there's no way they could come together without a proper reason. Normally, </span>
      <span class=" c13">Nakaoka</span>
      <span class="c5">-sensei and the class rep would take charge, but they were both overwhelmed with self-blame and seemed immobilized. This only added to the situation where there was no sign of progress in the discussion. Before they realized it, Friday had arrived, bringing with it the deadline.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"We can still choose an overseas destination, right? Let's go abroad!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"But you had to decide that before last autumn, remember? It's too late now. Why suggest something impossible?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Enough already, seriously! We have to decide today!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Ackkrgghhh!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Who's making those strange noises... wait, is it the class rep?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Shihouin-kun..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Seriously, Fujiwara-kun and Yuizaki-san should feel more responsible. I want to say it's their fault to begin with"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"But it's our fault too... it's not </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">just</span>
      <span class="c5"> their fault."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Time continued to pass without any progress, and it was now after school. Even classmates who had club activities to attend showed determination to focus on the discussion, accepting the possibility of being late.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">However, casting a sidelong glance at those classmates, Sandai began to prepare to leave. He had a part-time job, and he didn't really care where the destination was. Shino felt the same. She also started getting ready to leave. Shino frowned as she caught a glimpse of her face in her compact mirror.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Oh? My cheeks are a bit red." It was still January, and there were many cold days, causing her naturally fair skin to flush a little, making her cheeks slightly warm.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Today seems particularly cold, so it's only natural for your cheeks to get red... Should I get a warm drink from the vending machine?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"If I grab a warm drink, my face will totally go redder 'cause of the temperature difference, so I'll pass~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Well, like, I can't just leave it like that. Gotta fix my makeup a bit to cover up the redness on my face!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Really? I don't think the redness is that noticeable though"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"But, like, I can't take the risk of customers at work going, 'Is this waitress sick or what?' Not everyone's gonna think it's just 'cause of the cold today," Shino explained. As a café waitress, Shino wanted to make a small effort to adjust her complexion to avoid any misunderstandings about her health. Sandai might not fully understand the challenges of customer service, given his simple job cleaning at an aquarium, but he could imagine and empathize to some extent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yeah, you're right. It's not good if they mistake you for being sick. Some customers might even give you a hard time about it. Being cautious is definitely better than being sorry," Sandai agreed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Exactly!" As soon as they stepped into the hallway, Shino took out a pouch from her bag and headed to the nearest girls' restroom to freshen up her makeup. Sandai decided to wait for her in the hallway.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Suddenly, a lively and petite girl, surrounded by a few followers, approached Sandai out of nowhere. Her eyes sparkled with excitement as she stretched up to get closer to his face. </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">Who is this girl? </span>
      <span class=" c13">Sandai</span>
      <span class="c5"> was bewildered by the unexpected approach, and the girl moved even closer to his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Um, are you Fujiwara Sandai-senpai?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The word "senpai" indicated that the girl was a junior—a first-year student, Sandai realized. However, he had very little interaction with his own classmates, let alone juniors, so he was naturally perplexed by this encounter. He had no idea why she would be talking to him, and he had no recollection of her at all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Do you need something from me?" Sandai asked, trying to make sense of the situation. The girl turned back for a moment to look at her followers, who were cheering her on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">The girl sniffed and turned her gaze back to Sandai, then she spoke, </span>
      <span class="c5">"──Please go out with me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">As Sandai’s thoughts came to a halt, the loud voice of a female student caught the attention of their classmates. They cautiously opened the classroom door, and one by one, their curious faces appeared.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">After a few seconds of dazed confusion, Sandai managed to restart his frozen thoughts. "U-um... What did you just say?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I said, 'Please go out with me!'"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"By 'go out with me,' do you mean there's something you want me to help you with or something like that?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"I'm not talking about that! I mean, as a man and a woman! In other words, I want us to have a romantic relationship!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Is this some kind of punishment game or something you're being forced to do?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Despite becoming well-known for dating Shino, Sandai's behavior remained unchanged, and he wasn’t the type to be idolized by underclassmen, at least not in that way. So when someone confessed their feelings to him, Sandai could only think of it as some sort of punishment game.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">However, the girl vehemently denied that idea, "It's not a punishment game or anything like that! I asked you out because I personally see you as </span>
      <span class=" c13">a </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">good guy</span>
      <span class=" c13">!</span>
      <span class="c5">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"You and I have never met before, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"That's right! We haven't!" The girl approached him, and with each step, Sandai took one back. The hallway was narrow, and soon his back hit the wall, "I have a list where I manage all the cool guys, but you, Fujiwara-senpai, were completely off my radar! However, taking a closer look, you’re quite handsome, and your calm demeanor gives off an adult vibe, which is charming! Above all, you’re the guy that Yuizaki-senpai fell for, so there must be unique charms about you that others don't have! That's why I want you, Fujiwara-senpai!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Sandai recalled what Shino had told him earlier, that there were women who wanted other people's boyfriends and would try to mess with them. This girl in front of him was </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">exactly</span>
      <span class="c5"> that type. Sandai, not expecting to find himself in this situation, was surprised. However, despite his surprise, he was not at a loss for an answer. He wasn’t a very dexterous person, and more importantly, he had no intention of turning his feelings toward anyone other than Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Even being the second choice is fine! Let me start as the second girlfriend first, and as you gradually come to understand my good points, I'm sure you'll end up liking me more than Yuizaki-senpai!</span>
      <span class="c5">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“I don't want a second girlfriend or anything like that. I… only want Shino.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I'll make you change that feeling—" Before the girl could finish her sentence, a slender, moistened finger gently pressed against her cheek. Sandai knew the owner of that finger very well. It was Shino. When Sandai timidly looked at her, he was met with a fearsome expression, her brows furrowed and fierce. Sandai shuddered involuntarily, and the female student was sweating like a waterfall as her mouth tightened.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Shino gave the girl a quick glance and spoke in a low, chilling voice, "You're a first-year, right? What do you think you’re doing with my boyfriend?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, you know, Y-Yuizaki-senpai… I'm…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"What are you doing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I'm having a little chat with Fujiwara-senpai…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“What?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“.....”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Shino's technique of gradually becoming less verbal and more intimidating toward girls who got involved with Sandai was something she had done before with a co-worker from her part-time job, Mei. However, this was more severe than at that time. </span>
      <span class=" c13">But why was Shino putting more pressure on this female student than she did on Mei? Perhaps the reason was </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">the kind of feelings</span>
      <span class=" c13"> she has for Sandai.</span>
      <span class="c5"> Mei didn't have any romantic feelings for Sandai; it was merely a little teasing, which is why Shino wasn't serious about it either.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">However, this female student clearly had romantic feelings directed towards Sandai. That was enough reason for Shino to display her demonic intimidation without holding back, and to put it simply, she was a potential troublemaker.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, I was thinking of becoming his second girlfriend... Ah, but Yuizaki-senpai is the first, so you can rest assured that it's totally fine—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"What?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">As a vein throbbed on Shino's forehead, the girl slowly made a U-turn and, accompanied by her followers, discreetly backed away. Rather than the girl retreating quickly, it was Shino who made her leave without a word.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Though the atmosphere in the room remained somewhat tense, it seemed like the peace in the school had been restored... or so they thought. However, a single comment from one of Shino's gal friends who suddenly appeared from the classroom raised the tension once again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hey, Shino, why are ya so fired up? She's just a first-year, no need to bully her, ya know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Bully?" Shino glared at her friend with the same intense expression. As the aftermath of the anger was directed at her, she stiffened, her shoulders shaking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Sh-Shino...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"What bullying? Like, I wasn't even bullying her or anything, but she was </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">totally</span>
      <span class=" c13"> trying to snatch my boyfriend, y’know? Of course, I'm gonna get mad!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I get that, but like, she's younger, ya know? Gotta consider that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"What's age gotta do with it? Is it okay for someone younger to steal someone else's boyfriend just because they're older?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Like, she wasn't even trying to snatch him or anything..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"But almost, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Um... how do I put it... Fujiwara! Help me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Me!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">The gal tapped on Sandai’s shoulder and quickly hurried back into the classroom. </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">How irresponsible!</span>
      <span class=" c13"> Naturally, he felt frustrated with the </span>
      <span class=" c13">gal’s</span>
      <span class="c5"> behavior, but he couldn't just grab her by the collar and pull her back. For now, his priority was to handle Shino, who was on the verge of exploding.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Shino... calm down.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Huh? I'm totally calm," </span>
      <span class=" c13">Shino replied, putting up a front.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Seeing through Shino's act, Sandai gently hugged her and said, "It's okay, it's okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">In a soothing rhythm, like comforting a baby, he gently patted Shino's back and she protested, </span>
      <span class=" c13">"I'm not falling for your tricks just 'cause you're doing that, okay? I'm not some baby, y’know."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"I was happy when you patted my head before. Even when you teased me as a 'big baby,' I was still happy. So, how about you, Shino?"</span>
      <span class="c5"> As Sandai whispered into Shino's ear, she pressed her face against his chest and made a soft sound, like a contented cat being petted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Mmmm"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Sandai succeeded admirably in dispelling Shino's anger and anxiety. </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">somehow I managed to make it work… </span>
      <span class=" c13">Sandai let out a sigh of relief and their classmates, who had been watching the whole scene, also breathed a collective sigh of relief as the tension in the room instantly relaxed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5"> </span>
      <span class="c5">“Phew, crisis averted. I thought it was going to be a serious fistfight, you know?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Fujiwara-kun, you're just perfect at handling Yuizaki-san, huh~”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“It's not just a Yuizaki-san exclusive technique; any girl would calm down like that. If someone treated me like that, I'd totally melt in a similar way.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Shino's got such a creepy look on her face.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Like, seriously... the whole argument over the school trip destination is starting to seem ridiculous.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">“But we gotta decide by today, right? Let's be practical and choose a realistic place. Wasn't </span>
      <span class=" c13">Hakodate</span>
      <span class="c5"> the easiest to decide on? How about Hakodate?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Yeah, that sounds good.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The exchange between Sandai and Shino, unbeknownst to the students, secretly helped unite the class, which had been in a dispute over the school trip destination, and quickly reached a conclusion. The two, who were also the cause of the dispute in the first place, went around and quelled it. Whether it was due to fate or just a coincidence, putting aside any philosophical contemplation, Sandai and Shino achieved a significant victory.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">However, they had forgotten one crucial detail. It only hit them when one of the students muttered to himself, “Is it already 4 o'clock? Oh no, I'm going to be late for club activities.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Oh no, I'm going to be late for my part-time job!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Me too!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Yes, as they both had part-time jobs, Sandai and Shino rushed off in a hurry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c22">
      <span class="c5"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
      <span class=" c13">２</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c22">
      <span class="c5"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"</span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">Huff, huff</span>
      <span class="c5">..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai finally arrived at his part-time job at the aquarium and checked the time on his phone. It was just five minutes before the start of his shift—a pretty close call. But he managed to make it on time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I've never been late before… so I'm glad I could keep my… perfect attendance" Gasping for breath, he opened the employee entrance door and made his way to the office. Inside, the deputy director, Komaki, and a few other staff members were on their break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Oh, hey there, Fujiwara-kun," Komaki was the first to notice Sandai and called out to him. The other staff members also greeted him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Good morning, everyone."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"You look kinda worn out... Ah, must be 'cause you barely made it on time. Did you run here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's not often we see you sliding in just in time like this. Saeki-kun sometimes does it, so I'm not surprised with him, but you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, some stuff happened at school today."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"I see. Well, as students, I guess such things do happen. But if you're changing clothes, you might not make it in time for the time card. How about I punch in for you now? I can do Saeki-kun's as well while I'm at it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">It was a workplace with kind-hearted people, and Sandai had always felt that way. However, that's precisely why he couldn't explain the details of what happened at school. </span>
      <span class=" c13">If they were to find out that a younger girl confessed to him, and his girlfriend Shino got mad over it, they'd probably be </span>
      <span class=" c13">s</span>
      <span class=" c13">hocked.</span>
      <span class="c5"> Moreover, at work, Sandai was known as a straightforward and diligent guy, and he didn't want to risk that reputation. Being honest about everything wasn't always the best course of action.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai bowed slightly without saying a word, had his time card punched, and quickly went to change his clothes. He was so preoccupied with just barely making it on time today, that he forgot to check if Hajime was there, as he usually did, and went straight into the changing room. That's when he encountered the situation again.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I should be more careful next time..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Ehhh!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Hajime was alone in the changing room. He was in the middle of changing, already wearing work pants, but his upper body was exposed, wearing a camisole-like shirt without a top. A mix of embarrassment and apology overwhelmed Sandai, just like the feeling when accidentally peeking at a girl changing clothes. He couldn't quite understand why he reacted this way, even though Hajime was of the same gender.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">However, upon reflection, Sandai realized that Hajime's gender was merely self-proclaimed. Not long ago, they went together to the botanical garden, and at that time, Sandai inadvertently caught a glimpse of Hajime's bare skin and got a punch to the eye. He showed a clear refusal to be seen naked by someone of the same gender. Why did he not want to be seen naked by someone of the same gender? Sandai couldn’t help but think that he had some secret about his body, and he felt </span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">that </span>
      <span class="c5">was the reason for the strange feelings he sometimes had towards Hajime.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">“</span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">Haaah</span>
      <span class="c5">, you should at least knock when you come in!" Hajime hurriedly put on his jacket, his cheeks slightly flushed, and glared at Sandai with a growl. Unlike last time, he didn't go for an eye punch, probably because even though the shirt was somewhat see-through, it still concealed his bare skin to some extent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, sorry" Sandai apologized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Geez..." Hajime puffed up his cheeks and turned away with a huff, saying "I'll go ahead," before leaving the changing room.</span>
      <span class="c5"> The room was now filled with silence as Sandai was left alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"</span>
      <span class=" c15 c13">Haaah</span>
      <span class="c5">…." He couldn't help but let out a sigh. He couldn't deny that he was curious about whatever Hajime was hiding, but he was his first friend of the same gender, and that felt good. It was okay just the way it was. So, even if Hajime had some secret, Sandai thought it would be better not to know. He decided to put all his effort into remaining oblivious to it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">With renewed determination, Sandai finished changing and went on to perform the usual cleaning duties inside the facility together with Hajime.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The days of part-time work and spending time with Shino passed without any particular issues, and things returned to normal after the class trip destination was decided. As time went by, it was already the latter half of January. One day, Sandai realized that his hair had grown quite long.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">"I should probably go get it cut soon, right?"</span>
      <span class=" c13"> Sandai muttered to himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Ever since Shino's friends had referred to his previous visit to the beauty salon as “remodeling", Sandai had been quite casual about hair care. It wasn't that he was being lazy; rather, he wanted to avoid attracting too much attention from other girls, as Shino disliked it. However, no matter how much he tried to hide it, his hair kept growing, and he couldn't maintain a sense of cleanliness. Thus, Sandai decided to secretly visit the beauty salon without telling Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Today, Sandai had a day off from work, while Shino had a shift at her part-time job. With some free time, until he had to pick her up, he thought it would be best to get it done today and immediately made a reservation over the phone. Incidentally, the hair salon he called was the same one that took care of him for the "remodeling”. He was aware that there were many other salons, but he didn't have much knowledge in that area and didn't want to risk any mishaps. So, he decided to go back to a place he had gone before</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">“</span>
      <span class="c5">Ah, Hello?. I'd like to make an appointment, is that okay?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c24">《</span>
      <span class=" c13">Yes, that's perfectly fine. What day would you like to make an appointment?</span>
      <span class="c24">》</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Today would be convenient for me. Is there any availability?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c24">《</span>
      <span class=" c13">A same-day reservation, I see. We have an opening at 6 p.m. If that time works for you, I can make the reservation for you.</span>
      <span class="c24">》 </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">The time when Shino finishes her part-time job is around 8:30 PM. If I can get a reservation at 6 PM, I'll definitely finish before it gets too late to pick her up, unless I choose a complicated hairstyle.</span>
      <span class=" c13"> </span>
      <span class="c5">“Then, I'll take that time.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c24">《</span>
      <span class=" c13">Sure. So, your reservation for 6 PM is confirmed... May I have your name, please?</span>
      <span class="c24">》 </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“It's Fujiwara Sandai.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c24">《</span>
      <span class=" c13">Fujiwara Sandai-san.... By the way, have you used our salon before?</span>
      <span class="c24">》 </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“I went once around last fall. I went with a group of gals, and it might have been a bit noisy and bothersome…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c24">《</span>
      <span class=" c13">A group of gals? Last fall... Ahh...</span>
      <span class="c24">》 </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“Huh?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c24">《</span>
      <span class=" c13">Oh, it's nothing. We'll be waiting for you then.</span>
      <span class="c24">》 </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">What was that "ah" in response to?</span>
      <span class="c5"> Sandai tilted his head, but then he immediately remembered that he had looked really bad the last time he visited. Although he downplayed the situation as just "I might have caused trouble," to ordinary people, it was a sight that would not be easily forgotten once seen—a high school boy surrounded by five gals. Sandai felt a strong desire to explain the situation, but the more he tried to make excuses, the more counterproductive it would be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Sandai decided to remain as calm as possible and to head over when it was time, without worrying too much. He believed this was the best choice and, once decided, it was better not to dwell on unnecessary thoughts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">When Sandai got close to the hair salon, he started aimlessly wandering around to kill some time. He bought vegetable juice at a convenience store to fill his stomach and stopped by a bookstore to check out a new light novel he was interested in. Before he knew it, six o'clock had arrived.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai entered the beauty salon and provided his name and appointment time. After a short wait, a male hairstylist came over with a wry smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Long time no see! I remember you were my client before. Do you recall?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai recognized who he meant. The hairstylist's cornrow-style hair made it difficult to identify him at first. However, upon a closer look, Sandai realized he was indeed the same person who had served him before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, quite some time has passed, and your hairstyle is so different from before, so I didn't recognize you at first.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Haha, I see. I did change my hairstyle drastically, so it's only natural you didn't recognize me right away," the stylist chuckled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Sorry"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"No worries at all. Anyway, about this hairstyle called 'cornrows'... How about trying the same one as mine?" The stylist recommended his own wild and fashionable hairstyle, but it appeared too tough-looking for Sandai's taste.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">It's more like a delinquent or a yankee……</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai thought it wouldn’t look good on him, and besides, Shino might not like it, so he decided not to go for it, "I think my girlfriend would dislike that kind of hairstyle, so I'll pass"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Oh, you have a girlfriend?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see. Well, with your looks, you probably have one, two, or even three girlfriends, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"I don't have three. Just one," Sandai replied.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"</span>
      <span class=" c13">kidding, kidding</span>
      <span class="c5">. So, what's she like? One of those gals from the group you came with last time? They were all cute girls."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"No, she wasn't anyone from that time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"What kind of girl is she? Oh, I'm not just asking out of curiosity. If I know what she's like, it'll be easier for me to suggest a hairstyle that she'll be happy with." Instead of just cutting as instructed, the hairstylist determined the direction of the cut while maintaining proper communication. Given that he had done a meticulous job previously, Sandai, who had come to trust him as a reliable stylist, honestly described Shino's personality</span>
      <span class=" c13">.</span>
      <span class="c5"> In response, the stylist gave a wry smile, "I see. So she's possessive, and she might get upset if you look too cool because she's afraid other girls might approach you. She sounds... quite intense, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"I feel that way too, but since she's my first girlfriend and I have no one else to compare her to, I'm not sure exactly how intense she is compared to other girls."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I get it. Well, it's probably better to remain ignorant for now. It's for your own good, I think. Based on what you've told me, I feel like trying to get to know other girls might lead to some unpleasant situations."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The hairstylist seemed to be both fashion-sensitive and skilled at listening to others, suggesting he had ample experience in handling women. Sandai felt it would be wise to take this advice seriously, so he nodded briefly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"But still, it's tough that even the previous hairstyle didn't work out... I aimed for a refreshing and modest look, but maybe that's the problem. Perhaps I made it too appealing to girls. Hmm..." The stylist began muttering to himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Not wanting to disturb him while he contemplated his suggestions, Sandai started reading the men's hair catalogs that were placed nearby. It featured various styles like very short, short, semi-short, and so on. Each hairstyle seemed somewhat similar, yet different in some way. All the hairstyles in the catalog looked cool, and as Sandai gazed at them, he couldn't help but wonder which one suited him best. However, he knew that personal preference and what actually looked good on him were two different things. Choosing solely based on his own preferences could lead to disastrous results. </span>
      <span class=" c13">Sandai knew this, and above all, what mattered most was how Shino would feel about the hairstyle. So, he simply enjoyed browsing through the catalog without getting too carried away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hmm... Yeah, that's true... In that case..." As Sandai was about halfway through the hair catalog, the hairstylist seemed to have made a decision on the hairstyle. He borrowed the catalog from Sandai and flipped through it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"How about something like this?" The hairstyle the stylist showed was similar to the one he had done for Sandai previously but with an even more subdued and mature vibe. "To me, it may not look drastically different from before, but that's just from a guy's perspective. For girls, it gives off a clean but understated vibe. I think she'd be happy with this, don't you...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai, who was not particularly sensitive to fashion, couldn't predict how Shino would view this hairstyle that seemed unchanged from the previous one. However, it was a professional suggestion, and rather than offering his own unskilled opinions, he believed it would yield better results to trust and leave it to the stylist. So, he nodded and said, "Please go ahead."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Alright then, let's get started."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai closed his eyes and let things happen as they would. Thus, standing still without a thought for an hour, he realized he had transformed into a new version of himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"All done. How does it look?" The stylist patted his shoulder, and Sandai stared at his reflection in the mirror.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">As he had been told, it didn't appear significantly different from before, but the atmosphere felt more mature than the previous style. The faint scent of hair styling products had a warm touch, perhaps in consideration of the winter season, and it turned out really nice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Thank you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"No problem at all," The stylist smiled, then changed the subject, "By the way…. Do you remember when I said I wanted to make you a 'haircut model'?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"I thought you had a rather nice look, so I wanted to feature you. Our salon has a space in a magazine that we receive every other month, and I want to showcase you there. It'll be one of several features, just a small section in the corner."</span>
      <span class=" c13"> Whether such a conversation had actually taken place or not had slipped from Sandai's memory, and he couldn't recall it clearly. </span>
      <span class=" c13">But </span>
      <span class=" c13">'Now that he mentioned it, it started to sound a bit familiar. </span>
      <span class=" c13">"I'll make today's service free. Is that okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Um..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The offer of a free haircut made Sandai's heart waver. While he received some financial support from his parents and worked part-time, he wasn't exactly well-off, considering the expenses of living alone.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">However, despite the offer, Sandai hesitated about having his photos displayed for strangers to see. As he was contemplating this, he found himself pushed forward, and the next thing he knew, he was taking several pictures in the mini-studio inside the salon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Done! Thanks!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">In the midst of his indecision, he ended up in this situation. Well, it was just a small corner, and it was free of charge. Besides, he couldn't turn back time and change the past. So, Sandai decided to quietly give in.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">After leaving the salon, he checked the time on his smartphone and saw that it was around 7:30 in the evening. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">"There's still some time before Shino finishes her shift…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Having about thirty minutes to spare before going to pick her up, Sandai decided to kill some time at random. Just then, he coincidentally ran into Nakaoka, who was on her way home.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">“Fujiwara? What a coincidence........ were you shopping?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I was just about to pick up Shino from her part-time work. But it's a bit too early to go right now, so I plan to kill about thirty minutes before going there..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I'll excuse myself then. Take care, Sensei"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai nodded and was about to pass by when Nakaoka reached out and grabbed his shoulder. Sandai turned around with a questioning look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"W-What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"You just said you need to kill about thirty minutes, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"...That's true, but…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Killing time alone can be boring, right? I'll keep you company for the next thirty minutes."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Sandai was puzzled, but Nakaoka grabbed him by the collar and dragged him off to spend the next 30 minutes with </span>
      <span class=" c13">h</span>
      <span class="c5">er.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c22">
      <span class="c5"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c6">
      <span class=" c13">４</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0 c22">
      <span class="c5"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Nakaoka dragged along Sandai and arrived at a karaoke bar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Karaoke, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's my treat. Thirty minutes of karaoke is nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Um, okay..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">After checking in at the reception, they entered the karaoke room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Come on, all the way to the back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I prefer the entrance side..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Let me have the entrance side. It's for convenience, like going to the restroom."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"That’s right."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">When taking seats, there's quite a personal preference among women for the aisle side versus the wall side. It's not about good or bad; some feel comfortable by the wall, while others, like Nakaoka, prefer the aisle for easy movement without much concern. By the way, Shino, like Nakaoka, prefers the aisle, but her choice is more like an expression of her desire not to let Sandai go anywhere.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"By the way, Sensei, you go to karaoke too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I come to karaoke fairly often for relieving stress. Also I'm often with Sasakura."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Sasakura was a school nurse. There were times where they showed a close relationship between them during the school festival, indicating that they are friends or something along those lines.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"You two get along well, don’t you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"We're the same age... high school classmates and friends. We were a bit distant for a while after going to different universities, though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's quite a coincidence to end up working at the same place as your friend from school."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"We joined at different times, ran into each other by chance, and rekindled our friendship. The world is surprisingly small. But anyway... Even though I'm treating you today, Fujiwara, can't you at least thank me properly for my exceptional kindness? Hm?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">As much as he wanted to retort, knowing Nakaoka's personality, she'd probably come up with a tricky response, so Sandai held back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, yeah. Thank you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I like kids who can express gratitude."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Saying that, Nakaoka gazed at Sandai's face intently. It was a slightly different expression from her usual demeanor, a kind and gentle look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"W-What's with that kind look, staring at me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Nakaoka chuckled, monopolizing the remote control, and began queuing up her own songs one after another. She seemed to have no intention of letting Sandai sing and expected him to listen to her songs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Well, it was fine as long as Sandai could pass the time. He wasn’t that skilled at singing, so just listening was like a wish come true.</span>

<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww0.jpeg">

    <p class="c16">
      <span class="c5">As Sandai sipped his drink slowly, thirty minutes had passed in the blink of an eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well then."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Take care."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai watched Nakaoka's back as she left, now looking refreshed after singing to her heart's content. By the way, it is worth mentioning that Nakaoka was incredibly skilled at singing.</span>

    <p class="c6 c22">
      <span class="c5"/>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">After parting ways with Nakaoka, Sandai arrived at the café where Shino worked. Upon entering, he immediately made eye contact with Mei’s, who had a choco coronet hairstyle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Welcome... Oh, it's Shino-pi’s boyfriend, isn't it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Did I hear a click of the tongue just now...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I didn't do anything like that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Really?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">A brief moment of silence hung in the air.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The sense of bitterness they had towards each other was blatantly obvious. but they never openly argued face to face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"We have a vacant seat over here. It's the boyfriend's bonus!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Thank you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"No need for thanks."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">As Sandai settled into the seat he was shown, Mei promptly brought over the boyfriend's bonus tea and a plate of pastries from the café.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Here you go."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Thanks."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I told you, no need for thanks."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Right...right"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"......."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"......."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">For Sandai, Mei is his girlfriend's coworker.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">For Mei, Sandai is her colleague's boyfriend with whom she gets along well with.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Though they don't exactly get along, they can't be too dismissive of each other without tarnishing Shino's face, who is caught in the middle. So, perhaps it would be better to throw in a few considerate words – that's what they're thinking. But they're both lost, unable to figure out what to say to each other – that's the kind of atmosphere it is.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Um... Well..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"......."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"If you have something to say, it's best to say it sooner."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Speaking of which, do you have anything you want to say to me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I might... or I might not... It's that kind of feeling."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"......."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"......."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">With the need to say something gnawing at him, Sandai's brain worked at full speed, and he caught sight of the suspicious situation by the employees-only door out of the corner of his eye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Through the gap in the door, several female staff members were peering at them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class=" c13">—-  </span>
      <span class=" c13">What's up with that guy, staring so intently at that chocolate croissant girl?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Wait, isn’t he Shino-chan's boyfriend?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Mei... Could she be trying to steal him?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Wasn't Mei into flashy guys? Did her preferences change?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Shino's in the dressing room changing, but if she runs into this, it'll be a big problem.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Seriously... I'll have to talk to Mei-chan later as the assistant manager!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Whoa! Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Is there something on my face or what?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  Hide, hide!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  What's going on? Oh… it's Sandai and Mei-chan.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c12">
      <span class="c5">—-  "Aren't you angry? Don't you have the composure of a girlfriend?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">—- What are you even talking about? Seriously, I'm lost here. But it seems like those two are kinda feeling uncomfortable around each other. So, they're just sorta caught up in this awkwardness...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">—- Now that you mention it, yeah, that seems about right. I knew it. Because I'm the assistant manager!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">—- The palm-curling wiper assistant manager.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">When Shino appeared, the female staff members all scattered like spiders. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">What on earth was that about...? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Well, setting aside things that cannot be understood even if one thinks about them, with Shino's arrival, the heaviness between Sandai and Mei came to an end.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Relieved, Sandai let out a sigh. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"What are you two up to?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's just, well, that feeling of awkwardness..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Shi-Shino-pi... um... I was thinking maybe I should be considerate of Shino-pi’s boyfriend..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"You don't need to be overly considerate, you know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Huh? I don't need to be considerate?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yeah, like, when I see someone being way too considerate, I'm just like, 'What's the deal with them and someone else's boyfriend?' So, honestly, it'd be kinda better if you didn't stress about it too much."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see... Well, I wouldn't want to upset Shino-pi, so I get it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Mei, who seemed a bit self-centered, had developed a slight flinch upon seeing Shino. It seemed like she still had a bit of trauma from when Shino had intimidated her before. Despite her seemingly selfish personality, Mei surprisingly had a timid side.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Well, Sandai didn't really need to delve into Mei's inner world, so he let the topic slide and quickly enjoyed the perks of being a boyfriend before heading home with Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">On the way to the station, Shino intently stared at Sandai's face for a while. Sandai immediately guessed the reason – his hairstyle had changed a bit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"......"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"My hair's grown out a bit."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see. It looks better than before. It seems like fewer girls would approach you now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai didn't really notice the difference between his current hairstyle and the previous one, but he seemed to have successfully conveyed the idea to Shino that "other girls might not like it as much."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Indeed, as the hairdresser had said, they understood each other well, capturing the delicate sensitivity of girls that boys might not grasp.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hehe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Shino happily laughed and entwined her fingers with his. Sandai gently and slowly returned the gesture, careful not to hurt her delicate hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"What should we do today?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hmm... I heard it's going to get pretty cold today, and it'll probably get even colder as time goes on... so I'm thinking we should head home a bit early."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see. Well then, I'll make sure to escort you all the way home today too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Thanks! Oh, wait, gotta swing by the pharmacy real quick before I catch my train."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Is there something you need to buy?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yeah, just some everyday skincare cream, razors, and... well, feminine hygiene products."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Being a girl, Shino absolutely needed those things for her daily life, so there was nothing weird about it. But for Sandai, hearing "feminine hygiene products" made him feel oddly embarrassed. Despite having already taken their relationship to an intimate level, there was a different kind of awkwardness associated with this topic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Feminine hygiene products, huh. Well, yeah, they're essential for girls."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Shino's unabashed attitude probably stemmed from a kind of trust that Sandai would never shy away from or avoid such discussions. Sandai keenly felt that aspect too. That's why he wanted to confront it properly and why he had realized certain things in the process.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"So, I was thinking..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Girls really end up spending way more money just by existing compared to guys, huh? Like, those feminine hygiene products, right? It's a total must-have expense just because you're a girl."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"......"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Even though Shino says she'll pay her share for our dates, I still try to cover more of it. I mean, I'm a guy, so I don't really have those big expenses."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hmm?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Wh-what? I'm not really the extravagant type, so I can totally manage that much."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">There was a time when Sandai used to collect erotic books, image sets, or videos, but he got rid of the books shortly after meeting Shino, and he tidied up and reduced the contents of his PC after their first intimate experience. While Sandai wasn't rich by any means, he significantly curbed his unnecessary spending, allowing him some financial flexibility.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai glanced at Shino from the corner of his eye, as if trying to gauge her reaction. Shino rested her index finger on her chin, adopting a thoughtful gesture. But she seemed to have an answer ready, as she smiled softly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yeah, that's right. So, how ‘bout you pitch in a bit more this time?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Leave it to me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"But, you can't just never let me pay at all, okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Alright, how about a 7:3 split, with the 7 being my share? And I'll even handle the remainder."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Got it. By the way, what does 'remainder' mean?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai was well aware that Shino had a bit of a naive side, but not knowing the word "remainder" was an entirely different level of ignorance. He nearly stumbled in disbelief.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"W-What's going on? Huh? Wait, is 'remainder' like some word that normal people know…..?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Well, yeah, 'remainder' is a word that normal people know."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Oh, you see, like, I'm kind of an airhead, so it's, like, totally normal for me not to know stuff like that, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Remainder is like... You know when there's, like, a payment of, say, 1007 yen? It's, like, that 7 yen part."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Oh, right, I get it now. The small change stuff, yeah?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Exactly!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Remainder means the small change stuff. Got it, I'll remember that!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Shino playfully snapped to attention, saluting like she was joking around. Sandai couldn't help but wonder if she really understood, but pressing her further on it would just put her in a bad mood. So, he brushed it off and they entered a nearby pharmacy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai had no clue about the specific names of the products Shino was looking to buy, so he decided to be a good sport and play the baggage carrier. Instead of just idly waiting, he memorized the names and packaging of the feminine hygiene products that Shino discreetly placed in the basket. He considered the possibility that he might have to buy them in the future.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I should remember the names of these feminine hygiene products, too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Huh? Why?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"For example, if you're feeling unwell and need me to buy them for you. If I don't know which ones to get and end up bombarding you with messages or calls, you won't get proper rest, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"In that case, I'd ask my mom for help..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"But Neko-san and Daigo-san run the tofu shop together, and there might be times when they're busy or have important things to do. I think it's possible."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Come to think of it, there were, like, a couple of times in middle school when I was in that situation. But, like, I'd just tough it out during those times."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's just my selfishness, but I don't want to make you endure that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I see... Well then, maybe you should remember?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai had initially intended to nonchalantly memorize the feminine hygiene products, but since he wasn't used to seeing them on a daily basis, he stared intently to commit them to memory. He focused intently, not missing a single character as he memorized them. Suddenly, Shino's face turned red, and she tugged at Sandai's sleeve, pulling him gently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Remembering them is fine, but, like, staring so intently is a bit... you know."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">After being advised by Shino and glancing around, Sandai finally realized that the passing female customers were giving them strange looks and raised eyebrows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">──Staring at feminine hygiene products... The girlfriend next to him is blushing like crazy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">──The type of guy who only lets his girlfriend use the specific feminine hygiene products he approves...? He might seem like a quiet, good guy, but he's actually a pervert.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">──Such a cute girl getting caught up with a guy who has personality issues... It's really too bad.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">He didn't quite understand what they were saying, but one thing was for sure – he definitely wasn't being called a "good boyfriend" or anything like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"You could just take pictures of the packaging after you buy them, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Y-Yeah, that's a good idea. Haha."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Sandai calmly excused himself from the situation, acting as if he didn't know anything. Inside, he was feeling quite flustered, but revealing that wouldn't help and might even make him seem more suspicious. So, he put on a composed, dependable boyfriend facade as best as he could.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">６</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">When they arrived at Shino's tofu shop, the lights were off. Even if Daigo and Neko were out due to work, Miki should have been there... Sandai tilted his head in confusion, and then Shino explained:</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"My parents and Miki went out for dinner today, but they haven't come back yet."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The Yuizaki family, excluding Shino, had gone out for dinner together. Shino hadn't joined them, probably because it was difficult to match her part-time job schedule, and perhaps also because Sandai was around. It was a subtle way of saying to prioritize time with her boyfriend. Sandai wasn't sure about Daigo, but he felt that Neko was the type to think that way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's kinda lonely waiting here alone, so, um, wanna wait in my room...? Is that okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Sure, I don't mind. In that case, I'll come in."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yay! This way, this way!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai's heart was pounding a bit. He had become more familiar with the Yuizaki family since he started dropping off Shino home more often, but this was his first time entering Shino's room. Previously, whenever he escorted Shino, there was usually someone else around – either Daigo, Neko, or Miki. Even when he visited their house, he hadn't been to Shino's room to avoid leaving a bad impression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">However, by chance, today presented the opportunity to enter Shino's room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">Calm down... I'm getting nervous.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">What would Shino's room be like? With excitement, Sandai followed Shino. Her room was on the second floor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Here's my room!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">As soon as he entered, Sandai caught a whiff of Shino's scent. It had a slight sweetness, probably from her usual hand cream and shampoo. The room was primarily decorated with warm colors, and it was tidier than he had expected. The table had a bit of clutter, but it wasn't excessively messy, just normal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">There were also small baskets hanging around with knitted items, and a bookshelf filled mostly with cooking, baking, and sewing books.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Have a seat!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Shino placed a cute, deformed animal face cushion and patted it invitingly. As Sandai tried to sit down without hesitation, he thought it would be a bit pitiful to squash the cute animal face with his butt. So, he shifted it slightly and settled on sitting on just half of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Suddenly, Shino exclaimed, "Oh!" and left the room briefly, returning with a newspaper. She then took a bottle of nail polish out of a drawer and started wiping its contents onto the newspaper with a cotton swab.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"...What are you doing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I got this nail polish as a sample. But like, it totally turned into a rock from just sittin' around, so I gotta get rid of it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">While being a gal, Shino didn't really bother decorating her nails. One reason was her job in the food and beverage industry, as well as frequently doing housework, which made her wary of things like dishware or clothing getting stained with nail polish.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">While it would likely be fine if she was careful, Shino also had a somewhat careless side to her personality, so her choice to abstain was based on that aspect of her character. Of course, this was only her typical behavior. On days when she spent the entire day on a date without any work or chores, she would casually decorate her nails.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">It was relatively recent that Sandai started noticing this change in her behavior, particularly after winter break.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It's seriously hard..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Looks like a tough task."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Yeah, like, I've got a few more bottles of nail polish that need to get disposed. Mind giving me a hand with that, too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Sure, sure."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Taking the nail polish containers from Shino, Sandai started helping with the disposal, mimicking what he saw. The monotonous work continued, and eventually, they were done.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Shino crumpled up the newspaper and tossed it into the trash bin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"All done!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"For plastic containers, they go with plastic, and for glass bottles, they go with glass, and you put them out for recycling pickup. Don't throw them out as burnable garbage"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I know that much..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Perhaps treating her a little too much like a simpleton, Shino pouted slightly and started playfully hitting Sandai with a pillow.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Hey, hey!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Mmm~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Don't get so worked up."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I'm not really mad. I just wanted to lightly hit you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Even so, you put quite a bit of strength into it—"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai tried to evade the pillow attack, Shino tripped him up with her foot and tumbled over while clinging onto him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Eek!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">"Ouch..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">Feeling a weight on his stomach, Sandai involuntarily lifted his eyelids. And there, his eyes met with Shino s</span>
      <span class=" c13">traddling</span>
      <span class="c5"> on him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">It seemed she was aware that the recent tumble was her doing, as a look of apology graced her expression. However, rather than verbalizing an apology, she pursed her lips and gently leaned in, placing her hands on both sides of Sandai's cheeks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">*Chuuu*</span>
      <span class="c5"> - a gentle kiss was planted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">The meaning behind this act was clear: "It wasn't intentional, so don't be mad."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">In response, Sandai knew that he had to convey his feelings through actions as well. He leaned in to kiss Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13 c15">“Mmm…”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">“.....”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Not just once, okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"I know."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">They repeated the kisses, again and again. Communicating their emotions gradually, matching their breaths to ensure it wasn't tiring, creating chuckling noises.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">A sudden *clank* from the door broke their rhythm. It had happened after they had shared more than five kisses. As both Sandai and Shino turned towards the source of </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">the noise, they found themselves being observed by Miki, Neko, and Daigo, who were peeking through the gap in the door. It seemed that they had returned home before Shino and Sandai noticed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ Hey, they've noticed us looking.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ Because Dad was making noise...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ Seriously, we can't rely on Daigo-san anymore.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ Oi, is this all my fault?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c13">─ Yep, pretty much.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ Ehh...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ But still, Shino is amazing. Straddling on Fujiwara-kun and kissing him like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ Well, big sis really likes him, doesn't she?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">─ Hey, wait, looks like Shino's coming this way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Realizing they were being watched, Shino marched over to the trio with a thud and forcefully closed the door behind her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"...They saw us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Muttering softly, Sandai lowered his head as Shino approached.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"Sorry..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Feeling responsible for the family ruining the nice atmosphere, Shino's voice trembled slightly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">It was not Shino's fault. Miki, Neko, and Daigo aren't at fault either. If anyone was to blame, it was just the timing. While this might be apparent with a bit of thought, logical reasoning wasn't exactly Shino's strong suit, and she seemed on the verge of tears. And so, Sandai tightly embraced Shino from behind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">"It’s okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Patting her head gently, Sandai's touch seemed to revive Shino's spirits, dispersing the nearly tearful atmosphere.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Taking care of her mental state was part of a boyfriend's responsibilities.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">Sandai didn't find it bothersome at all. In fact, he felt a certain sense of satisfaction. Being able to support someone he cared about made him feel like his whole self was affirmed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c5">And he thought to himself,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15 c13">I really do like Shino, huh?</span>
    </p>
