    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">In the afterword of the previous volume, I talked about purchasing roses, so I was hoping to be able to tell you that “they bloomed beautifully” this time, but I am writing this afterword in February... So, in other words, they haven’t bloomed yet (crying).</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Well, aside from my current situation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">This is the third volume of this work, but just like in the previous volume, Sandai-kun and Shino-chan's days as lovers have passed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino-chan still loves Sandai-kun and is overflowing with feelings. Sandai-kun accepts Shino-chan and tells her through words and actions that he loves her just as much.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Their days are going smoothly, but it's not just because of convenience; I think it's because the two of them are getting along with each other.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As the author, I myself followed this work as a reader while writing it, and along the way, I found myself sometimes agreeing with a “I see.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai-kun is always thinking about what would make Shino-chan happy, and Shino-chan is also very protective of Sandai-kun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The two of them have gradually come to resemble each other since they started dating, but they’re still not exactly the same, and it’s precisely because they understand each other that they are able to be there for each other when necessary, and that is how the happy days of this story came to be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">It can be seen that both Sandai-kun and Shino-chan think that happiness is not something that falls from the sky, but that it depends on them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">While Sanda-kuni and Shino-chan were going about their daily lives, the other characters also began to change little by little.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino-chan’s fears have come true for a junior girl, Hajime-kun continues to give off an atmosphere as if he is hiding a secret ......, Mei-chan is having trouble grasping the distance between them, and the Class rep and Takasago-chan seem to be experiencing a change in their relationship due to their school trip. The love life of Shino-chan's gal friend and Nakaoka Sensei, who has a past that connects with Sandai-kun.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The characters all have their own egos and therefore do as they please, so sometimes things take a turn that I never imagined.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In this volume too, many scenes developed in a way that surprised even me, the author.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">I'd love to talk passionately about which parts were surprising, but the afterword is reaching its limit, so I'll refrain for now…..</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Finally, I would like to express my gratitude. First and foremost, to all the readers. Thank you for picking up this volume. Knowing that many people were looking forward to it, and seeing that the momentum from the second volume hasn't slowed down, has been a great relief and joy. I truly appreciate it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Next, to Hizuki Higure-sensei, who provided illustrations for this volume.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Every time I see the finished illustrations as well as rough sketches, I realize how wonderfully you have colored my work, and I am filled with gratitude. I am very happy that you have drawn the characters so vividly on the cover, in the color insert, and in the illustrations for this volume.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">And to everyone involved.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Thank you, Take-chan, the editor in charge. Thank you to Fantasia Bunko's editorial department, proofreaders, reviewers, layout designers, distributors, and the printing company, thank you. I would also like to thank everyone at the bookstores and electronic sites.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">I express my gratitude in every volume, but I am the kind of person who tends to forget if I don't express my feelings, so I try to put them into words as often as possible.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Now, whether the next volume can be published or not is uncertain, given the rapidly changing circumstances in the publishing industry. However, I hope I will be able to….I am sure that we will be able to publish it, so please look forward to it when the time comes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">That's all for now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">I look forward to meeting you all again in the next volume!</span>
