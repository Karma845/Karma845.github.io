    <h2>Digression ②: Who Would Have Thought We'd Ecounter Choco Croissants In The Middle Of Town?</h2></a>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">On that day, Sandai waited for Shino near the bronze animal statue close to the station. It was their rendezvous for a date. However, he had mistakenly arrived twenty minutes early. If he had arrived an hour early, he could have killed time somewhere, but with just twenty minutes to spare, he decided to sit quietly on the edge of the stairs in front of the statue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">And then it happened by chance. He ran into Mei.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, it's Choco Croissant..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Eek..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's with the 'eek'? Don't react like you've encountered a monster."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Is Shino-pi here nearby?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Don't just ignore me... Well, whatever. Shino's not here. We're meeting up, but I got here too early."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wow, so it's like, 'I'm so excited for our date! I got here way too early!' kind of thing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, something like that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You're not mad at me for making fun of you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, it's true that I'm looking forward to the date with Shino, so there's nothing to get mad about."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wow!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Could you please stop with those exaggerated reactions?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"But even if you say that, Mei won't stop. That's just how Mei is."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Mei stuck her tongue out and sat down next to Sandai.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why did you sit next to me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Mei also has a meeting here, you know, in front of the statue."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Upon closer inspection, Mei's outfit had a bit more flair to it, resembling the kind of look she'd put together for hanging out with someone. She wore a hoodie and a lace-trimmed skirt. Her shoes were laced-up boots, and her hair was meticulously styled, making her look like an exquisite Choco Croissant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A meeting... with a boyfriend?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If it were a date with a boyfriend, I'd choose a completely different outfit. I do want a boyfriend, but I don't have any candidates."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You want a boyfriend, huh? I remember you had a thing for flashy guys, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yes, that's right. Can you introduce me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I only have one friend, and he's not exactly flashy. He's a cute kind of guy. So, I can't make that introduction."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Having only one friend is way too lonely, you know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Mei propped her chin on her hand and looked at Sandai with a pitiful expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Don't look at me like that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, even if you say that, having just one friend is nothing but pitiable, you know. But, well... Shino-pi can be possessive, and maybe having only a few friends like you, he-pi, is just right," Mei remarked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Mei's words were somewhat on the mark. Shino was the type to continuously check if there were any opposite-sex connections, so it was probably better for Sandai to have few friends. Because he had hardly any friends, he didn't give Shino unnecessary worries.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, I do think sometimes that having few friends is for the best. It spares me from making Shino jealous or anything like that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino-pi can be really scary when she's angry."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino tends to direct her anger toward those around her rather than me when she gets upset. To avoid involving others, I'm pretty careful."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's not just Shino-pi, many girls get angry at those around them rather than their boyfriends. Not that it applies to everyone, but Mei probably does the same. After all, if </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">you complain to your boyfriend, he might not like you anymore... But when you're in a relationship because you fell in love with him, you don't want to be seen as a narrow-minded person. So, it's better to blame it on others..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Girls directing their anger, more like fangs under the guise of anger, at those around them instead of their significant others seemed to be a result of various complex emotions, and it appeared to be quite common.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino-pi, she really doesn't want to be disliked by He-pi, does she?" Mei looked at Sandai with a mischievous glint in her eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's with that expression..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm just wondering what's so appealing about this plain boy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...There's no particular reason. It feels like I just fell in love out of nowhere. But whatever the reason, since Shino chose me, I intend to live up to her expectations."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai affirmed this, Mei lifted one eyebrow and made an expression of interest. However, she immediately snorted with a “hmph.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Not really... Well, I just wish you happiness. Anyway, I have a friend coming over, so see you later."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Mei stood up and headed toward her friends who were gesturing to her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ It looked like she was talking to that boy over there. Do you know him?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Just a bit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Wow, he's quite handsome.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ That plain guy has a girlfriend, after all. Shinopi, the part-timer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Huh? Isn't Shino Yuizaki at the same part-time job as Mei? She's really popular with the boys at our school, too. She had a boyfriend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ It seems they started dating around last fall or so.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Mei is trying to steal Yuizaki's boyfriend...?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ We just happened to meet, and that's not my thing, you know?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ If it were your thing, would you consider taking him?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ It depends on the time and situation. If I really wanted him, I might.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ She's trying to make me feel like a bad woman, but Mei, you have a weak mental, so you'd probably run away if you felt intimidated.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ ...I can't deny that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">What Mei was talking about with her friends was unknown to Sandai, but he didn't need to know. There was no need for him to be concerned about Mei and her surroundings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As they continued talking, Shino arrived. She was dressed in a white blouse and denim overalls, giving off a somewhat plain vibe. Shino's fashion had actually been changing little by little since she started dating Sandai. Initially, she seemed to be more conscious of current trends, but now she placed a stronger emphasis on cleanliness and seasonal appropriateness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">For better or worse, her style seemed to blend in naturally when she was with Sandai. It didn't feel forced, and it appeared that she had adapted to match Sandai's style over time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While she still retained some of her gal-like qualities, it was a balanced mix compared to before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You’re here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I’m ready."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shall we go?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I haven't decided what I'm going to do, so it's going to be random, but as long as it's not too tiring."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Okemaru Suisan."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Okemaru ...... Susan?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino, who was not well-versed in otaku-related internet memes, had no idea about the origin of Sandai's statement and was simply bewildered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">By the way, Sandai knew this would happen and used it deliberately. He found it amusing when Shino was confused because she was cute, and sometimes, he liked to see her like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Using memes that the other person doesn't understand was a mutual thing. Sandai, too, often didn't understand slang that gals frequently used, and when Shino questioned it with a "?", </span>
      <span class="">he</span>
      <span class="c3"> found it amusing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Speaking of which, while I was casually looking for something interesting on my phone, I found this place."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hmm? What kind of place?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"This one."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, that place... Have you been there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah. It wasn't that great."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see... Then how about this one?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">As they leaned on each other, sharing a scarf and strolling at a leisurely pace, they chatted. It was just a glimpse of their everyday life.</span>
    </p>
