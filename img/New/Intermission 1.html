<h2>Digression ①: Mr. Bacteria, You're Slimy, Aren't You?</h2>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Although Sandai's part-time job is cleaning the aquarium, mainly responsible for general cleaning around the premises. He didn't usually deal with much regarding the tanks themselves, but occasionally, he would be asked for assistance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Today was one of those days when he was asked for help. He was tasked with a special cleaning involving draining the water from a large aquarium tank. This timing was chosen because it was after the New Year's holiday and winter break for students, resulting in fewer visitors. The plan had been set in motion around last week, but due to unexpected personal matters, one of the originally planned staff members had to take sudden leave. So, they turned to Sandai to fill in the gap.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Considering the current low number of visitors, both Sandai and Hajime weren't particularly busy. Therefore, without much reluctance, they agreed to help out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Alright then, let's start draining the water. Once it reaches a suitable level, we'll stop the drainage temporarily. At that point, you can go in and use a net to catch the fish" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Got it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Fujiwara-kun works diligently without a single complaint. He gets things done incredibly quickly. As for Saeki-kun... well, he's a bit... yeah..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai continued to silently carry out his instructions like a machine, the male employee who had been giving cleaning instructions saw a figure in the corner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">There was Hajime, sitting girlishly and half-crying. He was not very athletic and had been slipping and falling repeatedly, likely due to his lack of coordination.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ugh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Are you okay? Did you get hurt?" Sandai asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Holding out his hand, Sandai helped Hajime slowly stand up. However, he almost slipped again right away, prompting Sandai to hurriedly support his body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Thanks~! Eww~ It's so slimy~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That sliminess is probably biofilm."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Bio... film?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Bacteria."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Eek~ I don't like bacteria~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Bacteria aren't all bad. Anyway, be more careful."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah... I'll go change for now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Hajime let out a cute sneeze, "Heh-chu," then shuffled awkwardly towards the changing room. As Sandai watched Hajime's back, an indescribable expression crossed his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Hajime's work clothes were clinging to his skin, outlining his body's contours, giving off a distinctly feminine impression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"... Saeki-kun really does look like a girl. By the way, whenever Saeki-kun is in the changing room, everyone inexplicably feels awkward and ends up going outside before he finishes changing," a male employee muttered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The discomfort regarding Hajime wasn't only felt by Sandai; it seemed everyone around was experiencing the same sentiment. Sandai understood their feelings quite well, as he had his own suspicions, so he nodded in agreement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Speaking of which, Fujiwara-kun is really close friends with Saeki-kun, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, we're friends, yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I have to ask, though, is Saeki-kun really a boy?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"He says so himself, and I think he is, but..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Hajime wanted to believe in Hajime's words, but there was a more pressing reason for needing it to be true. Their current friendship was grounded in the fact that they were of the same gender. If, for some reason, Saeki-kun wasn't a boy... various problems and complications would arise. Thus, Sandai preferred not to delve too deeply. As long as he didn't observe it, it would remain nonexistent, much like Schrödinger's cat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If even Fujiwara-kun doesn't know, I doubt anyone else will."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, you're probably right."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai gave a nonchalant response, then continued scrubbing with the deck brush. A few minutes later, Hajime returned after changing his clothes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm back~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Welcome back. Now, let's get back to cleaning."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai made sure to pay extra attention to Hajime's balance to prevent him from falling again as they continued working. The cleaning inside the aquarium went smoothly, transitioning back to the regular maintenance of the facility.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As usual, the scene resembled any typical part-time job—except conversations tended to stray more into personal territory due to the lack of visitors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"By the way, how's your relationship with Yuizaki-san?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's going well."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's pretty impressive that you're able to date someone as intense and jealous as Yuizaki-san without any issues."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, I haven't had any prior experiences, so it might be due to that. Also, I don't mind adjusting for the other person. She's my first girlfriend, and I want to treat her well."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I envy Yuizaki-san."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...You envy her?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah. I also prefer for somebody else to match my pace rather than the other way around. Isn't it enviable to have somebody who's willing to take in and accept everything as their partner?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It seemed Hajime was aware of his somewhat self-centered nature.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">And it was, indeed, true.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Sandai remembered various things about </span>
      <span class="">Hajime</span>
      <span class="c3">. He tended to act on his own whims, reasoning that he wanted to do something. Hajime seemed to want someone who would accept him for that... perhaps.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Well, even if he attempted to predict everything from mundane conversation to underlying emotions, the accuracy of such guesses was dubious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In any case, they returned to their routine work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Their conversation flowed as a casual exchange, and they continued with their assigned tasks.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The sky was clear—no signs of storms—and the wind was gentle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Today was such a day.</span>
    </p>
