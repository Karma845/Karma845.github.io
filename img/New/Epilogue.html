    <h2>Epilogue</h2></a>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The school trip had come to an end, and there were just easy-going classes remaining for the third term. There was not even a month left until spring break arrived. But before the spring break came, there was an important event to be celebrated: White Day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">This event couldn't be handled with the usual response of giving something somewhat appropriate as a return gift. You see, March 14th was, in fact, Shino's birthday. The question was, should Valentine's Day return gifts and birthday presents be kept separate, or should they be combined into one grand present? It was a puzzling dilemma.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">This was a situation where it was best to ask the person herself. It was the most certain way to make sure that she received a present according to her wishes, and the last thing he wanted was to mess this up. But contrary to his wishes, Shino hadn't given any clear hints or requests about what she wanted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—I really appreciate how Sandai put so much thought into it. That's what makes it extra special! After all, it's my birthday present!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">What Shino desired was a "gift that you've picked out and chosen yourself." However, this proved to be quite a demanding request for Sandai</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">...What should I do?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai scratched his head while frowning. For now, he decided to do something about it on March 13th, the day before White Day, when Shino was working part-time and he had the day off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Then, an unexpected visitor shows up on that day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai was racking his brains all morning, the doorbell rang, announcing a visitor. When he checked, he found it was Miki. Sandai rushed to the entrance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hi! Miki's here to play!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Was she a god of salvation or a mischievous demon? Sandai couldn't quite figure out what Miki's real intentions were. Nonetheless, she seemed like the perfect person to consult with about gift selection, and that was exactly what he needed. While Miki had toyed with him about underwear previously, it had ultimately turned out well. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">One didn't need to take everything Miki said at face value, but there was more than enough evidence to consider her advice as reference.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Smiling, Sandai welcomed Miki into the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Miki-chan, what brings you here today? Anyway, it's cold outside, so warm up inside."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Aren't you mad?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"No, not at all. You're her little sister."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"…?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yes, and I'll give you some juice too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai handed her the juice, and Miki twisted her confusion. It seems that she noticed that Sandai was acting strangely.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Juice... you're giving it to me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I am."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Thank you. By the way, it's my onee-chan’s birthday soon..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Indeed."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Miki feels like her onii-chan is having a hard time picking a present... Is she right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"She's right!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"He looks pretty seriously troubled... I can tell by his creepy attitude."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The days go by and there are still a lot of things to worry about and wonder about. Sandai can't understand every detail of Shino's feelings and thoughts. No matter how much he tries to be understanding, he is not Shino himself, so his ability to know what is really going on with Shino is limited.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, this is true for anyone. As the saying goes, children don't know their parents' thoughts, even if they are blood relatives, they may not understand their thoughts. Human emotions, feelings, and hearts are very difficult to understand. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">However, even after knowing this, Sandai did not want to forget that he would try his best to understand it in his own way as a boyfriend. He will spare no effort in making sure that they can both smile and be happy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Today and tomorrow will surely be a happy time -- that's what Sandai had hoped. But things don't always work out that way in the world...but that's story for another time.</span>
