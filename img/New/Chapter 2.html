    <h2>February 1st - February 14th: Let's Be All Lovey-Dovey For Valentine's Day</h2></a>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">１</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">January came to an end, and February arrived. The tranquil flow of everyday life gradually showed signs of liveliness as Valentine's Day approached in mid-February. The two of them, Sandai and Shino, as a couple, naturally found themselves caught up in the Valentine's Day excitement.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">During lunch break, Shino handed Sandai a homemade bento and said, </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, you know, Valentine's Day is coming up soon." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Her face was filled with excitement. Sandai felt the same way as Shino and was also eagerly anticipating Valentine's Day. However, he kept his feelings from showing too much on his face. He wanted to express his overflowing feelings of gratitude and words on the actual day.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Valentine's Day... in two weeks, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Are you giving me chocolate?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Even though he already knew the answer, Sandai still asked the question out loud. Shino smiled mischievously and nodded briefly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah! It's homemade!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, you are good at making sweets."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, it's one of my few brag-worthy hobbies. By the way... since Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday... is it okay if I stay over at your apartment?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">──Spending the night.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai immediately understood the implications of those words. Shino was saying that they could go beyond just spending the night and engage in sexual intimacy. Looking back, they had not had sex since their first experience together on a trip during the winter vacation. He wasn't sure how to initiate such things, and as a guy, he felt awkward about directly bringing it up, fearing it might seem like he was only interested in her body.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino probably saw through these thoughts of Sandai's. She was well aware of his concerns, and that's why she was extending the invitation. Shino had mentioned before </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">that she wanted to become closer. And Sandai had eventually mustered the courage to take things further after that statement. However, if it ended after just one encounter, it wouldn't truly fulfill Shino's desire for them to become "closer." To achieve that, they needed to continue their intimate relationship. At least, that was how Shino saw it. Of course, Sandai was aware of that too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Alright."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai nodded confidently, Shino smiled happily. They kept their voices down so they wouldn't be overheard, but the sweet atmosphere that overflowed from them made their classmates frown. Amid the various glances they received, one of them seemed a bit different. The sender of that gaze was Takasago. She looked at them with a squirrel-like expression, more precisely, she was looking at Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After a brief pause, Takasago approached them with fidgety movements reminiscent of a small animal, and then she spoke to Shino. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, um, ......."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's up?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I have a little favor to ask..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A favor?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai, who was listening nearby, had a pretty good idea of what kind of favor it was. Takasago wanted advice on making homemade chocolate for the Class rep, and she had come to Shino for help.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai had figured this out during the school festival when he saw how disastrously bad Takasago was at cooking and baking. She could barely manage to make cookies, and even then, she needed Shino's guidance to pull it off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Takasago probably wanted to give the Class rep homemade chocolate for Valentine's Day, but she didn't know how to make it. Sandai's guess was spot on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What do you want to ask me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I want you to teach me... how to make chocolate..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"For Valentine's Day?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yes!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You want to give it to the Class rep?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yes!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai gazed at the classroom wall, he thought to himself, </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">I knew it. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He could easily guess what Shino's response would be.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, that's fine, but..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Thank you!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"But if you end up making something weird and it sends him to the hospital, that would be a problem even before any progress in your relationship. I've said this before, but even though I'm not particularly fond of the Class rep, it doesn't mean I want to ruin things between him and Mahiro-chan."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino was generally kind to people of the same gender as long as they didn't make her jealous, and she was good at taking care of others. It was a given that she would agree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, there was one issue.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">I have a feeling about where this is going.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"─Then, Sandai should be there too. As a taste tester."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai sighed, thinking, So it's going to be like this. To be honest, memories of the school festival flashed through his mind, and he wasn't really eager to eat any of the sweets Takasago made.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">But Shino insisted on doing it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">With no other choice but to accept as </span>
      <span class="">she</span>
      <span class="c3"> was his girlfriend, Sandai nodded half-heartedly. Then, somehow, Shino's gal friends gathered around them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Surrounded by gals, Takasago looked surprised, and Shino wore an exasperated expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Sounds fun! I'm coming along to make chocolates."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I don't have any particular guys I want to give them to, though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, maybe you don't, but I do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What!?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Just the other day, a first-year boy was sneakily looking at me, so I asked him, 'Do you like me?' and he looked down."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh no... Wait, did you make him your boyfriend?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Maybe a potential candidate. Well, it's not bad to have someone start liking you, so I might give him some chocolates."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hmm... You're into younger guys, huh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You sound like you're not interested, but you're really into it, like you're going to give him handmade chocolates.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shut up!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Sandai glanced at the Class rep who was studying at his desk. He sneezed and said something like, 'Is someone talking about me?' or something similar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">２</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The day before Valentine's Day this year was a Saturday, and while there was school, both Sandai and Shino had a day off from their part-time jobs, making it a perfect opportunity for chocolate making. After school, they dispersed once and agreed to gather again after each bringing their own ingredients.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, for some reason, the meeting place ended up being Sandai's apartment. This was only communicated to them on the day itself after school. Sandai saw a group of five people along with Takasago gathered at the entrance of the apartment building and beads of sweat formed on his forehead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why are you guys at my house?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai whispered quietly to Shino. In response, Shino began twisting her hair around her finger with a slightly guilty expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's, like, the conversation’s flow just went that way, y'know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"The flow of the conversation...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"My place is pretty far, and I don't want to intrude on Mahiro-chan's place with the whole gal squad. Gonna be pretty awkward for her"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What about your gal friends' places?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I mean, I did throw out the idea of any of us hosting it, but then someone was like, 'I wanna check out Shino's special boyfriend's lovely place,' and you know how it goes..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai was praised and flattered as "Shino's special boyfriend," which seemed to have swayed him into agreeing. It's very much in Shino's style that she becomes more lenient in her judgment when she's complimented. Well, now that it had come to this, there was no helping it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Protesting now would only earn him ridicule from Shino's friends or accusations of being an easily angered boyfriend with no understanding. So, he might as well make the best of it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Whoa... This place is, like, super fancy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Living it up in a swanky spot, huh, Fujiwara?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Mine's a small little house like a pencil, so I totally envy places like this, living in a mansion."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Your dad would seriously shed tears if he heard you say that. Like, he totally busted his butt for the family, even if it's just a regular house."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">I ain't like, dissing him or anything~! I mean, I totally write him a 'thanks, Pops' note every year for his birthday.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Are you, like, in kindergarten or what?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why're you sayin' that? Seriously, I totally love my dad, you know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Looks like your family's on good terms."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"And it turns out, your place is pretty close to my house, Fujiwara."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh? Really? Where?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You see that tower building over there? The penthouse on the top floor of that tower."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...I didn't think you had a rich friend."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What a surprise."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Security is a hassle too, and I thought it would be tiring to invite you over, so I never did, and I lost the chance to say it too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"An issue of crazy wealth gaps between friends' families. On one hand, you've got a shabby tofu shop or a pencil-like house, and on the other, a penthouse on the top floor of a tower..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Penthouses are amazing..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Leaving Sandai and Shino aside, the gal group got a bit too excited and, seemingly influenced by the lively atmosphere, even Takasago joined in the conversation discreetly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino's friends and Takasago didn't seem like they would get along, but when they actually interacted, they could at least have a normal conversation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It's clear that people tend to put up walls on their own and create patterns of not getting along, as it's often the case in the world.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, well, general perceptions and reality sometimes align. This is, for instance, a phenomenon where people, as individuals, become more assertive when part of a group.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Except for Shino, everyone, upon entering Sandai's house, started rummaging around without permission, showing eager interest in various things.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wow, it's pretty spacious. Whoa, this sofa is so fluffy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You're keeping it clean, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Guys usually hide erotic magazines in these kinds of gaps... Wait, I don't see any here."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Maybe it's over here~?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Is it there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"By the way, it's my first time in a boy's room... Oh, look, I've seen this stuffed animal at the arcade!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Before Sandai could get angry about them poking around his place, Shino stepped forward before him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"...Hold on a sec."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was a small voice, almost like a murmur.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Yet, Shino's soft murmur carried a sense of irritation and anger, and everyone sensed it, growing quiet in response.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, I remember now! We came today to make chocolate."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Don't go rummaging around too much."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Right."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's Shino's guy's place, you know? And since it ain't our boyfriends' spot, we should keep it kinda proper."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"So, we mustn't be disrespectful..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Seeing everyone quiet down, Shino apparently thought that there was no need to scold further. She snorted softly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Shino acted like a sensible person, but looking back, she’d also been rummaging through Sandai's house when she first entered.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Not that she was in a position to blame others... Well, pointing that out wouldn't lead to anything good, so keeping quiet was the right move.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Come on, let's get the ingredients out."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Prompted by Shino, each person placed their bought ingredients on the table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Most ingredients seemed fine without any issues, but as Takasago took something out of her bag, everyone's gaze fixated on it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Um, Mahiro-chan?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yes!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well... is it just me, or is there something weird?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why do you have so many cacao beans?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Chocolate is made from cacao, so..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino was taken aback, and even the 5 gals went "!?" in confusion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, only Sandai, who had a hunch that Takasago would bring something strange, remained unfazed, sitting in a chair and gazing into the distance.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Uh, well, you see, you can use chocolate bars and stuff, you know?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"B-But wouldn't that make it impossible to make chocolate...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You melt them! Put the chocolate bars in a bowl and float it in hot water to melt them."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"......"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"For instance, like, what happens if you put chocolate on a warm surface?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It melts... ?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Exactly, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh... I get it now..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Finally, Takasago seemed to catch on.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In the general scheme of things, making chocolate meant not refining raw materials, but melting and remixing ready-made products.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, Takasago, you might be, like, dumber than Shino…..?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh no~ I wouldn't even think of making stuff from cacao beans~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You're probably good at school stuff, though, Takasago."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Natural airhead?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, you don't really give off that vibe, but, well, if you only judge by actions, you seem kinda... airheaded. You don't have that 'acting cute' thing going on, so you don't really come across as an airhead, but your actions are totally in line."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Once again, Sandai sympathized with Shino, as she was surely carrying a heavy burden this time too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">３</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As expected, the chocolate-making process was proving to be extremely challenging, just as Sandai had predicted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Takasago was causing her usual mishaps, and even the gals, who looked down on her with a sigh of "Oh dear," weren't particularly skilled in cooking or making sweets. They messed up quite a bit too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Every time, Shino, in her role as a support, was running around, her eyes spinning with busyness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oops~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Sorry, Yuizaki-san."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"We couldn't really say much about Takasago either. Sorry 'bout that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No harm meant~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai also wanted to help out Shino, but he knew that intervening wouldn't lead to anything good.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sometimes, you need to have the patience to wait quietly for guys to catch up—Sandai sighed internally, conceding this to herself. But Shino seemed to have something on her mind, occasionally giving Sandai a penetrating look.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Hm? What's up?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"N-Nothing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Her eyes seemed to say, "Come on, do something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The sentiment came through painfully clearly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, even if Sandai were to act, it would only add another hindrance and make Shino even busier. No matter how he might be perceived, the right move here was to stay still and not complicate things any further.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">But even so, the piercing glances still made his heart ache, so he decided to take a walk outside for a while.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Until there's a break, I'll just be a hindrance if I stick around. I'll kill some time outside."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Telling Shino this, Sandai stretched and put on his coat. He felt Shino's intense gaze on him, but he pretended not to notice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...He escaped."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While taking in Shino's resentful murmur mixed with frustration, Sandai stepped outside, taking a casual stroll around the nearby area to pass the time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The weather wasn't too bad; there were a few clouds, but the sun was still shining brightly. The slightly warm rays brushed against his skin.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was mid-February, so even though it was still winter, there was a feeling that spring was gradually approaching. Many people seemed to share Sandai's sentiment, as there were many people walking by.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──Tomorrow's Valentine's Day. It's such a hassle to give obligatory chocolates at work. It's totally fine to give them to friends or boyfriends, but giving them to colleagues and bosses is exhausting.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──I get that, but if you're like, "I'm not giving any!" and stuff, won't they say you're being prickly and make the atmosphere awkward?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──True.</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww1.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──Absolutely! But, you know... even if you give them to avoid making things awkward, these guys on White Day might be like, "I totally forgot," and end up not giving anything back. And if they do give something back, it's probably a cheap chocolate bar that's clearly cheaper than what you gave them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──They say triple the return, but honestly, I've never seen a guy actually return triple.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──No matter where I go, it's all about Valentine's... An event that's out of reach for someone like me who's not popular.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──I don't have that connection either. I'm in the same boat. Let's think positively. If you look at it in a good light, you don't have to worry about White Day return gifts, so you could say the economic burden is zero.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──That's true, but I don't like that kind of thinking because it seems like I'm justifying my unattractiveness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">──It's fine to be serious, but if you don't justify your unattractive self once in a while, you'll only damage your mind.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sitting on the steps of a nearby station plaza, Sandai yawned while observing the crowd. With Valentine's Day approaching tomorrow, the conversations of the people passing by were all centered around that topic.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As he sat there, lost in thought without doing much of anything, Sandai noticed that it was about time for Shino and the others to wrap up their chocolate-making session, so he decided to head back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Just then, his phone suddenly rang. Glancing at the caller's name, he saw that it was from his father, Nidai. Sandai tapped to answer the call.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hello?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's been a while. Sorry about that. I've been pretty busy."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"It's fine. I saw you on TV talking about disasters the other day, so I know you must be busy. So...what's with the phone call all of a sudden?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I was just wondering how things were going. You called me before to tell me that you got a ‘gal girlfriend’ right? I was wondering what happened after that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Pretty much normal. We're getting along well."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see. Well, that's good to hear."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Is that all?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, one more thing... How's your teacher Ms. Nakaoka doing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When Nakaoka's name came up, Sandai tilted his head and thought, "Huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ms. Nakaoka...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah. Well, it's not me who's concerned about it; it's your mom. I'm sure she has a lot on her mind."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Perhaps she was worried whether the homeroom teacher was genuinely looking out for her son? Sandai’s parents lived overseas, so they naturally couldn't attend meetings like parent-teacher conferences. This might be why there was no opportunity for his mom to directly talk to Nakaoka and address any concerns.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I guess she's doing fine?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“I see. I’ll tell her that. ...Sorry for calling you out of the blue. I have work to do, too. I'll hang up, then.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">They may have been blunt parents, but the Sandai had gotten used to them. They weren't bad parents by any means. </span>
      <span class="c3">Simply, neither of them have a good sense of personal distance, but Sandai rarely thought of anything such as 'I wish they were closer.' People are different, and that applied to his parents as well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">If they ever tried to bridge the gap from their side or if Sandai wanted that, he just needed to respond without any stubbornness. That's all.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">Now then...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">To check the outcome of Shino and the others' baking efforts, Sandai rushed back to the apartment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">４</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Upon entering the entrance, Sandai was hit with an overpowering, overly sweet chocolate scent, causing him to groan and instinctively press his arm against his nose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">He had a bad feeling about this. The urge to leave immediately welled up within him, but this was his home where he had to return. He couldn't just run away. So, with a sense of trepidation, Sandai cautiously peeked into the kitchen</span>
      <span class="c3">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">There, Shino, Takasago, and the other gals were all sprawled around, groaning in exhaustion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ugh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Just making chocolate, and yet, why..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"We tried so hard..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"So tired..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Baking is more complicated than it seems..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Heh... heh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Although making chocolate by melting and solidifying it sounded simple enough, without prior experience, getting the proportions of salt and plums and the texture right seemed to have been a struggle, resulting in this disastrous scene.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai quietly sighed, Shino weakly got up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"You're finally back... my useless boyfriend..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">There was a hint of bitterness in Shino's voice. Sandai could sense that she wasn't truly angry, but he didn't know what might set her off, so he just chuckled awkwardly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Then, Shino extended a plate containing several chocolates.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's this?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"The finished products. The safe ones."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Shino urged him to taste them, Sandai took a bite as she offered. Each one was perfectly balanced—not overly sweet or bitter. Among them, the baked chocolate had a satisfying crunch and texture, surpassing the quality of store-bought options.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Delicious."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I taught them thoroughly, after all."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Thoroughly….. that's why everyone ended up collapsing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino also had an elaborate, or rather, inflexible stubbornness. That was why she seemed to have taught them without compromise until they reached a level where she could accept it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Only the wrapping remains, so let's do that together?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">For this task, Sandai could contribute as well. He followed Shino's instructions and carefully wrapped each piece, ensuring they maintained their shape.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When all the work was done, evening had fully set in outside. Takasago, along with the gals, left one by one, holding the wrapped chocolates. They mentioned having successfully made them and that it was time to head back.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Left behind, Sandai and Shino started to clean up the mess.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"They left without a hitch, but am I crazy to think that I should help them clean up too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Not at all. I was thinking the same."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Right?."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, that's how they are. We kinda have to go with the flow. Plus, Mahiro-chan and the others are busy thinking about who to give these to."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"She's probably going to give them to the Class rep. Hopefully, things progress."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Think about it – the Class rep might be all like, 'Huh? You made these for me?' even if he's a bit thrown off at first."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You're making fun of him, aren't you, ......?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, I don't like him."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino bluntly stated that she disliked him. However, it didn't mean she would go and try to harass him. This aspect of her personality showed her inherent seriousness. As long as Sandai didn't get involved, she was able to keep “things separate”.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's one of Shino's good points not to belittle someone just because she doesn't like them. She knows how to make a distinction."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Do you think so?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino tilted her head in confusion. Apparently, she wasn't fully aware of her own good traits. Well, many people are better at recognizing good qualities in others than in themselves. Shino had that aspect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I prefer you not being artificially sweet, though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I don't really get it, but if you like me being around, that's all that matters. By the way... I've made chocolates for Valentine's Day tomorrow too. Take a look."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When Shino opened the refrigerator, there was a container that looked like a pot and was unfamiliar to Sandai. Shino explained that she had brought it herself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">Inside this... is there chocolate? But would chocolate usually be placed in a container like this? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Feeling curious, Sandai slowly reached out to check inside. Suddenly, Shino slapped his hand away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's a surprise for tomorrow!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"R-Right..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Don't look inside without permission, okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was supposed to be something to look forward to on Valentine's Day. Well, it was not like he had to wait for several days, just one day. Sandai wasn’t a kid, so waiting normally wasn’t a problem. With that, they continued with the cleanup.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Due to the repeated mishaps caused by Takasago and the other gals, the place was quite a mess. It was already past 8 in the evening when they finally managed to clean up everything.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Since they were having a sleepover tomorrow, Sandai gave Shino a ride home today. Along the way, they realized they hadn't had dinner and settled for a quick meal at a nearby restaurant.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Chu... um, I'll save that for tomorrow!" Shino was apparently holding back her "love you lots" for tomorrow's sleepover and seemed to be refraining from being overly affectionate today as they stood in front of her tofu shop.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino had unconsciously adjusted her emotions to enjoy the affectionate atmosphere during events like this. Adjusting emotions may sound complicated, but it's actually something everyone naturally does. Just like looking forward to savoring pudding later when it's hidden in the fridge or deciding to read that book you've been curious about when you have the time to immerse yourself in it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">These actions are part of our everyday habits, performed unconsciously. In other words, they signify that Sandai had become an integral part of Shino's daily life.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hm... oh, Shino's back, huh? Did Fujiwara-kun drop you off? Sorry to always be a bother."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The store door rattled open, and Daigo stepped out. Despite it being nighttime, he was wearing a light work uniform. However, he didn't seem bothered by the cold at all, scratching his head without a hint of shivering.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino visibly frowned when Daigo showed up. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Y-You don't have to look so disgusted... When you sent me home, if it were just me or Neko, we would always greet each other. Why today, of all days?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Clearly, Shino's annoyance was because she felt her quality time with her boyfriend on the eve of Valentine's Day was interrupted. But Daigo didn't seem to have thought that far.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, when adults start families and homes, they often become less involved in such events, so it's not really Daigo's fault.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Slightly digressing, when Sandai took a proper look at Daigo's face, he was slightly surprised. When they had first met, Daigo's face was swollen beyond recognition from bruises, making it hard to see his features. But looking at him now, he had a </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">well-proportioned face of a good-looking young man. Sandai noticed he resembled Miki. No, it's not that Daigo resembles Miki; it's more like Miki resembles Daigo.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ugh! Dad, can't you read the room?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Read the room? I just noticed there was some conversation happening at the entrance and wondered if someone was coming back soon... Am I at fault here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Totally!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Right, right. By the way, Fujiwara-kun, if you have some time before your train, you should come inside and pass the time. I'll even give you some atsuage as a souvenir for the ride back."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I don't need atsuage!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Intervening in a parent-child argument is tricky, but the relationship with the Yuizaki family is generally good, so pretending not to notice would be awkward too. Sandai decided to calm them down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Come on, both of you, let's settle down. I like atsuage too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"See, Fujiwara-kun likes it too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You're just being considerate! Get a clue!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Despite Sandai's attempt to mediate, Daigo jumped onto Sandai’s rescue ship in a strange way, which only agitated Shino even more. Sandai was puzzled over what to do when Neko arrived from the back and pulled Daigo's ear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What are you doing?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ne...Neko..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Why are you </span>
      <span class="">almost fighting</span>
      <span class=""> with our daughter right in front of her boyfriend? You know that would make Fujiwara-kun uncomfortable, right? </span>
      <span class="">You want to stand by Shino's side, but don't you think about what to do if it makes a bad impression on him?"</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww2.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"..." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After being admonished by Neko, Daigo visibly deflated and retreated indoors. Shino continued to give Daigo a stern look, though it wasn't a sign of dislike. Her anger was directed at him, not born from a feeling of hatred.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm sorry about that," </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Neko apologized, and Sandai hastily waved his hands to convey that he wasn't bothered. Neko then glanced at Shino discreetly, confirming she wasn't looking their way, and whispered softly in Sandai's ear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Tomorrow, Shino is staying over, right? Daigo-san doesn't know, but I'll make sure to mislead him nicely."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Just one thing, though. Please promise me one thing—make sure to use protection."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When someone's parents bring up sexual matters, it's an indescribably embarrassing topic to touch. However, the meaning behind what was being said was clear to Sandai as well.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It's only natural for young adults to become curious about the opposite sex's bodies as they grow older, even more so given their age. However, they're still students. If an unintended pregnancy were to happen, it would be a difficult situation for both Shino and Sandai, given their current circumstances. The message behind "use protection" was to ensure that they engage in their romantic relationship in a healthy and responsible manner.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Blushing slightly, Sandai nodded and said, "Yes," to which Neko responded with a pleased smile.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">As Daigo's figure disappeared from view, Shino finally turned their way, not fully grasping the situation, and tilted her head with a "?" expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">５</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Valentine's Day—Sunday.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Today, both Sandai and Shino had shifts in the morning. The plan was to meet up in the afternoon and spend some alone time together. As Sandai went about his usual work routine alongside Hajime, the end of his shift came unexpectedly quickly. Sandai hurriedly changed and bowed his head in farewell within the office.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well then, I'll head off..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">But just as he was about to leave, he was stopped by Komaki and Hajime, who were also finishing their shifts.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ah, wait a moment, Sandai!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wait up, Fujiwara-kun."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai turned around, Komaki handed him a small pink bag, and Hajime presented a white box adorned with a red ribbon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"This is……..?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai looked like a pigeon that had been hit by a peashooter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's Valentine's Day today, so chocolates! Special ones just for you!" Hajime said with a smile. Following that, Komaki let out a small sigh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I've prepared chocolates too because it's Valentine's Day. I'm giving them to everyone."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It seemed both of them had prepared chocolates for Valentine's Day. However, while it was clear that Komaki's gesture was a thoughtful consideration due to her position, Sandai couldn't quite fathom why Hajime had given him chocolates.</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww3.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai stared at him in suspicion, Hajime crossed his arms behind his back and attempted a not-so-masterful whistle. "Nowadays, it's common for guys to exchange 'friend chocolates' too, you know~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Was that really the case? Doubts couldn't be easily brushed aside, yet, with no means to verify the truth. Since Hajime was pretty much the only friend he had at work, </span>
      <span class="c3">Sandai decided to take it at face value, as everything would fall into place that way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Hajime had said it was “special only for Sandai,” but this must have meant “at work.” Since Sandai was his only friend at work, he automatically became a special person at work.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Thank you, Komaki-san. And Saeki too!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai expressed his gratitude with a carefree smile and as soon as he left the office, he snuck a piece of chocolate into his mouth and down into his stomach. If Shino found out, it would be a big problem, so he put the rest away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Komaki's gift was an assortment of candy-like chocolate candies, while Hajime's was a high-end brand of chocolate. Komaki's chocolate candy was familiar to Sandai’s taste buds, while Hajime's luxury brand chocolate had a deeper flavor that he did not usually enjoy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Anyway, the main event was about to start. Sandai entered Shino's workplace, a cafe, and was led to his seat by one of the female staff members.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Here you go~ Right this way~"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Thank you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, and since it's Valentine's Day, your boyfriend perk is a bit fancier today~!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Today's boyfriend perk seemed to align with the prevailing holiday trends, as a slice of chocolate cake was presented. A single bite revealed the fluffy texture of the cake and a pronounced sweetness that tickled his palate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">Delicious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, having just eaten the chocolates from Hajime and Komaki a while ago, Sandai was starting to feel a bit nauseous after finishing the boyfriend perk. Considering he still had Shino's chocolates waiting in his fridge at home, he began to worry about the state of his stomach.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Well, that was probably just a needless worry.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Instead of heading straight home, Sandai thought it might be a good idea to include a short stroll in their date plans. A bit of fresh air and a leisurely walk might ease his slightly nauseous stomach. He casually gazed out the window. Being Valentine's Day and a Sunday, the street was bustling with couples.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Whether the passing couples were already lovers or had mustered the courage to ask someone out for this special day, Sandai couldn't discern. But most of them were thinking the same thing Sandai was thinking about making out with Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After taking a sip of tea, Sandai exhaled lightly with a "Phew," causing the window to fog up slightly. Despite the heated interior of the café, this phenomenon occasionally occurred. For no particular reason, Sandai used his finger to draw an umbrella shape on the foggy glass, inscribing his and Shino's names beneath it. He attempted to create what was known as a "sharing umbrella."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Though a rather childish play on words, it still made him smile, and his cheeks relaxed in response. "What are you doing?" Startled, Sandai turned around to find Shino, who had finished her shift and changed into casual clothing. "Oh, it's nothing." He wiped the window glass with his sleeve, erasing the sharing umbrella. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Were you drawing something on the window glass?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh? I wasn't drawing anything." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I caught a glimpse of something, you know! What were you drawing? Tell me!" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino persisted, but Sandai held firm with a "secret." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why won't you tell me?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I wonder why." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Meanie!" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Puffing her cheeks like a chipmunk, Shino expressed slight annoyance rather than genuine anger. However, pushing further might trigger her anger, so Sandai decided not to press on and got up from his seat. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, it looks like your shift is over too, Shino. Shall we head out soon? Going straight to the apartment might be a bit plain, so how about a short stroll for our date?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Are you trying to change the subject?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, I am. Can you let it slide? Do you dislike the idea of a stroll date?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...I don't dislike it, but..." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">When Sandai took Shino's hand, Shino squeezed it back while complaining. Apparently, she was willing to be swept away as Sandai had requested.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">６</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Their leisurely stroll date held no particularly exciting elements. They walked casually, took breaks here and there, and wandered into random commercial establishments to pass the time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Some might find this mundane, but there were countless ways to experience a relationship. Sandai wasn't seeking a roller-coaster style of romance, and Shino seemed to appreciate their laid-back time together. Of course, for special occasions or when they felt like creating lasting memories, they would engage in different activities. Flexibility was key.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Before they knew it, the evening had arrived. Sandai's previous stomach discomfort had subsided, and as the temperature grew cooler, they decided it was time to head back to the apartment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It tends to get chilly in the evenings."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"There was a tiny bit of snow a few days ago."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, it was lightly falling. Well, it turned into rain pretty quickly, though."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Speaking of snow, our school trip spot got switched to Hakodate. I wonder if it's, like, all snowy over there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Who knows? We'll find out once we get there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Casually bringing up the topic of the impending school trip, Sandai realized that he had forgotten to buy something and stopped by a convenience store.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What are you buying?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Just a little something."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai headed to a section of the store where they stocked male cosmetics and bandages, but what he was looking for wasn't there. It seemed that certain convenience stores carried them while others didn't. Since he couldn't distinguish which stores had them, he decided to search online using his smartphone. He found information suggesting that it would be better to visit a drugstore, as they would surely have what he needed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Indeed, it was something that should definitely be available at a drugstore. With that in mind, Sandai stopped by a nearby pharmacy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, Sandai."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hm?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You know, I noticed you went into the convenience store, looked a bit puzzled, and left without grabbing anything. And now you're here in the pharmacy section... What's up? What are you looking to pick up?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Condoms."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It wasn't something he needed to hide, so Sandai straightforwardly revealed his intent. Shino blinked slowly in response, then mumbled, "I see," before looking ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Shino was the one who had suggested the idea of staying over for Valentine's Day, and perhaps because it was a statement that she had originally made with a certain degree of preparedness, she didn't appear flustered in the least.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, upon closer inspection, Sandai noticed a slight blush tinting Shino's ears, and her face was still turned to the side. It's really important to use protection. Shino's mom, Neko, also emphasized the importance of contraception, and besides, if anything were to happen, it's Shino who would face difficulties.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">To avoid burdening Shino, it was crucial to properly use contraceptives. And so, He arrived at the section with condoms on display. There seemed to be various options, but He opted for a thicker one to ensure it doesn't break. Some products boasted about their thinness, but it's not worth risking unexpected incidents just for a momentary pleasure.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Keeping his gaze focused on the items in front of him to avoid eye contact with the store staff, he paid for his purchase, received the condoms in a paper bag, and quickly exited the store.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Generally, buying contraceptives is a normal thing, and was no need to be overly conscious of others' judgment. That's why the store staff handled it like a routine business. Well, this kind of fumbling is something many people experience until they get used to it. Someday, Sandai would probably look back on these moments fondly, reminiscing about how naive he was. Until then, it was best to savor the bittersweet emotions and sensations. It wasn’t sure whether Sandai had realized it or not.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">７</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As soon as they entered Sandai’s' house, Shino checked the contents of the container that held the chocolates in the refrigerator and, for some reason, started warming them up in the microwave. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">Why is she heating up chocolates?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Confused, Sandai stared at her with a puzzled expression. Within a short span of about ten to twenty seconds, the microwave beeped. Wearing oven mitts, Shino removed the container from the microwave and placed it on the table.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Just to clarify, that... is chocolate, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why did you warm it up in the microwave?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's just something I do."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino opened the lid of the container, revealing the chocolate now gooey and melted. Sandai's confusion deepened. Next, Shino opened the vegetable compartment of the refrigerator and pulled out strawberries and bananas. Sandai rarely looked inside the vegetable compartment, and he was pretty sure it was empty. Seeing items in there felt strange, and he couldn't help but silently gaze at Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"....."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"W-Why that expression? Oh, wondering about the fruits? I bought them when we made the chocolates yesterday. I secretly sneaked them in."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Whether it was everyday items or stuffed toys won at the arcade, Shino seemed to make herself at home in Sandai' place, and it appeared that the refrigerator wasn't an exception. Feeling a need to emphasize their private space away from family, a sentiment common among couples, Sandai instinctively understood Shino's feelings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was something he needed to tolerate to some extent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You can totally have any of the treats without names. And for the stuff I'm saving for myself, I'll make sure to label them with my name."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I guess I'll start labeling things that are exclusively mine too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Though they hadn't established many rules between them yet, as they gradually added more, the risk of forgetting them seemed inevitable. So, Sandai quickly jotted down the rule of naming their food on a piece of paper and stuck it to the wall.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh? What did you stick there?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I put up a paper with rules we agreed on so we don't forget. I tend to forget stuff too, so it helps."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see... that makes sense. It'll be helpful, I sometimes let things slip too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">There was still plenty of blank space left on the paper.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As more and more rules pile up, it's gonna get to the point where they won't fit on just one paper... Sandai thought, trying to keep them a bit loose so it doesn't become too strict and unbearable. But that's a tale for another time.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">The melted chocolate and the fruits... What exactly is Shino planning to do with them? </span>
      <span class="c3">Sandai pondered for a moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Then, Shino impaled a strawberry with a fork and half-dipped it into the chocolate before sticking it into Sandai' mouth.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Here you go."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Whoa..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hehe, that's how you eat it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">For Sandai, who always thought of chocolate as something solid, this method of eating was an eye-opener. The sweet scent of chocolate was about to trigger another wave of stomach discomfort, but the refreshing taste of the fruit canceled it out, making it surprisingly easy to eat. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">This way of dipping the fruit made it simple to adjust the amount, and even those who are not fond of sweet foods can enjoy it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Say 'aah'."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Shino fed Sandai, so the food made its way to Sandai's mouth without him doing anything. However, just letting Shino do it wasn't in Sandai's nature, so he tried to return the favor.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Here, 'aah'."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Nom nom."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"First time I've seen someone say 'nom nom' out loud while eating."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"C-Cute, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Way too cute."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You don't like it when I'm being cute?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It really depends on who does it. If some other girl did it, I’m sure I would be weirded out, but when you do it, Shino, I quite like it," </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">they exchanged banter. Meanwhile, Sandai noticed a smudge of chocolate at the corner of Shino's mouth. It seemed to have gotten there during the "aah" moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oops, looks like a bit of chocolate got on the corner of your mouth when you did the 'aah'."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh? Oh, you're right."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'll wipe it off for you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai tried to wipe it off with a nearby handkerchief, but Shino stopped them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No wiping!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why not..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Not wiping, but cleaning it up in a different way...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Seeing Shino close her eyes and understanding what she was implying, Sandai decided to go along with her desired method to get rid of the chocolate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With a gentle kiss, Sandai cleaned the corner of Shino's mouth. Then, Shino's shoulders trembled slightly, and they slowly lifted their eyelids.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino's eyes were glistening, and their heartbeats seemed unsteady. They took shallow breaths repeatedly. They stared at each other in silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was Shino who snapped out of it first. In a fluster, they hastily grabbed a nearby plush toy and handed it to Sandai.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A plush toy...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With a blush coloring their cheeks, Shino covered their face with both hands and said,</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Sex…It's a signal that 'It's okay.' But there are times when it's not possible due to my period or how I'm feeling physically. And sometimes, even if I hint at it with an gesture, you might not get it. So, when I give you a plush toy like this, it means 'It's okay today.'"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Unlike boys, girls can't just have sex whenever they want. Their physical condition is influenced by their period, causing fluctuations, and they may experience mental instability before and after the cycle, depending on the individual.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It's not something they can control at will; it's just the way their bodies are structured, and they have to accept it. However, conveying this every time is challenging and burdensome for girls. On the other hand, there is a limit to how much the boys can understand by the atmosphere.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While Sandai was more perceptive for a boy, he still had his imperfections. Recognizing this, Shino came up with a method to convey her feelings accurately, using the plush toy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Got it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When Sandai agreed, Shino nodded repeatedly with her face still covered by her hands. Her courage reached its limit here, and from this point on, it was Sandai's turn to take action.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He embraced Shino tightly, causing her to exclaim in surprise. She quickly wrapped her arms around his back and before she knew it, she resembled a koala clinging to a tree.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"There, there."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Aw~! Usually, I'm the one treating you like a baby, but now it's the other way around~!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"In bed, it's my way of showing tenderness, like when I play with a baby. It's my message to you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Babubabu! Babubab!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You're really turning into a baby."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Even though you've done the same..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"How was it? I don't remember."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You were saying 'babubabu' too. Actually, I'll take a bath and get all clean first."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, let's go in together"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Sure..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The second time they got intimate after bathing together felt less tense than the first, yet they were still exploring. However, they made sure to approach this with care and empathy, understanding it as one of the ways to strengthen their bond through communication.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Losing sight of this sentiment would lead to becoming mere beasts driven by lust. While some might drown in their raging desires, Sandai wasn't that kind of guy. His overwhelming feeling was a pure desire to touch Shino out of love.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">８</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm exhausted!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That took a lot more stamina than I expected."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After the deed was done, the two of them were back in the bath, washing each other's bodies. They could have just fallen asleep right there, but they decided to take another bath since they had sweated quite a bit.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino settled between Sandai's legs, leaning her back against him. In this position, Shino's head was right near Sandai's nose. From Shino's neck, he could smell that familiar scent of a girl he had sensed before. Without thinking, he leaned closer, making her neck tingle. In a hurry, Shino covered her neck with her hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No way! Even if I might still be a little sweaty... why are you smelling me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino's sweat smells nice."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If you were talking about how my skincare stuff smells nice, I'd totally love it. But when it's my own body scent..... It's kinda embarrassing."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Though she didn't seem too upset, Shino still showed a slight sign of discomfort, prompting Sandai to retreat quietly. Not fully grasping what was wrong was a result of the skewed sense of normalcy he had developed during his loner days.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Putting aside those thoughts, Shino was a considerate girl who often adapted to Sandai. Therefore, a few seconds later, after she let out a faint growl, she said,</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww4.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Being sniffed is a bit awkward, but if you really like my scent that much, well... you can take a sniff if you want," she said, giving him permission to sniff her.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, Sandai knew that he should not accept this at face value. This was more of a "It's okay as long as I'm mentally prepared" kind of "okay." It also carried the undertone of "sniff casually, not like a pervert." So, keeping all that in mind, Sandai wanted to make sure he got it right. Understanding these unspoken agreements was challenging, yet Sandai found it somewhat enjoyable. But of course, that was because he was deeply in love with Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Now, as they settled into bed together and fell asleep while flirting a bit, they woke up to find that, the next day, Monday had arrived. Opening his eyes, Sandai noticed that Shino was no longer next to him. He didn't need to search, as he quickly realized where she was. Rubbing his eyes, he made his way to the kitchen, where he found Shino busy preparing breakfast.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"〜〜♪"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">She had changed into her uniform and tied an apron around herself, giving off the aura of a gal wife one might find in fictional works. Well, it was not entirely off the mark... </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Regardless, Sandai had no intention of disturbing her cooking, so he quietly took a seat and watched Shino's back without any particular activity. While he hadn't been staring with intense focus, Shino eventually noticed and turned around.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Sleepyhead-kun, you finally woke up?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I wouldn't call it oversleeping exactly... Good morning."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hehe, good morning. Just wait a sec, I'm almost done."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As instructed by Shino, Sandai patiently waited. Breakfast was ready in a matter of minutes, and a neatly arranged sandwich and a creatively plated salad were placed on the table. Even if one observed Shino's packed lunch-making routine, it was evident that she never took shortcuts when cooking. Her feelings of wanting to please him and her genuine enjoyment of cooking, including baking, came across through her attitude.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In the beginning, Sandai might have felt guilty about these actions, but he had grown beyond that. These were things Shino genuinely wanted to do. There was no need to interfere or dampen her enthusiasm. However, he always made sure to convey his gratitude.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Thanks."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">With just that one word, he wanted to express his appreciation. Shino beamed and responded cheerfully, "You're welcome!"</span>
