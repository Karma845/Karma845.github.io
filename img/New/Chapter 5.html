<h2>March 2nd - March 6th: Love Is Different For Everyone</h2></a>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">１</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Bathed in the warmth of the rising sun, Sandai woke up. It was the last day of the school trip, a whole day of free exploration to enjoy Hakodate as part of the "learning experience."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yawn..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai let out a yawn, Umeda, who was slightly late in waking up, rubbed his eyes and stared at Sandai with a strangely serious expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What's up?" Sandai asked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda lowered his head and muttered, "Fujiwara,......, I've been thinking a lot about it, and I wasn't sure whether or not to tell you,...... but I have a little favor to ask you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A favor?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"After breakfast, and if possible, with Yuizaki too, would you listen to what I have to say?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shino too?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah. I think having Yuizaki's cooperation would be helpful in various ways..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai had no idea what kind of cooperation Umeda was talking about, but he could sense the gravity of the situation. So, he agreed to listen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After breakfast, Sandai and Shino joined Umeda on his request. Umeda bent over at a right angle and lowered his head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Please! I’m begging you! Be my love Cupid!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai was baffled by what he was saying, and Shino shared the same puzzled expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wait, ...... what?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What ...... did he suddenly say?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I don't fully understand, but if you two help me, I have a feeling things will work out. I just have that feeling!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda had revealed that he expected some kind of "good-luck charm" effect by getting cooperation from Sandai and Shino, who were a loving couple.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I have a girl I like!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ah, I see."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Y-Yeah, give it your best shot!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Don't say it as if it's someone else's business! Please, help me!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">While it sounded like a "random request" or more precisely, just someone else's problem for Sandai and Shino, Umeda was clearly in a desperate situation. Sandai exchanged a glance with Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What should we do?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What do you mean... Hmm..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I don't know much about Umeda myself, but I get the feeling that he's the type to not give up even if you say no."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Well, I don't mind helping out with Sandai if he's with me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm okay with helping a bit, too"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The two of them weren't reluctant to cooperate. The problem was whether they could really achieve good results by working together.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"There's a chance that our involvement might worsen the situation rather than bring you closer. What we think is good could backfire"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, that's true"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I can't confidently say it will work out for sure... We're quite unique ourselves, so our experiences might not be relevant"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In this situation, it was best not to get too involved. However, ignoring a crying male student who looked miserable would also leave a bad taste.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, it ultimately depends on what Shino wants to do"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A-Are you throwing it all at me?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I don't know how other girls feel, other than Shino. If Shino doesn't want to do it, there's nothing I can do. So I'll leave the decision to you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see….Nyaa"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai understood that Shino's playful cat-like ending is only somewhat without meaning or intention, so he makes a cat's paw to fit the groove without pointing it out.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“Nyaa…..”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When Sandai spoke the appropriate cat language, Shino also made a cat's paw with a “Nyaa” sound</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">
        “Unya~!”
        <br/>
        “Nya nya!”
      </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">This exchange was much more embarrassing for anyone watching than the two who were doing it. As they continued, Umeda, who had been watching their cat gestures from the side, turned bright red and looked down in embarrassment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...So that's what boyfriends and girlfriends do, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda seemed to have instilled some strange stereotypes about relationships, but in reality, there were no fixed rules or standards when it came to romantic relationships. The most important thing was to find the right balance for the people involved. If feelings didn't align properly, then even if a couple started dating, they would eventually break up.With that in mind, Sandai signaled Shino for a response. Shino shrugged and said, </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Don’t you think it's okay to help out a little?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">If Shino was willing, Sandai had no reason to refuse, so he conveyed their approval to Umeda. Umeda happily grasped the hands of Sandai and joyously repeated, “Thank you!”. Then suddenly, Umeda was kicked by Shino.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Geh!!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hands off other people's boyfriends."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"B-But, even though we’re both guys..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I don't give a shit! But if you pull that stunt again, I’m totally not helping you,"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Y-Yes..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">It didn’t seem to change the fact that Shino was jealous even of men, and before they knew it, her expression had turned icy cold. Umeda's posture, kneeling while clutching his lower abdomen, reminded Sandai of the class rep during the school festival. Sandai wished he had stopped it before it happened, but he had also told Umeda about Shino's personality on the very first day. Sandai was also caught off guard, thinking that he wouldn't make a mistake like this, and his reaction was delayed. </span>
      <span class="">For now, Sandai clasped his hands together in his mind and prayed for the best as he said 'Amen'</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">２</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"So, who is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If you don't know which girl you like, you won't be able to get anywhere."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Um... that girl over there... um, what was her name? She's one of Yuizaki's gal friends..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda pointed to one of Shino's gal friends, who was sipping a drink from Starbucks with a cheerful laugh, without any hint of travel vibes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Up until now, Sandai had never cared about the characteristics of Shino’s friends, but the gal in question had tanned skin the color of wheat, and she was a cheerful, slightly tall girl</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ah, that's Manami"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was the first time Sandai learned the name of one of Shino's friend, but he didn't anticipate having many opportunities to interact with her in the future. Therefore, he figured there was no need to remember her name.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, Manami! She's actually pretty nice!" Umeda exclaimed.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Totally, like, for sure! She's got good common sense. She can totally step in and keep the peace when things get heated."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That's right! She's so kind! She actually helped me with my work during the school festival, saying, 'You look like you're having a hard time,' and that's why I thought she liked me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Umeda spoke with excitement, but Sandai had a hunch that the reason Manami had helped was probably </span>
      <span class=" c15">“she had to”</span>
      <span class="">. Sandai found it hard to believe that Shino's friend was such an auspicious person who would help out “because she loves him.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">From the perspective of Sandai who knew that he was one of the group that often took such actions, like dragging Sandai around under the pretense of “remodelling” in the Legion, or using people’s houses without permission to make chocolate, it was extremely questionable where the “kind” element was coming from.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda was undoubtedly having some serious misunderstandings, but Sandai couldn't blame him. He was at that age, after all. The mid-teens are a time when even a small interaction can lead to misunderstandings. However, such a momentum is not something that can be taken for granted. A small incident can be the trigger that leads to a successful relationship.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai and Shino had started dating without a big reason, and their story could be considered a similar success story. However, in a sense, luck was also a huge factor. Many elements played into whether the gears turned smoothly, including their personalities, circumstances, and the timing of their push-and-pull. Whether the distance betweem Manami and him would get closer depended on how well they could adjust the gears.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"So, like, what you're saying is... you think she’s got a thing for you just 'cause she pitched in at the school festival?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Exactly!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Totally making some sweet presumptions there, huh?...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino firmly crushed Umeda's hopes, revealing her intention to set him straight to avoid any strange fantasies.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"P-Presumtions?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yep. Manami isn't the type to help because she likes someone; if anything, she's the kind who'd get nervous and dodge the person she likes. She'd even have trouble having a conversation."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"So, if she was keeping her distance when she helped me, that might've been because she liked me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda began to cling to the idea. He needed to understand the situation first, but he was getting farther away from it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai felt that it would be better to go along with Shino's direction and let him see the reality of the situation, so he decided to back her up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Maybe it wasn't that she was avoiding you because she liked you, but rather, she found your intense gaze unsettling."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I wasn't…. giving such intense looks…."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Didn't you keep staring at her? You unconsciously read her interest in you from observing her gestures, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"When you put it that way... I guess I was staring at her quite a bit."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"See, I knew it. Isn't that the reason? If someone stares at you like that, it can make you feel uncomfortable, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wait…what the heck!... why are you blaming me like this when I asked for help?!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda began to get indignant, perhaps feeling that Sandai's tone was a bit harsh. Still, it was crucial to get the point across. If possible, Shino would be the best person to explain from a girl's perspective, but she was glaring at Umeda as if he were trash, so that wasn't going to happen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Well, it was probably partly because Shino wasn’t good with boys to begin with, but in any case, Sandai decided to repeat the explanation over and over again. Umeda’s face was bright red, as if it was about to burst into flames, but as Sandai spoke to him politely and admonishing him, his anger eventually cooled down and he came to terms with it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see. I guess it was me who was acting all weird. I get it now."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm glad you understand."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"But then what should I do? This unrequited love is painful, isn't it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"It doesn't matter if it's painful or not, all you have to do is try your best to get her to like you. Now that you've realized what's wrong with you, don't you think all you have to do is fix it and make her like you?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Manami…..what kind of guy does she like?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai couldn't possibly know that, so this was Shino's time to shine. However, she seemed really annoyed to Umeda's actions from earlier, which was evident in her displeased expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"For some reason, I don't like sending weird guys like this to my friends...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai could somewhat understand her sentiment. If he considered the situation from Shino's perspective, regardless of the actual facts, she was essentially sending a guy to her friend as a potential boyfriend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It’d be one thing if he was a boy whom they could send them off with pride, but Umeda’s personality was childish, or worse, a difficult one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">There's no point in feeling bad about it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, even though it was a spur-of-the-moment situation, they had already agreed to help. Shino was also caught between the two sides of the board, going back on that now would only make things worse. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Well, Umeda seemed to have reflected on his actions, and had shown that he was willing to correct his mistakes and change.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">That should be acknowledged.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Everyone makes mistakes, and if it's something one has no experience with, it can't be helped that he’s not good at dealing with it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Besides, Shino isn't admirable enough to say anything about Umeda either. She had tried forcefully kissing Sandai before they had started dating, and if one just looks at her actions, Shino was pretty much the same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino herself seemed to be aware of the mistakes and stampedes she had made for her first time having those feelings, and eventually reluctantly began giving Umeda advice.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Manami's usually the coordinator, so making solo decisions isn't her thing. That's why I think she's into guys who can, like, take charge and lead the way."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What exactly should I do?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"So, like, when we go out to eat, Manami often puts her own preferences on the backburner to make sure everyone's happy. You think you could pick up on that and choose something she'd enjoy?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Got it. You mean I should ask her preferences and be assertive, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Noo!, being perceptive is the way to go. It's all about making the right choice without even asking."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Even if you asked and she answered, she might still feel like she pushed you to ask. Manami's got her own way of thinking, and she could end up feeling down on herself."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, I see..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“Some girls don't care, but Manami does, ‘kay?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“.....”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“Manami does that thing where she checks out stuff she wants or food she's into, so keep an eye out for those subtle hints. Just be all natural about it so dosen’t even notice.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino had said this casually, assuming that it can be done easily, but this was quite unreasonable. Umeda also had a look of despair on his face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino's reason for presenting such a challenging request was likely her misunderstanding of the "things that a boy can do," which is based on her perception of Sandai.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Sanadai, after all, had done things that most boys couldn't do. However, Shino didn't fully understand this. She instinctively knew that Sanadai had a high level of perception, but it was vague. She had no concrete knowledge of the extent of Sanadai's perceptiveness.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, it would be cruel to blame Shino, who was in an environment where the only boy she knew was her boyfriend Sandai, and she had nothing to compare him to.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">People who are told to measure something without a ruler and could measure it perfectly were either very smart or geniuses. Unfortunately, Shino wasn’t a genius, she wasn’t smart, and she was actually an idiot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">So, It was unavoidable for her to think that an average boy could probably do about 80% of what Sandai could do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The day will come when Shino will realize that the majority of boys in the world could not do even half of what Sandai could do. But even so, Umeda was dismayed by the difficult and demanding requests that had been thrust upon him, but he nodded reluctantly, as if he wanted to do it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“Okay, I'll figure it out!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That whole 'I'll do it' attitude seriously rubs me the wrong way, so maybe consider switching up your usual way of speaking, unless you want to be hated." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Alright, alright! I'll change the way I speak too! I'm off! Both of you, watch over me!" Perhaps numbed by Shino’s bitter words composed of goodwill, Umeda cut the conversation short and headed straight for Manami like a bullet</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Should we go check on them, or should we leave them alone?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's got my friend in the mix, so I'm keeping tabs on the situation." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While Sandai wouldn't mind leaving Umeda be, Shino wanted to follow the developments, especially since it concerned her friend.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai decided to respect Shino's wishes. "I see. Well then, shall we secretly watch over those two from the shadows today?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino seemed to realize that Sandai had been considerate of her, and she nodded happily with a “Yeah.” With that said, they decided to check on Umeda and Manami from the shadows.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda had a lot of assumptions, but whether it was a by-product of that, he seemed to have a remarkable ability to take action, and even though he was nervous, he didn’t seem to hesitate in the slightest</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">When Manami was alone, he took that opportunity and spoke to her immediately.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">Hey, Manami. Are you free right now?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">Who?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">It's Umeda, we're in the same class, Umeda!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">Umeda...I feel like there's someone with that last name. So?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">No, I mean...we have free time today, so if you'd like, you can come with me...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">Are you, like, inviting me on a date or something?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">Th-That's not what I meant... If you're free, why don't we go together...?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">It's not a date. Well then, goodbye.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">Huh?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">"If it were a Date, I’d get this vibe like he sees me as a girl, so I'm, like, open to going along with it a bit. But honestly, this is more like just finding someone convenient to kill the time"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">I want to go on a date with Manami, so please!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Umeda was doing his best to somehow take the conversation towards the next step and was excessively changing what he was saying to suit the other party. It was rare to find someone who fitted the phrase "suspicious behavior" so accurately.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Manami, however, sensed no malice in Umeda's efforts and seemed to have a rather favorable impression of him as she was smiling and laughing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was a scene that showed that Manami is more open-minded than Shino. If a man approached her with behavior like Umeda's, Shino would definitely reject him even if she knew there was no malice in his intentions.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Thanks to Manami's neutral attitude of "let's wait and see for now," Umeda seemed to have successfully get a date. Umeda and Manami got on a tram together. Sandai and Shino hurriedly followed suit, taking seats in a corner not visible to Umeda and Manami.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That was a close one."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"We almost missed it..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Soon, the tram began moving. The view from inside the tram was quite different from a regular train. Since the vehicle moved at a low speed using the roads, the cityscape passing by was unusually vivid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It felt somewhat similar to riding a bus, but it was an inexplicable sensation that you could confidently assert was entirely different.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“By the way, it's my first time riding a tram.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Mine too. There aren't any near where we live. Well, it might be a case of not knowing. If we looked for it, there could be some."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">They had never made an effort to look for trams. In their everyday lives, they usually got by on foot, and for slightly longer journeys, they often used regular trains or buses. That was the reason they hadn't looked into it before.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'll check it out a bit when we get back. If we have trams here, it might add a bit of variety to our dates."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">As Sandai mentioned that, Umeda and Manami seemed to be getting restless with each other.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c8">I heard they have local sweets in Hakodate.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c8">Food time? The ultimate moment is here; we can't let it slip by!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c1">Huh?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c8">Wait, I'll check it on my phone... There it is. Oh, they have a lot of sweets. They all look so delicious. Look!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c8">The way you said 'Look' is a bit annoying, but... Oh, there are tons of mouthwatering choices, right? What's Umeda's favorite sweet? I'll go with that too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c8">Me, huh......I'm......</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c8">Why are you staring me in the eye? Look at your phone screen with all the sweets.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">──</span>
      <span class="c8">No hahaha, uh, uh...... oh, no, I guess I'm interested in... the pumpkin pudding that Manami seemed to glance at for a moment.........? ...?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1"> ──</span>
      <span class="c8">Oh, really...? This one did catch my eye too.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After Umeda and Manami got off the tram and entered a nearby pastry shop.Following the two, Sandai and Shino also got off the tram and sneaked into the pastry shop, and while trying not to be found out, they decided to take the opportunity and buy something themselves.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"There are various options here. I don't know much about sweets, so I'll leave it to Shino."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Leave it to me~."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Shino hummed as she browsed the confections, and finally chose a cheese omelet, polvorone, and Hakodate rusks, all of which seemed to have a strong local flavor and would be useful as souvenirs.</span>
      <span class="c3"> </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino apparently chose them as souvenirs to give to her part-time workers and family members.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I figured Sandai would be repping it at his part-time gig, so I went for something that'd be a hit with all and give off that local vibe."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">This time, Sandai thought he would only buy what he would eat instead of buying souvenirs, and he felt a little depressed as he felt like a worthless man. However, he quickly adjusted his feelings because Shino would surely find it strange if he remained gloomy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Well, this time, they weren't buying souvenirs but sweets for themselves. As promised earlier with Shino, he declared that in such situations, he would pay in the 7:3 ratio with him covering the 7 and the remainder. With the souvenirs purchased, they continued to tail Umeda and Manami.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">３</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Time flew by in an instant. It was now evening and time to go back to the hotel. After observing Umeda and Manami's interactions throughout the day, it seemed like things were going well on one hand, but not so much on the other, resulting in quite an ambiguous outcome.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">There are cases where a relationship starts on the first date. But generally speaking, the main focus of the first date is usually whether both parties can see each other as potential romantic interests. Umeda seemed to be putting in the effort, and Manami was indeed open-minded. However, there were no occasions that indicated Manami strongly considering Umeda as a romantic interest, making the outcome rather harsh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">They can be friends, but they can't be lovers—that's where the line was drawn.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As bedtime approached, Sandai and Shino discussed their thoughts about Umeda and Manami. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“It seems like it might be impossible for Umeda to become her boyfriend, don't you think?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Manami seemed super </span>
      <span class="">close</span>
      <span class="c3">, but I didn't catch a glimpse of any cracks in that emotional fortress of hers... Well, gotta admit, it's feeling pretty darn impossible."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Should we tell Umeda?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No... we can't say for sure that Manami won't have a change of heart. Perhaps it's best not to completely rule it out." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"As long as there's even a tiny possibility, it's not necessary to put the final nail on the coffin, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, that's it. Miracles can totally happen, you know?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Then I guess we’ll stay quiet."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"All right, then. ... It's getting late, so goodnight kiss." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino closed her eyes, and Sandai kissed her as she had wished. The goodnight kisses continued for several minutes, with repeated breathing. With a hint of reluctance, Sandai parted from Shino and returned to his room. Just then, Umeda approached Sandai excitedly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, Fujiwara! I did a good job today, didn't I?! I was able to have a normal conversation, and I feel like I followed your advice and perceived her desires....!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Unaware of the truth about Manami's feelings, Umeda seemed to be quite confident in his progress. Sandai couldn't help but feel a bit sorry for him, as he was about to share some important details. But he remembered Shino's advice not to say anything and decided to keep silent.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see. I think it's going to go well."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It is!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, since you haven't officially become her boyfriend, just keep being kind to her without becoming a nuisance."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Got it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm going to bed then."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai got into bed and slept soundly. He woke up in the middle of the night due to Umeda's snoring and used tissues as makeshift earplugs.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The next morning, after having breakfast, the classmates boarded a bus to the airport. At the airport, they went through the same procedures as before and one by one boarded the airplane. Sandai and Shino, like during their departure, found themselves sitting apart on the plane.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">But this time, there was no need to be considerate, so they easily swapped seats with other classmates and sat next to each other.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The inside of the plane was quiet, both before and after takeoff. Everyone was tired from enjoying the school trip to the fullest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai and Shino were also tired without realizing it, and they left for the dream world, huddled together, supporting each other.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai thought the school trip was just a school event, but after the trip was over, many things had happened. There was the ski resort incident, learning about the relationship between Nakaoka and his parents, and the new romantic developments among classmates. However, even with all that happening, the time with his lover Shino and their connection passed peacefully and smoothly, and thanks to that, Sandai was able to forgive everything. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">But what about Shino?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Only Shino herself would know the truth of her true feelings, but the way she fell asleep with drool on Sandai's shoulder told the gist of the story.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">─I'm happy.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Surely, that’s what she had really felt. Perhaps, that was the deepest truth.</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww9.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Soon after the school trip had ended, the classroom echoed with the troubled voices of classmates. They were compelled to write about what they had learned during the trip and submit the printout as part of their assignment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If you look back on the historical explanations and building tours on the first day and the skiing experience on the second day properly,......you should be able to write about it." Nakaoka said with a sigh. She sat at the teacher's desk and continued speaking while scratching her back with her hand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A school trip isn't a reward for you guys, it's a school event for proper learning. Don't write anything weird; I'll get in trouble." As Nakaoka said it with a self-protectionist attitude, she could hear the students murmuring “You useless teacher.” But Nakaoka ignored everything and yawned.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai felt a strange sense of satisfaction at the turn of events, thinking that it was just Nakaoka as usual, and had already finished making his printout. Sandai was good at writing these kind of impressions. It's finished in a way that makes it look just like that.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai, who had submitted the printout in a jiffy, returned to his seat and looked at the committee chairman and Takasago on the side. They were the ones who had experienced an accident at the ski resort and had to withdraw from the school trip halfway through, seemed to be doing nothing out of the ordinary. They may have had their own feelings about leaving the trip, but they seemed to have come to terms with it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The sound of pens crunching echoed through the classroom. With nothing else to do, Sandai turned around to see what Shino, his girlfriend, was writing for her assignment. Shino was humming and running her pen in a slumped position. Sandai gently peeked over the top and stole a look at Shino's printout.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">“School trip with boyfriend! My classmates were a bit of a nuisance, but thanks to them, I realized that the time alone with Sandai was very important... and a precious moment. In other words, I learned about love. ♡”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai's slight anxiety that she would be scolded for this turned out to be true, and after submitting the assignment, Shino was furiously scolded by Nakaoka. But instead of  silently reflecting on her actions after being scolded, Shino was going toe-to-toe with Nakaoka as per usual.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ Yuizaki! What is this!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ What I learned?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">─ The content has nothing to do with the school trip! It's basically just you saying that you're head over heels for Fujiwara!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">─ It's about realizing the importance of my alone time with Sandai during the school trip. So, it’s somehow related?</span>
    </p>
