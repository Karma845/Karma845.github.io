    <h2>March 1st: We Ended Up Getting Stranded While Skiing, Didn't We?</h2></a>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">１</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Second day of the school trip.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The schedule for this day became clear as they boarded the bus and overheard conversations around them. It was apparently a full day of skiing, a hands-on learning experience, as Sandai had initially thought. Their school, located in a city area on mainland Japan with relatively little snowfall, offered skiing as an educational opportunity. Since most students didn't have the chance to experience skiing in their daily lives, it was considered a valuable learning experience.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was worth noting that all the skiing equipment would be provided, eliminating the need for students to bring their own. This was mentioned by Nakaoka, their teacher, on the bus, who explained that including the equipment in the initial trip cost helped reduce the burden on families.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Let me remind you as your homeroom teacher, this is primarily an 'educational experience.' Tomorrow, the last day with a full day of free activities, is meant to maintain your motivation for the final year before graduation, so you can have fun, but don't forget the learning aspect," Nakaoka emphasized.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While Nakaoka stressed the educational significance, most students saw the day as an opportunity for fun. To them, the plan for today and tomorrow essentially meant two days of play.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, as their classmates' excitement contrasted with Sandai and Shino's more reserved expressions, they couldn't help but feel apprehensive.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hey, Shino, have you ever skiied before?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Nope. What about you, Sandai?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Never. ...I mean, if we end up getting hurt, it'll just be a bad experience, and I won't enjoy it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm so not into pain either. In that case, why don't we just build a snowman and have a blast, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That sounds good."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">While it might have sounded like they were renouncing the educational aspect, if they viewed it as a situation where they recognized the potential danger beforehand and took measures to avoid it, they could consider it a kind of </span>
      <span class=" c15">"learning"</span>
      <span class="c3"> too. At least, that's how Sandai decided to interpret it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, despite their personal resolve, circumstances sometimes don't allow for it. Except for the completely free last day, they were primarily moving in groups, meaning that even Sandai and Shino would be with others. They were, in fact, with the class representative and Takasago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai could overhear the conversation between Takasago and the class representative, who sat in front of them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"We get to experience things we can't in our daily lives and learn from them... That's the essence of today's skiing, which makes it an essential part of our school trip."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Really... I see. I thought maybe skiing was chosen just because everyone would enjoy it..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"There's no way it's like that. The school just wants to give us a learning opportunity, and it's natural to think that skiing was chosen during that process. You don't have to be good at skiing; just the act itself holds meaning."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see... By the way, Shihouin-kun, can you ski?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I can. I'll teach Takasago too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">For some reason, Takasago and the class representative had a very nice atmosphere about them. However, it made Sandai and Shino sensitive to the situation. If they were to resist skiing here and now, it might disrupt the warm atmosphere between Takasago and the class representative.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">While Sandai and Shino weren’t concerned about the class representative, both of them had a favorable view of Takasago. </span>
      <span class="">It was clear that Takasago liked the class representative and was trying to get closer to him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While they were willing to cooperate, neither Sandai nor Shino had any intention of interfering. They figured they could maintain their own friendly relationships while allowing Takasago and the Student Council President to do the same.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It would be easy to say, "Let's just focus on our own fun," but doing so would likely cloud the sincere expression of the class representative. If that happened, it was almost certain that Takasago would feel down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In essence, if they refused to ski and chose to enjoy snow activities on their own, it would inadvertently make Takasago feel uncomfortable in a cascading effect.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What should we do?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What should we do... Mahiro-chan is like totally excited, so it looks like we're going along with them, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">It was an entirely unexpected turn of events, but working as a group was the best option. There was no other choice. Sandai let out a sigh, and Shino shrugged her shoulders.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">２</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Upon arriving at the ski resort, they were provided with equipment and ski wear by the facility staff in an orderly fashion. People who had finished preparing began their experiential learning at their own discretion.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai, along with Shino, struggled with the unfamiliar skis, moving slowly on the snow. However, to put it frankly, it was more tiring than enjoyable. Nevertheless, Takasago and the Student Council President, who were right nearby, seemed to be having a great time, so Sandai didn't mind much.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Be careful, Shino..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"M-My skis are going in a weird direction, and my legs are spreading on their own... I feel like... I'm going to split..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino let out a deep, uncharacteristic voice that they never heard before. It was evidence that she couldn't maintain her composure and a clear sign of being a perfect beginner. Sandai felt somewhat similar.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While they both made an effort to maintain a calm expression, they couldn't help but break into a slight sweat as they struggled to make progress. A small misstep threatened to send them into a split position.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Indeed, it seems we're better suited for making snowmen," Sandai remarked.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, you're right... Ugh... Ngyaa!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Watch out!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino lost her balance, and Sandai instinctively caught her. However, with the unfamiliar skis still on, they couldn't maintain their footing and ended up falling with Shino on top of them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino, who was now straddling Sandai, apologized with a somewhat embarrassed expression. The accident was not Shino's fault, just a matter of luck and timing, so Sandai brushed off the apology and offered comforting words.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's alright. More importantly, are you okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you for catching me, Sandai..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Well, no need to worry about it too much. You're light, and, well, the feeling of your thighs isn't too bad."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When Sandai jokingly said that, Shino blushed and playfully slapped Sandai's cheek.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"The feeling of my thighs….. how lewd."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Indeed, it might have been a bit of a lewd way to phrase it, and Sandai chuckled awkwardly while managing to get up with Shino in his arms.</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww5.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Seemingly unable to bear to watch the two of them, Class Rep gracefully slid over to them.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Fujiwara-kun, Yuizaki-kun, you two fell over for no apparent reason. Clearly, you're complete beginners. You should at least learn how to use the ski poles properly. How about I teach you? N-Not that I have any ulterior motives in saying that, so don't misunderstand, especially you, Yuizaki-kun."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With an attempt not to upset Shino's mood, the student council president seemed to have mustered the courage to offer assistance. Sandai and Shino exchanged glances, somewhat surprised by the proposal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, Shino, despite appearing somewhat distant, responded with, "Well, if we can learn how to use the ski poles... thanks, I guess..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">This was quite an unexpected change of heart. Sandai leaned closer to Shino, asking her about the sudden shift.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I thought you'd say no. What happened?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino glanced at Takasago, who was not far away, and then whispered so that only Sandai could hear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I was thinking, like, maybe Mahiro-chan wants to see Class Rep's super cool side. You know, when guys teach something, it can be, like, totally attractive, and some girls totally dig that.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c10 ">So, that's what it's about</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai thought, understanding her reasoning. Shino was saying she’d chosen to put up with it for Takasago’s sake. If Shino wanted to do that, then it was Sandai’s duty as her boyfriend to go along with it. Sandai decided to obediently accept Class Rep’s teachings.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Though unaware of what was going behind the scenes, class rep, who had been twitchy ever since Shino's previous traumatic experience, seemed to have mustered the courage to teach them as he had said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“With this, I don't think you'll fall flat for now. Yes. Now then, I'm going back to coaching Takasago.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Class Rep pushed the bridge of his glasses with his middle finger, then spun around, using the pole and ski board as if it were his arms and legs. He slid forward, but he paused a few meters before suddenly turning around, as if she had something to say.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why are you looking back all of a sudden?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Do you have something to tell us?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The two inquired, but the student council president's expression became unexpectedly serious.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No... um, do you know where Takasago is?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Surprised by the question, Sandai quickly scanned their surroundings, but there was no sign of Takasago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino, too, looked around and, like Sandai, failed to locate her, shaking her head.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Class rep is right; we can't see Takasago anywhere. I wonder where she went."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Maybe s</span>
      <span class="">he</span>
      <span class="c3"> went back to the facility to take a break, something like that?" Sandai suggested.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With that possibility in mind, Sandai and Shino exchanged glances before the class rep adjusted his glasses once more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If she's going back to the facility, Takasago would’ve definitely given us a heads-up. That's the kind of person she is... The place where Takasago was earlier is right here, but the ski tracks continue down a steep slope... Could it be?" </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The student council president looked at the ski tracks left in the snow and suddenly realized something. He followed the tracks, speeding down a fairly steep slope.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In no time, he vanished from their sight. Left behind, Sandai and Shino exchanged glances, unable to comprehend the situation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c10">What did the class rep notice? </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai was the first to understand.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Class rep followed these ski tracks... Ah, I think I get it!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What do you mean?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Most likely, Takasago accidentally went down this steep slope at some point. It's such a steep hill that once you start sliding, you can't stop. Since Takasago is just learning how to ski from the class rep and is likely as much of a beginner as we are..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What? What should we do? Should we go tell a teacher?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">At the end of the steep slope was a winter forest with dense coniferous trees that stretched on forever. It was so thick that it would be difficult to find them if they were ever stranded. They noticed a shadow spreading across the world. Looking up, they saw the sun slowly being obscured as it began to cloud over. It seemed like the weather might turn for the worse soon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...We should probably go tell a teacher."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With that decision, Sandai and Shino quickly turned on their heels and headed back to the facility to explain the situation to Nakaoka since It was the best course of action.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">But life has a way of throwing unexpected events their way.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ahh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ugh..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was a mistake to approach the steep slope. The snow underfoot started moving, and they ended up sliding down the hill together.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh no!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ahh!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Rolling down the slope, Sandai was the first to collide with a tree, bringing them to a stop. Then, Shino crashed into Sandai.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ughh…."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ouch..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A-Are you hurt?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Somehow, what about Sandai?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm fine too."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The two of them staggered to their feet and checked each other to make sure they were safe. Knowing that neither of them was injured, they sighed in relief and slowly gazed up at the steep slope they had just rolled down.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...It's pretty high."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Do you think it's impossible to climb up?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was approximately twenty to thirty meters in height. On a gentler slope, there might be a chance to climb it using ski poles, but on this steep slope, that was not a viable option.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What should we do?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"We'll have to look for a way around."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Whether they looked to the right or left, the steep slope continued. It was evident that finding a spot to climb would be challenging, but it was the only option they had at the moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While trying to comfort Shino, who was on the verge of tears, Sandai began searching for a detour route.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, moving on the unfamiliar ski boards was slow, almost at a snail's pace. After some time had passed—twenty minutes, maybe even more—they hadn't found anything resembling a detour.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">In the meantime, the dubious weather had worsened, and a blizzard began. Before they knew it, the surroundings became so obscured that they couldn't even see what lay a few meters ahead.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Th-The front..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Let's hold hands. So we won't get separated."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Yeah."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Holding Shino's hand to ensure they wouldn't get seperated, Sandai continued onward.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">...We might have to give up on going back for now and find a place to rest.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Wandering around aimlessly would only deplete their energy due to the blizzard. So, for now, Sandai decided to focus on finding shelter from the blizzard.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He strained his eyes, relying on his senses as he kept moving. That's when he spotted a mountain hut. The hut was unlocked and open.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Is it really okay to enter without permission?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's an emergency. We have no other choice."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Guess you're right."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Inside the mountain hut, they found stacked firewood and a small fireplace. On closer inspection, there was a note on the wall that read "Emergency Shelter."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It looks like this is a mountain hut for people who got into trouble like us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Glad we’re not trespassing... Or wait, are we stranded?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Probably. Our current location is uncertain, so yeah, we’re stranded."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Aww..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, things will work out... Anyway, we need to warm up. How about using the fireplace?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Fireplace... How do we light it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It says 'Emergency Shelter' on the wall, so there should be firewood, and probably ignition tools as well... Ah, found them."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Scrounging around near the firewood, Sandai discovered matches, a lighter, and some newspaper wedged between the logs. He clumsily lit a fire and placed the firewood into the fireplace. As the flames gradually grew, Shino took her place in the warmest spot.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Mmm... It's so warm..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Good thing we didn't end up freezing to death," </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai muttered as he observed Shino, who was warming up with a runny nose.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He took out his smartphone from the inner pocket of his skiwear, thinking he should contact the fire department, the police, and also let Nakaoka know about their situation. However, due to their location in the mountains or perhaps because of the blizzard, there was no cell reception.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It seemed they were in a situation where they couldn't do anything until the weather improved. Frustration began to well up within Sandai, but he knew that getting frustrated would only consume their energy, and it wouldn't change their circumstances.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sitting down beside Shino, Sandai at the crackling fire. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...... when do you think the weather will get better?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Mountain weather can change rapidly, and maybe it'll settle down at some point. Besides, we still have plenty of firewood, so even if it takes a while for the blizzard to subside, we can stay warm. We'll be okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh, I see."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While making idle conversation with Shino, Sandai waited for the weather to improve. However, as an hour passed, then two, there was no sign of it getting better. Eventually, Shino started to doze off.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Are you sleepy?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"A little."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You can sleep. I'll stay awake."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Thanks….lend me your leg"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Legs?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'll use you as a pillow."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ah, I see."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With a nod of understanding, Sandai let Shino to use his legs as a pillow. Shino settled down and began to breathe softly in her sleep with a relieved look on her face.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Goodnight."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">As Sandai gently patted Shino's head, he gazed out of the window. Soon, he spotted a figure approaching.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">At first, due to the blizzard, the figure was blurry, but as it got closer to the hut, its outline became clear. It was the class rep carrying Takasago.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The Class rep entered the hut, opened the door, and paused as he looked at the two unexpected visitors.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Fujiwara-kun and Yuizaki-kun... What are you doing here?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"We got stranded. But more importantly... is Takasago okay?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While briefly giving a rundown of the situation, Sandai observed Takasago's condition. Takasago seemed to be in a bad state, with a flushed face and ragged breathing. The Class rep layed her down near the fireplace, took off his ski-wear and draped it over Takasago</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"She's not okay. She has a fever."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...We need to take her to the hospital, right?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I thought of calling a search and rescue team or an emergency response team. But  because of the blizzard my cell phone has no signal. Does your phone have any reception?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"My phone has no signal either."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...So, we have to wait here until the blizzard stops."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That's how it’s gonna be, huh?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"... It's frustrating." </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The class rep said, sitting down. He slightly contorted his face and lifted the hem of his pants to look at his right ankle. The class rep’s right ankle was swollen and red.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"What... happened there?" Sandai asked, and the class rep quickly hid his right ankle.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...While I was looking for Takasago, I accidentally twisted it due to carelessness."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Is it broken or something?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's not broken. It hurts, but I can still walk... I don't care about myself. What I want is to get Takasago to the hospital as soon as possible." Despite the pain he must have been feeling himself, the class rep displayed an attitude prioritizing Takasago over himself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Normally, the class rep was somewhat evasive when approached by Takasago, who was always pushing the boundaries, but he seemed to have a fondness for Takasago's willingness to be close to him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...Let's talk, Fujiwara-kun. Let's distract ourselves a little."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With Takasago running a fever and the class rep being injured himself, anxiety could be sensed brewing in class rep’s heart. His eyes spoke the need to talk and divert his mind. Understanding this, Sandai decided to engage in the conversation.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah. ...Class Rep, what do you think of Takasago?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Unsure of how to approach this conversation, Sandai, who was a bit of a loner and lacked social skills, chose to ask the question directly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Loners are often out of touch with common sense of the world, as Sandai's way of speaking demonstrated. However, at this moment, it was the right approach.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Th-That was sudden."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The class rep appeared flustered, his glasses clouding up, but at the same time, it seemed like this question helped to distract him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Takasago's affection for Class Rep is so straightforward that it's obvious even from an outsider's perspective. I was curious about what you thought when her feelings were directed at you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Why are you silent? I thought I brought up a topic to take your mind off things..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wouldn't it be better for you to learn some common sense, Fujiwara-kun?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I see, my bad. I mean, I'm a loner with poor social skills, you know. Cut me some slack."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai scratched his cheek, and the class rep let out a sigh.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, whatever. So, how do I feel about Takasago? To put it simply... I recognize her feelings as a member of the opposite sex. However, I can't help but feel it's not quite appropriate to view her as a girl just because of that."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">The class rep’s answer was brusque. It left the question of which it was ultimately unanswered, leaving those listening somewhat puzzled.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, since the class rep had acknowledged recognizing Takasago as a member of the opposite sex, he had not outright denied the possibility of a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship. In essence, he was in a situation where he needed that final push.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While Sandai may be lacking in general common sense, being in a relationship himself, he was sensitive to the nuances of love matters like these. That's why he didn't miss the moment when he could provide that final push.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shihou-in..kun…I... like... you..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai overheard Takasago murmuring those words while lying in front of the fireplace. He stared at the class rep and said, "Class rep, tell Takasago, 'I like you too.'"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He believed that words and emotions often went hand in hand, and by having the class rep say, "I like you," it would also give him that final push. As a side effect, he also hoped that it would improve Takasago's condition while she was feverish. When feeling unwell or going through tough times, kind words from someone special could be encouraging. Even if they couldn't hear it, the heart could sense the words.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai repeated, staring at the flustered Class rep, "Tell Takasago, 'I like you too.'"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Are you joking...."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"I'm not joking. Takasago is having a fever. At times like these, one's state of mind is crucial. Providing reassurance is essential."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“.....”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The seriousness of Sandai's tone and his attitude seemed to affect the class rep’s state of mind. After some hesitation, the class rep finally mustered the resolve to whisper in Takasago's ear.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Takasago..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Shihou-in….kun…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"....I like you. So, I'll do my best to make things right. Please, don’t worry."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It's uncertain whether Takasago, whose consciousness was blurred, heard the class rep’s words. But they certainly reached the core of her heart. And her ragged breathing gradually calmed down, and she started breathing softly in her sleep with a completely relieved expression.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Seeing Takasago calm down, the class rep seemed to have released the tension within him. He said "I'll take a short rest too," and laid down, closing his eyes.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The only sounds in the room were the crackling of the burning wood. After a while, Shino sat up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I..just woke up…"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Good morning."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah... Huh? Mahiro-chan and Class Rep?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"They arrived while you were asleep. It seems Takasago has a fever, and class rep injured his leg."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"That's tough..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino had seemed to grasp the situation and set aside her usual dislike for the class rep, genuinely expressing her concern.</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww7.jpeg">
   
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai casually glanced out the window. To his surprise, the blizzard had completely subsided, and he could clearly see the evening sun setting on the horizon.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class=" c15">...Perhaps...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">With this thought, Sandai checked his smartphone. Thanks to the blizzard settling, he noticed a signal bar showing up. He quickly dialed Nakaoka 's number.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">“</span>
      <span class="c3">Nakaoka sensei?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c1">—Is that you, Fujiwara? Where are you now?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I got into a bit of trouble and ended up in a mountain hut. There's a sign inside that says 'Emergency Shelter.' I think it's not too far from the ski resort."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">—A mountain hut serving as an emergency shelter, huh? Got it. We'll come with the ski resort staff. By the way... are you alone?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"No, Shino is with me. Also, the class rep and Takasago are here. Shino and I are fine, but the class rep injured his leg, and Takasago has a fever."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c8">—An injury and a fever... Honestly...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Nakaoka and the ski resort staff arrived when it was already completely dark. Everyone acted swiftly upon arrival. The class rep and Takasago were immediately taken to the hospital. While Nakaoka, as their teacher, seemed to have the intention of staying with the injured class rep and Takasago, but she decided to leave that to the ski resort staff for the time being and prioritize getting the students to the hotel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Accompanied by Nakaoka, Sandai and Shino returned to the ski resort. In the lobby, their classmates had gathered, and there was an air of tension in the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—It seems like Fujiwara-kun and Yuizaki-san, as well as the class rep and Takasago-san, were stranded...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—Will the school trip be cancelled?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—Rather than thinking about whether the school trip will be canceled or not, shouldn't we be more concerned about the four of them returning safely?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—That's true, but...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—I happened to overhear Nakaoka-sensei on the phone. It seems everyone is safe, but the only ones in good condition are Fujiwara and Yuizaki. The class rep and Takasago are injured and a fever.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—The class rep may seem a bit out of the loop sometimes, but I never expected him to be in an accident.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—Oh, Nakaoka-sensei is back with Fujiwara-kun and Yuizaki-san!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—But I don't see the class rep and Takasago...</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">—If they really have injuries and a fever, the class rep and Takasago-san must be headed straight to the hospital.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When their classmates noticed Sandai and Shino, the atmosphere in the room eased a bit. It seemed that having a better understanding of the situation provided some relief. However, Nakaoka, in her role as their teacher, didn't forget her responsibilities and quickly instructed them to board the bus to the hotel.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Get on the bus! The school trip has only one day left!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The school trip, which had faced the possibility of cancellation, seemed to have been allowed to continue, perhaps due to the consideration of having only tomorrow's free activities remaining. Many students were clearly troubled by the situation, and as soon as they returned to the hotel, they looked completely exhausted.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"......I'm kind of tired."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino also wanted to rest early today, and while she was concerned about the committee chair and Takasago, she returned to her room immediately after taking a bath and having dinner. Sandai also decided to take an early rest today, so he crawled into bed and closed his eyes. However, he could not fall asleep and woke up.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Zzzzzzz"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai, feeling envious that his roommate Umeda was snoring and sleeping soundly, headed for the hotel lobby, where there was a vending machine, to have something hot to drink and catch his breath.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The time was midnight, and the lobby was enveloped in the silence of the late night. When Sandai arrived, he noticed someone familiar sitting there. It was Nakaoka.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ah..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Nakaoka, with a thoroughly fatigued expression, sat in the lobby, leaning back on one of the sofas. It was easy to imagine that Nakaoka had been the most exhausted due to her position. Sandai decided leaving her alone and quietly buying a drink and return without talking to her. However, a sudden mishap occurred as the drink fell from the vending machine with a loud "clank," catching Nakaoka's attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Oh? Fujiwara?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I just came here to buy some drinks .......So I'll be right back in my room."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">He bowed his head slightly and turned his back on Nakaoka. Then Nakaoka called out to stop him, saying, “Wait.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Um... what is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I never thanked you for contacting us."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"There's no need for thanks, really. It's more like I should apologize for causing you trouble. I'm sorry."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"You didn't purposely get into trouble, so there's no need to apologize. First of all, you should be proud of having made the call. It's quite common in the world for cases where a delay in communication leads to difficulties and irreparable situations. Many people, even adults, can't manage to communicate effectively."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I feel relieved to hear you say so. By the way,......, what happened to the class rep and Takasago,......?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"After escorting the students to the hotel, I went to the hospital to check how they were doing. Both of them are not in critical condition. Class rep has a sprained ankle, not a fracture, and Takasago's fever seems to have gone down quickly due to the IV drip. However, I won't let them participate in tomorrow's free activities. As soon as their health improves, they will be sent back individually."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was difficult to guess how the class rep and Takasago were feeling, but it seems that they were frustrated because, unlike Sandai and Shino, they both seemed to have been looking forward to the school trip as much as the rest of their classmates.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, this was something that could not be helped.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The situation was what it was.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai consoled himself, thinking of it as a bittersweet page of youth. Moreover, the class rep and Takasago had reasonable personalities, so they should be able to handle their emotions internally.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I'm glad to hear they're not in critical condition. I feel relieved. ...It's past lights out now, so I'll head back to my room. Excuse me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Wait a moment."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"What is it?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"...I've been getting tired a lot lately. I want to talk about the past a little to distract myself. Come along. Let's talk about old times that might have some connection to you"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Nakaoka said, pointing to the sofa in front of her, suggesting that Sandai join her. Sandai didn't quite understand what was going on, but Nakaoka seemed to want to discuss some past story related to Sandai.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The atmosphere didn't seem conducive to an easy refusal, and the way Nakao mentioned a past story related to him piqued Sandai's curiosity. Reluctantly, he took a seat on the sofa and prepared to listen.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Um, does this have something to do with the old story...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I know your parents—Professor Fujiwara and his wife, in other words. I've had dealings with them."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It's not unusual for a teacher to know their students' parents..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"That's not what I mean by 'know.' To be more specific, I owe a debt to them. I spent about a year abroad studying at a partner school in London, England, around ten years ago. The couple I interacted with during my stay was Professor Fujiwara and his wife. It was his wife who went out of her way to help me."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai was taken aback by the unexpected connection. It was a surprise to learn that Nakaoka had prior knowledge of his parents in such a context.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai had never heard about this from his parents. However, it was highly unlikely that Nakaoka was making a joke, especially considering that she mentioned ‘London’ specifically.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">About ten years ago, the university where Sandai's parents were working during that time was indeed located in London. At that time, his parents were not well-known and moved to various universities almost like migratory birds. It would have been impossible for anyone to accurately guess their location at that time unless they had genuinely known about it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“I don't mind traveling, but I was afraid of going overseas for a long time. I was really relieved at the time when I learned that there was a Japanese professor at a university I was studying abroad at.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...When you're living overseas, it's natural to feel confused or uneasy about the differences from your home country, and Nakaoka-sensei must have had a hard time."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"It seems you have a high level of empathy for these matters, perhaps because you spent your early years in England with your parents."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, I wasn't exactly thrilled to live in England..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai began to say, but he stopped himself mid-sentence. The reason being that he wondered why Nakaoka knew that he and his parents had lived abroad. It was a possibility that Sandai's parents did not take him to England and left him with his grandparents, but Nakaoka was confident that Sandai had lived with his parents.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai was not particularly close to his parents, but he knew that they were not the kind of parents who’d frequently discuss their family affairs with others.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">If his parents were to talk about Sandai, it would be if there was something that made them directly involved with Sandai</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“......, I'd like to change the subject a bit.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">“What is it?”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Perhaps is it possible that you and I have met a long time ago?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai asked while taking a peek, Nakaoka lifted one eyebrow and then immediately started to laugh hysterically.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Hahaha! What? Did you just realize it now?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Yeah. ...... when ......?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I took care of you. Not for a long time, maybe about about two weeks, I think. That's about it."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">During his childhood years in England, Sandai had been under the care of acquaintances of his parents several times. However, there was no specific person who had taken care of him, and various people had filled that role. As a result, he didn't have clear recollections of who those people were.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Upon reflection, he realized that Nakaoka did seem to be one of those individuals.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Well, you had a reputation for running away from whoever took care of you because you were scared of everything. </span>
      <span class="">When I took over from the person who previously looked after you, they said, 'Sandai is scared of everything,' and it was entirely true."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"...?"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Even when I tried to talk to you, you wouldn't respond. Instead, you'd just look at me and then run away. I had to chase after you. Once, you almost fell into the Thames River, and I had to grab your collar to stop you... </span>
      <span class="">Oh, and there was another child who used to follow you around.</span>
      <span class="c3">"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I have absolutely no recollection of that. I'm not that foolish to almost fall into the Thames River. As for a child following me around, I don't remember."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">For Nakaoka, it seemed to be a memorable memory, but for Sandai, he really didn't have much recollections of that time. Some people remember their early years well, while others don't. Sandai was the latter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">After hearing Nakaoka's story, Sandai thought that the fact that she took care of me was true. But he felt like Nakaoka was joking about what had happened at that time. Especially the part about the other person.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">The part about there being another child was especially puzzling. Sandai's perception was that during his time in Japan and when he was abroad, he didn't have friends. That's why even getting along with Hajime was a significant struggle for him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">However, as he continued to wrack his brain to bring back memories, he began to have a faint recollection of a brief period of time when he happened to play with another child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was such a brief and incidental interaction that it didn't qualify as a friendship. Sandai couldn't recall their conversations or even the face of the other child.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Well, you were quite young at the time. It's only natural not to remember. Even if someone asked me to recall myself as a kindergartener, I wouldn't remember a thing. But it makes me feel like I'm only human sometimes, thinking back to those days. I have a feeling I've been a little more lenient with you."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I've never felt that you've been lenient with me..."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"I also gave you a push regarding your situation with Yuizaki. If it wasn't you, who was involved with Yuizaki, I'm not sure if I could have done the same. Anyway, as a teacher, my intention is to help students grab a better future."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Nakaoka shrugged as she said this. Her gestures were casual, but it was clear that she wasn't evading the question and was speaking from her heart.</span>
    </p>
    
<img class="move" src="https://animestuff.me/novel/ww8.jpeg">
    
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">When Nakaoka had tried to set him up with Shino, she had been somewhat overly meddlesome, no doubt about it. At the time, Nakaoka had provided a clever-sounding excuse, but even if that excuse were true, there was no need for her to go to such lengths. However, Sandai figured it might have something to do with the sentiment that had grown out of their past encounter.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Upon reflection, Sandai realized that Nakaoka treated him differently from other students, often engaging in actions she wouldn't take with others. Nakaoka had even accompanied him for time-passing activities, which she probably wouldn't have done for most other students. Also, there were times when she seemed to sternly warn Shino, which was unusual.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">While It could be considered simply her actions as a teacher, but on the other hand, it felt like she was warning Shino ahead of time so that the burden on Sandai wouldn’t grow. There was a sense of looking after him more than what a typical teacher would do.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai didn't want to acknowledge this, and he pursed his lips. Suddenly, Nakaoka grabbed his ear and pulled him closer.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"Ow, ow, ow!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">"Don't dwell on it so much. I just wanted to have a little chat about the past. That's all. You know, when I was younger, I found it strange how people would dote on their nieces and nephews, but now, I can kind of understand that feeling. They're adorable... Anyway."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Nakaoka released his ear, stood up, and took a step away.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"If Yuizaki ever happens to see you in a situation like this, I don't know what she might do. That's all I’m going to say. Hang in there, young one."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai remained silent. Nakaoka left but turned back for some reason.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">"As for how far you've gone with Yuizaki, I can somewhat sense the atmosphere, but do make sure to use protection. Haha!"</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Nakaoka was still Nakaoka, making an unnecessary comment, a parting line that was sure to spoil everything. Sandai watched Nakaoka walk away, wearing a bewildered expression. Then, he decided to step outside for a bit to feel the night breeze.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">It was still early spring in Hakodate in March. Sandai gazed up at the night sky. Winter hadn't completely let go yet, and the cold wind still blew through the city. However, the clear night sky, void of the heavy clouds that had covered it during the day, revealed the sparkling stars. The night sky stretched out forever and ever.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Sandai remembered Shino's concern for Class rep and Takasago. Nakaoka's information about the two was still fresh in his mind, and he decided to inform Shino about it through chat messages. He knew Shino was most likely asleep at this hour, but he thought she could read it in the morning. Sandai briefly organized the text and sent the chat.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="c3">Shino's response came quickly, and it appeared that his message had woken her up, as there were several typos due to sleepiness. In summary, she said, "I'm glad that they're okay."</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c0">
      <span class="">Sandai apologized for waking her up and assured her that both the Class rep and Takasago were fine. Shino replied with a simple "I see."</span>
    </p>
