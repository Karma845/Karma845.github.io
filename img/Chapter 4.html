<h3>Round 4: I Wish You Wouldn’t Come</h3>

<p>Cherry blossoms are often thought of as a symbol of new beginnings, but by the time spring break ends in Tokyo, most of the trees have already turned into green leaves.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, the scenery was not photogenic on this day last year either.</p>

<p>Today is the entrance ceremony at Tokyo Metropolitan Orikita High School.</p>
<p>This spring break felt short yet intense.</p>
<p>Moving for the first time was more physically draining than I had imagined.</p>
<p>The main reason was that I ended up handling ninety percent of the unpacking.</p>
<p>Even though I volunteered to do it in place of my busy parents, it was indeed exhausting.</p>
<p>And then, a shock greater than the move itself——Our next-door neighbor turned out to be a popular idol.</p>

<p>As if that wasn’t enough, I never would have imagined on the last day of the school year, just before spring break, that we would end up in a relationship where I cook meals for her every day.</p>
<p>Though I’ve been serving home-cooked meals to my neighbor every day, my own meals are quite simple.</p>
<p>This morning’s menu was buttered toast, a mini salad, and black coffee, that’s all.</p>
<p>As I was nibbling on the toast, the entertainment segment started on the morning news program.</p>

<p>「Continuing coverage on the love affair rumors of the popular idol group Comet Hunter’s leader, Yamoto Mikoto. According to their agency, Yamoto-san is currently three months pregnant, and it has been decided that she will leave the group as of today. On her own SNS (TN: Social Networking Service/Social Media), Yamoto-san commented, ‘I apologize for the inconvenience caused to the members and fans due to my thoughtless actions. As a leader, I take responsibility and have decided to leave the group. From now on, I wish to support the members from behind the scenes…’」</p>

<p>Romantic scandals, graduations, marriages, pregnancies. I wonder what the fans think about such reports.</p>
<p>As if to answer my question, an interview with a middle-aged man who claimed to be a long-time fan was aired.</p>
<p>It seems he was devoted to Yamoto Mikoto, apparently spending most of his annual income on supporting her.</p>
<p>However, since the love affair rumors were reported over the weekend, he impulsively disposed of all his merchandise.</p>
<p>The interview concluded with his words of despair, saying he had ‘lost his will to live.’</p>

<p>I like Yuzuki. I like how Yuzuki enjoys eating the food I cook.</p>
<p>But something like this is not the outcome I want.</p>
<p>My goal has always been to ‘stop excessive dieting through the power of delicious meals,’ not to cause a scandal leading to leaving the group or retiring from the entertainment world.</p>
<p>In the first place, I doubt Yuzuki would ever fall for a guy.</p>

<p>…Wait, doesn’t that mean I’m also at a dead end?</p>

<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>

<p>As a result of the class shuffle, I was placed in second-year Class A.</p>
<p>While I was chatting with my friend Hozumi, who had been in the same class and sat in front of me the previous year, I heard a small scream from the girls behind us.</p>

<p>Looking in the direction of the voice, I saw a button had rolled onto the desk.</p>
<p>It seemed that the fastener on the blazer had come off.</p>
<p>I approached the flustered girl and spoke to her.</p>

<p>“I can fix it for you if you want.”</p>
<p>“Ah?”</p>

<p>The girl wearing a white headband was taken aback, probably because she had just been approached by a boy she had never met before.</p>
<p>I took out a sewing kit from my school bag.</p>
<p>When I gestured with my hand, she showed a moment of hesitation before handing over her blazer.</p>
<p>We’re pressed for time as we need to move to the gymnasium, so my goal is to finish in under a minute.</p>

<p>Ready, set, go.</p>
<p>While I’m stitching it away, Hozumi starts explaining nonsense to the girl.</p>

<p>“It’s over once Suzufumi got his eye on you. This guy, he’s overprotective and loves taking care of others. Even in our first year, he was known as the ‘mom’ character in class.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, I’ll stuff you with an extra rice.”</p>
<p>“Huh, that’s not ‘mom’, that’s the cafeteria lady.”</p>

<p>The girl giggled softly.</p>

<p>“Alright, restoration complete.”</p>

<p>Time: fifty-eight seconds. Mission accomplished.</p>

<p>“Thank you. You’re… Mamori-kun, right? Let’s have a good year together.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, same to you.”</p>

<p>I handed over the blazer and smiled.</p>
<p>I hope that we both have an enjoyable year ahead.</p>

<p>At Orikita High School, the entrance ceremony and the start-of-term ceremony are held on the same day.</p>
<p>First comes the entrance ceremony, followed by the start-of-term ceremony.</p>
<p>Unusually, all upperclassmen are required to attend the entrance ceremony.</p>
<p>Last year, I was not only watched over by parents but also by the second and third-year students, which made me extremely nervous.</p>

<p>While heading to the gym, Hozumi and I shared updates about our recent daily lives.</p>
<p>We talk about how we slept in every day during spring break, how the new movie theater in the next town is nice, how the shrimp cutlet sandwich at the school store seems to have been upgraded, and how I’ve become friends with my neighbor in the apartment complex.</p>

<p>Nearly five hundred students in the gym, excluding the new students, are packed together.</p>
<p>There were also parents in suits scattered among the pipe chairs.</p>
<p>The seating arrangement places the upperclassmen at the very back, the parents in front of them, and the freshmen at the forefront.</p>
<p>Since the new students enter after the ceremony begins, the center of the gym is left open like a pathway.</p>
<p>Still, today was unusually noisy. Not so much loud as restless. Teachers and upperclassmen were fidgety, and even the parents seemed restless, glancing around uneasily.</p>

<p>Hozumi, sitting to my left, leans forward from his pipe chair and says.</p>

<p>“Hey, did you hear? Apparently, there’s a celebrity among this year’s freshmen.”</p>


<p>“Hey, did you hear? Apparently, there’s a celebrity among this year’s freshmen.”</p>
<p>“A celebrity… like an athlete?”</p>

<p>Orikita High School promotes excellence in both academics and sports and despite being a public school, it’s quite active in club activities.</p>
<p>Especially the baseball and basketball teams are regulars at the Kanto tournaments.</p>
<p>I don’t know if they offer sports scholarships, but it wouldn’t be strange for a well-known talented player to enroll.</p>

<p>“It’s an idol, an idol. The name… if I remember correctly…”</p>
<p>『At this time, we will begin the entrance ceremony for Orikita Public High School. First, we will have the entrance of the first-year students…』</p>

<p>Hozumi’s lines were drowned out by the speaker’s announcement.</p>
<p>We welcomed the freshmen with thunderous applause.</p>
<p>Immediately after, a shrill voice could be heard through the cracks of the applause.</p>
<p>The first-year students walked solemnly through the center of the gymnasium, their faces tense.</p>

<p>Among them, there was one girl who stood out from the crowd.</p>

<p>“No way…”</p>

<p>I was wide-eyed in disbelief.</p>
<p>Well-arranged features, black hair cascading like a clear stream over her shoulders, and a dignified demeanor.</p>

<p>“Yuzuki…”</p>

<p>There was no mistaking it. Sasaki Yuzuki has enrolled as a junior in the school.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Arisu Yuzuki! The center girl from 【Spotlights】! The real deal is so cute~”</p>

<p>Hozumi was grinning from ear to ear next to the stunned me.</p>
<p>The neighbor and idol I knew took her seat without breaking her composed expression, seemingly accustomed to the murmurs of the crowd.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, when I checked the wiki once, it said she was fifteen years old.</p>
<p>It’s not strange that we’d be in the same school, given we live in the same apartment building.</p>

<p>“Even a girl like that goes to a normal high school, huh? Maybe I’ll check out her classroom later.”</p>

<p>Hozumi ran his fingers through his permed brown hair and smirked.</p>

<p>“…No, don’t do that, it would be a nuisance.”</p>
<p>“Man. If we were in the same class, I could brag about it to the guys from junior high. I’d at least like to talk to her once before graduation.”</p>

<p>Far from just speaking a word, I’m currently visiting her house every day, and just yesterday, I was stroking her belly on the bed.</p>
<p>If Hozumi had known about that, he would probably have cried tears of blood.</p>

<p>Regardless of Hozumi’s reaction, I’m surely in a situation others would envy.</p>
<p>In fact, I myself have been enjoying my recent daily life.</p>
<p>The more I think about it calmly, the more I realize that I can’t let the nature of my relationship with Yuzuki become known to those around me.</p>

<p>In the end, the atmosphere in the venue did not dissipate until Yuzuki and the others left, resulting in a somewhat lackluster entrance ceremony.</p>

<p>——And then after school. The guy in the seat in front ofo me turned around with vigor.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand it anymore. Let’s go to the first-year classrooms!”</p>

<p>Hozumi then slung his school bag over his shoulder with his fanboy enthusiasm on full display, looking like he might dash out of the classroom at any moment.</p>
<p>I’m the only one who can rein in this guy who’s on the verge of running wild.</p>

<p>“I said it during the entrance ceremony, but you’re going to bother her. Let’s go home now.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. It’s not like I’m going to hit on her or anything. Besides, I got a girlfriend over spring break.”</p>

<p>Looking back, it seems like he said he had his eye on someone around last winter.</p>

<p>“Just hearing her voice up close would make me happy. Come on, let’s go.”</p>

<p>I was half-dragged to the first-year floor on the first level.</p>
<p>I wonder if he knows which class Yuzuki’s in.</p>
<p>Peeking into each classroom and getting the stink eye from the freshmen each time is something I’d rather avoid——</p>

<p>As it turns out, my worries were unnecessary.</p>
<p>As we descended to the first-year floor, the classroom of Class 1-A came into view first.</p>
<p>Right next to it, there was a crowd of people near the door at the front of Class 1-B.</p>
<p>The number easily exceeded ten.</p>

<p>Observing from a distance, the density of people inside and along the corridor side was even higher.</p>
<p>Through the gaps in the crowd, glimpses of graceful black long hair could be seen.</p>
<p>Yuzuki was smiling and skillfully handling a barrage of questions despite being surrounded by a large group.</p>
<p>Among them, the girl with twin tails right in front of Yuzuki seemed completely smitten with the class idol.</p>

<p>“Arisu-san, why did you enroll in Orikita? Don’t all celebrities go to private schools with an entertainment program?”</p>
<p>“Being a celebrity isn’t that big of a deal. I’m just a normal high school student.”</p>
<p>“You’re not normal at all! You have such a cute face, and your skin and hair are so glossy, I’m jealous~. You must be using expensive brand-name skincare products, right?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, I just use affordable stuff you can find at the drugstore. I guess I pay more attention to things like strength training and my diet.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki seems at first glance to be a friendly high school girl you could find anywhere.</p>
<p>But having shared meals with her in her private life for the past few days, I can tell.</p>
<p>——That’s her idol mode.</p>
<p>Right now, she always looks the person in the eye when responding, and the timing and frequency of her nods are perfect.</p>
<p>This isn’t a skill that can be developed overnight. She must have had a similar experience in junior high.</p>

<p>“…Are you satisfied now? Hozumi, let’s get out of here.”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. If only I could get a closer whiff of a beautiful girl’s scent…!”</p>

<p>The moment I reached for Hozumi’s nape, Yuzuki turned towards us.</p>
<p>Her large eyes widened even further——It seemed she recognized my presence.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I just remembered I was called to the staff room. Everyone, please take care of me from now on.”</p>

<p>She stood up with a full-bloom smile.</p>
<p>Then, starting with the twin-tailed girl, a large group of followers immediately cleared a path.</p>

<p>It was clear that they were all what Yuzuki defined as ‘fans’.</p>
<p>As I hesitated whether to call out to her, Yuzuki muttered under her breath as we passed by each other.</p>

<p>“…Resource Room”</p>

<p>The beautiful girl continued down the hallway alone without looking back.</p>
<p>If any tactless person tried to follow her, they would immediately be subdued by the crowd.</p>

<p>“Hey, didn’t Arisu Yuzuki just say something?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know. But we’ve accomplished our goal, right? I’ve got things to do, so I’m heading home first.”</p>
<p>“Sure. I’ll just read some manga in the library until her staff meeting is over.”</p>

<p>Wait what? His girlfriend is a teacher?!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>The third floor of the school building, resource room.</p>
<p>Peering through the glass of the sliding door, I see the space of about ten tatami mats lined with metal shelves packed with files.</p>
<p>It was my first visit to this room in my second year of high school life.</p>
<p>It seems that the resource room is currently being used as a storage space for student council documents.</p>

<p>I remember about a year ago after the entrance ceremony had ended and we returned to the classroom, the teacher gave us a general explanation about the special rooms.</p>
<p>Regarding the resource room, I think he joked about it, ‘You might not even enter it once before you graduate.’</p>

<p>It’s so rarely frequented by people that there are even rumors of boys and girls doing dirty things in this room from time to time.</p>
<p>When I knock on the door twice, a low ‘Come in’ comes from inside.</p>
<p>It’s Yuzuki.</p>

<p>『May I take your order?』</p>

<p>The sudden question came flying at me.</p>
<p>Without a moment’s delay, I answered with a determined face.</p>

<p>“A pork bowl with extra toppings. Egg on top.”</p>
<p>『Entry permitted.』</p>

<p>Having breached the security, I slowly opened the door. The lights in the room were off.</p>
<p>Against the backdrop of a gloomy overcast sky, Yuzuki is leaning against the window at the back of the room.</p>
<p>The room was dimly lit, so I couldn’t make out her expression.</p>

<p>“…Sorry about earlier. You must be surprised that I suddenly barged into your classroom. I was just trying to stop my friend’s rampage…”</p>

<p>It seems that she deliberately called me out on school because she wanted to set things straight early.</p>
<p>Yuzuki passed by my side and locked the door.</p>
<p>Then she immediately returned to her original position.</p>

<p>“It’s not that I’m angry about it. I was surprised because I never imagined that Suzufumi would be a student at Ori High. I just wanted to tell you early on.”</p>

<p>It didn’t seem like she wanted to vent anger or complaints.</p>
<p>If I had to describe Yuzuki’s current emotions in one word, it would probably be ‘confusion.’</p>

<p>“Here’s a question for you, Suzufumi. What is my profession?”</p>
<p>“You’re an idol.”</p>
<p>“Question two. What’s taboo for an idol?”</p>
<p>“Romantic scandals, I guess?”</p>
<p>“Fifty points. The correct answer was, ‘Acting friendly with a same-age member of the opposite sex.’ “</p>

<p>Yuzuki frowns and smiles wryly.</p>
<p>I don’t think our relationship will be exposed just by meeting each other.</p>
<p>But in the unlikely event that it gets out, how many people would actually believe it even if we explain that ‘it just so happens our homes are next to each other.’?</p>
<p>Approaching Yuzuki at school was a mistake from the start.</p>

<p>“In front of a crowd of high school students who are keen on rumors and gossip, how do you think it would look if Suzufumi and I gave off the impression that we’ve known each other from the start?”</p>
<p>“…There might be people who misunderstand.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Regardless of what our actual relationship is, the truth may not always be perceived correctly.”</p>

<p>I want to become lovers with Yuzuki someday.</p>
<p>However, in a way she doesn’t wish for, I don’t want the groundwork to be laid without her consent.</p>

<p>“That’s why I want you to pretend to be a stranger at school.”</p>

<p>Honestly, I had anticipated she would say something like this.</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to make male friends at school. In case some strange information spreads on social media, I want to be able to firmly deny it. That’s why, I wish you wouldn’t come Classroom 1-B either.”</p>

<p>It would be a lie to say that I don’t feel lonely not being able to talk with Yuzuki at school.</p>
<p>That being said, it’s clear what should take priority considering her job.</p>
<p>I let out a shallow breath and agreed to her request.</p>

<p>“…Alright, I understand. It’s a shame that the plan to deliver homemade bento every day is canceled.”</p>
<p>“…don’t ever do that.”</p>

<p><em>Tsk-</em>, Yuzuki said so while bringing her face close to mine.</p>

<p>“Well then, I guess I should leave quickly. If someone were to see us together—”</p>

<p>——The door creaked.</p>
<p>Yuzuki shifted her gaze toward the door. I hesitantly turn around as well.</p>

<p>“What, Arisu Yuzuki?”</p>

<p>At the entrance of the reference room, a male student stood. Judging by the color of his indoor shoes, he might be a third-year.</p>
<p>Encountering a famous idol, the Senpai’s eyes were wide open.</p>
<p>A look of panic appeared in Yuzuki’s eyes.</p>

<p>“I thought I had closed it properly…?”</p>
<p>“Ah, right. The student council also has a key to the reference room. We’re planning to refer to old materials for next month’s event…”</p>

<p>An unexpected visitor in the special room reputed to be rarely frequented by anyone.</p>

<p>“…but why is Arisu Yuzuki here? And you are? A second-year student? She said it was closed, what exactly are you doing here…”</p>

<p>There was a brief pause, and then Senpai realized his mistake.</p>
<p>This misunderstanding could be a problem.</p>

<p>Some students perceive this resource room as a secret hideout for dubious activities.</p>
<p>An idol and a male student in a dimly lit private room——It’s somewhat natural for anyone to jump to ‘that’ conclusion.</p>

<p>I recalled this morning’s entertainment news.</p>
<p>A popular idol’s romantic scandal. Interviews with fans. Every single letter of their resentful words came to mind, sending a chill down my spine.</p>
<p>Yuzuki’s face was pale. Not a trace of the soft smile she had when I saw her in class 2-B.</p>

<p>“S-sorry. I didn’t mean to intrude. I’ll leave and come back later. I won’t tell anyone…”</p>

<p>It’s impossible to believe him when he says that in such a strained voice.</p>
<p>The moment he returns to the student council room, the smoldering embers will undoubtedly transform into a raging flame.</p>
<p>I shouted loudly enough for the senior who was quickly walking away from the document room to hear.</p>

<p>“Now…what’s your answer!”</p>


<p>I turned back towards Yuzuki and asked.</p>
<p>As I watched the window behind her, I could see the reflection of the Senpai’s indoor shoes hidden behind the door.</p>
<p>It was proof that he was secretly eavesdropping.</p>

<p>“Yuzuki, give me a clear answer!”</p>
<p>“A-answer?”</p>

<p>To the bewildered Yuzuki, I pressed on.</p>

<p>“The answer to my confession. I won’t let this end ambiguously!”</p>

<p>I signal with my eyes, and Yuzuki, realizing my strategy, nods slightly.</p>
<p>In the next moment, the atmosphere around Yuzuki changes completely.</p>

<p>“——I’m sorry. I can’t date you, Mamori-senpai.”</p>

<p>Looking down and lips pressed together, Yuzuki looks genuinely apologetic from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>She switches from the new student Sasaki Yuzuki to the idol Arisu Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Why not?! You said you liked me at the handshake event!”</p>
<p>“I mean that as a fan, as a man, that’s a little…”</p>

<p>A smile that’s like evading the topic, awkward and strained.</p>
<p>The gesture of constantly fiddling with her hair is typical of what someone unconsciously do when they feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“Really, there’s no chance for me? Not even a millimeter?”</p>
<p>” … “</p>

<p>A silent affirmation. The faint sigh that escaped hinted at a firm resolve.</p>

<p>“…I understand. But please let me go to your live concert once in a while. I genuinely like the idol Yuzuki too…”</p>
<p>“…of course, thank you…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki bit her lower lip and clenched her hands tightly at her chest.</p>
<p>I wiped away tears with my arm and dash of the resource room.</p>
<p>I passed by the senior who was lurking behind the door, turned the corner, and headed down to the sophomore floor below.</p>

<p>There were no students in the hallway.</p>
<p>I could finally breathe a sigh of relief now that I had made it this far.</p>

<p>“Wow…”</p>

<p>It’s only after I’m alone that the realization starts to hit me.</p>
<p>Even if it was just an act, getting rejected is seriously depressing!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Descending to the second-year floor on the second level, I closed the door at the back of the class took refuge in my own classroom, Class 2-A, located right next to the stairs.</p>
<p>I’ll kill some time here before heading home.</p>
<p>Outside the window, sunlight streamed through the gaps in the clouds.</p>

<p>” … “</p>

<p>Most likely, that Senpai will spread the word about the big incident he witnessed.</p>
<p>It would be ideal if the matter could be contained within the student council, but that seems unlikely.</p>

<p>Like Yuzuki earlier in the resource room, I lean against the window.</p>
<p>Immediately after, I saw a female student crossing the corridor through the glass pane above the door connecting the classroom and the hallway.</p>
<p>It was Yuzuki.</p>

<p>I only caught a glimpse of her, but she seemed to be in a hurry.</p>
<p>Her gaze wandered all over the place as if she was searching for me.</p>
<p>I know she came all this way to chase after me, but it would be troublesome if someone else were to spot us together again, so I shouldn’t call out to her.</p>

<p>However, Yuzuki quickly returned.</p>
<p>She seemed to have spotted me in the brief moment she passed by Class A.</p>
<p>Her hair was disheveled, and a thin layer of sweat glistened on her forehead.</p>

<p>As Yuzuki reached for the sliding door, I stretched out my left palm in a ‘stop’ gesture.</p>
<p>Sensing my intention, she stopped, and I slowly approached her.</p>

<p>“I’m so sorry!”</p>

<p>Though Yuzuki didn’t enter the room, she bowed deeply through the door.</p>

<p>“It would be a problem if someone else saw us. You should go home now.”</p>

<p>I tried to sound as gentle as possible while softly admonishing Yuzuki through the door.</p>

<p>“I caused trouble for you, Suzufumi. I’m really sorry.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it. It’s one of those things beyond our control.”</p>

<p>Though I never expected to end up fabricating a confession, there’s no need for Yuzuki to feel down.</p>

<p>“Just like you said, I won’t talk to you at school anymore. Please enjoy your high school life without any worries.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, on the other side of the door, doesn’t seem ready to leave.</p>
<p>She probably feels guilty for indirectly causing my reputation at school to suffer.</p>
<p>Really, it can’t be helped, huh?</p>
<p>I step half a step closer and smile. The girl’s eyes on the other side of the glass were slightly moist.</p>

<p>“It’s a favor for you.”</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>
<p>“Someday, you’ll listen to my request too. Then we’ll be even. Or is the great idol-sama someone who repays kindness with ingratitude?”</p>
<p>“Th-that’s not true!! I’ll return it threefold!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki puffs up her cheeks in annoyance. Well, it’s much better than her looking downcast.</p>
<p>Instead of parting words, when I touched the center of the glass, Yuzuki did the same.</p>

<p>Separated by the transparent pane, our hands overlapped.</p>
<p>Finally, Yuzuki flashed a satisfied smile and left.</p>
<p>I touched the palm of my hand that had been against the glass.</p>
<p>It’s cold, yet warm.</p>

<p>☆☆☆</p>

<p>That night, I was in the usual living room of the Sasaki household.</p>
<p>Yuzuki’s expression was pale as if she had just encountered an intruder while trying to warn a neighbor in the resource room.</p>
<p>I feigned ignorance and busied myself with preparing dinner swiftly.</p>

<p>Today’s dish was a special menu I had wanted to feed Yuzuki for a long time.</p>
<p>It was a lavish dish with both meat and fish—a true embodiment of life. I got so carried away that I went over budget.</p>

<p>“I bet there will be seconds. Would an idol get chubby if she ate something like this? But then again, she did say she’d eat until her stomach bursts…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that much…”</p>

<p>Several hours after parting at school, I packed a large amount of ingredients into an Okamochi and stormed the Sasaki house, declaring, ‘I’ve come to collect a debt.’</p>

<p>Naturally, Yuzuki resisted.</p>
<p>However, when I clutched my chest and recited in a monotone, ‘Ahh, the pain of unrequited love hurts—so bitter, so painful’, she reluctantly let me into her room.</p>

<p>Yuzuki, sitting seiza and shrinking in front of the low table, looked like a debtor confined by a loan shark.</p>
<p>She trembled, wondering what kind of torture was to come.</p>

<p>I gently placed my masterpiece dish on a round plate onto the table.</p>
<p>Yuzuki’s eyes widened.</p>

<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>“Today’s special is a galette.”</p>

<p>Galette.</p>
<p>It’s a dish originating from the Brittany region northwest of France that was said to be the ancestor of the crepe.</p>
<p>It’s made by baking a round piece of dough and then folding it into a square shape with the filling on top.</p>
<p>It is a French dish that is very popular among women because it looks good on SNS.</p>
<p>Unlike crepes, which mainly use wheat flour, galettes are primarily made with buckwheat flour.</p>
<p>Therefore, they are less sweet and were considered more of a meal than a dessert in Japan.</p>

<p>“It’s not the usual manly meal, is it? Are you trying to suffocate me with meat juices and oil?”</p>
<p>“I won’t go that far. Well, you must be tired from the entrance ceremony, pretending to be something you’re not in front of your classmates and all the other things you’ve been doing. I thought you might want to eat your favorite foods without any worries today.”</p>

<p>According to Wikipedia and the official website, the idol Arisu Yuzuki’s favorite foods are galettes and crepes.</p>
<p>I know the truth. What the private Yuzuki craves are common people’s dishes like pork bowls, Milanese Doria, and yakisoba.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I didn’t think the information listed in her profile was completely false.</p>
<p>Galettes can be topped with a variety of ingredients including meat and fish, aligning perfectly with what Yuzuki loves to eat.</p>

<p>The ingredients are classic: bacon, raw salmon, fried egg, and mushrooms.</p>
<p>There’s also cheese and fresh cream, giving it a French-style pizza feel.</p>

<p>“Sure, I do love galettes, but still…”</p>
<p>“Ah, my chest hurts——heartbreak is so painful——”</p>
<p>“That’s not fair…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki pouted, but her usual spirit was missing in her resistance.</p>


<p>“Well, just have a slice. I’ll consider the debt repaid with that.”</p>
<p>“…Right, that’s fair. Today’s meal is like an apology, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, Yuzuki’s voice began to heat up with emotion.</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped, huh!? I don’t want to eat it but it’s to return the favor! Yeah, can’t be helped!”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>This girl, who was sulking just a moment ago, used me as an excuse.</p>

<p>“Okay then, Itadakimasu—”</p>

<p>Yuzuki skillfully handled the knife and fork, placing a slice of the galette on her tongue.</p>

<p>“…wow…”</p>

<p>The moment the galette entered Yuzuki’s mouth, it blossomed into a smile.</p>

<p>“—The crispy bacon and the aroma of mushrooms explode in your mouth, making my mouth instantly go Western! The seasoning is strong, but the cheese and fresh cream make it mild. The crust is crispy and fragrant, yet so chewy and fun when you bite into it~!”</p>

<p>She had been tense just moments ago, but now her face is lit up with a smile.</p>
<p>This expression truly suits Yuzuki best.</p>

<p>“The combination of a warm galette with cold salmon is definitely a hit. This unique crunchy texture is something only salmon can provide!”</p>

<p>Time for me to try my first galette.</p>
<p>Yes, the seasoning and baking are perfect.</p>

<p>While I’m savoring the meal slowly, Yuzuki quietly continues eating.</p>
<p>At this pace, she’ll have finished eating in less than five minutes.</p>
<p>I stopped moving my knife, stood up, and told Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to enjoy this galette to the fullest. What would you like for seconds? Should we go for something refreshing with tomatoes and asparagus, or go hearty with German potatoes and sausages? There’s also the option of bananas and berries for a dessert-style.”</p>
<p>“…Well then, the one with potatoes and sausages.”</p>

<p>Choosing the hearty option without hesitation—that’s so Yuzuki.</p>
<p>As I focus on baking the dough by the stove, I sense Yuzuki’s presence right behind me. She’s unusually quiet for just watching me cook.</p>

<p>It was about time for me to voice the concern that had been on my mind for a while.</p>

<p>“Honestly, you’re still just putting on a brave front, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>” … “</p>

<p>No reply. That means yes.</p>

<p>“You know, you don’t have to be on guard even in front of me.”</p>
<p>“…How can you tell?”</p>
<p>“I can tell. After all, we’re together every day.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki let out a sigh as if she had resigned herself and rested her head on my back.</p>
<p>I feel a vague warmth just above my waist and instinctively straighten my back.</p>

<p>“…I wanted to be the perfect idol not just on stage or in front of cameras, but at school too. I failed in the resource room, and worse, I caused trouble for Suzufumi… I didn’t want to burden you further, yet you made a galette for me and even saw through my forced cheerfulness… I’m such a mess.”</p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate me. Doing this is nothing for me, not a bother at all.”</p>

<p>Up until now, how much do you think I’ve been looking after my friends and classmates?</p>
<p>Compared to them, Yuzuki is in the category of an honor student.</p>

<p>“Why do you go so far for me? My goal to be the perfect idol shouldn’t matter to you, Suzufumi. Helping me doesn’t benefit you.”</p>

<p>I can feel her genuine confusion coming from behind.</p>
<p>That’s true, the desire to be a top idol is Yuzuki’s alone, and I don’t necessarily need to intervene.</p>

<p>“It’s not like I helped you because I wanted Arisu Yuzuki to be the perfect idol. I’m doing this for you because I want to support the real Sasaki Yuzuki who is doing her best. I want Sasaki Yuzuki to enjoy her days.”</p>
<p>” … “</p>

<p>There’s no response from behind.</p>
<p>I wonder if she’s pondering the true meaning of my words.</p>

<p>“And this time, it might have turned out to be for Yuzuki’s benefit, but it’s also for my own sake.”</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You said earlier, ‘Helping me doesn’t benefit you’. But that’s not true. You see, just eating together like this is enough. I’m genuinely happy If Sasaki Yuzuki is doing well and can join me at the table with a smile.”</p>

<p>Every time, Yuzuki is thrilled by the food I make.</p>
<p>Being able to watch that from the special seat across the table——how could I not be happy?</p>

<p>“I simply enjoy the time I spend having meals with you, Yuzuki.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>“So don’t worry about it and just be yourself as usual. I’ll keep making meals for Yuzuki from tomorrow on, but don’t feel obliged to eat it as a way of repaying me, okay?”</p>
<p>“What’s that, that’s weird… but thank you.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s voice was wrapped in relief.</p>
<p>With the way things are, she’ll probably be back to her full spirits by tomorrow.</p>

<p>“Just one last question. If I’m in trouble again…will you help me, Suzufumi?”</p>

<p>It might be the first time I’ve heard Yuzuki make such a timid remark.</p>
<p>But it’s not just a weakness. I sense another emotion lurking behind it.</p>
<p>A hope similar to a prayer, timidly peeking at me from the depths of her heart, longing to be discovered.</p>

<p>“…That’s a stupid question.”</p>

<p>I stopped cooking and slowly turned around.</p>
<p>Yuzuki was clutching her hands tightly in front of her chest, looking timid and anxious.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t know what Yuzuki truly wants.</p>
<p>For all I know, my actions might just be meddling.</p>
<p>—Still, my answer has always been clear to me.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you. If Sasaki Yuzuki is in trouble, I’ll definitely help you no matter the situation—Isn’t that obvious?”</p>

<p>At first, Yuzuki seemed dazed by my words.</p>
<p>Then, as understanding dawned, she suddenly widened her eyes——then quickly looked down as if to escape my gaze.</p>

<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>The tips of both ears, peeking through her black hair, were turning crimson.</p>
<p>Perhaps she had become hot from being near the fire for too long.</p>

<p>“Hey, are you okay?”</p>

<p>As I lean in to check, Yuzuki jumps back like a startled cat that has been splashed with water.</p>

<p>“I’m fine! Yeah, I’m totally fine!”</p>

<p>Repeating ‘I’m fine’ over and over as if to convince herself, Yuzuki suddenly became flustered.</p>
<p>After fidgeting with her fingers, Yuzuki slowly raised her face.</p>

<p>” … “</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, staring at me like that?”</p>

<p>For some reason, Yuzuki’s expression was a mix of frustration and conflict, like when she was resisting her food.</p>

<p>“…just so you know, I absolutely won’t lose!”</p>
<p>“O-okay?”</p>

<p>A sudden declaration of determination.</p>
<p>Maybe she wants to say, ‘Don’t think you can win me over just by feeding me my favorite galette.’</p>
<p>Well, whatever it is, it seems she’s snapped out of her fake cheerfulness, so that’s good for me.</p>

<p>As I was dishing out seconds of the galette, Yuzuki peeked over from the side.</p>
<p>However, her gaze wasn’t on the galette but on me.</p>

<p>“…I’ll remember it, Suzufumi—that you said you’d ‘help’ me.”</p>

<p>Faced with Yuzuki’s shy smile, my heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Up until now, I had been closely observing the person known as Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>
<p>Yet, the Yuzuki I see now is one I’ve never encountered before.</p>

<p>——Something other than her idol mode shone brighter than any smile I’ve ever seen.</p>
