<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Clandestine Rendezvous with a Popular Idol</h3>

<div class="calibre3">After leaving the classroom, I walk down the hallway, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm about to meet a popular idol, so I don't want to sow the seeds of rumors.</div><div class="calibre3">I climb the stairs and the closer I get to the rooftop, the further away the hustle and bustle of the school becomes.</div><div class="calibre3">I reach the landing of the rooftop.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka's sitting on the lower part of the stairs.</div><div class="calibre3">She's the girl who has been controlling 'Rin' last night.</div><div class="calibre3">However, from her appearance, it's hard to imagine Rinka as an innocent and cheerful person like Rin.</div><div class="calibre3">Her long, lustrous hair and beautiful, sharp eyes. Her whole body exudes an air of coolness that makes it hard to believe that she is a sophomore in high school.</div><div class="calibre3">But, hard to believe, she'll say something like&nbsp;<i class="calibre5">"Because I'm Kazu's wife, kay!"</i>, uttering those words with heart marks fly around.</div><div class="calibre3">"You're late, Kazuto-kun. What have you been up to?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">As soon as I arrive, Rinka gets up from the stairs, and asks me in a cold voice while sweeping up her hair.</div><div class="calibre3">To tell the truth, my heart is going to freeze.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, that..... I was having a little chat with my friends." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">If I answer honestly. She may get angry.</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, that's right. It's good to take care of your friends, but that doesn't mean you should neglect your own wife, does it?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm...... not my wife, but my girlfriend." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'll correct it for the time being.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm not old enough to get married yet.</div><div class="calibre3">Then Rinka, her eyes narrow, stomps the floor and closes the distance in front of me.</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, Rinka-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"'Indeed, we're not officially married couple, but we're married in the game, aren't we?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"W-we are." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"In the game, we can communicate with each other with a pure and genuine heart, without being bound by our real identities or appearances. We got married in that world, so it's no exaggeration to say that we've transcended the real world couple." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, that's an exaggeration! After all, we're just ordinary lovers." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's if we follow the rules of the real world. If we look at our hearts, we've been married for a long time." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">T-this is so messed up.......!</i></div><div class="calibre3">"Or could it be that you don't want to get married with me, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"T-that's not......." (Kazuto)&nbsp;</div><div class="calibre3">".......Although the other day, he confessed his love for me with such passion that it brought me to tears......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, no, I did, but." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As Rinka said, I confessed to her how I really felt.</div><div class="calibre3">I was not lying about my feelings for her, of course.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Even so......</i></div><div class="calibre3">I can't shake the discomfort of the married couple stuff, aside from the game, even in the real world as well.</div><div class="calibre3">"I did, but...... what? Depending on Kazuto-kun's next words......, I'll cry. I won't be able to live with being rejected by Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Her words don't seem to be a lie.</div><div class="calibre3">There're thin tears in her eyes.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm probably the only person in the world who has ever seen tears in the eyes of a cool idol.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Ummm, yes. We're a couple." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">No man can resist a woman's tears.</div><div class="calibre3">I've just proved it <b class="calibre4">myself</b>.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun....... I love you, I really love you so much." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Letting out a breath of relief, Rinka hugs me, <i class="calibre5">.......This is dangerous. <span class="calibre11">(<b class="calibre4">PTW/N</b>: BE STRONG! DON'T GET NOSEBLEED!!!)</span></i></div><div class="calibre3">My head is about to boil from being hugged by a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka's affectionate appeal is not half-baked.</div><div class="calibre3">Although Rin and Mizuki Rinka are completely different in terms of what they say and how they act, their fondness for me is the same.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know why Rinka's personality changes when she's in the game.</div><div class="calibre3">"Mmm-pheewww~......, by hugging Kazuto-kun like this, I can ingest Kazuto-kun ingredients." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's probably a bad thing to take." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Not a bad thing at all, because when I ingest in the Kazuto-kun ingredient, it makes me feel really good. It's addictive." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Isn't it completely the same as drugs......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">What if Rinka becomes a nerd sooner or later, I wonder.</div><div class="calibre3">"Anything is fine. Just having Kazuto-kun near me is enough to fill my heart......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Letting out a blissful voice, Rinka presses the tip of her nose against my chest as she hugs me. She smells me, cooing and sniffing....... this is embarrassing.</div><div class="calibre3">That's when it happens.</div><div class="calibre3">From the bottom of the stairs, I hear the sound of several girls talking.</div><div class="calibre3">The voices are getting closer and closer.</div><div class="calibre3">"――――!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">I quickly gaze at Rinka's face. It's unusual, but she has a drop of sweat dripping down her cheek.</div><div class="calibre3">This is dangerous. We're on a rooftop landing. Since the rooftop is locked, there is no way to escape. Of course, there is no place to hide.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Should I switch to thinking of an excuse if we're found out?</i></div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Rinka?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka, who seems to have made up her mind, slowly descends the stairs.</div><div class="calibre3">She passes the bottom landing and went to the lower floor.</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh! Mizuki-san! What are you doing in a place like this?"</div><div class="calibre3">Naturally, she's spotted by the female students who come from below.</div><div class="calibre3">They're surprised by the sudden encounter with a cool and popular idol.</div><div class="calibre3">"I was looking for a less popular place to practice my dance. What are you guys doing here?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh? We came here to have lunch on the roof."</div><div class="calibre3">"Unfortunately, but the roof is closed. It'd be wiser for you guys to go somewhere else." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, just as what I guessed. Hear? I've told you, haven't I? Let's go back to class."</div><div class="calibre3">I stay on the roof landing instead of going down the stairs, so I can't see the girls.</div><div class="calibre3">But I can hear the chatter between the girls getting further and further away.</div><div class="calibre3">And I also can hear the footsteps of one of them coming up the stairs.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Pheew~......I managed to do that, somehow." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"T-thanks for the good work." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">The one who comes up is Rinka, who is a little out of breath.</div><div class="calibre3">As expected, even a cool idol can be worn out by nerves.</div><div class="calibre3">"The rooftop landing is dangerous, too." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah, ....... If I had to go through this every time, my heart won't be able to keep going." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If so...... the place left for us is there, maybe." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"There?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Emmm. it's a little far from here, but it's a classroom in the old school building." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">The old school building, huh....... It's not used at all now, and its function has been changed to storage rooms and clubrooms.</div><div class="calibre3">Certainly that during lunchtime, the average student would not drop by.</div><div class="calibre3">However, all the classrooms there are locked.</div><div class="calibre3">"Actually, there's only one room was unlocked. The teacher must have forgotten to lock it." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Hee....... How do you know all that?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"We were looking for a place where we could practice dancing during the lunch break. Then, we found it by chance." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">We</i>...... speaking of that, there's also another member of <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b> who is enrolled in this school.</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you guys not using it to practicing now?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Emm. We decided not to because of the risk of the teachers finding out. We stand out, for better or worse, and if the three of us were to head to the old school building every day, we'd be found out, wouldn't we?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Indeed." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">They are popular idols, and even if they are acting normal, they will attract attention.</div><div class="calibre3">The fact that Rinka was near the rooftop will probably soon become a rumor that will spread throughout the school.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... We'll meet at the old school building for tomorrow's lunch break" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Understood." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">And so we appoint to meet again.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not easy to go out with a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre3">......Well, I'm starting to think that this thrilling is not so bad these days.</div>
