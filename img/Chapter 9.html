<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; The Stalker's Identity</h3>

<div class="calibre3">"I think someone might be watching me the whole time." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">""......Huh?"" (Tachibana; Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">After school. I tell my problems to Tachibana and Saito, who came to invite me to go home.</div><div class="calibre3">They look at me as if they're asking me what the hεll was going on.</div><div class="calibre3">"I can feel that person's eyes on me. And it's been happening since this morning." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I tell them with a serious face. It's to show them how serious I am.</div><div class="calibre3">During breaks between classes, even when I was walking down the hallway to the lavatory, I felt like someone was watching me.</div><div class="calibre3">Even when I had no choice but to stay in the classroom, I could feel eyes on me from somewhere.</div><div class="calibre3">However, since I didn't feel eyes on me during class, I guessed that the culprit was a student from another class.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't feel any hostility, but it's still uncomfortable.</div><div class="calibre3">Thanks to this, I never had a chance to talk to Rinka. There was no way I could meet a popular idol in a situation where someone was watching.</div><div class="calibre3">I explain the situation, hoping that my friends will be kind enough to help me.</div><div class="calibre3">"I see. I understand your situation, Ayanokouji-kun." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Really, Saito?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. Actually, I feel like I'm being watched too." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wait a minute! Actually, I can feel eyes on me too!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Even Tachibana?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">What's going on? Are you saying the target is the three of us?</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Who's watching us and for what purpose?</i></div><div class="calibre3">"Look at this." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">Said that, Tachibana takes out an acrylic key chain with an illustration of a 2D beautiful girl from his pocket.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">......What's wrong with this guy? It has nothing to do with what I just said.</i></div><div class="calibre3">"Lapis keeps looking at this me during classes.... what should I do?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Are you kidding me? I'm talking seriously here." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's right, Tachibana-kun! We are talking seriously!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">Saito, who was unusually distracted, raised his tones.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Yes, scold him more, buddy!</i></div><div class="calibre3">"My Lizbet is giving me hot eyes not only during class but even during break time!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">Saito takes out a figure from his bag and placed it on the desk with a bang.</div><div class="calibre3">It is a figure of a red-haired, big-bre*sted, and older sister-like character girl.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">......What the hεll have you brought to school?</i></div><div class="calibre3">"Wait a minute, Saito! Isn't that a figure that costs more than 20,000 yen!?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's right! I saved up my allowance every month, checked the change slot in the vending machine every day, and...... I was finally managed to buy one last week!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wow! Amaziiiiiiiiiing! That's amazing love!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Saito who is praised by an excited Tachibana, smiles with a shy smile.</div><div class="calibre3">"By the way, Ayanokouji-kun, what kind of girl are you feeling the gaze of?" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"............I was a fool for trying to consult to you guys." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">""Huh?"" (Saito; Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Seems like, they have truly moved on to the next stage of their lives.</div><div class="calibre3">There's nothing wrong with collecting figures and acrylic key chains.</div><div class="calibre3">But when you start to feel the stares like I do, it's a red flag then.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Listen, both of you. I think I can hear Lizbeth's voice these days." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Seriously, that's awesome!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">.............</div><div class="calibre3">Let's go home.</div><div class="calibre3">They have already been living in a different dimension.</div><div class="calibre3">I walk out of the classroom alone, leaving the two of them to their own excitement.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre20">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</i></div><div class="calibre3">☆</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre20">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</i></div><div class="calibre3">"...... I can still feel that eyes on me." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'm on the way to returning home, walking around the city for a while,, and stopped.</div><div class="calibre3">I can feel the eyes on my back.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">It's definitely someone is watching me now.</i></div><div class="calibre3">I look back, but all I can see is the asphalt road and the houses lining both sides of it. The only other thing I see are telephone poles. There's not even a passerby.</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Is it just my imagination?</i></div><div class="calibre3">But it's very stressful being stalked by someone all day long.</div><div class="calibre3">If the stalker is only an assumption on my part, I want to prove it somehow.</div><div class="calibre3">If it is, I want to catch and talk to that person.</div><div class="calibre3">".......Let's give it a try." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I think of a strategy and start walking again.</div><div class="calibre3">I turn the corner, put my back against the wall, and wait for it.</div><div class="calibre3">I hear the sound of rushing footsteps.</div><div class="calibre3">Then, the person who comes out of the corner is――――.</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh, Kiyokawa-san!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji!? Oh shi......!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">The person who shows up is Kiyokawa Ayane. The person who had been stalking me was a neat and popular idol.</div><div class="calibre3">When Kiyokawa recognizes me, she looks surprised, but then immediately returns to her elegant expression as if she has only just switched on a switch.</div><div class="calibre3">"H-Hello, Senior Ayanokouji. What a strange coincidence to meet you in such a place like this, yes." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Bullsh*t. You've been following me for hours." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I ain't following you. This's just a coincidence." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"When you saw me earlier, you almost said, "Oh sh*t" Am I wrong?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, I didn't. What I was about to say was, <i class="calibre5">'Oh the shikqwirrel, Senior Ayanokouji!'</i> That's it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Aren't you too bad at lying? Either way, it's rude, you know." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3"><blockquote class="calibre16">(PTW/N: She says (about to say) Shima(tta)...; but denied with saying Shimassima.)</blockquote></div><div class="calibre3">What do you mean of I am a squirrel? I can't get it at all.</div><div class="calibre3">"Think about it. Why do I need to follow after Senior Ayanokouji? Even if I'm to follow after, I would choose a more attractive gentleman. Fufu, what an over self-esteem you are." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I'll report to Rinka for now." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm sorry, I was following you." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3"><blockquote class="calibre16">(PTW/N: WHOAAH!!1!1! Sasuga~ Rinka-chan no PAWAAA)</blockquote></div><div class="calibre3">She bows her head in what can be called a lightspeed move.</div><div class="calibre3">I know it, she was doing this without telling Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">"What are you planning by doing this?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">".......It's not convenient for us to talk here at. Is there any other place that is more secluded?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Even if you say so, ....... Then, would you like to come to my house?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't you have a family there?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"My parents both work, so they won't be home until nightfall. And I don't have any siblings." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see, in other words, I'll be alone with Senior Ayanokouji at his home...... So that's how you brought Senior Rinka and Senior Nana into your home and built the relationship you have now." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's a deeply meaningful statement. I tell you, Rinka and Kurumizaka-san have never come to my house." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3"><blockquote class="calibre16">(PTW/N: Ow boy, you brought another girl to your home while hadn't to your gf!?)</blockquote></div><div class="calibre3">When I say that, Kiyokawa opens her eyes with a snap.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"That means..... I am your real target? So you're saying that the reason you approached seniors was as bait to lure me in?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'll say it again. You're an idiot, aren't you, Kiyokawa-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wh-what do you mean by, I'm an idiot? I'm a neat and tidy idol to everyone, you know. Which the hell part of me look like an idiot?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No...... none at all, though." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">In fact, she looks like a genius. And she seems to be able to do everything with dexterity.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's right, isn't it? I'm not an idiot. Even though I'm always just barely escaping red marks." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She stares at me with a face as if saying, <i class="calibre5">"Hmm? Did I say something strange?"</i>.</div><div class="calibre3">"Aren't you an excellent student, Kiyokawa-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ufufu. In order for me to get an above-average score, I'll have to study bloody hard." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"S-seriously?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder what. I have an image of Kiyokawa, the neat young lady, getting full marks in all subjects easy-peasily.</div><div class="calibre3">But no, she has already been busy with her idol activities, so she probably doesn't have enough time to study. So it can't be helped.</div><div class="calibre3">"In the first place, will studying help me in the future? It won't, am I right?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You just hate studying!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji, humans can live happily with a minimum of food, water, and entertainment to kill the time. In other words, studying is unnecessary, am I right again?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I feel like my common senses have been overturned in this instant." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It is not the values regarding the study, but the common senses of the neat idol.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm dumbfounded by her argument, which sounds like a quibbling child who hates studying.</div><div class="calibre3">If you think about Kiyokawa's character, I think she shall be encouraged to study.</div><div class="calibre3">"Now, let's head to Senior Ayanokouji's house. Ah, I don't mean anything strange. And I'm not a Closet." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I already know that......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It seems that she doesn't like the fact that she was called a Closet Pervert.</div><div class="calibre3">She assured me categorically.</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder if it's okay to take Kiyokawa home with me.</div><div class="calibre3">For some reason, I just have a bad feeling about this.</div>
