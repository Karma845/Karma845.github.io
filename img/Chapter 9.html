<h3>Chapter 9</h3>


<p style="text-alr"><strong>Round 9: I Lacked the Resolve 1</strong></p>

<p>Upon arriving at the apartment, I check the contents of the collective mailbox.</p>
<p>Pizza delivery, bulky trash collection, private tutoring school flyers.</p>
<p>In just one day, various flyers have been stuffed inside. The mailbox for room 810 is overflowing with flyers; not even a single piece of paper can fit in anymore.</p>

<p>“……”</p>

<p>I get on the elevator and get off to the eighth floor.</p>
<p>As I walk down the communal corridor, the door to room 808 opens.</p>

<p>“Oh my, Suzufumi-kun. Welcome back.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>The lady was holding a box with a noshi ribbon (decorative attached to a gift).</p>

<p>“I was just about to visit you. This is a prize I won in the shopping district’s lottery. Here’s a share for you.”</p>

<p>Beside the box, the words’ Platinum Pork’ are boldly written in a strong brush style.</p>
<p>Seeing this brand of meat reminds me of a shocking encounter during spring break.</p>

<p>“Ah, are you sure? Such an expensive item.”</p>
<p>“I won it twice. The two of us can’t finish eating so much fatty meat.”</p>
<p>“You’re so lucky.”</p>
<p>“By the way, the last prize I won was a trip to Atami. I’ll be going there soon. I’m really looking forward to the hot springs.”</p>
<p>“You’re incredibly lucky…”</p>

<p>And you really do love hot spring trips, don’t you—</p>

<p>“Suzufumi-kun, weren’t you good at cooking? Please make sure to cook for your parents and friends too.”</p>
<p>“…Yes, leave it to me.”</p>

<p>With that, the lady went back to her room.</p>
<p>I passed by room 809 and stood in front of the room at the very end——ringing the doorbell.</p>
<p>There’s no response from inside. I know for sure that it’s not because she’s pretending not to be home.</p>
<p>It seems she hasn’t returned today either.</p>

<p>Staring at the box in my hand, I muttered to myself.</p>

<p>“…The one I most want to share this is still missing, huh.”</p>

<p>It’s been five days since Yuzuki stopped coming home.</p>
<p>Perhaps she secretly returns while I’m at school attending classes.</p>
<p>Ever since the day of the live performance, YYuzuki has disappeared from my sight.</p>
<p>My messages go unanswered. Naturally, my calls too.</p>

<p>SNS was being updated regularly, and she had even appeared on live web shows.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like she was involved in any incidents or troubles.</p>
<p>There’s only one conclusion that can be drawn from this.</p>
<p>——Yuzuki is avoiding me.</p>
<p>Yet I couldn’t think of a reason why.</p>

<p>No, if I think hard about it, it’s not like there aren’t any clues.</p>
<p>For example, a few days before the concert, we walked home together.</p>
<p>From the elevator in the apartment building to the room, we held hands with just our pinkies.</p>
<p>On the day of the concert, I gave her a homemade bento.</p>
<p>Maybe a weekly magazine caught wind of this information and reported it as a romance rumor.</p>
<p>Yuzuki left the apartment to hide and, under the agency’s instructions, cut off contact with me.</p>

<p>But for these five days, I scoured weekly magazines, online news, and even anonymous forums, yet there was no exposure of Arisu Yuzuki’s love life.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, maybe she’s just simply busy with work.</p>
<p>There’s also a fan meeting for the group coming up, so there’s no doubt she’s being chased down by preparations.</p>
<p>I try to come up with these reasons to convince myself, but I still can’t accept them.</p>
<p>After all, Yuzuki has always let me know in advance when she’s going to stay out overnight, no matter how busy she is with work.</p>
<p>——To have no contact for five days is strange, no matter how I think about it.</p>

<p>Literally, it felt like Yuzuki had gone somewhere out of my reach.</p>
<p>Ever since I seared the image of her gallant figure at the live performance into my memory, the idol Yuzuki has been constantly flickering in my mind.</p>
<p>As things stood, I instinctively knew that the future waiting for me is one of gradual separation.</p>

<p>“…Yuzuki…”</p>

<p>It’s not that I’m grieving over not being able to meet the idol, Arisu Yuzuki.</p>
<p>——I wanted to meet Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next morning, I spotted a familiar figure in front of the school gate.</p>

<p>“Ah, you finally arrived. You’re so late, Suzu~”</p>

<p>Rika smiled and lined up beside me.</p>

<p>“…Hi, Rika.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a little low on energy? Your beloved childhood friend came out to greet you, you know~”</p>

<p>Undeterred by my salty response, Rika, walking beside me, has a cheerful expression.</p>

<p>“What’s up with you, ambushing me like this?”</p>
<p>“You’ve been so curt with your messages lately. So I thought, if you have any worries, this kind and gentle Rika Onee-san will listen to you.”</p>
<p>“… It’s nothing. Sorry if I made you anxious.”</p>
<p>“Really? You’re not forcing yourself?”</p>

<p>Normally, Rika would back off quickly, but she’s unusually persistent today.</p>
<p>I put on the mask of a cheerful childhood friend and forced a smile.</p>

<p>“You worry too much. More importantly, have you been studying for the midterms? You don’t want to get scolded by your mom again and have your part-time work hours cut, do you?”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>I was well aware that Rika suddenly became weak when it came to the topic of studying.</p>
<p>Using this to get through this situation felt somewhat underhanded though. I couldn’t help but feel slightly guilty.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll immediately ask Rika for help if anything happens.”</p>
<p>“Better be true. But if you lie, I’ll come knocking on your door even if it’s in the middle of the night!”</p>
<p>“Yes-yes, you’re welcome anytime.”</p>

<p>Since the second and third-year students have different rows of shoe lockers, Rika and I parted ways at the entrance for students.</p>
<p>It’s shameful that I’ve even got my childhood friend worried about me.</p>

<p>On a whim——I decided to change the route to Class 2-A’s classroom.</p>
<p>Usually, I would go up the stairs right past the student entrance and then move to the back of A class, but I strode to the end of the first-year students’ floor after putting on my indoor shoes this time.</p>

<p>Of course, the reason was to peek into Class 1-B.</p>
<p>I crossed in front of the classroom right before the start of the Homeroom period when most students would have arrived.</p>

<p>This year’s first-years seem to be serious students—when I peeked inside through the fully opened door, most of them were already seated.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t spot the girl with long black hair and amber eyes.</p>
<p>It seems she hasn’t come to school after all.</p>


<p>“Um… Do you need something in the first-year classroom?”</p>

<p>A girl with red-framed glasses, who sat next to Yuzuki’s left in the classroom, seemed suspicious of me staring into the classroom and came out into the hallway with a wary look.</p>

<p>“Yuzuki-san is probably absent today. For the past few days, she has been either late or leaving early even when she has come to school.”</p>
<p>“I-I see.”</p>
<p>“You’re… Mamori-senpai, right? The one who confessed to Yuzuki-san on the day of the entrance ceremony.”</p>

<p>It seems my true identity had been discovered by Yuzuki’s classmates.</p>

<p>“I won’t tell her you came here. It seems like Yuzuki-san is avoiding you.”</p>
<p>“…What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Recently, whenever a boy from another class enters the classroom, Yuzuki-san always checks to see who it is. It’s as if she’s on guard for someone.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’m the person she’s wary of?”</p>
<p>“Who else could it be? Are you maybe trying to approach Yuzuki-san again? If you’re too persistent, I’ll tell the teacher, okay?”</p>

<p>Her eyes behind the glasses were serious.</p>
<p>More than being wary of me, she seemed concerned about Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“…alright, I understand. I won’t come to Class B anymore. Sorry for scaring you. Thank you.”</p>

<p>My hope of seeing Yuzuki in Class B’s classroom was cut off.</p>
<p>But somewhere in my heart, I also felt relieved.</p>
<p>What do you know, she does have friends who care about her, after all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>『Mamori Suzufumi from class 2-A, please come to the student guidance office during lunch break.』</p>

<p>As soon as the morning classes ended, I was called out over the school intercom. Being summoned by name like this was a first for me in my school life.</p>

<p>“Looks like Suzufumi finally got called out by Momo-chan!”</p>

<p>Hozumi, who saw me off from the classroom, had the biggest grin I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>The reason for the summons was all too clear. It was probably about my visit to Class 1-B this morning.</p>
<p>Being lectured about Yuzuki was the last thing I wanted, but this time, I was in a tough spot.</p>
<p>Right now, it seems I’ve become a complete stranger to Yuzuki.</p>
<p>Moreover, the surrounding view of me was that of a potential stalker.</p>
<p>I can’t even argue against it if I’m said to be worse than Mikami-sensei, who once had an incident of almost being a dangerous pervert.</p>

<p>Knocking twice on the door, a low voice from inside said, ‘Come in.’</p>

<p>“Excuse me.”</p>

<p>The room contained only a bookshelf filled with university guides and a six-seater conference table.</p>
<p>Dressed in a suit, Mikami-sensei was sitting in the central seat at the far end with her elbows on the table and her hands clasped together.</p>

<p>“Take a seat.”</p>

<p>I sat down on a pipe chair directly across from Mikami-sensei, in the middle on the entrance side.</p>

<p>“Don’t you have something to say to me?”</p>

<p>Sweeping her short bobbed bangs aside, her gaze sharpened.</p>

<p>──If you dare to mess with her…</p>
<p>The ominous warning once uttered by Mikami-sensei was about to become reality.</p>
<p>Now, what kind of apology would be best to calm her anger?</p>

<p>First, I should probably apologize for visiting Class 1-B. Bending my forehead to the floor and declaring, “I will never approach Yuzuki again”, should surely convey my sincerity.</p>
<p>Yuzuki wishes for that too. For Mikami-sensei, it would be a cause for celebration to have such a troublesome man as me kept away from Arisu Yuzuki.</p>

<p>With that, everything will be resolved smoothly. No one will be hurt, and no one will be saddened.</p>
<p>Even so, I couldn’t open my mouth.</p>
<p>——Even though what I needed to do was clear.</p>

<p>“…I see, you intend to keep feigning ignorance to the very end.”</p>

<p>As if to say all hope was lost, Mikami-sensei sighed deeply.</p>

<p>“Then, I’ll say it clearly. Yuzuki-chan’s──”</p>

<p>I clenched my fists on my lap and shut my eyes tightly.</p>
<p>Ah, it’s over.</p>

<p>“——Yuzuki-chan’s live performance was amazing!”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>“You watched the live stream too, right? This time, the song selection was more general audience-oriented than usual. Personally, I’m totally satisfied because there were three solo songs by Yuzuki-chan. I never expected ‘Red Sun Twilight’ to be a solo Ver. by Yuzuki-chan. That was a complete surprise. There were only two solo songs last time and the time before that, and there was only one at last year’s Christmas live performance. Well, that made this time’s excitement off the charts. More than that, I’m worried about her health. She’s been appearing on live broadcasts before and after the live, and with the fan meeting also coming up, the management should really ensure Yuzuki-chan gets some proper rest──”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, wait, hold on. What is this, you want my thoughts on the live performance? Don’t tell me you summoned me here just to talk about that?”</p>
<p>“What else would it be?”</p>

<p>I was bracing myself to be reprimanded for this morning’s surprise attack on Class B, but it seems that news hasn’t reached this person’s ears.</p>

<p>“I was waiting for you to invite me to a discussion these past few days, you know? But since you were so passive, I guess I have no choice this time. As fan club member number 000005, I must be kind to my junior fans. Any community will surely decline if new people don’t join——”</p>

<p>Putting aside the rise and fall of communities, I let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>There are less than thirty minutes left in my lunch break. I took out my lunchbox from the school bag I had placed beside my pipe chair.</p>
<p>I had planned to eat in the courtyard after the lecture, but this idol otaku’s passionate speech shows no sign of ending, so I might as well have my lunch here.</p>


<p>As I put my hand on the lid of my lunchbox, I felt a strong gaze from the front.</p>
<p>Mikami-sensei was glaring at me sharply as if trying to kill me with her eyes.</p>

<p>“How dare you brazenly take out your bento in front of me…!”</p>

<p>Perhaps I had been too casual with my homeroom teacher.</p>
<p>Although I intended to always be mindful of manners and etiquette, I tend to forget the very concept of manners in front of this person.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s not much of lunch break left, so—”</p>
<p>“And here I am, having eaten nothing but grass and beans for the past three days!”</p>

<p>Once again, the reply that came was completely beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, this person has been cutting down on food expenses to the limit for the sake of supporting her favorite idol.</p>

<p>“Last night, I had stir-fried bean sprouts and pea shoots with five cans of chuhai (shochu highball). This morning, I had cold tofu and natto, and for lunch, I had bean sweets given to me by a colleague… I’m at my limit!”</p>

<p>Following her gaze, I realized it was not on me but on my bento.</p>
<p>If she was originally someone in financial trouble, I would definitely take care of her, but in this person’s case, it’s clear that her lack of money is due to her idol spending.</p>
<p>Still, ignoring a hungry teacher in front of me felt uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“…Would you like some?”</p>

<p>For a moment, Mikami-sensei’s eyes sparkled but then they quickly returned to normal.</p>

<p>“Hmph, I haven’t fallen so low that I need to be pitied and given food from a student.”</p>
<p>“I have another one, actually.”</p>
<p>“Really!?”</p>

<p>She leaned over the table, her eyes wide like a child’s.</p>

<p>“Yes. I made too much.”</p>

<p>I had actually planned to give it to Yuzuki at school if I saw her, but that seemed unlikely today.</p>
<p>Handing the second lunchbox to a visibly delighted Mikami-sensei, we both simultaneously lifted the lids of the willow-made boxes.</p>

<p>“Whoaaa…”</p>

<p>Mikami-sensei’s mouth hung open like a child who had just opened a treasure chest.</p>
<p>Today’s lunch is sandwiches.</p>
<p>The ingredients include classic options like tuna and ham, as well as luxurious tonkatsu for a katsu sandwich, and a fruit sandwich mixed with plenty of fresh cream and chopped strawberries, kiwi, and banana.</p>

<p>“Haaah…”</p>

<p>Holding a palm-sized square-cut sandwich in both hands, Mikami-sensei gazes intently at it like a common soldier bestowed with a reward from the king.</p>

<p>“Itadakimas—”</p>

<p>She quickly bit into it like a small animal, starting with the tuna sandwich loaded with black pepper.</p>

<p>“…Sweet potato shochu, on the rocks.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Or, maybe white wine…”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>

<p>After muttering these mysterious phrases, Mikami-sensei next chose a ham sandwich.</p>
<p>In addition to the ham, it was filled with shredded cucumber, adding a refreshing texture and juiciness.</p>

<p>“Red wine, preferably the cheap stuff from a family restaurant… A highball would also be acceptable.”</p>
<p>“…Are you talking about what drinks would go well with these sandwiches?”</p>

<p>It seems that for Mikami-sensei, even picnic-style food was considered suitable for pairing with alcohol.</p>
<p>The third choice, making a grand entrance, was the katsu sandwich.</p>
<p>Her hands trembled slightly as she held it, perhaps it had been too long since she had meat or fried food.</p>
<p>Crunch- cruch- munch- munch-</p>

<p>With a snap, Mikami-sensei’s eyes flew open.</p>

<p>“Beer! Beer beer beer! A medium draft, and make it quick!”</p>
<p>“Sensei, please calm down! This isn’t a pub, it’s the school’s student guidance office!”</p>

<p>I shook Mikami-sensei’s shoulders, trying to bring her back to her senses.</p>
<p>The content of her comments aside, it seemed that Mikami-sensei genuinely enjoyed the sandwich.</p>
<p>She continued to munch away, leaving only the fruit sandwich.</p>
<p>Even Mikami-sensei, known for her love of drinking, appeared like a typical girl in front of sweets.</p>
<p>She took out a silver thermos, seemingly preparing for an elegant tea time.</p>

<p>“The rich whipped cream and the sticky sweetness of the banana combined with the sharp sweet and sourness of the strawberries and kiwi make a perfect dessert. This bread is also moist and fluffy, melting nicely in the mouth.”</p>

<p>After the fourth sandwich, I finally heard a proper food review from her for the first time.</p>

<p>“With my mouth filled with sweetness, drinking this is like——aahhh!”</p>

<p>Mikami-sensei’s face instantly filled with satisfaction as she gulped down the contents of the thermos bottle.</p>

<p>“…Just to confirm, that’s tea in your thermos, right?”</p>
<p>“…Did you know? Whipped cream surprisingly goes well with sake. The sweetness of the cream and the bitterness of the sake enhance each other. It’s good either warm or at room temperature, but my absolute recommendation is definitely cold sake. You see, the crisp coldness seeps through, giving you a sensation like plunging into a cold water bath after a sauna.”</p>
<p>“Uh, why are you so talkative all of a sudden? And isn’t your face getting a little red?”</p>
<p>“I’m such a bad girl, eating and drinking in front of my students——Ufu-ufufufu.”</p>

<p>This must be what they mean by ‘makes one’s skin crawl (身の毛もよだつ)’.</p>
<p>(TN: 身の毛もよだつ, expresses the sensation of all the hairs on your body standing on end or feeling as if they are.)</p>
<p>Mikami-sensei is giggling to herself, seemingly finding something amusing.</p>
<p>Then she stretched out her arms on the table and collapsed forward, tossing aside her low-heeled pumps.</p>

<p>“Ah… Yuzuki-chan… my precious… my love…”</p>

<p>With a dreamy look in her eyes, she suddenly expresses her love for her favorite idol.</p>
<p>She really does love Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Hey, do you think I’m cute?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>The Slit-Mouthed Woman——it seems that she appears even at schools during the day.</p>
<p>(TN: Something like an urban legend; she approaches people (typically children) and asks them if they think she is beautiful. If they answer ‘no,’ she becomes violent. If they answer ‘yes’, she removes her mask to reveal her slit mouth and asks again. )</p>

<p>“That’s right, I’m the cutest in the school, aren’t I?”</p>

<p>Though I responded with a question, it was taken as an affirmation, with an exaggerated topping added on.</p>
<p>Setting aside whether she’s the cutest or not, Mikami-sensei is certainly cute.</p>
<p>Round eyes, a button nose, and glossy lips. The short bob suits her, and she has a small face with an outstanding figure.</p>


<p>“I also aimed for it in the past—to be an idol.”</p>

<p>Casually, a shocking statement was made.</p>

<p>“I wanted to be fawned over. Isn’t it the best to satisfy your need for approval and make money at the same time?”</p>

<p>Moreover, the motive was rather low.</p>

<p>“But my parents were both teachers, and they took great pride in their work. That’s why they wanted their daughter to follow in their footsteps, especially with my mother. We used to argue about it a lot.”</p>

<p>Mikami-sensei often includes small talk during lessons.</p>
<p>However, she had never brought up her family environment before.</p>

<p>“When I was told, ‘Being an idol is just a game,’ we even got into physical fights. From her perspective, she was probably worried about the future of her only daughter. Still, even if it’s just a desire to ‘try something,’ even if there’s no lofty ambition, I wanted to live my own life.”</p>

<p>When people start something, at the core is usually a strong desire.</p>
<p>I too started cooking because I had the wish to cheer up my father.</p>

<p>“No matter how much they opposed me, I persistently persuaded them. I was finally allowed to chase my dream on the condition that I graduate high school. During weekdays, I sent out demo tapes, and on weekends, I participated in auditions. To earn the entry fees, I filled all my free days with part-time jobs. I had to balance it with my studies too, so I studied until late at night, always keeping my grades within the top ten of my class.”</p>

<p>I know that a teacher named Mikami Momose is actually a hard worker.</p>
<p>She’s more enthusiastic about classes and events than most other sensei, and she always includes personal comments for each student when returning tests.</p>

<p>“In the summer of my third year of high school, I finally made it to the final audition. From the ten of us who had made it that far, members were chosen to form an idol group. It was a three-day, two-night training camp, but as I interacted with everyone, I realized something.”</p>
<p>“…What did you realize?”</p>
<p>“Our resolve was different. I thought I was doing quite well, balancing studies and part-time jobs, but that’s the norm. I went to various idol concerts to take in input, devoured books on improving conversation skills, and attended entertainment-related drinking parties to make connections——yet I was the only one who had more than four hours of sleep a day. Especially for those over twenty, there’s no turning back. They were staking their lives on becoming idols, even if it meant cutting their lifespan short.”</p>

<p>I remember Yuzuki’s daily rhythm.</p>
<p>Maybe the reason I heard sounds of life at night or dawn wasn’t just because of irregular work hours but also because there must have been time spent preparing, like doing strength training or memorizing scripts.</p>

<p>“After realizing that, I thought to myself. ‘I can’t keep living like this for the rest of my life.’ I want to go out and have fun sometimes, and I want to sleep in on weekends. In the end, I even failed the final audition. There was still time before the deadline of the promise I made to my mother, but I gave up on becoming an idol. From the latter half of summer vacation, I studied hard, attended a national university, obtained a teaching license, and became a school teacher. I have no regrets. But still, ‘I lacked the resolve’ to push forward on the path I wanted to take.”</p>

<p>Mikami-sensei, speaking dispassionately, seemed refreshed.</p>
<p>Surely, by doing things her own way, she was able to face her failures properly.</p>

<p>“That’s exactly why I am so in love with Arisu Yuzuki’s determination. No matter how small the venue, she gives her all, and even after becoming popular, she never slacks in her efforts. I love Yuzuki-chan for embodying the spirit of an idol.”</p>

<p>I’m well aware that Yuzuki is earnest and a perfectionist. But hearing the story of a former idol aspirant makes me feel the weight of the word ‘perfect’ even more.</p>

<p>“So I was so surprised at the last live performance. Of all people, Arisu Yuzuki unusually made a mistake in her choreography.”</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>

<p>It felt as if cold water had been poured over my heart——a sensation of freezing spreading from the inside of my body.</p>

<p>“It was during the debut song ‘Spotlight.’ She corrected it immediately, and since the camera was close-up during the stream, I don’t think anyone else noticed. Her mistake in a live performance is rare; in fact, it was the first time as far as I know. How did I notice? Well, I’m member number 000005.”</p>

<p>Ignoring Mikami-sensei’s smug look, various dots connected into lines within my mind.</p>
<p>At the recent live performance, I felt a slight fluctuation in Yuzuki’s expression.</p>

<p>——It wasn’t just my imagination.</p>
<p>Her strong obsession with perfection.</p>
<p>The thoroughness of not even showing her true self to school friends.</p>

<p>In the end, she’s trying to exclude even me from her ‘world’.</p>
<p>A normal idol would think, ‘Just this once.’</p>

<p>But if it’s Arisu Yuzuki──</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I returned to the apartment, I ran into the apartment’s owner in front of room 810.</p>
<p>Apparently, there had been a request from the resident of this room to move out.</p>
