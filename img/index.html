I was on the train on my way to high school, but what is this place?</p><p class="calibre2">In front of me is an old man that looks like a king, and he’s trembling with excitement as he opens his arms widely in an exaggerated manner.</p><p class="calibre2">Around him are a portly middle-aged man with a beard and people wearing armor who I assume are knights. The knights are lined-up to the left and right and are looking this way cautiously.</p><p class="calibre2">And around me, are people wearing the same type of clothes as me. Boys and girls wearing school uniforms, suits, and casual clothing. There are seven of us, three boys and four girls.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone seems confused, and some look worried.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t remember answering anyone’s call in the first place, you summoned us all on your own. The reason why is still a mystery.</p><p class="calibre2">“Where are we? And who are you?”</p><p class="calibre2">Someone wearing a school uniform steps forward and asks.</p><p class="calibre2">One of the knights is about to make a move, but the old man raises his hand and stops him.</p><p class="calibre2">“This is the Kingdom of Elesya, and I am its king. We have summoned you here by way of an otherworldly summoning passed down in our kingdom.”</p><p class="calibre2">He tells us a long and boring story.</p><p class="calibre2">Basically, summoned heroes receive the blessing that is excellent skills, and they want us to use them to defeat the revived demon king.</p><p class="calibre2">The student asks if defeating said demon king will let us return to our original world, and apparently that’s possible if we use the demon king’s magic stone.</p><p class="calibre2">I say apparently, because they make it very clear that they have only read in books that other heroes managed to go home.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then heroes. Chant status open, and show us your powers!”</p><p class="calibre2">I hear people whisper status open, and I do the same.</p><p class="calibre2">A transparent panel appears in front of me, and it shows me stats like in a game.</p><p class="calibre2">Name &ndash; (Sora Fujimiya) Job &ndash; (Jobless) No Level</p><p class="calibre2">HP &ndash; 10/10 MP &ndash; 10/10</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…1 Stamina…1 Agility…1</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…1 Dexterity…1 Luck…1</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking) Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk)</p><p class="calibre2">So I’m a weak character. Can I even beat the weakest monsters?</p><p class="calibre2">I was a student in that other world, but now I’m jobless. Is it because I didn’t do anything?</p><p class="calibre2">And what does no level even mean?</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you done checking? If so, touch this crystal one at a time.”</p><p class="calibre2">An old man wearing a robe that’s standing next to the king points to a crystal on an extravagant pedestal.</p><p class="calibre2">If you touch this crystal, everyone else can see your stats.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone goes up to it and touches it, one by one.</p><p class="calibre2">The king, the old man, and everyone around them cheer every time.</p><p class="calibre2">(Master Swordsman), (Sorcerer King), (Paladin), (Saint), (Sword King), (Spirit Mage)…</p><p class="calibre2">There are murmurs about those jobs, and people also sound surprised about their owners’ levels.</p><p class="calibre2">The highest one is level fifty, and the lowest is level thirty.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone has multiple skills too. You have five skills? What are you a hero? I say to myself without even thinking. Reality is always harsh…</p><p class="calibre2">The multiple eyes pointed my way with high expectations hurt, but I can’t run away, so I take a few steps, and then resign myself and touch the crystal.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s something that sounds like static for a second, before my status panel is shown to everyone else like all the others.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone is at a loss for words, even the ones who were summoned here like me.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s like the wave of excitement is subsiding.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are these status and skills!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Don’t ask me! I demand a redo.</p><p class="calibre2">The noise of people talking gets louder, and just as my weakness is about to break my heart, I see a line in the status panel I didn’t see before.</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking) Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk) &ndash; (Get one experience point with each step)</p><p class="calibre2">Experience points &ndash; 21/1000</p><p class="calibre2">But when I look at the panel being displayed by the crystal, that line isn’t there.</p><p class="calibre2">Can I level up just by walking… But if I don’t have a level, what are these experience points for?</p><p class="calibre2">But still, that experience counter doesn’t show zero, it shows twenty one.</p><p class="calibre2">Did it count the steps I took towards the crystal?</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t remember how many steps I took, but that seems about right.</p><p class="calibre2">As I think about this, I realize that suddenly everyone is quiet.</p><p class="calibre2">I raise my head, look towards the king, and he turns away.</p><p class="calibre2">Then I turn to the old man in the robe, and he does the same.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It seems we have managed to summon six chosen heroes. Let us have a banquet to celebrate! This way, heroes!”</p><p class="calibre2">I guess I don’t count.</p><p class="calibre2">The people summoned along with me look awkward, turn away, or look concerned, but in the end, they’re all taken away.</p><p class="calibre2">They have good jobs and high levels, fighting skills to survive, but they lived in a society where they didn’t need fighting techniques. They have no choice but to obey when they’re surrounded by armed knights.</p><p class="calibre2">One knight stays behind with me, and says ‘come’ quietly before walking off without waiting for a response.</p><p class="calibre2">As I expected, he’s taking me outside the castle.</p><p class="calibre2">We reach the gate, and another knight throws me a bag with gold coins as a parting gift. I open the bag to check, and see two gold coins.</p><p class="calibre2">It really feels like there should be more considering the bag’s size. Isn’t two too little anyway?</p><p class="calibre2">I look at the knights, and see them grinning like they’re making fun of me.</p><p class="calibre2">As I think about how apparently there are idiots in every world, I figure it doesn’t matter since I’m probably never going to see them again anyway, and head towards town.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-10"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1 &ndash; Confirming my current status</h1><p class="calibre2">Before I know it, it’s morning.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently I fell asleep as I was doing some thinking. I guess the environment change made me more exhausted than I thought.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk to the window, and look at the city again.</p><p class="calibre2">The capital of Elesya spreads out in a circle with its castle in the center. Closer to the middle are many imposing tall buildings, and as we get further from it, the smaller houses stand out.</p><p class="calibre2">I see some clouds slowly floating in the still somewhat dark sky. Last night I looked up and saw two moons, which made me feel like I’m really in another world.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m staying in a cheap inn close to the outskirts. It has two floors, and the first floor is a dining room.</p><p class="calibre2">One night is costing me ten bronze coins, breakfast and dinner included. It was originally a bit more, but I got a discount because I paid for ten days straight.</p><p class="calibre2">The owner looked annoyed when I went to pay with a gold coin, but when I told her it was all I had, she gave me the change.</p><p class="calibre2">Some stores don’t like it when people try to pay with gold coins, and I was told that I should have silver coins for stores, and bronze coins or coins with holes in the center for stalls.</p><p class="calibre2">The merchant guild does currency exchange, but there is a handling charge for people not affiliated with it.</p><p class="calibre2">For a second I wondered if two gold coins would be enough to pay for my lodging, but this is a pretty cheap inn.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, it’s good to have money if I’m going to have to live in this world. I never know when I might need something.</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper told me there are coins with a hole in the middle, bronze coins, silver coins, gold coins, and platinum coins in this world.</p><p class="calibre2">One bronze coin is worth a hundred coins with a hole.</p><p class="calibre2">One silver coin is worth a hundred bronze coins.</p><p class="calibre2">One gold coin is worth a hundred silver coins.</p><p class="calibre2">One platinum coin is worth a thousand gold coins.</p><p class="calibre2">Platinum coins are used by royalty, nobility, and the richest merchants, and the average person has probably never even seen one.</p><p class="calibre2">I currently have one gold coin and ninety nine silver coins! One gold coin is actually enough for me to live for six months without doing anything. If I don’t waste money of course.</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper told me all sorts of things while I ate. One thing particularly important is that I need identification when entering a town.</p><p class="calibre2">Without it, I have to pay every time I go to a new place, and apparently some towns charge a lot.</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper had a surprised look on her face when I told her I didn’t know about this.</p><p class="calibre2">She must think it’s strange that I didn’t know, because she figures I must’ve gone through an entrance at some point, if I’m here now.</p><p class="calibre2">“To get identification, you need to join a guild or something.”</p><p class="calibre2">The common one is the adventurer guild. Everyone is accepted as long as they pay, even if they have no special skills.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s also the alchemist guild, chemist guild, merchant guild, mage guild, and more, but they won’t accept people as full-fledged members if they don’t have specific skills.</p><p class="calibre2">I chant status open in my head, and open the status panel.</p><p class="calibre2">After trying some things yesterday, I learned that I don’t have to vocalize that incantation to open it.</p><p class="calibre2">I also walked around town for a bit after coming to the inn, and learned a few things.</p><p class="calibre2">Name &ndash; (Sora Fujimiya ) / Job &ndash; (Jobless) / No Level</p><p class="calibre2">HP &ndash; 40/10 / MP &ndash; 40/10</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…30 (+1) / Stamina…30 (+1) / Agility…30 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…30 (+1) / Dexterity…30 (+1) / Luck…30 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking lv3) &ndash; Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk) &ndash; (Get one experience point with each step)</p><p class="calibre2">Experience points &ndash; 452/4000</p><p class="calibre2">Skill points &ndash; 2</p><p class="calibre2">Skills learned</p><p class="calibre2">(Appraisal lv2)</p><p class="calibre2">All sorts of things improved. The experience counter is working as described, and the number has been increasing as I walk. When it reaches a certain number, I level up.</p><p class="calibre2">All stats increased by ten when I leveled up, and now it shows (+1). Is that a correction value based on the job? That’s my best guess.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, I can use one skill point to learn the skills in the skill field. I don’t know if I can take these back after I used them, so I learned Appraisal just to check and because it seems useful, and left the rest.</p><p class="calibre2">As for skills I learned, I figure there’s two ways to level them up.</p><p class="calibre2">The first, is to just use skill points. I would have had to use two skill points to bring Appraisal up to level two, and I don’t know if there’s a limit.</p><p class="calibre2">The second, is by increasing proficiency. Proficiency increases as I use the skill, and makes the skill level up when it reaches a certain point.</p><p class="calibre2">I tried leveling up Appraisal like this, and the amount of proficiency it needs also increases with each level up.</p><p class="calibre2">Proficiency didn’t go up when I tried to appraise the same thing multiple times, but it did when I left an hour gap between appraisals.</p><p class="calibre2">Then I checked to see how many skill points it would take to bring it up to level three, since I brought it up to level two with proficiency, and it turns out I need three.</p><p class="calibre2">I guess that means the necessary points are relative to the level.</p><p class="calibre2">But the most notable thing… Is really that I’m jobless.</p><p class="calibre2">When I tried to use Appraisal on my job, it showed me all sorts of jobs I could choose, but they were all gray, just like the skills I haven’t learned, and I can’t pick any of them.</p><p class="calibre2">When I use Appraisal on the gray letters, nothing happens. Is my Appraisal level too low, or is it just that I can’t use Appraisal on them at all?</p><p class="calibre2">It’s too bad, because if I knew what I needed to change jobs, I could learn skills more effectively with that in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">That’s pretty much all I learned yesterday, and now my stomach is growling.</p><p class="calibre2">The sun is rising, and I’m starting to see people walk around on the street.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-0"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 2 &ndash; Visiting guilds</h1><p class="calibre2">My breakfast is bread, a thin meat that looks like bacon, salad, and soup.</p><p class="calibre2">Unlike the dinner I ate last night, it’s pretty plain and light on salt. I hear dinner is saltier in part to replenish the salt spent during the day.</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like the ingredients are presented as they are and without seasoning, and I can’t say it tastes good.</p><p class="calibre2">The bread is tough too, so I eat it by letting it soak in the soup.</p><p class="calibre2">I eat silently while listening to conversations around me.</p><p class="calibre2">Most people staying here are adventurers or merchants. Adventurers talk to their partners about what requests to accept, and merchants keep each other in check as they talk about what will sell and what has no hope of turning a profit.</p><p class="calibre2">I heard more useful information last night when the drunk adventurers talked about their adventures, and end up not hearing anything the innkeeper didn’t already tell me.</p><p class="calibre2">I guess that’s all I’m getting by eavesdropping, and I’m not brave enough to jump between those adventurers and start asking questions either.</p><p class="calibre2">It seems common sense doesn’t apply to drunks. Maybe that’s just prejudice on my part.</p><p class="calibre2">After I finish eating, I go back to my room and take a breather, and leave the inn after killing some time.</p><p class="calibre2">As I leave, I’m asked by the innkeeper what she should do, since I’m staying here for several days, and I ask her to just change my sheets.</p><p class="calibre2">“I should go ask questions first.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m noticing that I’ve been talking to myself a lot more lately, and decide to go to the guilds I looked into before.</p><p class="calibre2">Asking questions is free, so I make plans to go to the alchemist guild, chemist guild, merchant guild, and adventurer guild.</p><p class="calibre2">I go around them in order as I walk around town.</p><p class="calibre2">I learn that those affiliated with the alchemist guild or chemist guild have a duty to provide certain goods every month. For the alchemist guild, it’s items transmuted by that person, and for the chemist guild, it’s either a certain amount of potions or items of the same category.</p><p class="calibre2">People affiliated with the merchant guild have to pay a monthly membership fee. Also, people have to register with the guild if they’re going to do business. If they don’t, and start trading on their own, a lot of pressure is put on them, the worst of which being that a directive will go out to bar them from doing business, making it so they can’t buy or sell goods.</p><p class="calibre2">The registration fee is one silver coin, and the monthly fee is one silver coin minimum.</p><p class="calibre2">But that’s only the minimum, as people rank up depending on how much they pay, and receive more benefits as they rank up. For example, they receive priority in business involving rare items.</p><p class="calibre2">The merchant guild also buys monster materials and items, which leads me to question if this doesn’t overlap with what the adventurer guild also does. But apparently that’s not a problem, and I’m politely told it’s actually a system put in place to prevent a monopoly, and stop prices from skyrocketing.</p><p class="calibre2">A pass that lets people enter and exit towns freely only costs one silver coin? Isn’t that pretty cheap?</p><p class="calibre2">The last guild I visit is kind of what I figure is the right choice for me, the adventurer guild.</p><p class="calibre2">To be perfectly honest, I have no good feelings towards this country, so I think I want to leave eventually. And I imagine I’m going to be at least somewhat strong.</p><p class="calibre2">This is a fantasy world with skills and magic. On Earth, if I went abroad, there were dangerous places where public order was so bad that my life could even be at risk, but this world is actually even more dangerous.</p><p class="calibre2">It was unthinkable in Japan, but here, a lot of people carry deadly weapons around as they go about their daily lives, and anyone can have them.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t really know the social etiquette of this world, but if something happens that causes someone to attack me or a fight to break out, it could turn very ugly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Welcome to the adventurer guild. Is this your first time here?”</p><p class="calibre2">I heard that this place is packed early in the morning, as people scramble to accept requests, so I avoided that time period. Now the place is almost empty.</p><p class="calibre2">But it’s not like it’s completely deserted. There are people gathered in the place here in the guild where people can eat and drink, and someone is talking to a receptionist.</p><p class="calibre2">I focus my ears on those two, and it feels like he’s hitting on her.</p><p class="calibre2">I say yes, it is my first time here, and she tells me her name is Mikaru and she’s fifteen. She’s been a receptionist in this guild for a year, and she’s saying she’s happy she’s graduated from being a newbie.</p><p class="calibre2">But what about the guild?</p><p class="calibre2">I try to get the conversation back on track.</p><p class="calibre2">There are six adventurer ranks, S, A, B, C, D, and E. S being the highest, and E being the lowest.</p><p class="calibre2">To go up in rank, one has to complete requests, and failure to complete them comes with a penalty.</p><p class="calibre2">But adventurers can only rank up normally up to rank A. To be elevated to rank S, they have to complete a few designated quests, and receive a recommendation from the guild master.</p><p class="calibre2">As adventurers rank up, they can accept more difficult quests, and receive higher rewards. It’s all about high risk and high reward.</p><p class="calibre2">Rank also affects the period of time when one has to complete a quest. If one fails to complete a quest for a certain period of time, they will be demoted if they are rank D or above, or lose their status in the guild if they are rank E. For example, rank E adventurers have to at least complete a quest once every thirty days.</p><p class="calibre2">They can register again, but the registration fee will be high.</p><p class="calibre2">If this happens a few times, it will be deemed that they aren’t really serious about this, and their registration will be rejected. The number of times this has to happen before they’re rejected isn’t clear, and apparently it varies from guild to guild.</p><p class="calibre2">I ask if that means they can just re-apply in another adventurer guild, but it doesn’t look like it’s that easy.</p><p class="calibre2">“When you are ready to accept a quest, bring one here from the wall over there and so we can process it. Report regular quests here, and go to the purchasing counter to settle matters related to materials. Is there anything you don’t understand?”</p><p class="calibre2">“About quests to defeat monsters… Do I bring the monsters here without taking them apart?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It depends on the monster. There are some we won’t buy, but as for parts that can be used as materials, we will subtract a fee from your reward if we need to take the monsters apart. We also charge a disposal fee for some monsters, so be careful about that. Like goblins, goblins, and goblins.”</p><p class="calibre2">Does she have a grudge against goblins?</p><p class="calibre2">I ask myself if I have any further questions, and decide it’s enough for now.</p><p class="calibre2">Then I wonder if I should register with the adventurer guild, but since there are safe, low paying quests that can be completed here in town, I decide to register.</p><p class="calibre2">This won’t be enough for me to make a living once I run out of money, but these quests are pretty convenient for me, so I can’t complain.</p><p class="calibre2"> <a href="https://hidamarisoutranslations.com/walking-in-another-world/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3">Index</a> </p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-30"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 3 &ndash; Adventurer registration and equipment</h1><p class="calibre2">After paying the registration fee, three silver coins, I put a drop of blood on a card put out in front of me.</p><p class="calibre2">If I didn’t pay this fee now, it would have been taken from my rewards when I started working.</p><p class="calibre2">The card sucks in my blood, shines for a second, and turns black. After I’m handed the card, it turns white after a while.</p><p class="calibre2">When the person registered to it holds the card, the color changes depending on the holder’s rank.</p><p class="calibre2">If I lose this card, I can ask for a reissue, but I’ll have to pay for it. Ten silver coins to be exact, so I better make sure I hold on to it.</p><p class="calibre2">While Mikaru is explaining all this to me, a man boldly makes a move on the receptionist next to us.</p><p class="calibre2">I didn’t mention it before, but all the receptionists here are beautiful. On Earth, they could all be idols. The men on the other hand are all rugged like bandits.</p><p class="calibre2">I haven’t seen any good-looking guys, at least not in the guild. I’ve seen some in town, walking alongside women.</p><p class="calibre2">As I get up from my seat, another guy immediately slides into it and starts talking. It’s not about quests or anything either, he’s inviting her to go have a meal together.</p><p class="calibre2">I guess it’s almost lunch time, but I go accept a few quests.</p><p class="calibre2">The man is shot down and leaves, and I return to Mikaru to hand her the documents for the quests.</p><p class="calibre2">I was worried that maybe I couldn’t accept multiple quests at the same time, but some of them don’t have to be completed today, so it’s fine.</p><p class="calibre2">These delivery type quests range from five coins with a hole to ten. That’s really not a lot.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t know when these quests were even put out, so I can’t help but feel like it would be quicker if the person that put them out did them themselves.</p><p class="calibre2">I start to consider that they might be here as a way to help novice adventurers, but they’re actually harder than I expected.</p><p class="calibre2">Carrying heavy packages and walking from one corner of town to another would be pretty exhausting for a normal person. Walking from one corner to the other is easily over ten thousand steps.</p><p class="calibre2">But it’s no problem for me, as my skill makes it so walking never makes me tired.</p><p class="calibre2">These quests actually let me kill two birds with one stone, since I’m making money and earning experience points. And since my stats also increase as I level up, maybe that’s actually three birds. The rewards are really low though.</p><p class="calibre2">For a while, I follow the routine of studying in the guild’s library in the morning, and accepting delivery quests when I’m done with that.</p><p class="calibre2">Five delivery quests aren’t enough to even pay for one night in the inn, so if I just keep going like this, I’m going to run out of money eventually.</p><p class="calibre2">I start thinking about material collection quests. These aren’t about monster materials, but rather things like medicinal herbs and materials used for alchemy. I’ve been studying them in the library, and at the very least I remember what they look like, so I’m not worried about that. Especially since I can use Appraisal to know what things are right away.</p><p class="calibre2">Now I just need to look into where to get them.</p><p class="calibre2">Depending on the materials, I might have to go to the forest, which puts me at risk of being attacked by monsters. I guess this is the time to get my equipment in order.</p><p class="calibre2">I take the day off from accepting quests, and go out shopping for equipment.</p><p class="calibre2">People are actually worried about me because I’ve been accepting quests without so much as a day off. I was told that resting one’s body is part of an adventurer’s job, and the person saying it seemed pretty serious about it too.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s true though. No adventurer diligently accepts quests every day like this. Some diligently hit on the girls every day though.</p><p class="calibre2">I stop by a weapon shop, that actually sells defensive equipment too.</p><p class="calibre2">This place has a good reputation, and the owner is a former adventurer that seems like he’ll be kind enough to give me good advice.</p><p class="calibre2">This store was actually recommended to me when I was accepting delivery quests.</p><p class="calibre2">“Welcome. What are you looking for?”</p><p class="calibre2">He calls out to me while I look at weapons.</p><p class="calibre2">Is it because there’s no one else here? His attitude is more modest than his burly physique would suggest.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m a rookie adventurer… Sir. I was thinking about going outside to collect materials, so I’m here looking for equipment.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou…”</p><p class="calibre2">He’s looking at me like he’s evaluating me.</p><p class="calibre2">My stats have been going up, so I feel like saying I’m not the same as I was before, but my appearance didn’t change at all, so I can’t deny it if someone says I look unreliable.</p><p class="calibre2">Compared to other adventurers, I’m thin and short. I would be average on Earth, and my body can be best described by saying there’s nothing worth describing. I can’t say I have any real muscle either.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you have any weapons and equipment in mind? Can you use magic? And don’t feel like you need to be so polite.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I was thinking about buying a sword… And as for the equipment, I think I want something light that’s easy to move in. But I don’t want to get hurt, so I want something that protects me from pain too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s a tough order. A one-handed sword should be good… As for the rest, do you want monster skin clothing or a breastplate? The clothing would be cheaper and easier to move in.”</p><p class="calibre2">So the clothing is better? I guess I should also get a knife to strip away materials and a bag for them. I tell him I also want protection for the back of my hands that won’t hinder my movements, and boots fit to walk in the forest. I also mention that my budget is one gold coin.</p><p class="calibre2">He’s surprised that a novice has that much to spend, but I respond that I don’t want to be stingy with what could save my life.</p><p class="calibre2">I put an emphasis on the fact that I’m willing to use everything I have, to try to get a discount. In the end, I manage to get some pretty nice equipment.</p><p class="calibre2">The monster skin clothes in particular are stab-proof, and have a damage reducing effect.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s not like that makes me want to take damage any more, but it’s nice to be prepared.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre2">I ask, about the discount, but he wishes me good luck with a smile on his face.</p><p class="calibre2">People in the castle were trash, but a lot of the regular people here in town are kind and friendly. I thank him, and exit the weapon store.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2"> <a href="https://hidamarisoutranslations.com/walking-in-another-world/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3">Index</a> </p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-21"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 4 &ndash; Medicinal herb picking and first battle</h1><p class="calibre2">I borrow the inn’s backyard to do some light sword swings.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve never handled a sword before, but strangely enough, I don’t feel uncomfortable and I can swing it pretty smoothly.</p><p class="calibre2">Is this the blessing of the skill?</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve learned a few more.</p><p class="calibre2">Acquired skills</p><p class="calibre2">(Appraisal Lv4) (Appraisal Obstruction Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">(Sword Master Lv1) (Physical Strengthening Lv4) (Presence Detection Lv3)</p><p class="calibre2">(Magic Energy Control Lv3) (Basic Daily Life Magic Lv3)</p><p class="calibre2">Everything except for Appraisal Obstruction has been leveled up via proficiency.</p><p class="calibre2">I used skill points to level up Appraisal Obstruction because its proficiency wouldn’t increase no matter what I did.</p><p class="calibre2">I leveled up Appraisal Obstruction because I figured that since I learned Appraisal, other people can learn it too.</p><p class="calibre2">But even with my Appraisal skill at level three, I still can’t use it on people.</p><p class="calibre2">Maybe I was too quick to spend skill points on Appraisal Obstruction, but then again, there might be more items that have the Appraisal effect like that crystal.</p><p class="calibre2">I told myself that if I left it alone and others used it on me, I wouldn’t be able to take it back.</p><p class="calibre2">I guess I just need to walk more and earn back the skill points I spent.</p><p class="calibre2">As for Appraisal itself, I won’t know what happens unless I level it up a little more. I’ll just keep using it on things and wait patiently for it to level up by itself.</p><p class="calibre2">Sword Master is a skill that improves my handling of a sword. I tried to swing a sword without it at first, but it didn’t go well, so I learned it. I can level it up just by swinging a sword.</p><p class="calibre2">Physical Strengthening gains proficiency when I push my body to its limits, but if I go overboard, I’ll end up with bad muscular pain. I learned that lesson the hard way when I was testing how much weight I can lift.</p><p class="calibre2">Presence Detection is exactly what it sounds like, a skill to detect others’ presences around me. Leveling up increases its range, and makes it so I can sense things more deeply. At level one it was just a faint feeling, but I’m starting to feel more what kind of presence it is.</p><p class="calibre2">Magic Energy Control allows me to feel the magic energy on my body. This isn’t really that useful by itself, but it makes it so I don’t waste magic energy when I activate magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Basic Daily Life Magic includes different kinds of magic like Purification and Firestarter.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently there are baths in this world, but in cheap inns all you get is a wet towel to scrub your body. It’s not an exaggeration to say I learned this one just to wash myself. Firestarter will also be useful when I start working outside of town.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave the city, and while I’m expecting to return before lunch, I’m a careful guy, so I don’t forget to bring preserved food with me.</p><p class="calibre2">It wasn’t good when I tried it before, so I’d rather not have to depend on it.</p><p class="calibre2">“I haven’t seen you before. Are you an adventurer?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m going outside for the first time, because I accepted a medicinal herb picking quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I see. You shouldn’t say the contents of the quests you accepted. You never know who might be listening. Also, the forest in the outskirts should be fine, but monsters sometimes wander in, so be careful.”</p><p class="calibre2">I pass through the gate and follow the road for about thirty minutes, until I see a forest to my left and head that way. There’s a river flowing through the forest, and medicinal herbs grow near its banks.</p><p class="calibre2">I see there are others who come here to pick medicinal herbs, because there’s a trampled path that makes it easier to walk through the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk carefully with presence detection active, but don’t feel any living beings around me.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk for another thirty minutes, and reach the medicinal herbs I’m here for.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Appraisal to only pick medicinal herbs in good condition, and pick magic energy herbs that are mixed in here too.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t forget vitality and detoxing herbs too, but I heard that it’s common courtesy to leave some, because if I pick too much there won’t be any left.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, I think I got a good amount.</p><p class="calibre2">This is what Appraisal is all about. There are simple herbs mixed in here too, so it would be necessary to memorize the herbs’ shapes in order to not pick them by mistake.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, freshness is important, so withered and immature herbs get a bad evaluation. In some cases, they might not even count and be discarded altogether.</p><p class="calibre2">I put the herbs in a bag made specifically to preserve their freshness.</p><p class="calibre2">I get up, as I’m thinking it’s time to go back, and my Presence Detection picks up something.</p><p class="calibre2">Six presences coming this way, and moving very fast.</p><p class="calibre2">I hide while making sure to pay attention to the presences.</p><p class="calibre2">Just as I’m done hiding, I see six things jumping out, two people and four monsters. Are the monsters wolves? I read that they’re very agile and hard to take down, but if one can deal with that speed, they’re not much of a threat.</p><p class="calibre2">One of the two people steps forward with twin swords in hand, and the other is holding a staff, and steps back. The person holding the staff is breathing heavily.</p><p class="calibre2">A wolf jumps at the person with the twin swords, who skillfully evades it.</p><p class="calibre2">The twin swords owner is about to use that opportunity to strike, but another wolf gets in the way.</p><p class="calibre2">I thought the one holding the staff would support the other, but that person is still just trying to catch their breath.</p><p class="calibre2">I figured their opponents were just too fast, but apparently that’s not it. The one holding the staff is using it to support their body.</p><p class="calibre2">It takes me a second to think, and another one to act.</p><p class="calibre2">As a wolf is starting to jump, I throw my knife used to take monsters apart.</p><p class="calibre2">The wolf can’t dodge in mid-air, and the knife pierces it. It’s just luck.</p><p class="calibre2">After I got lucky with my sneak attack, I swing my sword at another one, whose movements have been dulled.</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like I got it, and after checking that it’s not moving, I look for my next prey.</p><p class="calibre2">But what I see are three wolves lying on the ground, and the twin swords user standing tall.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-11"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 5 &ndash; Encounter</h1><p class="calibre2">Now that I really think about what I did, I realize it was pretty reckless.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t know what would’ve happened to those two if I did nothing, but I’ve been warned before that stepping in and taking others’ prey can cause problems, so I should be careful about that.</p><p class="calibre2">Did I overstep my boundaries in a way?</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry.”</p><p class="calibre2">I guess I should just apologize.</p><p class="calibre2">The twin swords user looks a bit surprised, but awkwardly laughs after realizing what I’m talking about.</p><p class="calibre2">“You saved us when we were in a pinch. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Now that things have calmed down, I realize she’s a girl.</p><p class="calibre2">She has evenly cut silver hair that reaches down to her shoulders, and her red eyes are looking at me with interest.</p><p class="calibre2">But I’m a guy, so my eyes naturally go a bit below her face, even though I was trying not to let them do that.</p><p class="calibre2">The adventurer holding a staff is also a girl. The face I see as she takes off her hood seems young, especially with her blond twintails flowing in the wind.</p><p class="calibre2">Her body is small, and she looks like she has a great future ahead of her.</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">She speaks like she’s whispering, and bows.</p><p class="calibre2">“How do you divide the spoils in a situation like this? I’m a new adventurer, so I don’t really know the rules very well.”</p><p class="calibre2">They look surprised. Why is that?</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s pretty hard for a novice to take down a wolf. And you did it so easily too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve actually only been an adventurer for ten days. I’m only here for a quest to collect medicinal herbs. I think I only took it down because my weapon is good.”</p><p class="calibre2">The sword pierced the wolf without much resistance. Thank you for the good weapon, old man.</p><p class="calibre2">Thinking back to the feeling of the sword piercing the meat makes my hands shake. It was a monster, but I did kill a living being.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you all right?”</p><p class="calibre2">Suddenly, I realize the twintails are swaying right in front of me.</p><p class="calibre2">I look down, and my eyes meet their owner’s.</p><p class="calibre2">The surprise makes me take a step back, and I try to disguise how flustered that made me.</p><p class="calibre2">“What do we do with this? I’ve never taken apart a wolf or anything.”</p><p class="calibre2">I know the necessary parts and materials, because I looked over some documents.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m pretty sure I remember how they’re supposed to be taken apart too. But even though they’re monsters, taking them apart might make me throw up.</p><p class="calibre2">Now that the adrenaline is wearing off, it’s hard to even look at blood, because I’m not used to it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Of course we will take them apart. We don’t want to throw money away. I can teach you if want.”</p><p class="calibre2">She says with a grin, like she saw right through me.</p><p class="calibre2">I might as well do it. It will tell me if I can do this sort of thing from now on too.</p><p class="calibre2">But first, we introduce ourselves.</p><p class="calibre2">The twin swords user’s name is Rurika, and the magic user with the staff introduces herself as Chris.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t know if she’s reserved or wary, but she’s standing a step further away than Rurika.</p><p class="calibre2">But apparently, sometimes she does things without even thinking. Before, when she suddenly approached me, it was probably because her concern surpassed her wariness. At least that’s what Rurika tells me.</p><p class="calibre2">“Rurika, go rest for a bit. You haven’t recovered your magic energy yet, have you?”</p><p class="calibre2">Chris sits down and tries to compose her breath, just like Rurika says.</p><p class="calibre2">And then she suddenly pulls her hood over her head, like she just remembered it.</p><p class="calibre2">“She had to push herself too much when we were running. There are probably a lot more dead wolves in the forest. It looks like we have to give up on this one.”</p><p class="calibre2">We chat while she tells me how to take the wolves apart.</p><p class="calibre2">They’re a D ranked adventurer duo that accepted a quest to retrieve some killer bee honey, but encountered a pack of wolves on the way.</p><p class="calibre2">They managed to throw the whole pack into disarray with magic, but some left the others to chase them. Chris managed to take some down with magic as they ran, but ran out of magic energy, so they ended up leading the wolves here.</p><p class="calibre2">I ask if it wouldn’t be worse to take them on in an open space like this, and she says she was planning to hang on until Chris recovered some magic energy.</p><p class="calibre2">She also tells me that fighting wolves in the forest is actually tougher.</p><p class="calibre2">She’s more than good enough to take on a wolf if it’s alone, even if they’re in the forest, but it’s different if several attack at the same time. They use the trees well to attack.</p><p class="calibre2">“It looks like our honey quest is a failure. We can’t get it with a pack of wolves nearby. Ah… But is the guild going to let it go without a penalty? And we’re so close to rank C too…”</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently, depending on the scale, dealing with a pack of wolves can be a rank B job. When they form packs, there’s even a small chance that a unique variant will be born, and if that happens, the difficulty level shoots up.</p><p class="calibre2">“And I guess this is more or less how you take wolves apart…”</p><p class="calibre2">I did a good job, not throwing up.</p><p class="calibre2">Let’s just not talk about how it turned out. There’s a first time for everyone.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-1"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 6 &ndash; Reporting a completed quest</h1><p class="calibre2">“Coming back with a ‘flower in each hand’ uh? Where did you go to hit on girls?”</p><p class="calibre2">Just do your job. Shouldn’t you ask us for our guild cards first to check if we can go in?</p><p class="calibre2">Is that the first thing you say when people get here?</p><p class="calibre2">I silently hand him my guild card, and the gatekeeper checks it without complaining.</p><p class="calibre2">Isn’t being too friendly a problem? Is he just bored because no one else is here right now? Is he actually just jealous because he’s single? It’s not like we’re close or anything.</p><p class="calibre2">The two girls silently enter the city too.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s go to the adventurer guild first. We’ll thank you for helping us afterwards.”</p><p class="calibre2">We enter the guild together, and I feel a lot of eyes on us.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve been here a few times, but this never happened before.</p><p class="calibre2">Hm… Are we drawing attention because we’re a strange group? There’s nothing wrong about that, so I wish the death stares would stop.</p><p class="calibre2">“See you later.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says Rurika, seemingly not bothered at all, and I feel the atmosphere here get worse.</p><p class="calibre2">And I just accepted a simple quest too…</p><p class="calibre2">“I have the medicinal herbs.”</p><p class="calibre2">I deliver the medicinal herbs I picked to Mikaru.</p><p class="calibre2">The quest is about delivering a set of ten medicinal herbs, so if I deliver more sets of ten, it’s like I completed more quests.</p><p class="calibre2">This type of medicinal herb is used to make potions, so there’s always an active quest to gather them.</p><p class="calibre2">This means that if I accept a quest to take down ten wolves, but take down thirty, it still only counts as that one quest to take down ten. Of course, magic stones and materials can still be sold.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why were those two with you?”</p><p class="calibre2">So someone’s curious over here too. Her eyes are brimming with interest.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… I was in the place that was recommended to me to pick medicinal herbs, and we bumped into each other when they were being chased by wolves.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Chased by wolves?”</p><p class="calibre2">Mikaru sounds surprised, because she knows the duo of Rurika and Chris is pretty strong.</p><p class="calibre2">The adventurers that are listening in on our conversation also look surprised, and the guild suddenly becomes noisy.</p><p class="calibre2">Guild employees that are talking to Rurika and Chris run to the back of the guild, and after a while come back with a man.</p><p class="calibre2">The adventurers all go quiet when they see him, and everyone’s eyes are drawn to this man.</p><p class="calibre2">“Can you explain it to me again?”</p><p class="calibre2">His demeanor is soft, but his eyes are sharp.</p><p class="calibre2">In the completely silent guild, Rurika’s voice echoes. And when she’s done talking, the guild becomes noisy again.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s a pack of wolves in the forest relatively close to the city.</p><p class="calibre2">This is dangerous for adventurers and requires special attention, especially since that forest is visited by a lot of novice adventurers looking for medicinal herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">The man stands up and starts giving instructions.</p><p class="calibre2">A few parties that were taking a break here in the guild also request to participate, and some guild employees run outside to alert the other guilds and contact the gatekeepers.</p><p class="calibre2">“We can leave the rest to the guild master. Let’s go sell the wolves.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika comes to me after she’s done talking, and the three of us go to the purchasing counter.</p><p class="calibre2">No one is looking at us anymore, even though we’re walking together. Was that information that shocking? Everyone seems busy. I’m guessing they’re happy because they know why we’re together in the first place too.</p><p class="calibre2">As I expected, they assess the materials and tell me the materials from the wolves I took apart are bad.</p><p class="calibre2">I try to tell myself it’s normal for a beginner, to encourage myself.</p><p class="calibre2">I receive half the reward for the materials. I ask them why we’re not splitting it three ways, but Rurika tells me not to worry about it.</p><p class="calibre2">She says a beginner should just take what he can, and that they’ll buy me dinner to thank me.</p><p class="calibre2">I go back to the inn, leave my equipment there, and head to an inn they told me about. But before I leave, I make sure to tell the innkeeper I’m not eating here tonight. If I tell her ahead of time, I get a free lunch some other day, since I’m skipping dinner.</p><p class="calibre2">I was told this after coming back to the inn to have lunch while I was doing delivery quests.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently the fact that I’m paying for multiple days in a row has an effect on this too.</p><p class="calibre2">I think she feels like if she gives me perks like this, I’ll pay for multiple nights straight again. She has a strong merchant spirit.</p><p class="calibre2">I reach the inn I was told about, and stop abruptly.</p><p class="calibre2">Part of it is because it’s close to the center of the city I guess, but it’s completely different from the inn I’m staying in. The outer walls are all painted, and the whole place exudes cleanliness.</p><p class="calibre2">The first floor is a dining hall, but all the tables are neatly lined up, and there’s enough space between them. I feel like it wouldn’t be cramped even if the place was full.</p><p class="calibre2">When I say why I’m here, I’m taken to a private room.</p><p class="calibre2">After waiting for a bit, Rurika and Chris enter too. Chris is still wearing her hood.</p><p class="calibre2">“Thanks for waiting. I ordered some food, but is there anything you want to eat? Or can’t eat?”</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t really understand, so I leave it to them.</p><p class="calibre2">If I don’t like it, I’ll think about it then. I’m not going to get anything out of the menu either. There’s a lot of ingredients in this world I still don’t understand.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-31"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 7 &ndash; Objective</h1><p class="calibre2">“Thank you for today. Cheers.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says Rurika, and we start eating.</p><p class="calibre2">I haven’t seen any of this stuff, and one bite is enough to surprise me with how good it is.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s simply good. Everything has its own characteristic flavor, and it was clearly made with the enjoyment of the eater in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s good…”</p><p class="calibre2">Those words leak out of my mouth.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s my first time eating something in this world that rivals what I ate in the world I came from.</p><p class="calibre2">At first I eat carefully, but before I know it, I’m wolfing it down.</p><p class="calibre2">I hear laughter, and when I raise my head, I see Chris laughing.</p><p class="calibre2">She undid her twintails, so her hair is flowing down. She looks mature at first glance, but once she starts laughing, she looks young again.</p><p class="calibre2">She notices me looking at her, and flusteredly looks towards Rurika like she’s asking for help.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika starts talking, and she sounds almost exasperated.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m glad you like it. I chose this inn because it’s said to be good even by the standards of the capital. Even though an additional charge must be paid to eat this.”</p><p class="calibre2">It’s probably worth the price, although I’m scared to ask what it is. And I actually wanted to eat more normal food anyway.</p><p class="calibre2">We finish eating, and start chatting.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I hear that they didn’t receive a penalty for failing to complete their honey gathering quest, and then we talk more about their work as adventurers.</p><p class="calibre2">I want to know more about what adventurers do, but I also learn that they came from a different country.</p><p class="calibre2">They were adventurers in their home country until they were promoted to rank D, and then they moved from country to country while accepting escorting quests.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re from the Republic of Eldo. It was a nice place.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve heard that the Republic of Eldo is a country where humans and demi-humans live together.</p><p class="calibre2">In this world, demi-humans are races like beast people, elves, and dwarves. This really is a fantasy world. Races that were only imaginary where I came from are normal here.</p><p class="calibre2">I haven’t met any yet, but there could be at least one that’s an adventurer.</p><p class="calibre2">There are seven big countries in this world.</p><p class="calibre2">The Borsheil Empire, which touts human supremacy and denounces others as evil.</p><p class="calibre2">The Kingdom of Elesya, where the idea that humans are superior is common.</p><p class="calibre2">The Republic of Eldo, where many races live together.</p><p class="calibre2">The Beast Kingdom of Lath, ruled by the beast people’s king.</p><p class="calibre2">The Holy Kingdom of Frieren, where people worship a goddess.</p><p class="calibre2">The Magic State of Efa, where those who research sorcery gather.</p><p class="calibre2">The Dragon Kingdom of Hafre, a country of people that worship dragons.</p><p class="calibre2">There have been small wars throughout history, but there hadn’t been any major wars between countries in a hundred years.</p><p class="calibre2">But ten years ago, the Borsheil Empire declared war on the Republic of Eldo, and war broke out.</p><p class="calibre2">It wasn’t too large at first, but eventually all seven large countries got involved.</p><p class="calibre2">Attacking countries, defending countries, countries that stuck to neutrality…</p><p class="calibre2">The world was being exhausted, but the war had no end in sight.</p><p class="calibre2">But three years ago, in the Holy Kingdom of Frieren… It started with a holy woman, and then the chief priest received a divine message from the goddess.</p><p class="calibre2">“The demon king has returned. Loved ones, join forces and fight.”</p><p class="calibre2">At first, rulers dismissed this as nonsense, but when well-coordinated monsters started appearing, a ceasefire was called to drive them back.</p><p class="calibre2">They are still coming from a dark forest called demon forest, and attacking nearby kingdoms.</p><p class="calibre2">“Were you born here, Sora? Your equipment is pretty good for a beginner, so were you actually born to a good family?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I came from a place a little far away to make a living as an adventurer. I saved money, learned how to fight, and I want to go around and see the world.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m not really interested in that demon king. It doesn’t even feel real to me, and I have no reason to hate it or anything.</p><p class="calibre2">If I really want to dig for a reason, I guess it’s the demon king’s fault I was summoned to this world. But those people in the castle irritate me the most. I wouldn’t fight even if they begged me.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, it’s not like I don’t want to become powerful in this world.</p><p class="calibre2">I’d be lying if I said I don’t want power. I might actually become powerful one day because of this skill.</p><p class="calibre2">I think part of it is because I want to be better than those people too…</p><p class="calibre2">“See the world… That’s a funny motive.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it? I’m pretty serious about it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see I see.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika is staring at me while I talk.</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like she’s sizing me up. Like she’s probing for something.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you doing tomorrow? I assume you’re going to rest after completing a quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m probably going to be checking the delivery quests.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Delivery quests? Are you the delivery man people have been talking about?”</p><p class="calibre2">Delivery man?</p><p class="calibre2">I ask her what she means, and apparently adventurers have been talking about this weird person that’s been silently going around doing delivery quests no one wants to do.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s safe here in town, and I’m new here, so I figured it was a good way to remember the streets and paths.”</p><p class="calibre2">Walking around helps me remember where stores are, and remembering paths can be useful if I ever need an escape route.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’ve been doing those hard quests…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Incredible…”</p><p class="calibre2">Their honest praise tickles, but it was partially because of my skill, and also because I wasn’t brave enough to leave the city.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-22"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 8 &ndash; Training</h1><p class="calibre2">“It’s probably fate or something that we met, so how about we accept a quest together?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I just became an adventurer, you know? And didn’t you say you’re almost C rank?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ll get there once we complete a few more quests. What do you think, Chris?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I think it’s fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">“See? Honestly, the two of us have been completing quests, but it can be a bit tough for two people to handle stuff like what happened today.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m sure there’s plenty of people out there that will join your party.”</p><p class="calibre2">Thinking back, those stares that I got when we entered the guild were all about jealousy.</p><p class="calibre2">“We have been approached, but I didn’t feel the same spark that I feel right now. Not to mention that they all seemed to have ulterior motives, and Chris didn’t feel good about them either.”</p><p class="calibre2">In a way, it can’t be helped. They’re clearly good looking, and after talking to them, it becomes clear that their personalities match their looks.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika is cheerful and easy to talk to, and while Chris isn’t proactive in starting conversations, there’s a strange aura about her that makes me feel at ease just by having her around.</p><p class="calibre2">I might be wrong, because I basically just met them, but that’s how I feel.</p><p class="calibre2">“Also, as your seniors, we can teach you all sorts of things about being an adventurer. And… We can do mock fights to practice fighting. You have a sharp slash, but the way you swung your sword felt off, like the sword was swinging you.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m an amateur when it comes to using a sword. I’m basically using it in a sort of forced way with the skill.</p><p class="calibre2">These conditions seem too good for me. I feel like there has to be a catch.</p><p class="calibre2">But this is also a good chance. I want to know the basics of fighting. I thought about putting out a quest with the guild, but I’d need money for that.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right, I’ll give it a shot. You’re not going to stay in this country forever, are you? Then I’ll be with you for the time being.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, we’re thinking about looking for a nice escorting quest when we reach C rank, and moving. Anyway, give me half your day tomorrow. There’s somewhere I want to go.”</p><p class="calibre2">And so, the plan for tomorrow is to accept delivery quests in the morning, and meet her in the afternoon.</p><p class="calibre2">　◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">I go to the guild early in the morning, and it really is crowded. A lot of people are looking at the quests affixed to the wall, and some are even fighting over specific quests.</p><p class="calibre2">No one’s in front of the delivery quests. I check the details, and take three to the reception. I’m glad it’s not as crowded over here.</p><p class="calibre2">I finish the quests in the morning, just as I expected.</p><p class="calibre2">My Walking skill is level twenty, and I have four spare skill points.</p><p class="calibre2">What should I learn? Healing magic? Offensive magic? I don’t know what kind of magic I can learn, so I should look into it first.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry I kept you waiting.”</p><p class="calibre2">I go where we agreed to meet, and Rurika is waiting for me by herself.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right, let’s go. Chris stayed back, because it looks like she’s still tired. She’s not the best at running around like that.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika then takes me to the store where I bought all my equipment.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hello young lady. And the lad that bought all that equipment from me. Is there a problem with anything I sold?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re here today because we need weapons for a mock fight. Do you have anything good?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I have swords with busted tips and wooden swords, which one? The wooden swords are cheaper.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Can you adjust the weight? Of course, as a freebie~.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I can’t win against you. A one handed sword and twin swords then?”</p><p class="calibre2">We leave, and head to a training area here in town.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s mostly used by guards, but other people can use it too if there’s room. There’s one in the adventurer guild too, but I guess we would stand out too much there.</p><p class="calibre2">Luckily, there is an open space in the corner, so that’s where we’ll do our mock fighting.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I get a lecture on the basics of how to swing a sword and fight. Then we fight, and she points out what I’m doing wrong, and I repeat while trying to correct it.</p><p class="calibre2">Clashing swords with another person really is better than just doing practice swings. Proficiency increases faster too. One thing that’s particularly good is that when I attack someone instead of just doing practice swings, I have to take my opponent’s movements into consideration, so I’m using my head as well as my body.</p><p class="calibre2">We keep going for a while, and when it’s over, I’m so tired I can’t stand up. Rurika is fine, she’s not even out of breath. Is this because of the experience gap between us?</p><p class="calibre2">We were going at it pretty hard too, so I have a lot of bruises.</p><p class="calibre2">At first, some people looked over here with interest and jealousy, as they saw me training with a girl, but as the exchange of blows intensified, their stares turned into pity.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, you did pretty good for the first day. And don’t forget to carry that with you when you’re going around doing quests. I want to train when you have the time. Ah, but if you don’t want to carry that around, you can use a real sword. Which one do you prefer?”</p><p class="calibre2">A wooden sword, obviously. I’m not brave enough to swing a real sword at another person. A wooden sword can cause a lot of damage too, depending on where it hits, but it still feels completely different.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s go look for a quest tomorrow. I hope there are quests to take down monsters, but if there aren’t we’ll figure something out then.”</p><p class="calibre2">I get up, and use purification magic, both on me and on Rurika.</p><p class="calibre2">At first she’s really happy, and then she sulks because she says it’s not fair that I can use magic.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-12"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 9 &ndash; Goblin hunting &ndash; Part one</h1><p class="calibre2">“Look at this… It’s still here.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika mumbles in front of a quest document.</p><p class="calibre2">I look over her shoulder, and see it’s a quest from a nearby village about taking down goblins.</p><p class="calibre2">Goblins are seen as the weakest monsters, along with slime. Those two are classic examples of monsters novice adventurers fight first, but the only materials that can be harvested from them are magic stones, so they’re not worth much. However, they’re seen as low risk monsters that are good to build experience.</p><p class="calibre2">This quest has been here for five days, and no one has accepted it.</p><p class="calibre2">The reason is simple. The village is three days away by foot, and one day by wagon. But the cost of renting a wagon would be pretty much the same as the reward for completing the quest, and whoever accepts it could even end up losing money.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s not a problem for people with their own wagon, but most people who do are high rank adventurers, who aren’t going to go out of their way to hunt goblins.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn… It would be perfect if a horsebus just happened to pass there, but walking for three days…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is there a problem?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Camping is a hassle in itself, but someone would have to keep watch at all times, meaning we wouldn’t rest very well. It was really tough when the two of us walked for ten days… We didn’t have money back then…”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika says while looking into the distance. I probably shouldn’t ask any more about that.</p><p class="calibre2">“Would it still be tough with three people? I don’t have a lot of experience camping, so I honestly don’t know.”</p><p class="calibre2">The experience I do have is from camping by myself in the real world. Back then, I pitched my tent and slept on dedicated sites, so I didn’t have to worry about anything dangerous. That means the situation is completely different. All the tools I used were ones that were very easy to use too.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t even know how high or low the probability of countering monsters on the side of the main road is.</p><p class="calibre2">“It would be a little easier with three people, and it would be a good experience that doubles as training. It’s still warm, so a robe would probably be enough to sleep at night… We probably won’t encounter many monsters if we travel by the main road, so if we watch out for bandits…”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika mumbles to herself, and herself and Chris talk about something, before declaring they want to accept the quest.</p><p class="calibre2">“This one please.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum… Are the three of you going to accept it together?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes yes. I want to teach this newbie here how to be an adventurer. I say that smugly, but it’s partially to repay him for helping us before too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. Then I will fill out the paperwork accordingly.”</p><p class="calibre2">It looks like there won’t be a problem.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ll buy what we need today and leave tomorrow. We have to inform our inns too. We don’t know when we’ll be back, so we should cancel our stay. I’m sure they’ll at least kind of understand if we explain the reason.”</p><p class="calibre2">We buy food and healing potions, and check if we have everything we need to camp. If anything is missing, we have to buy it.</p><p class="calibre2">Healing potions are surprisingly expensive, but I guess they’re cheap if I think about it as buying things that might save my life.</p><p class="calibre2">We buy monster repellent too, but we’re not planning to use it. We’re taking it with us just in case.</p><p class="calibre2">As for food, we buy things that will keep for a while, and since Rurika and Chris have simple cookware, that’s what we’ll be using. I just have to buy tableware for myself.</p><p class="calibre2">We still have some time after we’re done, so we go to the training area. This time, Chris is doing some exercise too, but suffice to say, most of the time she’s just watching.</p><p class="calibre2">We don’t spend a lot of time here, because we don’t want to be tired tomorrow, and leave after agreeing to meet up early tomorrow in front of the gate. I’m going back to the inn with some bruises again today.</p><p class="calibre2">　◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">“Hm… It’s a great morning to leave the city.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika is already fired up. Isn’t she going to be too enthusiastic and get tired on the way?</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, are you going out today?”</p><p class="calibre2">Says the gatekeeper, as he looks at our camping equipment. I nod, show him my guild card, and exit the city.</p><p class="calibre2">We’re not going to get lost walking near the main road, but I don’t see anyone else going in this direction.</p><p class="calibre2">According to Rurika, since the forest where the wolves appeared is in the same direction as the village, people are avoiding going that way unless they really have to.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, the wolves are deep in the forest, so there’s little chance that they’ll come this way. It’s in their nature to live in the forest, so they’re not coming out unless they have no food or lost a turf war.</p><p class="calibre2">We walk along the road without any problems or really anything noteworthy. We just keep walking silently as the scenery in front of us doesn’t change.</p><p class="calibre2">Having that said, as we slowly walk away from the forest where the wolves are, I feel relieved somehow. Rurika says it’s fine, but I can tell she’s cautious too.</p><p class="calibre2">We don’t push ourselves too much, and take several breaks as we walk. It’s also important to keep ourselves hydrated. We have to be careful, since if we keep walking on our first day because we don’t feel tired, that’s going to have an effect later. That’s what Rurika says.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t feel tired no matter how much I walk, but that only accounts for the physical side. I do feel mentally fatigued. In particular, I feel like the nervousness I feel about being with two girls is intensifying as we get further away from the city.</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, to be honest, I’m not used to being with girls.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika is so frank and open, that I don’t feel too nervous around her, but Chris is different. I don’t know if she’s not used to being around boys, or if that’s just the way she is, but she always talks to me like she’s shy and like she’s constantly stepping back. I can’t help but picture a coddled young lady from a rich family.</p><p class="calibre2">It kind of makes me feel self-conscious too.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika looks at me and nods like she’s making fun of me, but at the same time like she’s saying she understands.</p><p class="calibre2">Ah, and I also have my wooden sword with me, and I’m being trained hard during our breaks.</p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-2"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 10 &ndash; Camping</h1><p class="calibre2">“We should stop for today. And if we’re camping here… We should be fine under that tree.”</p><p class="calibre2">We walk towards a tree not too far from the main road, and get ready to spend the night here. Depending on the situation, small groups of people don’t usually need to set up tents. Of course, that’s a different story in cold regions, but many people in places with a nice temperature feel good spending the night covered with only a robe.</p><p class="calibre2">This also makes it easier to deal with a sneak attack if that happens.</p><p class="calibre2">“Since Sora isn’t used to this, we’ll have two people stand watch just for today, while the other rests. But usually we rest better if only one stands watch.”</p><p class="calibre2">We’ll try it today, and if there aren’t any problems, only one person will stand watch tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre2">First, we start a fire and take a breather. Chris does it with her Basic Daily Life Magic. She teaches me some stuff about it too.</p><p class="calibre2">Both girls can cook, and they’re pretty good at it. I want to assume they’re being nice and letting me do nothing but watch because they assume I’m tired.</p><p class="calibre2">“Usually when people camp, they have a simple soup and bread. I actually heard that if you have a high performance magic bag, you can walk around with food you buy in a store, but I don’t know how true that is.”</p><p class="calibre2">“How much are they?”</p><p class="calibre2">“They’re usually sold in auctions, so their prices skyrocket. There are cheap magic bags too, but even those tend to cost around fifty gold coins. Apparently those can fit the contents of five barrels. Some people also find them in treasure chests in dungeons.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Do they get more expensive the bigger their capacity? Isn’t there anything like storage magic?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…There is storage magic in spatial magic. Apparently how much the user can carry is dictated by the amount of magic energy the user holds.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But there aren’t many people that can use spatial magic. That’s why they’re usually invited to high ranking parties even if they can’t fight at all.”</p><p class="calibre2">Spatial magic… I have skill points, so should I learn it?</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you need to have aptitude for it? How do you check if you can use it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It is possible to check your aptitude if you go to a church. If you learn you have the aptitude for it, it will come to you naturally, and if you continue to use it, you will learn new spells. Also, there are things called magic scrolls that will allow you to learn magic even if you don’t have the aptitude for it.”</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently I need to give alms if I want to look this up.</p><p class="calibre2">Magic scrolls are expensive too, so most adventurers don’t even use them if they find them in dungeons, and sell them instead. I hear that at some point there was a rumor that the Magic State of Efa successfully developed magic scrolls, but apparently no one talks about it anymore.</p><p class="calibre2">I think learning magic naturally once you know you have aptitude is the equivalent of learning it by using skill points.</p><p class="calibre2">I think people learn new spells by using magic because their proficiency increases and so does their magic level.</p><p class="calibre2">“Haven’t you ever done it, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve never checked it in a church. I guess I can use new spells because my magic level increases?”</p><p class="calibre2">When Chris hears this, she tilts her head like she’s confused.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, I don’t know if magic has levels. It might have, but there is no way to check.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Haven’t you ever heard the words status open?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Status open? I have not.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes yes. I see you’re having fun talking, but Chris needs to rest for a while. You can continue when you’re keeping watch together. Just don’t forget to watch out for threats too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says Rurika, and Chris’ face turns red before she covers it with her hood and lies down on a sheet.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve never seen Chris talk that much to anyone other than me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It does feel like she’s pretty shy. Some people just aren’t good at talking.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s not it. Well… I do feel a bit lonely, like she’s been taken from me, but seeing Chris have fun talking like that makes me happy, so feel free to keep talking to her. I approve of your friendship, but if you hurt her, I will never forgive you. Right?”</p><p class="calibre2">Yep. Her smile is scaring me.</p><p class="calibre2">That being said, while we did talk normally, we were talking about magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Chris probably loves magic, so she gets excited talking about it.</p><p class="calibre2">“But still, you can use Basic Daily Life Magic… How did you learn it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… I don’t really remember. A lot happened, so I don’t remember that time very well.”</p><p class="calibre2">I try to sidestep this topic. Even I know this isn’t a good excuse, but it’s hard to explain that I was summoned from another world.</p><p class="calibre2">No, if there are records of summoned heroes defeating the demon king, maybe people also know about people from another world.</p><p class="calibre2">But I don’t think I shouldn’t talk about that now. I might actually end up involving them, although there’s a chance that just being together like this is already involving them. I really wish those people just forget about me, or that even if they don’t, they just leave me alone. I won’t bother them either.</p><p class="calibre2">“Chris knows a lot about magic, even spells she can’t use herself. You should ask her more about it if you’re interested.”</p><p class="calibre2">I will do that. It should help me to know what skills I can learn.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, we keep watch and continue talking to make sure we stay awake, but quietly enough that it doesn’t bother Chris’ rest.</p><p class="calibre2">Eventually, Chris takes over from Rurika, and I ask her more about magic. What kind of magic exists, and what spells different elements have.</p><p class="calibre2">Chris tells me she spends her days off in the reference room of the guild or in the library reading books about magic, and books about fairy-tales and myths. And she’s always studying things like how to take monsters apart, what parts we need to take to prove we took them down, and what materials can become items too.</p><p class="calibre2">And when Rurika wakes up, it’s my turn to rest.</p><p class="calibre2">I lay down on a sheet, close my eyes, and chant status open.</p><p class="calibre2">Name &ndash; (Sora Fujimiya ) / Job &ndash; (Jobless) / No Level</p><p class="calibre2">HP &ndash; 220/220 / MP &ndash; 220/220 / SP &ndash; 220/220</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…210 (+1) / Stamina…210 (+1) / Agility…210 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…210 (+1) / Dexterity…210 (+1) / Luck…210 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking Lv21) &ndash; Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk) &ndash; (Get one experience point with each step)</p><p class="calibre2">Experience points &ndash; 1192/22000</p><p class="calibre2">Skill points &ndash; 5</p><p class="calibre2">Skills learned</p><p class="calibre2">(Appraisal Lv5) / (Appraisal Obstruction Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">(Sword Master Lv3) / (Physical Strengthening Lv5) / (Presence Detection Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">(Magic Energy Control Lv4) / (Basic Daily Life Magic Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">NEW</p><p class="calibre2">(Spatial Magic Lv1) / (Parallel Thinking Lv1) / (Natural Recovery Boost Lv1)</p><p class="calibre2">I use three skill points to learn (Spatial Magic Lv1), (Parallel Thinking Lv1), and (Natural Recovery Boost Lv1).</p><p class="calibre2">That leaves me with two.</p><p class="calibre2">The first thing that happens when I learn Spatial Magic is that now I can use Storage Magic. Its proficiency increases by putting things in this spatial storage, and it’s basically the magic version of an item bag.</p><p class="calibre2">Since my level is so low, I have very limited space. If I go over the capacity of my level, I’ll be constantly spending MP to maintain it, and apparently what I stored jumps out when my MP runs out.</p><p class="calibre2">Proficiency doesn’t just increase when I store things, just having something here at all times increases it too.</p><p class="calibre2">I can only store inorganic material, so that rules out living beings. Things that degrade over time degrade at about the same speed too, due to my low level.</p><p class="calibre2">Parallel Thinking allows me to think about more than one thing at a time. I was thinking about how I could use Presence Detection while sleeping here, and figured Parallel Thinking should do the trick.</p><p class="calibre2">Natural Recovery Boost is good to speed up the recovery of HP, MP, and SP. The HP part accelerates natural healing abilities, the MP part makes it easier to recover MP spent using magic, and the SP part hastens the recovery of SP spent using things like skills.</p><p class="calibre2">In the end, I think I can use Presence Detection while sleeping, thanks to Parallel thinking. I sort of get a faint feeling that it’s active, but since nothing happens while the two girls are keeping watch, I can’t say for sure that it works.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-32"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 11 &ndash; Goblin hunting &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">We’re done having breakfast, and it’s time to get moving again.</p><p class="calibre2">The mountain I see in the distance still looks the exact same. Walking along this grassy plain with such good visibility for so long is actually making me sick of walking.</p><p class="calibre2">We talk while we walk to distract ourselves, but we can’t let our guard down either. Of course, my Presence Detection is active too.</p><p class="calibre2">We keep walking without encountering any unforeseen issues, and we finally reach the village two days later.</p><p class="calibre2">In the meantime, we agreed to switch to a system of one person keeping watch at night while two rest. This is in part because I’m getting used to keeping watch, but also because the two person system was putting too much strain on Chris. And it also lets me test using Presence Detection with Parallel Thinking.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you have any business with this village?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We are adventurers, and we accepted a quest from the guild to hunt goblins.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika shows her guild card and explains why we are here to the wary gatekeeper. He calls someone to take over from him, and shows us to the residence of the village chief. But I notice that he seems restless on the way there.</p><p class="calibre2">“You can hear the rest from the chief.”</p><p class="calibre2">He calls the village chief, and leaves like he’s running away.</p><p class="calibre2">“Adventurers…”</p><p class="calibre2">The village chief apologizes, and explains that when they first put out a quest with the guild, the number of goblins was estimated to only be around ten, but their attacks on the village have become more frequent, and they have learned that there are more than they initially thought.</p><p class="calibre2">“At least more than twenty?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. We reinforced the fence around the village since they were first spotted, and that has helped us guard the village, but… We haven’t been able to fully defend it, and we have only managed to hold on by abandoning livestock when things get dangerous.”</p><p class="calibre2">“When was the last time you were attacked?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Two days ago. We managed to defeat them at first, but their numbers are growing and the damage they cause is increasing. We are completely on the defensive now.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. Then we’ll rest for today. If we go to the forest now, it will be dark by the time we get there, so we should go tomorrow morning. You can wake us up if there is an attack today.”</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum, and about the reward…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry about it, but I will say one thing. Some adventurers will leave when they’re not happy with the reward, so be careful about that. We’re putting our lives on the line here, and depending on the circumstances, sometimes people decide it’s not worth it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">There isn’t an attack today, but a group surrounding and watching the village from afar triggers my Presence Detection.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re going to where the goblins were seen, but they might pass by us and attack while we’re away, so don’t let your guard down.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika tells the gatekeeper, who nods deeply.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ll go in front, Chris will be in the middle, and Sora, you cover our back. Like I told you on the way here, goblins are sly, so be careful.”</p><p class="calibre2">They’re weak, so they had to become smart to survive. Monsters that are strong like ogres charge with their overwhelming strength, but goblins don’t have that, so they often use tricks. Of course, there are differences between individuals, and not every ogre is dumb.</p><p class="calibre2">As we walk, my Presence Detection picks up one goblin near us, and it’s getting closer.</p><p class="calibre2">After we take a few more steps, Rurika stops, and gives us a hand signal.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk in front of Chris, and Rurika’s presence disappears as she walks away.</p><p class="calibre2">My Presence Detection picks up goblins, but we still walk while being careful about our surroundings. What we really have to be scared of are traps. We have to be careful about our footing, and even tree branches too.</p><p class="calibre2">With every step, we’re getting closer to the goblin. By the time we’re close enough that I can feel its presence in my skin, the presence of the goblin hiding behind a large tree vanishes.</p><p class="calibre2">I can see Rurika with a sword in hand, pierced in the back of the goblin.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m going to continue moving on my own, and you two keep walking. We’re not in a hurry, so take your time. Just don’t go any further than what I told you earlier.”</p><p class="calibre2">She says before she takes off running. She’s fast.</p><p class="calibre2">I start walking again, while being mindful of Chris.</p><p class="calibre2">Five goblin presences come and go in the meantime, even though the two of us haven’t done any fighting yet. It seems the rest are gathering, and there are about twenty goblins left.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s not that far from what the village chief told us.</p><p class="calibre2">“They’re in kind of an open area, and there are about twenty of them I guess. First, I’ll appear from the right and draw their attention, and then you attack them with magic, Chris. I’ll charge at them at the same time, and then Sora can attack too. Goblins are small, so don’t do big swings.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika gets into position, and gives us a sign. Chris starts chanting right away.</p><p class="calibre2">Just before Chris finishes, Rurika jumps out and throws a knife. They’re completely in sync after being together for so long.</p><p class="calibre2">The moment the goblins turn their attention to Rurika, Chris’ area effect magic bursts. Since we’re in a forest, she uses a tornado wind spell. Fire magic is more powerful, but she doesn’t want to use it here.</p><p class="calibre2">Oops, this is no time to stand here and watch. I also attack the confused goblins.</p><p class="calibre2">Goblins are as small as kids, but they’re as strong or even stronger than an adult. They’re not to be underestimated.</p><p class="calibre2">I close the distance, attack once, and hit vital organs with a second attack and take down a goblin. I try to use that momentum to attack for a third time, but quickly shift to dodging instead. Two goblins are attacking me from both sides at the same time.</p><p class="calibre2">I block one, throwing off its stance, and slash the other.</p><p class="calibre2">As I look for my next target, I see an archer taking aim at Chris.</p><p class="calibre2">I pick up the stick the goblin I took down was holding and throw it. Even if it doesn’t hit, it should at least distract it.</p><p class="calibre2">The sound of the stick hitting the ground makes the goblin miss with the arrow that was aimed at Chris. I run towards it and slash it before it can get ready to fire another one, and receive a blow from a blind spot. I felt an impact, but it was softened by my clothes.</p><p class="calibre2">From there, it’s a mess. I’m careful to position myself in a way that I don’t get surrounded, and in a way that prioritizes defense rather than taking down enemies. Meanwhile, Rurika and Chris are whittling down their numbers.</p><p class="calibre2">The last goblin is defeated by Chris’ magic, and the short fight against the goblins, that felt long to me, is over.</p><p class="calibre2">The moment I realize this, my body collapses. I didn’t take damage, but I feel like all the strength left my body. I’m breathing heavily, and sweat is gushing out of my entire body.</p><p class="calibre2">“Nice job. Wait, you’re hurt a bit. Are you all right?”</p><p class="calibre2">I touch my forehead with my hand, and see blood.</p><p class="calibre2">It doesn’t really hurt, so even though there’s blood, it’s not that serious. I don’t even remember getting hit, so it must have been just a scrape.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s just a little cut. It’s fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. Chris, take care of that. Ah, but you don’t have to use healing magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">Chris casts Purification on the wound to disinfect it, and wraps it with a bandage.</p><p class="calibre2">Since it’s a small wound, it’s better to let it heal naturally, rather than with healing magic. I’m told it would be different if we were in a dungeon or we were in a hurry, but this quest is over, so it can heal on its own.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes yes. Chris is good at treating wounds, so don’t worry. Now let’s get the parts we need to prove we took them down, the magic stones, and burn the rest.”</p><p class="calibre2">The parts we need to prove we took down goblins are ears, and they have no materials that can be sold, so it’s common to retrieve magic stones, and burn the rest. Leaving corpses lying around can lead to them becoming undead, and their corpses can attract other monsters that then stay here.</p><p class="calibre2">We pile up the corpses, and Chris burns them with magic. Now all we have to do is report back to the village.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-23"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 12 &ndash; Return</h1><p class="calibre2">We show the parts to prove we took down the goblins, and the village chief thanks us again and again.</p><p class="calibre2">We’re invited to a celebratory banquet that night, and the villagers also thank us for ridding them of the goblin threat. Kids ask us to tell them about our battle with the goblins, but to be honest, I was so entranced while fighting that I don’t really remember it.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika puts on a performance that would put actors to shame, and exaggerates the story just a bit, but the kids all listen to her with a spark in their eyes. The adults also laugh as they listen.</p><p class="calibre2">We leave the village, and it takes us three days to return to the capital. In the meantime, I kept fighting Rurika with wooden swords.</p><p class="calibre2">“S-Sora, are you all right?”</p><p class="calibre2">When we enter the guild to report that we completed our quest, Mikaru speaks to me with a worried tone.</p><p class="calibre2">I have a bandage on my head, but the wound is pretty much gone. Part of the reason why I still have it on is because Chris was concerned and wrapped it for me, but also because I have something in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">“They were pretty strong. I could fight them one on one, but it was kind of tough to keep fighting against multiple goblins.”</p><p class="calibre2">We report that there were more goblins than the request stated, deliver the parts to prove we took them down and the magic stones, and since we have no materials to sell, we can settle everything here without having to go to the purchasing counter.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, and what happened with that wolf pack?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asks Rurika, and we’re told they’ve been successfully hunted.</p><p class="calibre2">Just as they thought, there was a unique specimen leading the pack, but it was quickly dealt with by multiple B and C rank parties. Normally that would be overkill, but they decided to throw a lot of fighting power at this problem and settle it quickly because it was so close to the city.</p><p class="calibre2">However, the ecology of the forest has been damaged a little, so people are being told they should avoid it for the time being. We’re also being told to be more careful if we accept quests to pick medicinal herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">I check the quests on the wall before we leave, and after we say goodbye, we check to see if there’s room in our respective inns. It turns out the three of us managed to stay in our inns again with no problem.</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper is surprised to see me back with a bandage on my head, but I quickly explain that it’s there just in case.</p><p class="calibre2">After taking it easy for one day, we meet up to go look at the quests again.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika picks quests for beginners that involve defeating monsters, and we start following a routine of leaving early in the morning, completing a quest, and returning that same day.</p><p class="calibre2">We hunt various monsters. The first time I see a bug type monster, a chill runs down my spine. I’m really not good with those, but I have to get used to it. Although I’ll probably run away if I come across one of those while I’m alone, and it’s not the actual target of my quest.</p><p class="calibre2">Animal type monsters are relatively profitable, because their fur is valuable. Some have weird quirks and can be hard to beat, but aren’t that big of a deal if I remain cool. A lot of them are edible, so taking them apart can become more troublesome than fighting them.</p><p class="calibre2">Since not only Rurika but also Chris are doing it, I can’t just throw this meat away, and instead work silently. I’m seriously considering looking for and learning a skill to take monsters apart.</p><p class="calibre2">We also go out to pick materials, and they’re surprised when I start using Appraisal. Of course, since I’m keeping Appraisal a secret, I lie and say I’m just confident in my memory.</p><p class="calibre2">The more we work together, the more the jealous stares turn lukewarm, like they’re just watching over us. I guess when they see Rurika giving me instructions, it feels more like a big sister teaching her little brother. Sometimes people even wish me good luck.</p><p class="calibre2">We keep accepting various quests, my pockets get fuller, and my guild rank goes from E to D. It’s around this time that Rurika and Chris are also promoted to rank C.</p><p class="calibre2">This also means it’s time to say goodbye, but something crosses my mind.</p><p class="calibre2">“So we’ll be leaving in five days… Are we going to rest in the meantime? Accept quests?”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika asks, probably to Chris and not me.</p><p class="calibre2">Her eyes are on an escorting quest. It’s a one way trip that will take ten days, and it says people can accept even if they don’t have a carriage.</p><p class="calibre2">The destination listed is close to the Beast Kingdom of Lath, so they’re going to head that way when they’re done.</p><p class="calibre2">Chris looks at me like she’s thinking about something. She’s probably remembering that being promoted in rank and accepting an escorting quest means it’s time to break up our temporary party.</p><p class="calibre2">“Then Rurika, about that escorting quest… Can I accept it with you two?”</p><p class="calibre2">Both Rurika and Chris are surprised to hear me say this.</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t know what an escorting quest is like, but if it’s all right with you, I want to do it while you teach me about it. Assuming I won’t get in your way, of course.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…We told you before, we’re going to the Beast Kingdom of Lath. That means we won’t come back here together.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Apparently I can take a horsebus between towns and cities, so worst case scenario, that’s how I’ll come back. There are different quests in guilds in different cities, right? I want to see what they’re like.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Then let’s check if we can accept it as a three person party. Apparently it’s a medium-sized caravan, so they’re probably looking for a lot of people.”</p><p class="calibre2">We bring an escorting quest to Mikaru, and she seems kind of worried. I’m sure it’s because other guild employees and adventurers already knew about Rurika and Chris, and they had already declared that they would be leaving to another country when they were promoted in rank. That means I have to tell Mikaru what I just told Rurika and Chris.</p><p class="calibre2">I go back to the inn to tell the innkeeper about this too, and then we go meet the person that put out the request to confirm the details.</p><p class="calibre2">We buy what we need, and since I have some free time, I accept delivery quests to level up. Making some extra money doesn’t bother me either.</p><p class="calibre2">“Now that I think about it, I haven’t been here, have I?”</p><p class="calibre2">The fourth quest takes me to an area I hadn’t been to before.</p><p class="calibre2">I avoided this because I heard it’s less safe. I just happen to find someone I’ve met before, who tells me this area is centered on the pleasure quarter. He wishes me good luck with a big smile, and leaves.</p><p class="calibre2">Pleasure quarter… So nighttime activities? It looks like some places are open during the day too.</p><p class="calibre2">I look around while checking the map, when suddenly I feel my sleeve being pulled.</p><p class="calibre2">When I turn to look, I see someone I know, but didn’t expect to find here.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you doing here?”</p><p class="calibre2">I hear this person’s voice, that sounds lower than usual.</p><p class="calibre2">When in doubt, ask a question back, but I feel like that’s not a good move here. I can’t see them because of the hood, but I’m sensing something from those eyes. Something like bloodlust. I don’t think I did anything wrong, but I’m getting chills.</p><p class="calibre2">“I-I’m here on a delivery quest. Why are you here, Chris?”</p><p class="calibre2">I stuttered. This strange feeling of nervousness makes my mouth dry.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m looking for someone.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Looking for someone?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes… We stand out too much here, so let us talk somewhere else.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Can you wait a moment? I’m going to deliver this.”</p><p class="calibre2">I start walking, and Chris follows me. No, I really am just here to deliver something. I’m not going somewhere weird.</p><p class="calibre2">I finish my delivery, and the person that accepts it looks at me oddly.</p><p class="calibre2">We didn’t walk much, but I’m tired.</p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-34"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 13 &ndash; Looking for something</h1><p class="calibre2">I still have one delivery quest to do, so I ask Chris if I can do that in the meantime. My destination is on the way to the inn, so I take what needs to be delivered and deliver it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you always do this?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Haven’t you ever done it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I have. In the town where I registered as an adventurer, delivery quests were few and popular.”</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently in small towns with a lot of new adventurers, people compete for delivery quests.</p><p class="calibre2">Big cities like the capital are the complete opposite. Adventurers that got at least somewhat strong in their hometowns come here in part to test their strength, so they don’t go out of their way to accept delivery quests. It’s not like no one does them, but the city is so big, that the demand is much larger than the offer.</p><p class="calibre2">“They’re pretty helpful for me. Even though, if someone asks me if I can live off this alone, I can only answer no.”</p><p class="calibre2">Still, with my skill, I have no complaints. If I did these quests without it, I would only do one every day, two at most. In a way, a skill that makes it so I don’t get tired when I walk really is extraordinary in a world without the locomotion power of a place like Earth.</p><p class="calibre2">There are horses and carriages, but they are out of the reach of an average person.</p><p class="calibre2">We stop by the inn where Chris and Rurika are staying, meet up with Rurika, and head to a cafe.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently they’ve been here a few times, and we’re led to a private room.</p><p class="calibre2">Now that I think about it, I’ve never just relaxed in a cafe in this world. Part of it is because I can’t afford to spend money like this, but also because I just don’t have the time. I want to lead a more relaxed life.</p><p class="calibre2">“So, I came here like you asked. What’s going on?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… I kind of met Chris in the pleasure quarter…?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Pleasure quarter… Chris, you were over there?”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika looks at Chris with an accusing stare, but that soon fades away and is replaced by Rurika patting Chris’ head like she’s saying it can’t be helped.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fine, then… You explain it, Chris.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. We told you we have been accepting quests and walking around the country. That is because we are looking for our friends.”</p><p class="calibre2">Chris stops for a second, takes a sip of her juice, and continues.</p><p class="calibre2">“The first town attacked by the empire was the one where we lived. We were still young, so when we were told to run away, we all dispersed and ran off without thinking. We managed to reunite with some friends after that, but there were also friends we never saw again… We are traveling to look for said friends.”</p><p class="calibre2">“People who weren’t killed back then were enslaved. They called them spoils of war, and when the ceasefire was called, they weren’t liberated. After we became adventurers, we went to the empire first. We look human, so we walked around without any problems, but we didn’t find them there, and so we came here. We heard there’s a slave auction near the capital’s pleasure quarter.”</p><p class="calibre2">“And you didn’t find them?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. But I figured since we will be leaving this country soon, I would check one last time. And I went to ask something.”</p><p class="calibre2">She says she gave them a bribe to contact the guild if they had any information about the people they’re looking for. Showing weakness to slavers might mean getting taken advantage of when it’s time to buy, but Chris figured it was time to stop caring about that.</p><p class="calibre2">“Chris has taken a liking to you Sora, so I actually wanted you to stay with us for a bit longer, but we have a goal to accomplish.”</p><p class="calibre2">“R-Rurika!”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t be shy. Ah, And we’re looking for two people, a beast person and an elf.”</p><p class="calibre2">“This might be rude, but can I ask something?”</p><p class="calibre2">A question pops into my mind as they talk.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re assuming the people you’re looking for are alive, but do you have any proof?”</p><p class="calibre2">At the very least, they don’t believe their friends are dead, or they wouldn’t go around the world looking for them.</p><p class="calibre2">But if I got separated from someone in a battlefield, would I be certain they weren’t dead?</p><p class="calibre2">“We know because of these amulets. We weren’t sure if it was true back then, but it tells us. We would have no answer if you asked us how we know, but we simply do.”</p><p class="calibre2">“The old lady said they’re spirit amulets.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both hold up similar amulets, and look at them lovingly.</p><p class="calibre2">They say this lady was bad-mouthed and got angry a lot, but she loved children from the bottom of her heart, and protected them until the very end. They seem very troubled as they talk about this. It’s like they have mixed memories that stop them from being completely frank with their praise.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see… And what about distinctive features… No, I guess that wouldn’t matter since you all grew up. Can you tell me their names at least? I’m planning on walking all over the place, so I might meet them on my travels. And about those amulets’ features… Are there more like them?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There are other amulets with the same shape, but this pattern is an original, so I don’t think there are more than four in the whole world. It’s like a set of four.”</p><p class="calibre2">The beast person’s name is Sera, and the elf’s name is Eris.</p><p class="calibre2">They tell me more about them too.</p><p class="calibre2">Sera is an easy-going beast person, and Eris has a strong sense of responsibility, and was basically the big sister in this group of four.</p><p class="calibre2">They tell me more about them, seeming very nostalgic, and sounding like they could never forget about their time together.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

I could follow Rurika and Chris, but I learned a few things after raising my Presence Detection level, and I decided that going with them is dangerous.</p><p class="calibre2">But then what should I do? I think about this while checking the skills I can learn.</p><p class="calibre2">Presence Concealment makes it so others can’t detect my presence. Apparently it also depends on their power.</p><p class="calibre2">Alchemy allows me to use materials to create items. Using MP makes the quality of the final product better.</p><p class="calibre2">I think that’s enough for now, but something catches my eye.</p><p class="calibre2">The Cooking skill lets me use materials to make nice food. Is it like an assist feature?</p><p class="calibre2">It won’t be useful in battle, and I don’t know if I can make money with it…</p><p class="calibre2">But, still, however. If I can cook good food and eat it, won’t that lead to an improvement in my life in general?</p><p class="calibre2">I could do a bit of cooking in the other world, but I wasn’t able to do much when I was faced with a wall of ingredients and seasonings. There are a lot of ingredients I don’t know about, and I’m not too knowledgeable about seasonings either.</p><p class="calibre2">After debating it with myself for thirty minutes, I decide to learn the Cooking skill. I’m not going to defeat the demon king anyway, so I might as well make sure I can have a nice life in this world and not die.</p><p class="calibre2">That means I need the appropriate skills for a pleasant life. At least that’s what I tell myself.</p><p class="calibre2">I start thinking that tomorrow I’m going to work hard and walk again, but I end up not accepting any quests in the two days before we leave, and instead buy the remaining things I need, and stay in the inn.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like it’s a waste to buy medicinal herbs, but I buy them to make potions with alchemy. But in the end, I make potions with low healing power, that say tiny and small recovery.</p><p class="calibre2">I put them away using Storage Magic (which I think I’ll nickname Item Box), and maybe I’ll start selling them eventually. Maybe I can sell them in small villages. But they might not want to pay much, because there’s no way to check for the potions’ quality.</p><p class="calibre2">And in the end, to sell things like potions, I have to register in a guild. But at the very least, I have no intention of doing it in this country.</p><p class="calibre2">To use Presence Concealment, I have to erase my presence by holding my breath, which the skill itself teaches me how to do. If I keep using it, its proficiency will go up. I want to be able to use it naturally, but for now, I can only activate it if I really focus. I’ll have to rely on Parallel Thinking to help me with this one too.</p><p class="calibre2">As for the Cooking skill, I ask the innkeeper to let me use the kitchen, and start testing it.</p><p class="calibre2">At first she watches me from afar, but then she starts teaching me some stuff, and I manage to at least make food that looks presentable.</p><p class="calibre2">But it’s lightly seasoned, and doesn’t taste great.</p><p class="calibre2">Now I have three skill points left.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m thinking it’s also about time I learn a job, and since the Appraisal skill has been leveling up, I’m starting to be able to read what appears when I select a job. I should be able to read everything if I level up a bit more, so I’ll pick a job then.</p><p class="calibre2">I hope I can change jobs after I pick one. If I’m stuck with the first one I pick, I get the feeling I’ll regret it. Actually, is there a temple or something like that in this world where I can change jobs?</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-13"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 15 &ndash; Escorting quest &ndash; Part one</h1><p class="calibre2">After finishing having breakfast, I go with Rurika and Chris to the place where we agreed to meet.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s a little earlier than the appointed time, but the caravan of the merchant that put out the quest is already here.</p><p class="calibre2">We greet the merchant, meet up with the other escorting adventurers, and do the final checks.</p><p class="calibre2">Five adventurer parties will be coming this time, three C rank parties and two D rank parties. One of the D rank parties reports that this will be their first escorting quest.</p><p class="calibre2">The last time we met, we talked about who would be leading us adventurers, and a veteran adventurer party known as ‘Goblin’s Grief’ will be taking that role. I ask them why they named their party that, and they say that when they were just starting out, more experienced adventurers gave them that nickname half-mockingly. They look into the distance and sound resigned when they say this.</p><p class="calibre2">My instincts tell me not to press further and ask why they got that nickname in the first place.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then everyone, we will be in your care.”</p><p class="calibre2">Dalton, the leader of the caravan, gives the order, and we’re off.</p><p class="calibre2">Seven wagons run forward in a line. Each has two or three adventurers, and the three of us are riding in the third wagon.</p><p class="calibre2">On the odd numbered wagons, adventurers are looking around on top of the canopy.</p><p class="calibre2">Since this is my first time traveling by wagon, Rurika is the first one to go up and be on alert. She says that people often get sick the first time they ride on a wagon, so I should get used to it first.</p><p class="calibre2">It really is different from Earth’s cars. It shakes a whole lot.</p><p class="calibre2">These wagons don’t have suspension, so the vibrations are transmitted directly to us. My butt hurts, but thanks to Natural Recovery Boost, the pain quickly starts subsiding, and then it starts hurting again. Is this actually an easy way to increase proficiency?</p><p class="calibre2">Nothing happens in the first four days of travel, and we safely reach the town that will be a stopping point for us.</p><p class="calibre2">There is business to be done here, and we’re also staying the night to have a chance to rest. The real escorting work begins from this point forward.</p><p class="calibre2">The way to the first town is relatively close to the capital, so there aren’t many bandits. If there were a lot of problems, there’s a good chance that the army, or rather, a chivalric order would mobilize. That area is very tightly controlled, so not many people are foolish enough to commit acts of banditism in a place like that.</p><p class="calibre2">As for monsters, being close to the capital also means there are a lot of quests to hunt them, so there are always few monsters because they get hunted if their numbers start increasing.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s the first town I’ve traveled to, so I go to the adventurer guild with Rurika and Chris to check out what kind of quests they have.</p><p class="calibre2">Unlike the capital, this town is small, so there aren’t many quests. There are only a few hunting quests and quests to do errands around town. That’s probably why I don’t see many adventurers either.</p><p class="calibre2">The next day, we set out as the sun rises.</p><p class="calibre2">“From this point on, there are a few spots where we will be passing close to the forest. This is the type of place where monsters and bandits appear, so be careful.”</p><p class="calibre2">Warns Siphon, the leader of Goblin’s Grief, just before we leave. That’s directed mostly at me and the D rank party that’s doing their first escorting quest.</p><p class="calibre2">I climb to the top of the canopy, and look around with my Presence Detection active.</p><p class="calibre2">It will be three days until we arrive at the first spots, but that’s no reason to let my guard down.</p><p class="calibre2">There are other merchants and wagons coming from the opposite direction, and I feel nervous for the first time since we started this escorting quest.</p><p class="calibre2">Our wagons move to the side of the road and stop for the three wagons coming the other way to pass.</p><p class="calibre2">There are two people in the driver’s seat, who look like they’re adventurers. I don’t see merchants, so are they inside?</p><p class="calibre2">In this world it’s not uncommon for bandits to pretend to be merchants to get closer and do a sneak attack, so unless there are known faces in the other group, people can’t let their guard down when another group of merchants passes by them.</p><p class="calibre2">Wagons are especially dangerous, because they could be packed with people instead of goods.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone raises their guard, but I’m less nervous. I can tell what’s inside the wagons via my Presence Detection, but I can’t say it, so I just pretend to be as wary as everyone else.</p><p class="calibre2">As the sun starts to go down, we leave the main road and get ready to set up camp.</p><p class="calibre2">I help the merchants tend to the horses by giving them food and water, casting purifying magic on them, and brushing them. This way, they’ll keep doing their best for us tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre2">I want to take care of horses in preparation for when I use horses to move around. They let me do it mostly because I can use Basic Daily Life Magic.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika and Chris are preparing the food. This is in part because they’re the best cooks among the adventurers here, but also because even in a different world, people want to eat girls’ cooking. There are two other female adventurers with them, and they’re having fun talking while they cook. Mostly just Rurika.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone else is either patrolling around or setting up tents with crisp movements. Everyone knows the sooner they’re done, the sooner they get to rest.</p><p class="calibre2">When it’s time to eat, we all split into groups. We mostly eat with the merchants that shared wagons with us, but there’s some rotation too.</p><p class="calibre2">Merchants talk about their troubles while we eat, the towns they’ve been to, and their dreams for the future. I get to hear all sorts of things I didn’t know, so it’s fun for me.</p><p class="calibre2">When that’s over, it’s time to keep watch in shifts.</p><p class="calibre2">I look up and see the stars.

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-3"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 16 &ndash; Escorting quest &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">After our lunch break, the wagons start moving again.</p><p class="calibre2">Our journey is going perfectly, and nothing’s happened so far.</p><p class="calibre2">Is this the calm before the storm? There’s a forest to our right and a rocky mountain to our left, and I can feel a lot of presences deep inside the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">They’re too far to see with the naked eye. If I say something about them, we can start preparing, but it will be hard to answer if they ask me why I know. Will they even understand what I’m talking about if I tell them it’s because of a skill I have?</p><p class="calibre2">No, that’s just an excuse. I just can’t let others know about the skills I have, and that includes Rurika and Chris.</p><p class="calibre2">All I can do is count on the ranger in the wagon that’s leading the way.</p><p class="calibre2">As we get closer, the reaction gets stronger, and I grab my weapon without thinking.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hey hey, what’s that all of a sudden? Did you see something?”</p><p class="calibre2">The merchant sitting next to the driver’s seat sees me doing this, and asks me about it.</p><p class="calibre2">“The place we talked about is just up ahead, so…”</p><p class="calibre2">I say to try to evade his question.</p><p class="calibre2">He laughs it off, because he knows it’s my first escorting quest.</p><p class="calibre2">I definitely sense something. I try looking for presences again as the forest is within my sight, and sense a lot deep inside it. They seem to be moving, but… They’re not coming this way?</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently what I’m sensing are wolves. About twenty of them.</p><p class="calibre2">But as Rurika watches this back and forth, she sounds her alarm, seemingly sensing something.</p><p class="calibre2">The line of wagons stops, and we hear a loud stir in the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">The wolves change direction and they all jump out of the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wolves?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Prepare your spells.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wait, something’s there… A tigerwolf!?”</p><p class="calibre2">Something else jumps out, like it’s chasing the wolves.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s a large beast that’s twice the size of a wolf. Its fangs that are larger than knives immediately draw my attention. But the real danger is in the claws of its front legs, which are said to be able to shatter even a shield.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s still some distance between them, but it’s fast. At this rate, it’s going to catch up with the wolves.</p><p class="calibre2">So that’s what was going on. The wolves are being chased by the tigerwolf.</p><p class="calibre2">“What do we do?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Magic users, prepare your spells. Blow those wolves away once they get a little closer. Everyone else, get ready to intercept them. Us, Goblin’s Grief, will take on the tigerwolf, everyone else hunt the surviving wolves.”</p><p class="calibre2">Siphon gives instructions.</p><p class="calibre2">He specifically tells the D ranked adventurers to move away from the tigerwolf, and they oblige without any complaints, because they’re aware of their own strength. There are two parties, so one is instructed to guard the merchants.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ll hunt wolves too. We’ll draw them away from the tigerwolf to make it easier for you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sora and the others, go look after the merchants too. I’m leaving that to you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Siphon tells us to go guard the merchants.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika hesitates at first, but follows the commands of the leader.</p><p class="calibre2">Magic is activated and fired on the wolves. They’re focusing on wind and water magic because they’re purposely choosing magic that makes as little noise as possible.</p><p class="calibre2">In the meantime, the wagons are circled like when we camp, and the horses are given calming herbs to prevent them from getting too excited and rampaging.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika tells me to get on the canopy, and I do so.</p><p class="calibre2">The magic attack throws the wolves into disarray, and the tigerwolf catches up to them and opens its mouth widely to bite at them. Its sharp fangs easily pierce one of the wolves, and blood sprays.</p><p class="calibre2">I hear what sounds like the wolf shrieking, and the rest abandon it, running away from the left and right of the tigerwolf.</p><p class="calibre2">The C ranked adventurers quickly deal with this, blocking the wolves like they read the future. When did they even get so close?</p><p class="calibre2">The tigerwolf starts groaning as it sees this, probably thinking they’re there to steal its prey.</p><p class="calibre2">But before it can jump at the adventurers, magic is fired at it. The timing is off, and although two or three spells are fired at it, it easily dodges them. Apparently it’s magic that prioritizes activation speed rather than power, to keep enemies in check.</p><p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, Siphon gets close and attacks the tigerwolf.</p><p class="calibre2">The tigerwolf lightly dodges this attack, and jumps at Siphon, who got within its reach. An adventurer holding a shield switches places with Siphon and blocks the sharp claws.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently he specializes in using a shield, because he’s holding it with both hands and he doesn’t have a weapon. No, that’s not it, it feels like he equipped just a shield specifically to be able to withstand the attacks of the tigerwolf. But he strikes with the shield from time to time, and doesn’t forget to draw its attention.</p><p class="calibre2">The battle with the tigerwolf has reached a stalemate.</p><p class="calibre2">In the meantime, the rest of the adventurers are hunting the wolves. C ranked adventurers have no trouble disposing of them, and they’re all being killed one after the other.</p><p class="calibre2">But wolves that the D rank party were fighting manage to slip through and come this way. Are they trying to escape from the tigerwolf? Trying to use us to relieve the stress from being chased away? Did they instinctively sniff out non-combatants? I don’t know, but they’re headed right for us.</p><p class="calibre2">Wolves run and jump this way, and Rurika kills one with one slash after dodging them.</p><p class="calibre2">The remaining two are dealt with by the other D ranked party and their unrefined but still well-matched combination. They’re not unharmed, but didn’t suffer any serious injuries either.</p><p class="calibre2">I was trying to come down from the canopy when the wolves were coming, but I was stopped, so I’ve been cautiously looking around. As far as my eyes can see and my Presence Detection can feel, there aren’t any more enemies.</p><p class="calibre2">All that’s left is the tigerwolf, and as neither side can finish off the other, the battle ends with the tigerwolf’s retreat.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div><p class="calibre2"> <a href="https://hidamarisoutranslations.com/walking-in-another-world/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3">Index</a> </p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-33"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 17 &ndash; Escorting quest &ndash; Part three</h1><p class="calibre2">As we take apart the wolves we took down, Dalton and the other merchants discuss with Siphon what to do next.</p><p class="calibre2">The problem is the tigerwolf that ran away. We let it get away, but they say it’s strange that it came so close to the road in the first place.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s advance as much as we can today. Please be aware that means moving forward as far as we can even after the sun has gone down.”</p><p class="calibre2">We will have the horses run as fast as they can, to put as much distance as possible between us and the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">Dalton gives the command, and the wagons start moving again.</p><p class="calibre2">“It really is strange for a tigerwolf to come to the outer edge of a forest. If it ran away after losing a turf war, that means something even more threatening is in the forest. And if it came here because it wasn’t finding prey, that means the forest’s ecosystem is crumbling.”</p><p class="calibre2">According to what I read before, tigerwolves are usually sighted deep inside the forest. They are pretty smart, and make the decision to run away when they realize they are at a disadvantage, so they’re said to be monsters that are difficult to hunt. Of course, that’s also because they’re strong. Because of this, their fur sells at high prices to rich people looking for luxury items. I guess those patterns and colors really do look nice.</p><p class="calibre2">Today we’re advancing for a while longer even after the sun has set. We end up making camp when the horses stop moving.</p><p class="calibre2">We take care of the horses, quickly prepare our dinner and eat, and decide to have more people keeping watch. Worst case scenario, people will have to sleep while we’re on the move again tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre2">We can hear howling in the distance from time to time, and I see some people flinch when it happens, but it can’t be helped. And me? I rest well, probably because I have Presence Detection. It seems people are split between thinking I’m brave or stupid.</p><p class="calibre2">My excuse is that I’m tired because seeing a tigerwolf for the first time made me so nervous.</p><p class="calibre2">After a night shrouded with tension, we silently eat breakfast and leave.</p><p class="calibre2">Some people have bags under their eyes because they couldn’t rest well.</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika and Chris are used to traveling, but they also look tired, so I tell them to rest. I’m going on top of the canopy today.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel more wind than usual, and it feels like the clouds are passing by us more quickly. I can see black clouds in the distance.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m just now noticing that it hasn’t rained since I came to this world. Is this a region where it doesn’t rain a lot? Is it not a rainy season? Does it just not rain at all? I don’t know, but the fact that I’m just now noticing something that wasn’t on my mind at all makes me realize I probably had more on my mind than I thought.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m probably missing a lot of things that are common sense in this world, but I can’t just casually ask either. I’m sure if I do, people will just ask me what I’m talking about.</p><p class="calibre2">Half a day passes, and so does the heavy mood, as we can clearly see some distance between us and the forest. It feels liberating.</p><p class="calibre2">“But still, a tigerwolf… We should report this when we get to town. There was a pack of wolves near the capital too, so this could all be an omen.”</p><p class="calibre2">“There hasn’t been a demon attack in a while. Do you think that could be related?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t know, but you can never be too careful. We should at least form a reconnaissance team.</p><p class="calibre2">It would be great if we could hunt it, but we need to at least push it back or we won’t feel safe crossing through here. What’s worse is the idea that there could be something that pushed the tigerwolf all the way here.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Worst case scenario, we have to go back to the capital through an alternate route.”</p><p class="calibre2">I listen to Siphon and the others talking.</p><p class="calibre2">We managed to fight the monster back because we have the numbers and everyone handled it well, but we’re told that if we were to encounter it while on our own, we should immediately run away as fast as we can.</p><p class="calibre2">Tigerwolf hunting quests can be accepted by C ranked parties and above, but it’s customary to only go after it after making thorough advanced preparations. Normally, people make use of traps and magic to make sure it can’t get away during their fight, especially since failure to hunt it after accepting the quest results in a penalty.</p><p class="calibre2">This means people who don’t look into what a tigerwolf is like beforehand, often end up failing their quest.</p><p class="calibre2">“We probably wouldn’t hunt a tigerwolf. It’s not like we’re working as adventurers to become known. It would be profitable, but it’s best to have a more reliable source of income.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says Rurika.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of our forced march after encountering the tigerwolf, the distance we cover in a single day has gone down drastically.</p><p class="calibre2">We only reach the town at night, two days later than we anticipated.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-25"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 18 &ndash; Breaking up</h1><p class="calibre2">“A-are you awake?”</p><p class="calibre2">I wake up and see an old man, no, Siphon.</p><p class="calibre2">It was nighttime when we reached this town, so we couldn’t get rooms for everyone. The girls took precedence, and the rest of us were shoved into whatever rooms were left.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did you sleep well?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I’m fine.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry for taking the bed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Just getting to rest in a room is good enough.”</p><p class="calibre2">Yes, since there weren’t enough rooms, I ended up sleeping on a sheet on the floor. Normally this wouldn’t be allowed, but Dalton knows the innkeeper, so he made an exception just for today.</p><p class="calibre2">We stop to have breakfast in the dining room, and then the adventurers go to the adventurer guild, and the merchants to the merchant guild. The quest actually ends here, so we go our own separate ways.</p><p class="calibre2">We collect our reward for the escorting quest in the guild, and sell materials from the wolves we took down along the way. Their food supplies are running low, so the fact that we’re bringing some meat means we get some nice extraordinary revenue.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then, you’re all dismissed. We are going to report to the guild about the tigerwolf. Let’s work together sometime if we have the opportunity. Dismissed.”</p><p class="calibre2">With Siphon’s words, every party goes its own way.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I ask the guild what inns they recommend, and check if I can stay there. The inn I slept in last night is available, but it’s a bit too expensive. Even if I end up having to stay there, I want to minimize the cost if I can.</p><p class="calibre2">They tell me about an inn that’s two copper coins a night. I pay for ten days, Rurika and Chris for five, and we secure rooms for ourselves.</p><p class="calibre2">“We should rest today. What are you going to do, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m going to check out what kind of quests the guild has. This place is not as big as the capital, but it’s still relatively big, and known as the trading city in this country. And I might as well gather some information, if I’m going to stay here for a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, in that case, can I go with you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sure, but are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre2">I say this out of concern for Chris’ physical condition, but she says it’s fine if it’s only for a while.</p><p class="calibre2">I look at Rurika, and she asks me to look after her.</p><p class="calibre2">I return to the guild with Chris, and ask an employee about the area surrounding the town. I spend about an hour asking mostly about monsters and materials like medicinal herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">Then I go to the board where quests are affixed, and check out what they have.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sora, what are you going to do from now on?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m going to accept quests in this town for a while. It’s pretty far from the capital, so I might as well do some sightseeing too while I’m here.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Sightseeing… I’m a little jealous.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It can’t be helped, you two have a goal. I hope you accomplish it soon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes…”</p><p class="calibre2">“And if you find your friends, I’d definitely like to meet them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I want to tell them just how much the two of you helped me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Y-yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh… A big town like this really has a lot of delivery and miscellaneous quests. I guess I’ll start accepting them again.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You really like those, don’t you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s because they’re safe. I guess some people think they’re a huge pain, but walking isn’t a big deal for me.”</p><p class="calibre2">We talk for a bit, and then it gets a little awkward.</p><p class="calibre2">I can see Chris’ face turn red as it peeks from under her hood, and I realize I’m being weirdly excited.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you going back? I’m going to accept delivery quests and walk around town for a while.”</p><p class="calibre2">I say goodbye to Chris, and accept a delivery quest.</p><p class="calibre2">As I walk around, I check the locations of buildings I might visit while I’m here, like other guilds and weapons and equipment stores.</p><p class="calibre2">I have lunch at a stall, and I ask questions about this place while also talking about how I came from another city on an escorting quest.</p><p class="calibre2">Relay city Physis, also known as the trading city, is a major city in the Kingdom of Elesya, and prospers due to its connection to the capital. There is also a mine near here, so it profits off of doing business with ore too.</p><p class="calibre2">A village was built near the mine, and apparently there’s work over there too. It’s not like a dungeon, but I hear monsters frequently appear in the mine too.</p><p class="calibre2">“I heard monsters appear in the mine, but where do they come from?”</p><p class="calibre2">I ask Rurika when we’re having dinner.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve heard that dungeons produce the monsters that appear in them, but I’m wondering how monsters get inside mines.</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t know a lot about it either.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I have heard about magic energy pools producing monsters.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Magic energy pools?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, but it is said that the principles of magic energy pools are not very well understood. One theory states that they are related to the phases of the moon. I heard this one is advocated by a famous sorcerer.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah… I’ve heard that a researcher of that Magic State of Efa announced it. Did you accept a quest in the mine, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I didn’t, I just heard that there are hunting quests sometimes, and I was thinking that maybe I’ll go if I have the opportunity.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn… We can’t say much about it, since we’ve never done a quest in a dungeon or a mine, but there are all sorts of restrictions, and you have to be careful as you walk around because it can be dangerous. If you’re going, you should form a party.”</p><p class="calibre2">“A party… I don’t have anyone I want to form a party with, so I should probably just do things like collecting medicinal herbs. I’m actually pretty good at that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I agree. You’re very good at that.”</p><p class="calibre2">They were surprised when we picked medicinal herbs together. Appraisal is like cheating, so I can’t be wrong.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you have plans for tomorrow, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m going to go pick medicinal herbs in the morning. I’ve been told where they are, so I should be back before noon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see, then how about we go shopping after lunch? We need to stock up on items.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Then I’ll try to come back as soon as possible.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t rush yourself too much. Nothing good comes from that. And you need to be especially careful in a new place.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika’s concern is correct. I have Presence Detection, but that might not be infallible.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-14"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 19 &ndash; Medicinal herb picking and alchemy</h1><p class="calibre2">I go to the guild early in the morning and accept a medicinal herb picking quest.</p><p class="calibre2">Magic energy herbs are still bought at a high price. Will they pay a bit more for vitality herbs than they do for medicinal herbs?</p><p class="calibre2">Today I’m thinking about picking the medicinal herbs I need to complete the quest, and use the rest to practice alchemy. It doesn’t make sense to buy medicinal herbs for alchemy when I can just pick them myself. Although I have to resign myself to doing that when I don’t have time to spare.</p><p class="calibre2">Around here, medicinal herbs are picked on a plain. Medicinal herbs seem to be growing as far as the eye can see, but actually, they’re hiding among the overgrown weeds.</p><p class="calibre2">Since there is nothing to identify where they are, there’s no other option than to just look for them. That’s what raises the difficulty.</p><p class="calibre2">That probably has to do with why this isn’t a very popular thing to do, even though there’s demand for it and it’s close to town.</p><p class="calibre2">I concentrate, and look around while activating Appraisal.</p><p class="calibre2">Words appear like speech balloons, showing me the names of the herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">I pick medicinal herbs, magic energy herbs, and vitality herbs in that order. I see a lot that are still sprouting, but I pick ones that are ready to be picked one after the other.</p><p class="calibre2">But there are still plenty, probably because not many people come here.</p><p class="calibre2">I put the medicinal herbs I’m going to deliver in a preservation bag, and put the rest in the Item Box. I’ve been using Spatial Magic this whole time, so it’s now level four. As the level goes up, so does its power to preserve degradable things for longer. Is it right to say time moves slower in the Item Box?</p><p class="calibre2">I have some time, so I try doing alchemy.</p><p class="calibre2">I make potions and stamina potions with medicinal herbs and vitality herbs until I’m out of MP. Magic energy herbs are expensive, so I’ll use them when my Alchemy level is a bit higher.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, if there is room in the Item Box, it won’t expel the items inside it even if my MP reaches zero. It’s important not to over-stuff it.</p><p class="calibre2">As I use Alchemy and see proficiency going up, I notice that how much it goes up varies depending on the materials I use. Does it actually depend on what items I make?</p><p class="calibre2">There are a lot of items that can be made with alchemy. When I activate the Alchemy skill, a list of what I can make pops up inside my head, and by using Appraisal here, I can see the materials I need.</p><p class="calibre2">I can still make them even if I don’t have the materials, but if I try to force it to make them, it always ends in failure. Even if I have the right materials, I can create a poor item if my Alchemy level isn’t high enough.</p><p class="calibre2">But if my level isn’t high enough, I can still sometimes make a good item if I focus and pour in a lot of MP. But there’s no guarantee that it will work, and it’s pretty much a gamble. And if my level is high enough, and I pour in a lot of MP, I create a good quality item. So far, this has produced 100% good items.</p><p class="calibre2">“But what is this that’s being displayed?”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m pretty much done making items for now, so I look at the list of what I can make again.</p><p class="calibre2">The word ‘NEW’ in the middle grabs my attention. I use Appraisal on these items, and see a line ‘items never before created’. They don’t have names, but their effects and necessary materials are displayed.</p><p class="calibre2">Among them, the effect ‘contact people far away’ catches my eye. Is this like a smartphone? It might be an item with functions similar to a telephone or e-mail. And the items necessary to make it are high quality magic stone, high quality ore, and a large amount of magic energy. It’s kind of vague.</p><p class="calibre2">I look at the effects of other items marked with ‘NEW’, and notice they’re very similar to things from Earth. Are they based on my knowledge or memories?</p><p class="calibre2">I use Appraisal on the high quality magic stone listing, and it says ‘magic stones from high level monsters, or synthesized by combining many magic stones’.</p><p class="calibre2">I check out the list while looking for something, a magic item capable of transmissions. Ah, but surely my Alchemy level is way too low.</p><p class="calibre2">But what I find requires a minimum of Alchemy level five, and I’m at level three. The real problem is the magic stones and ore. Both can be bought in the merchant guild, but I don’t know at what cost.</p><p class="calibre2">“Is a magic stone more important than ore for this item…”</p><p class="calibre2">I should go back, check the price, and see if I have the money to buy it. And since I might fail, I should buy spares. I also need to raise my Alchemy level.</p><p class="calibre2">I summarize everything I need in my head.</p><p class="calibre2">I put the potions I made in the Item Box, and walk back to town quickly. I don’t get the blessing of my Walking skill if I run, so I don’t run even if I’m in a hurry.</p><p class="calibre2">I deliver medicinal herbs and vitality herbs to the guild. Then I have lunch with Rurika and Chris, and we go shopping together to buy what we need for our travels.</p><p class="calibre2">While we’re shopping, I neglect to really pay attention to them, probably because I have alchemy on my mind. Rurika is exasperated and Chris sulks, and they gradually start speaking less.</p><p class="calibre2">“You need to apologize tomorrow and make up for today.”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika says with kind of a scary face, after we have dinner and before we say goodbye for today.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-4"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 20 &ndash; Magic item, transmitter</h1><p class="calibre2">“You’re leaving in three days, right? When exactly?”</p><p class="calibre2">I ask as we finish having breakfast.</p><p class="calibre2">“In the morning. There’s a large caravan headed to a town close to the beast kingdom, so we’re going to be making use of one of the horsebuses.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Not an escorting quest?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’ll cost money, but it’s nice to take it easy once in a while. But if the number of escorts decreases on the way somehow, we’ll step in.”</p><p class="calibre2">“There are a lot of ways to get around…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Why don’t you come with us too?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I better not. I think I’ll just be imposing too much if I keep going like this.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t be afraid to be spoiled by your two big sisters over here. Especially Chris.”</p><p class="calibre2">I look over at Chris, and her face is bright red. She’s teasing her.</p><p class="calibre2">“That sounds tempting, but no. I’ll show you how much I’ve grown next time I see you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. We’re going to take it easy for a short time, but what about you? Are you going to accept quests?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I accepted a medicinal herb picking quest yesterday, and was asked if I didn’t want to pick more. They practically begged me to do it, because the alchemy guild and the chemist guild have been pressing them. Apparently their inventory is gone because no one has been accepting these quests lately.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What a simple soul you are.”</p><p class="calibre2">“They told me they’ll give me a bonus if I pick a lot, so I’m planning to pick them all day long for two days. And sorry about yesterday, I had something on my mind. No, that’s just an excuse, isn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre2">I lower my head to Chris, and she whispers ‘all right’.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m busy for the next couple of days.</p><p class="calibre2">I pick medicinal herbs in the morning, have lunch, and practice alchemy. Once I’m done with that, I go to the guild, sell materials, and buy magic stones.</p><p class="calibre2">Magic stones can be bought in the guild, but can also be found in general stores in small quantities. They’re sold as fuel for magic items, so the average citizen can buy them. Apparently magic items like the lanterns that adventurers use in dungeons and monster repellent are popular.</p><p class="calibre2">However, I find out that monster repellent magic items are always in high demand, so they’re expensive and hard to find. There’s a store that sells them, but the prices are out of my reach for the time being. I ask them if five gold coins isn’t too expensive, and they tell me it’s actually cheap.</p><p class="calibre2">And so, because of this, adventurers who don’t have a lot of money to spend buy disposable monster repellent. The effect is pretty low compared to a magic item, but I hear there’s a lot of demand for those too.</p><p class="calibre2">I go around some stores looking for magic stones, and I find out through Appraisal that the quality of magic stones can vary even if they come from the same type of monster.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, big doesn’t necessarily mean high quality, and there are processed and unprocessed ones. Different magic items take magic stones of different sizes and shapes, so there are way more unprocessed magic stones, that people can then have processed to match their magic items.</p><p class="calibre2">I buy unprocessed high quality magic stones, fifty of them. I also buy ten lumps of iron ore, leaving me with two silver coins.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m going to have to make a living with medicinal herb picking for now.</p><p class="calibre2">“Status open.”</p><p class="calibre2"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3"></a>Name &ndash; (Sora Fujimiya ) / Job &ndash; (Jobless) / Race &ndash; Otherworlder / No Level</p><p class="calibre2">HP &ndash; 300/300 / MP &ndash; 300/300 / SP &ndash; 300/300</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…290 (+1) / Stamina…290 (+1) / Agility…290 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…290 (+1) / Dexterity…290 (+1) / Luck…290 (+1)</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking Lv29) &ndash; Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk) &ndash; (Get one experience point with each step)</p><p class="calibre2">Experience points &ndash; 18/30000</p><p class="calibre2">Skill points &ndash; 7</p><p class="calibre2">Skills learned</p><p class="calibre2">(Appraisal Lv8) / (Appraisal Obstruction Lv4) / (Parallel Thinking Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">(Sword Master Lv4) / (Physical Strengthening Lv5) / (Presence Detection Lv8) / (Natural Recovery Boost Lv4) / (Presence Concealment Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">(Magic Energy Control Lv6) / (Basic Daily Life Magic Lv5) / (Spatial Magic Lv4) / (Alchemy Lv5)</p><p class="calibre2">(Cooking Lv2)</p><p class="calibre2">Since my Appraisal level has gone up, I decide to check the descriptions of the jobs again, and learn that it’s actually possible to change jobs. But it comes with a warning that once I pick a job, I’ll be unable to change it until Walking levels up.</p><p class="calibre2">So the worst timing would be just after I level up.</p><p class="calibre2">But in order to increase the success rate of Alchemy, I should become an alchemist to receive its correction effect.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t fail. After all, Rurika and Chris are leaving tomorrow.</p><p class="calibre2">I pick the Alchemist job, and the (+1) in my stats changes.</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…290 (+0) / Stamina…290 (+0) / Agility…290 (+0)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…290 (+50) / Dexterity…290 (+50) / Luck…290 (+0)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic and dexterity have a +50 correction, and everything else is gone.</p><p class="calibre2">Did my MP get the same +50? Apparently the affected skills also receive a similar correction in terms of proficiency.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t help but wish I knew about this sooner, but I didn’t know if I could change jobs, so I think I still did the right thing. From now on, I’ll be more proactive when it comes to picking jobs.</p><p class="calibre2">“Let’s begin.”</p><p class="calibre2">I concentrate, and picture a transmitter. I’ll make a magic stone its core, and iron ore its base.</p><p class="calibre2">A pendant should do nicely for its actual shape.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I send magic energy to ten magic stones, and the magic stone in the center that’s connected to the others starts changing into a darker color. The other magic stones on the other hand gradually lose their color until they’re transparent. They look like glass.</p><p class="calibre2">When I grab the remaining magic stone, it cracks and turns to dust. Did I put too much magic energy into it?</p><p class="calibre2">Next, I try to be careful and hold back the amount of magic energy I pump into it. I try to make sure the light that connects the magic stones doesn’t break, and make sure not to fill it up too much again. Because I’m doing it more slowly, it takes more than twice as long as the last one.</p><p class="calibre2">I grab the magic stone, and this time it doesn’t break. After using Appraisal on it, I see it has become a sorcery stone. Its quality is low, perhaps because of the low amount of magic energy.</p><p class="calibre2">I do some image training to remember the feeling of making magic energy flow into it, and its amount.</p><p class="calibre2">Just as I’m about to start again, I stop, and check my status. After checking my MP, I drink a mana potion.</p><p class="calibre2">I slap my cheeks and get ready to start again. I don’t have to get it right on this one, I have three more chances. I’m going to remember the feeling from before, and slowly increase the amount of magic energy.</p><p class="calibre2">But as a result, my stomach is full, because every time I use Alchemy I drink a mana potion. I couldn’t drink another one if I had to. Maybe I will after some time passes.</p><p class="calibre2">I made four sorcery stones in total. Two are low quality, one is average, and one is high. Now I need to picture a transmitter while using iron ore to make the base, and I’ll be done.</p><p class="calibre2">After taking a break, I start working again.</p><p class="calibre2">If I’m going to use the low quality sorcery stones, I have to use both to make up for their low quality. Maybe I should make a bracelet instead of a pendant. First I use the ore to make a bracelet, then I insert the sorcery stones while sending magic energy into it. And of course, I increase its strength to make sure it doesn’t break easily on impact.</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s one, and the rest… I should make them pendants.”</p><p class="calibre2">I make the bases and chains, and attach sorcery stones. Nice, I don’t need any other artistic skills. I just have to design them by imagining something I know. This is definitely not plagiarism or anything. But I wonder if they’ll recognize them when they see it.</p><p class="calibre2">I line up the three items I made, and send more magic energy into them. These are made to look like the spirit amulets I heard about before, but rather than having the effect of telling others they’re all right, they have a function to search for their location.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right, I’m done.”</p><p class="calibre2">It’s like a main telephone and extensions. By sending magic energy to the main pendant, I can find out where the extensions are. If I hand this to them, it will save me the trouble of looking for them when we can get together again. I just hope they don’t throw them away.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-35"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 21 &ndash; Goodbye</h1><p class="calibre2">“Good morning. It’s almost time to go, but is everything ready?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning. Unlike you Sora, we have plenty of experience doing this, so we won’t be caught unprepared.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But Rurika, you were up late last night checking everything again and…”</p><p class="calibre2">“He doesn’t need to know that.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both laugh, but it feels a bit forced.</p><p class="calibre2">We eat breakfast like usual, and go back to our rooms. They gather their things and talk to the innkeeper, thanking him for everything and stuff like that.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave with them, and head to where they’re supposed to meet with the others.</p><p class="calibre2">We walk silently. No one opens their mouth, and the atmosphere is kind of heavy. Even Rurika, who is usually very talkative, doesn’t say anything.</p><p class="calibre2">We see some people when we get there. One of the C ranked parties that did the escorting quest with us is here too. One person notices us, raises his hand, and we do the same.</p><p class="calibre2">“Rurika and Chris. This is kind of embarrassing, but thank you for everything. I feel like if I was alone, I’d still be doing delivery quests in the capital. I came this far, saw all sorts of things, and experienced all this thanks to the two of you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“W-what’s that all of a sudden? We managed to go back to when we were just beginners and remember all sorts of things we had forgotten, so it was a win-win.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it was fun. Perhaps inappropriate, but fun.”</p><p class="calibre2">I think the inappropriate part comes from the fact that they feel like teaching me things was a detour that took time away from seriously looking for Sera and Eris, which is what they should be doing.</p><p class="calibre2">They’d probably disagree even if I said that’s not true.</p><p class="calibre2">“This isn’t really a thank you, but I’d be happy if you accepted it.”</p><p class="calibre2">I take out a bracelet and a pendant, and give the bracelet to Rurika, and the pendant to Chris.</p><p class="calibre2">“They don’t have the effect of the spirit amulet, but I’d still like you to keep them. You don’t have to equip them if they’re a bother.”</p><p class="calibre2">Now that I think about it, this is my first time giving a present to a girl. I guess I do have some ulterior motives, and in a way, it’s all shiny metal. Ah, are they going to say no because they’re too heavy?</p><p class="calibre2">“T-thank you.”</p><p class="calibre2">Chris goes against my concerns, and bashfully accepts it. She puts it on right away.</p><p class="calibre2">“But why? Are these magic stones? Aren’t they expensive?”</p><p class="calibre2">Rurika on the other hand is worried about the cost.</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry about it. I made some money picking medicinal herbs. I hope you take good care of it.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m speaking very quickly, and my heart is pounding fast. My hands are sweaty too. Am I more nervous than I think? I think this contradicts what I said in the beginning, but I’m really not calm.</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thank you. But are you sure you want to give one to me too? You could’ve scored some points if you gave only Chris a present.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says Rurika, seemingly to hide her embarrassment, but without breaking her teasing attitude.</p><p class="calibre2">I say ‘it’s all right’ again.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you going to stay in this country for the time being, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There are still many towns I haven’t visited. For now, I’m planning on going back to the capital, maybe through a different route because that tigerwolf was scary. If that’s the case, I might as well stop by another town.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I get it I get it. Just don’t over-do it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“We will do our best to be able to introduce you to our friends next time we meet.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, I’ll look forward to that. And I’m going to continue working as an adventurer, safely and comfortably.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes yes. Don’t over-do it. And don’t work too hard, and don’t forget to rest.”</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like we could talk forever. We never run out of things to say.</p><p class="calibre2">But eventually, the time comes to say goodbye. People board horsebuses one after the other, and when I look around, I see others saying goodbye, and some people getting a pep talk.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then, I hope to see you soon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, me too.”</p><p class="calibre2">Both board their horsebus, turn around, and wave.</p><p class="calibre2">I wave back.</p><p class="calibre2">It silently starts moving. They told me they’d reach the Beast Kingdom of Lath in twenty days.</p><p class="calibre2">When will we meet again? I need to take care of all sorts of things, to make sure it’s as soon as possible.</p><p class="calibre2">I watch the caravan until it’s out of my sight, and walk back to the guild.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-15"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 23 &ndash; Traveling</h1><p class="calibre2">I created a legend. What am I talking about?</p><p class="calibre2">It’s been five days, and I’ve been collecting medicinal herbs every day. At first the receptionist lady was happy, but at this point her face twitches when she sees me.</p><p class="calibre2">The most I was able to earn in a day was one gold coin. Even the other adventurers in the guild were surprised. I was invited to join a few parties, but I respectfully declined. They were pretty smothering… Instead, we went to the guild’s tavern, where I bought them drinks and they told me all sorts of adventuring stories. Ten silver coins just flew away with how much we drank. It would’ve been even more, if the guild master didn’t show up to send us home.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’re gonna miss you around here, Sora.”</p><p class="calibre2">I say goodbye to some adventurers I’ve become friendly with, as I enter a horsebus.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m guessing the investigation about the tigerwolf isn’t over yet, because the horsebus going through an alternate route is packed.</p><p class="calibre2">As the wagon shakes, I think about what I’m going to do next.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I’m going to a city south of the capital called South Gate City Epica. From Epica, there is a road to the capital, but also to the Magic State of Efa and the Holy Kingdom of Frieren.</p><p class="calibre2">“The road to the holy kingdom is well-maintained, but the one to the Magic State of Efa goes over a mountain, so it’s tougher. But I guess there must be a lot of rare things there, because a lot of merchants go over there.”</p><p class="calibre2">I hear all sorts of things in the wagon. Especially rumors of places I shouldn’t go near. I get the feeling I’ve been hearing a lot about monsters becoming more active.</p><p class="calibre2">“Does that mean there are a lot of hunting quests?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. That’s fine for big towns with a lot of adventurers, but not so much for smaller villages. The feudal lord can’t just abandon villages either, so I hear he’s busy dispatching soldiers.”</p><p class="calibre2">If villages are destroyed, that means less income for the territory. But even if soldiers are being dispatched, not every place is equal in terms of priority, and some places are going to be damaged.</p><p class="calibre2">“And soldiers are professionals at fighting other people anyway, not monsters. I heard they suffered a lot of damage when monsters first invaded from the dark forest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s the forest that stretches north from the capital, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. In the past there were only simple forts dotted near it, but now there is the fortress city. Apparently S ranked adventurers are being dispatched too.”</p><p class="calibre2">I go through towns and villages, and reach the south gate city ten days later. I’m expected to take another five days to reach the capital itself.</p><p class="calibre2">South Gate City Epica is surrounded by a double layered wall. There is farmland between the inner and outer walls, and the city is behind the inner wall. If we’re only counting the area inside the walls, it’s larger than the capital.</p><p class="calibre2">From the window of the wagon, I see what looks like a wheat field, and dairy farming further in the back.</p><p class="calibre2">Once I’m done with the procedure to go in, I walk to the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">I check the quests, and see there are more quests to help with farming than delivery quests.</p><p class="calibre2">There are hunting quests too, a lot of them to hunt goblins. Some come directly from the villages, and some are regularly posted by the feudal lord. If those are left alone, they’re going to keep increasing.</p><p class="calibre2">And as for medicinal herb picking quests… They exist, but are far from here. If I accept them, I’ll have to make the nearest village my base.</p><p class="calibre2">I ask about inns, and pay to stay in one for five days.</p><p class="calibre2">I go around collecting information while completing delivery quests, but I’ll probably accept other quests if I feel I can do them. I have some leeway when it comes to money, but there are things I want to buy.</p><p class="calibre2">“Status open.”</p><p class="calibre2"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3"></a>Name &ndash; (Sora Fujimiya ) / Job &ndash; (Alchemist) / Race &ndash; Otherworlder / No Level</p><p class="calibre2">HP &ndash; 320/320 / MP &ndash; 320/320 (+100) / SP &ndash; 320/320</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…310 (+0) / Stamina…310 (+0) / Agility…310 (+0)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…310 (+100) / Dexterity…310 (+0) / Luck…310 (+0)</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking Lv31) &ndash; Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk) &ndash; (Get one experience point with each step)</p><p class="calibre2">Experience points &ndash; 27001/31000</p><p class="calibre2">Skill points &ndash; 5</p><p class="calibre2">Skills learned</p><p class="calibre2">(Appraisal Lv8) / (Appraisal Obstruction Lv5) / (Parallel Thinking Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">(Sword Master Lv4) / (Physical Strengthening Lv5) / (Presence Detection Lv8) / (Natural Recovery Boost Lv5) / (Presence Concealment Lv5)</p><p class="calibre2">(Magic Energy Control Lv6) / (Basic Daily Life Magic Lv5) / (Spatial Magic Lv6) / (Alchemy Lv7)</p><p class="calibre2">(Cooking Lv3)</p><p class="calibre2">New</p><p class="calibre2">(Throw &ndash; Shooting Lv2) / (Fire Magic Lv2) / (Water Magic Lv1)</p><p class="calibre2">Throw &ndash; Shooting adjusts my aim when I perform a long-range attack.</p><p class="calibre2">Fire Magic lets me use fire spells.

Am I going to need to use a large amount of water?</p><p class="calibre2">I learned this because I need to know magic of at least three elements to change jobs to Sorcerer.</p><p class="calibre2">As for Throw &ndash; Shooting, it’s because I’ve leveled up Alchemy enough that I can make guns.</p><p class="calibre2">I tried shooting a few times, but I still can’t use them in an actual battle. I’ve never seen a gun or anything like it in this world, so I probably can’t use one in front of other people. But I’m not going to hesitate to use it when I’m in danger. Protecting my life comes first.</p><p class="calibre2">But I’m worried about the durability of the guns I can make. Maybe it’s because of the ore I used, but after firing a few times in succession, they don’t accidentally discharge, but they break.

I haven’t been to the farmlands outside, but I think I’ve walked all over the inner part.</p><p class="calibre2">I see slavers for the first time since I came to this world. I’m thinking about Rurika and Chris too, but I’m also told that buying a slave could be an option if I’m going to keep working solo. They’re pretty serious about it too.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently it’s not that rare for adventurers to form a party by buying slaves, because their scope of activity is pretty narrow when working alone.</p><p class="calibre2">I learn from the slavers that apparently there are different ranks of slaves.</p><p class="calibre2">Criminal slaves. The amount of time they have to serve as slaves depends on their sentences. They have to be freed when their sentence is up, so not a lot of individuals buy them. It’s mostly people involved in agriculture or mining. There are also people who committed serious crimes and were sent to the front lines of defense of the dark forest.</p><p class="calibre2">War slaves. These are prisoners of war or people who were captured in general. Important people are released if their ransom is paid, but when it comes to regular people, they were having trouble figuring out what to do with them, so they sold them.</p><p class="calibre2">Debt slaves. Many of these are citizens who didn’t pay what they owed, or sold themselves for the sake of their families. The terms and conditions for these can be displayed when they are sold. The more favorable the terms are for the buyer, like the inclusion or exclusion of sexual work, the more the slavers pay, because it makes them easier to sell.</p><p class="calibre2">War slaves and debt slaves don’t have a clear liberation date, but it’s possible for them to buy themselves back. Of course, if they’re employed as assistants to merchants for example, they receive less than half of what regular employees get.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, even if they’re slaves, their buyers are obligated to provide for basic living conditions. They are penalized if they do things like not feed them because they’re slaves.</p><p class="calibre2">If they are hired by adventurers, they have to be able to fight, or at the very least agree to fight. Mostly it’s the former, because having someone drag you down is worse than just fighting alone.</p><p class="calibre2">I ask about the price, and it’s well past what I have. Of course, prices go down depending on the conditions, but it’s still not a value one can casually spend.</p><p class="calibre2">I ask if they have any beast people or elf slaves, and I’m told no. Both men and women are pretty popular, so unless there’s a major problem, they’re usually sold pretty quickly here in the kingdom.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave the slavers and head for the guild. There’s a heavy mood in the air.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did something happen?”</p><p class="calibre2">I ask an adventurer I know, and I’m told a caravan that left for the capital five days ago was destroyed. It was a pretty large scale caravan, but it also had an escort of over ten people. I remember them passing by us when I first got here.</p><p class="calibre2">“What did it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Apparently it was monsters. A nearby villager who saw it came here to report it on the fastest horse they have.”</p><p class="calibre2">“And that’s why everyone is gathered here?”</p><p class="calibre2">“They’re talking about forming a hunting party. This was reported yesterday, but they’re talking to the survivors to try to get some more information.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it compulsory?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Probably for the adventurers that live here. Although there’s probably going to be restrictions in terms of monsters and rank.”</p><p class="calibre2">That’s when the guild master shows up. He’s a big muscular man.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re all here, and I assume you already know what’s going on. All adventurers ranked C and above will be joining this hunt. We will be hunting orcs, and it’s believed there are at least thirty.”</p><p class="calibre2">“And the reward?”</p><p class="calibre2">“All participants will receive ten silver coins, with further rewards depending on their performance.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are adventurers below C rank barred from joining?”</p><p class="calibre2">“They can join the hunt if they have experience fighting orcs. But keep in mind that there might be a superior species among them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“When will we leave?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Early tomorrow morning. We will be going by wagon, so bring your own horses if you have them. Things such as food and potions will be provided by us. Any other questions? If not, all participants take care of the formalities. Dismissed.”</p><p class="calibre2">People C ranked and up are processed one after the other, while D ranked adventurers discuss with their parties whether or not to join.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you going?”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m asked, but since I have no experience fighting orcs, I say no.</p><p class="calibre2">But does that mean the road to the capital is closed? I only reserved a room in the inn until today. Should I get an extension?</p><p class="calibre2">I work out a plan while I look at the quests. There are a few hunting quests, but are they going to just sit here now that the orcs are making everyone busy?</p><p class="calibre2">I look for quests that aren’t on the way to the capital… And see wolves. There are medicinal herbs near there, and is this a quest to pick magic energy herbs? I’m going to accept the quest to pick magic energy herbs, and hunt wolves if I can.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-36"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 25 &ndash; Trial run</h1><p class="calibre2">The next day, I see the orc hunting group leave, and walk in the opposite direction.</p><p class="calibre2">I can find magic energy herbs where medicinal herbs grow, but this time I’m going to a place near a village (although it will still take me half a day to get there) that’s famous for having a lot of magic energy herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">Generally speaking, if people go to a regular place to pick herbs, they’re lucky if they find one magic energy herb per ten medicinal herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">That’s not true for me, but that probably has a lot to do with the fact that I can use Appraisal. I’m not looking for them normally.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk to the village without rushing, and it takes me about half a day, just as I expected. Usually that would leave someone pretty tired. I had Presence Detection active as I walked, and sensed about five wolves in the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">“What is your business here?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m here to pick medicinal herbs. If there is an inn, I’d like to stay there.”</p><p class="calibre2">“All right. But don’t loiter around the village. If you bother the villagers I’ll kick you out.”</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t think I’m very welcome here.</p><p class="calibre2">The inn charges me one copper coin per night, and my room has a bed and a shelf to put my things. The food is pretty plain, just barely above preserved food. People don’t talk more than necessary, and I don’t exactly feel comfortable here.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s nothing here in the way of entertainment. It just feels like people are trying to live day to day.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you going to pick medicinal herbs? Don’t go around hunting beasts if you find them, because you’re screwed if you get attacked.”</p><p class="calibre2">Someone warns me. People do hunt monsters, but it’s only when it’s decided they are a threat to the village, and the whole village goes out to hunt them.</p><p class="calibre2">I enter the forest, and the first thing I’m going to do is pick magic energy herbs. I heard all the mana potions were bought for the orc hunt, and that pretty much emptied their stocks. Apparently there are also parties going out to pick magic energy herbs in other places.</p><p class="calibre2">I finally reach the herbs two hours after entering the forest. It’s hard to walk with all the roots in the way. It feels like just walking here and avoiding them would cost people a lot of stamina.</p><p class="calibre2">The area where medicinal herbs are growing seems pretty narrow, but after checking with Appraisal, I see more than half are magic energy herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">I collect quite a bit, while avoiding the ones that are sprouting, and being careful not to pick too much. Then I take a break, and activate magic.</p><p class="calibre2">“Display Map.”</p><p class="calibre2">This is a spell I learned when my Spatial Magic reached level six. It displays a map centered around where I am. Its range is small at first, but I can pump magic energy into it to make the map bigger.</p><p class="calibre2">This also has an automatic mapping feature, so it records where I’ve been.</p><p class="calibre2">By itself it’s not that different from a map in the guild, so I figured this wasn’t all that useful, but it really shines if I combine it with other skills.</p><p class="calibre2">The skill it seems it was pretty much made to be used with is Presence Detection. By using them together, I can see reactions on the map. If the reaction is in a place not yet recorded by Map, it records it, so it’s pretty useful. But if there’s no response, nothing is registered.</p><p class="calibre2">Still, Presence Detection has an effective range too, so the best way to make sure is just to walk.</p><p class="calibre2">“Five wolves… And is there a beast over there? The reaction is too small to be a monster. I think the wolves are too deep in the forest to harm the village, but…”</p><p class="calibre2">Should I hunt them? There’s no one around, so it might be a good opportunity to test my gun. It’s too loud though, so I still need to improve it.</p><p class="calibre2">I approach my target with Presence Concealment active. I’m walking while looking at the map, so I have to be careful not to trip on roots. This gives me trouble at first, but Parallel Thinking conquers it. Skills are so useful, depending on how you use them.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m getting close to the wolves, but they haven’t noticed me yet.</p><p class="calibre2">I ready my gun while I hold my breath. I feel recoil when I pull the trigger, but thanks to my physical strength stats, the gun barrel doesn’t move. But the noise… It sure is loud. I’ll have to check how loudly it echoed when I get back to the village, and have a cover story ready if people are talking about it.</p><p class="calibre2">The bullet I fired hits a wolf in the neck like it was drawn to it. It falls without even having time to shriek.</p><p class="calibre2">The other wolves are now alerted, and raise their heads to look around.</p><p class="calibre2">One of them meets my gaze, and that’s when I pull the trigger.</p><p class="calibre2">The bullet reaches the wolf faster than it can move, and opens a hole in its brow.</p><p class="calibre2">By the time I move the muzzle to my next target, the remaining wolves are already on the move, hiding behind trees while running over here.</p><p class="calibre2">When I point the gun, they move to the sides, as though they’re avoiding my aim. Do they sense danger on an instinctual level?</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t attack with the gun when they move so fast. Even if I pull the trigger, I can’t hit them because they dodge too well.</p><p class="calibre2">I hide too, and retreat. I need to switch from my gun to my sword. Then I undo Presence Concealment for a second, and reactivate it.</p><p class="calibre2">And just as a wolf jumps out from behind a tree, I get close and swing my sword.</p><p class="calibre2">The wolf looks surprised to see me there, and is taken out in one hit.</p><p class="calibre2">But because of this, another wolf jumps at me.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t swing my sword, so I use it as a shield to block the wolf’s attack.</p><p class="calibre2">The wolf rebounds and lands on its feet, and comes at me again right away.</p><p class="calibre2">Is it scared of my gun? It keeps doing small steps side to side as it approaches me.</p><p class="calibre2">I point my sword forward, and don’t let its movements fool me. Rurika taught me this, or rather, carved it into me.</p><p class="calibre2">I kill the wolf’s feint while moving as little as possible, and instead entice it to attack with a feint of my own.</p><p class="calibre2">The wolf takes the bait, and I easily dispatch it.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s one wolf left, and I can feel it getting away from here really fast. I’m guessing it sensed the odds were turning increasingly against it. I use Map to check it, and eventually the blinking dot that represents the wolf disappears.</p><p class="calibre2">I take apart the two wolves I shot, although I still can’t do it very well.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m hiding the fact that I have Storage Magic, so should I buy a magic bag? They’re very expensive. Can I make a small one with Alchemy?</p><p class="calibre2">I go back to the medicinal herbs, and decide to camp here today.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-27"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 26 &ndash; Solo camping and reflection</h1><p class="calibre2">Part of the reason why I want to camp is to raise the proficiency of my Cooking skill.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t cook for myself when I’m in town. I need to ask inn owners to let me use their kitchen, and they don’t always like that.</p><p class="calibre2">And even though they’re not exactly local delicacies, there is food in stalls that I can only eat in specific towns, so I end up eating there too.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m having wolf steak for dinner, and soup made from edible wild herbs I picked on the way here and wolf meat.</p><p class="calibre2">Having things like soup stock powder can really change a meal while camping.</p><p class="calibre2">I boil wolf bones and salt them. Then I throw in wild herbs and wolf meat, and boil it again while managing the fire.</p><p class="calibre2">I cut the tendons off the steak meat, sprinkle some salt and pepper, and grill. Spices and seasonings are expensive.</p><p class="calibre2">As I eat this plain tasting soup, I start thinking. I’m feeling relatively comfortable with my life, so I need to think about what’s next. I guess food is what’s next on the agenda. Just getting to eat good food is enough to fill one’s heart… Or at least it should be.</p><p class="calibre2">And if I can sell it, I won’t have to continue working as an adventurer.</p><p class="calibre2">I can be a traveling merchant if I want to go around to different places.</p><p class="calibre2">Another thing that’s on my mind is this guild card. I carry it with me as a means of identification, but how important is that in this world? I use it to enter towns and villages, and I show it when I accept quests and report that I completed them, but does it contain records of when I used it?</p><p class="calibre2">Now that I think about it, I saw them holding my guild card over some sort of magic item when I entered someplace and showed it to them.</p><p class="calibre2">They said something about checking if I wasn’t a criminal, I think? They didn’t do that in the village.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve seen guild employees do something with the card when I accept quests or report that I completed them. But from a skeptical point of view, it looks like they’re able to track me.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s fine while I’m here, but when I move to another country, I should probably get another form of identification. I’d be happy if the people of this country just abandoned me because I’m useless and left it at that, but I don’t think they’re going to give up that easily. I need to deal with that too.</p><p class="calibre2">I finish eating, and after a short break, switch gears to something else.</p><p class="calibre2">The topic at hand now is the fighting I did today. It proved to me that the gun is clearly helpful in battle.</p><p class="calibre2">But it’s not without its problems. It’s true that I’m just not used to it, but I can’t stay calm and use it when the enemy gets near. I guess it can’t be helped, since it’s supposed to be a long distance weapon anyway.</p><p class="calibre2">Should I make another one and start using two? Or remodel it so it’s capable of rapid-fire?</p><p class="calibre2">Obviously I’m not going to aim very well with my non-dominant hand, but I have a skill that corrects it, so I think I should be able to do it if I practice.</p><p class="calibre2">The other issue is power. The bullets pierced the wolves’ bodies, but will they do the same with monsters who have tougher skin? I’m particularly thinking about orcs.</p><p class="calibre2">If they don’t work, I can probably work on them to make them tougher and more powerful, but will the gun barrel withstand those without breaking?</p><p class="calibre2">There are a lot of problems. If I’m going to rework the gun, I’m going to need ore used in alchemy too.</p><p class="calibre2">I spread a sheet on the ground, and sleep wrapped with a robe.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s no rush to get back, so I’m going to spend another day walking around the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Appraisal as I walk around. Today’s goal is to look for things that are edible and I can use as ingredients. There are wild herbs, but also other things like berries. I find quite a bit once I actually start looking.</p><p class="calibre2">Some people say nature is a storehouse of food, and I guess they have a point. There are mushrooms too.</p><p class="calibre2">But I have to make sure to always use Appraisal, because some plants are toxic.</p><p class="calibre2">This one has a component that causes paralysis. Can I use this to make something like a paralyzing bullet?</p><p class="calibre2">　◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">After camping for another day, I decide to return to the village because I’m running out of space in my Item Box.</p><p class="calibre2">The gatekeeper is surprised to see me. It’s probably because I told him I was going out to pick medicinal herbs, and he expected me to come back the same day.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did something happen?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I lost track of time while I was picking herbs. Then I came across some wolves and got lost.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wolves? Where?”</p><p class="calibre2">“North from where I was picking medicinal herbs. There were two of them, so I took them down, but…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. If you have meat with you, we can buy it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I ate some while I was camping, but I can sell the rest. What about the fur?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t you think you can get more money for it if you sell it in the guild?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s less to carry, so I don’t mind. In return, I’d be thankful if you asked the innkeeper to make a nice meal. Especially if it’s something characteristic of this village.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ok. Hold on a second, I have to go call someone.”</p><p class="calibre2">I sell the wolf meat and fur I have on me, and spend the night in the village.</p><p class="calibre2">The food has been bumped up a notch, like I requested, and became a little fancier. Although the innkeeper is still silent and doesn’t show any sign of wanting to be friendly.</p><p class="calibre2">For some reason, I also paid half the price for staying here. The gatekeeper tells me it’s a reward for taking out the wolves for them. I’m thinking it’s less like a reward and more like a token of appreciation.</p><p class="calibre2">The next day, when I leave, I feel like the gatekeeper’s tone is a little softer.</p><p class="calibre2">Damage caused by monsters is probably a serious problem in this village.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-16"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 27 &ndash; Orc hunt &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">I go back to the city, and it’s wrapped in a busy atmosphere. Did something happen?</p><p class="calibre2">I go to the guild to report on my picking quest, and they’re really happy. They told me before they didn’t have enough magic energy herbs, but the group that went out to hunt the orcs requested more mana potions, so their stocks are pretty much depleted.</p><p class="calibre2">“Did some sort of trouble happen with the hunt?”</p><p class="calibre2">They got ready to go in a hurry, but I remember hearing that they took a lot of supplies.</p><p class="calibre2">“When they got there, they learned that the scope of the orcs is bigger than they thought… Apparently there’s a lot of confusion over there too.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are they all right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I hear they were attacked but managed to push them back. But… No, if there’s anything else, the guild will announce it. Come back tomorrow morning if you want to know more.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m told they’ll buy medicinal herbs and vitality herbs if I have them too, so I take out some of them.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t sell potions as they are.</p><p class="calibre2">As I walk around, I hear rumors about the orcs.</p><p class="calibre2">A large group went out to hunt them, and merchants are always gathering information, so the townspeople know what’s going on too.</p><p class="calibre2">Merchants who were headed to the capital are obviously troubled, because they can’t safely cross the path to their destination.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m sure there are quite a few people who were headed to the capital via the South Gate City because of the tigerwolf. I’m in the same boat, although my motives are different.</p><p class="calibre2">For now, I’ll just pay to stay in the inn for one night.</p><p class="calibre2">The inn is basically empty, probably because so many adventurers are out on a hunt.</p><p class="calibre2">The next day, I go to the guild early in the morning to try to gather information. If the hunt has no end in sight, I need to accept quests while I’m here. I have enough money to keep going without accepting quests, but having more money is never a problem, and I might buy a slave.</p><p class="calibre2">When I reach the guild, I see information being displayed. Adventurers crowd around it to look at it, forming a human wall.</p><p class="calibre2">Seeing as I’m probably not going to be able to catch a glimpse of it for now, I go check out the quests.</p><p class="calibre2">I get the feeling that the quests related to medicinal herbs are increasing. Hn? The rewards are getting higher too.</p><p class="calibre2">I look at the map, and see the place I went to before is the closest one. Or at least it would be, if it was included in the note saying where we can pick herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">It says the place I went to doesn’t have a consistent amount to pick. Or maybe too many people went there and it was picked clean.</p><p class="calibre2">There were a lot of magic energy herbs there, but I get the feeling there were too few medicinal herbs and vitality herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">While I groan in front of the board with the quests, people are leaving the other side, so I move there.</p><p class="calibre2">Let’s see… We are receiving more information about the scope of the group of orcs. There were reports by multiple people that a superior species was sighted during our first fierce clash, so scouts are currently being sent to confirm this information. It says.</p><p class="calibre2">The rest is about construction of simple fortresses and defensive bases. It also asks the feudal lord for the support of the chivalric order.</p><p class="calibre2">I think they should probably just retreat until the chivalric order arrives, but maybe they’re building defensive positions to distract scouts and stuff like that.</p><p class="calibre2">“H-hum…”</p><p class="calibre2">Someone calls out to me as I look at the board. I think it’s one of the ladies that works as a receptionist.</p><p class="calibre2">“What is it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hum, are you Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I am.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Thank goodness. Can you come over here? There is something I want to talk to you about.”</p><p class="calibre2">We head to an empty reception desk.</p><p class="calibre2">“So…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I have a quest for you…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is that what’s called a designated quest? I am only ranked D.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Not really a designated quest, rather, I heard you are a pro when it comes to picking quests, and would like you to accept one.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Where did you hear that?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Adventurers have been talking about it, but then we received a report from the adventurer guild in Physis.”</p><p class="calibre2">Is that a good answer? No, wait, does that mean guilds can communicate with each other?</p><p class="calibre2">“If you need them for the hunt, it would be better if you didn’t get your hopes up.”</p><p class="calibre2">“W-why?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t know how much you need, but if you want me to deliver a lot, the places where I can pick them are too far. It would take me a day, no, two, and that’s not including the time it would take me to actually pick them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes, the places where you can pick a lot are far from here. But what if we provided a wagon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That would take less time, but I don’t really want to go with other people.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Eh… Why?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I want to be able to focus while I pick.”</p><p class="calibre2">That’s a lie. I just don’t want people to see me pick them. What if someone feels there’s something odd about it?</p><p class="calibre2">If they’re willing to provide a wagon, I’m sure they’re going to hire more people and have as many as possible picking herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">“So…? I can continue to accept picking quests normally. They pay well, so I was going to do it anyway.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Please wait. I have to talk to my superiors.”</p><p class="calibre2">The receptionist lady gets up in a hurry and disappears to the back.</p><p class="calibre2">Hn… So they’re low on medicinal herbs… Wouldn’t it be more effective if they just brought them here and I did the picking? But I guess there’s also the risk of getting ripped off by the middle man. It’s tough.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-6"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 28 &ndash; Picking quest</h1><p class="calibre2">I look outside as the scenery runs past me in the shaking wagon. The sound of a rattling wooden box is the soundtrack of this journey.</p><p class="calibre2">Riding on the back of the wagon are me, five other adventurers, and a wooden box to fill with medicinal herbs. In the driver’s seat is the driver and an adventurer guarding him.</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you think the rainy season is almost here?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I guess, but I sure hope it waits until we get back. Camping in the rain is no fun.”</p><p class="calibre2">So the concept of rain does exist in this world. Is it just luck that it hasn’t rained so far?</p><p class="calibre2">I’ll be spending the night here to do the picking quest.</p><p class="calibre2">There are several spots to pick medicinal herbs not far from each other, so we’ll split up to pick them.</p><p class="calibre2">Of course, that means I’m picking alone. I made it very clear I wouldn’t do it otherwise. That might have left them with a bad impression of me, but it’s not even a designated quest anyway, so I have the right to choose.</p><p class="calibre2">“We’ll come by here just past noon tomorrow. Make sure you’re here.”</p><p class="calibre2">The wagon stops by a tree that’s going to serve as a landmark. I jump down and nod.</p><p class="calibre2">I watch the wagon go until it’s out of my sight, and go pick right away.</p><p class="calibre2">I understand how demanding I’m being, so I need to show results too.</p><p class="calibre2">It takes me about two hours to walk to the medicinal herbs. This is a grassy plain with good visibility, so I’ll know right away if something is coming. On the other hand, it also makes it easy to spot me.</p><p class="calibre2">I activate Map and Presence Detection.</p><p class="calibre2">It doesn’t seem like anyone is near.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk around the grassy plain with Appraisal active.</p><p class="calibre2">Today I’m going to be picking magic energy herbs and vitality herbs, but mostly focus on medicinal herbs.</p><p class="calibre2">There are usually more medicinal herbs than the others anyway, so I only have to walk for a bit before I find one.</p><p class="calibre2">I was told it’s all right if I pick by the root. Does it have to do with the rain?</p><p class="calibre2">Medicinal herbs are plants, so I’m guessing they work the same in this world, and grow if they get water.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m completely focused on picking, and before I know it, the sun has gone down quite a bit.</p><p class="calibre2">I remember I need to at least find a good place to sleep before it gets dark, so I start looking around.</p><p class="calibre2">I look for a hollow spot, and find a nice one a bit far from here.</p><p class="calibre2">They were talking about rain, so I make a simple roof with the sheet, and take advantage of the hollow to protect myself from the rain and wind.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve picked about eighty percent of what I planned to pick, but they said they’re going to pay more the more I pick, so I’m going to pick as much as time permits.</p><p class="calibre2">That said, it’s hard to do it after the sun has gone down. The light from Basic daily Life Magic doesn’t improve visibility all that much. I could probably do it if I had light magic, but…</p><p class="calibre2">I start a fire, and get to cooking.</p><p class="calibre2">I pour water on a pot, and a kind of portable food specifically made to make soup that I created and prepared yesterday.</p><p class="calibre2">The bread I have was bought from a store and kept with Storage Magic, so I take it out and take a bite. It doesn’t have the effect to stop time or anything, so I hold it over the fire a bit. That is enough to make a big difference in how it tastes. Then I spread some butter and eat it.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m done eating, so now I just have to go to sleep. I use Purification from Basic Daily Life Magic on myself, and get ready to go to sleep.</p><p class="calibre2">But before I do, I activate Map and Presence Detection. I think I’m fine, because I’m keeping Presence Detection active, but I use it along with Map just to be sure.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, even though Presence Detection didn’t pick it up, there is a reaction on the map.</p><p class="calibre2">The blinking light doesn’t look stable, but a red dot appears on the map from time to time.</p><p class="calibre2">“What is this…”</p><p class="calibre2">This sudden occurrence stops me dead in my tracks.</p><p class="calibre2">I look at the map for a while, and when I calm down, I stop being so alarmed and try to relax.</p><p class="calibre2">If someone’s watching me, they could also sense that I’m alerted.</p><p class="calibre2">From what I can see on the map, they’re not moving.</p><p class="calibre2">I stay put for a while, and eventually it disappears.</p><p class="calibre2">After thinking about what to do, I decide to set up a simple trap. This isn’t necessarily to catch whoever is watching, it’s more to hinder their approach. I try to make it seem like I’m just looking out for monsters, in a way that doesn’t raise any alarms.</p><p class="calibre2">Now I just have to get Parallel Thinking working to its fullest while I sleep.</p><p class="calibre2">A faint sound wakes me up, I guess because I wasn’t sleeping very deeply due to the mysterious observer or whatever it was.</p><p class="calibre2">I call out Map again and use Presence Detection, but nothing shows up. But is it because whatever it was isn’t there, or because they’re just very good at hiding? Was that reaction from yesterday an error?</p><p class="calibre2">An ominous shade is cast on me, and when I relax and look up, I see the sky is covered with gloomy looking clouds, and it starts to gently rain.</p><p class="calibre2">I eat breakfast quickly, get my things, and start picking medicinal herbs again.</p><p class="calibre2">The plan was to pick as much as time permitted, but now I’m aiming for the amount I had in mind.</p><p class="calibre2">I walk around the grassy plain, praying for the rain to not get stronger.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m in a hurry, but I don’t want to get sloppy. If I pick them and they can’t be used, it will all be for nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">As I start to get the feeling it must be around noon, I stop picking.</p><p class="calibre2">I activate Map, but don’t see a reaction of the wagon. I think I still have some time, but the rain is getting a little stronger, so I decide to end it here.</p><p class="calibre2">I go to the tree where I’m supposed to meet them, stretch some rope and use the sheet to make a shelter against the rain near the tree.</p><p class="calibre2">I get a rock so I don’t have to sit directly on the ground, and use it as a chair.</p><p class="calibre2">I take off the robe, hang it from a branch, and start a fire to warm myself.</p><p class="calibre2">The robe is waterproof, so I’m not wet, but the temperature is dropping, and I’m feeling a little chilly.</p><p class="calibre2">I heat up some soup to warm my body from the inside, and take a deep breath with my stomach full.</p><p class="calibre2">While I’m resting, a reaction being displayed on the map gets closer.</p><p class="calibre2">“So you really are here. Did you stop early because of the rain too?”</p><p class="calibre2">Asks the driver of the wagon.</p><p class="calibre2">Apparently they came back sooner than the appointed time.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t confirm or deny it, and put my stuff in the wooden box, before retrieving the sheet and rope, and putting on the robe.</p><p class="calibre2">I enter the wagon, and the other adventurers seem exhausted.</p><p class="calibre2">I’d feel bad making them use their strength to talk, so I just say hello and sit in an empty space.</p><p class="calibre2">And as if waiting for me to sit, the wagon takes off. I really can’t get used to how much it shakes.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-37"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 29 &ndash; Magic Energy Detection</h1><p class="calibre2">It’s the day after the picking quest.</p><p class="calibre2">I just finished a delivery quest, so I go back to the inn, and dive on the bed.</p><p class="calibre2">My head hurts. It’s throbbing, so I use Water Magic to dampen a towel and place it on my forehead. It probably doesn’t do much, but at least it feels like the pain is getting better.</p><p class="calibre2">This is what I get for having Presence Detection on without ever turning it off. I figured I was pushing myself too much, but I wanted to raise its proficiency.</p><p class="calibre2">Proficiency of Presence Detection is increased by sensing presences. The more I sense, the faster it grows. It grows even faster if I focus the sensitivity on a target.</p><p class="calibre2">But this time I went over the limit and spent all my SP, and my body is feeling the recoil. That’s the state I’m in now. I didn’t know about it at the time, but apparently this could’ve been avoided if I drank stamina potions.</p><p class="calibre2">I lay down for a while and compose my breathing, as the headache slowly gets better.</p><p class="calibre2">After taking a sip of water, I check my skills.</p><p class="calibre2">“Presence Detection LvMAX.”</p><p class="calibre2">I finally raised it to the limit. I’m guessing other skills are also capped at level ten.</p><p class="calibre2">My breathing is in order, so I try activating Presence Detection. There’s a distinction between stronger and lighter reactions.</p><p class="calibre2">Do the lighter reactions come from people with the Presence Concealment skill? That’s hard to check from here. I need to check with my own eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">And then I notice a skill I haven’t seen before.</p><p class="calibre2">New</p><p class="calibre2">‘Magic Energy Detection’</p><p class="calibre2">It’s what it sounds like, a skill to detect a target’s magic energy. How does it differ from Presence Detection? All I know is that since it appeared when I maxed out Presence Detection, it must be related to searching for enemies too.</p><p class="calibre2">I haven’t been using skill points, so I have a few saved up. I want to say it will have some sort of use, but… I need two skill points to learn it.</p><p class="calibre2">In the end, I decide to invest those points in learning Magic Energy Detection.</p><p class="calibre2">I try using it right away, and get a reaction. Since it’s so low leveled, the effective area is pretty small. It only extends around this inn, but I can see bigger and smaller reactions.</p><p class="calibre2">Is it just a skill to check the amount of magic energy? If it is, I feel like Presence Detection would be enough. Did I mess up…</p><p class="calibre2">No no. It’s too early to jump to conclusions. I need to actually test it and raise its level.</p><p class="calibre2">I check my jobs while I’m at it, and see a new one, Scout. I’m guessing it would revise the values of enemy detection skills. I’m going to be working alone a lot for a while, so maybe I’ll change jobs.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, you’re looking better. Are you feeling all right?”</p><p class="calibre2">The innkeeper lady says when I enter the dining hall.</p><p class="calibre2">She knew? Did I look that bad? I guess I probably did.</p><p class="calibre2">“I think I’ve been working too much. I’m thinking of taking it easy today.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You adventurers sure are busy bees. The others haven’t come back from their hunt either. It’s really hurting business.”</p><p class="calibre2">She leaves after saying something I don’t know is a joke or completely serious.</p><p class="calibre2">She’s talking about the ones that went out to hunt orcs. I heard that the chivalric order is leaving today, and taking potions with them.</p><p class="calibre2">Maybe I’ll go watch.</p><p class="calibre2">I eat and head to the gate. There are a lot of people here.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone’s eyes are fixated on the knights wearing the same equipment and not moving a muscle.</p><p class="calibre2">The person I assume is their commander gives the order, and the knights and wagons head out.</p><p class="calibre2">There are probably about two hundred people there. The noise they make when they all move out at once feels like an earthquake, although that’s quickly drowned out by cheers.</p><p class="calibre2">The uproar continues for a while, until the knights are out of our sight and everyone disperses.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, a horsebus enters the city.</p><p class="calibre2">I stare at it, and see a face I recognize.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, Sora. Thanks for coming to greet me here.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, Gob…”</p><p class="calibre2">I say without thinking, and he comes close very quickly. I don’t want a close-up of a rugged old man.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hn? What?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It’s been a while, Siphon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Ou, you look well. We just passed by a bunch of knights. What’s happening?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’ll learn more about it in the guild, but it’s a unit to go hunt orcs.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Orcs? I feel like a whole lot of people just left.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Apparently there are a lot of them, and even a superior species. A lot of adventurers went too, and the inn I’m staying in is almost empty.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Isn’t that lucky? Aren’t you going?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No, one of the conditions is prior experience fighting orcs. Ah, and they’re in the direction of the capital, so travel there is suspended.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Seriously? I guess we should go visit the guild.”</p><p class="calibre2">Goblin’s Grief all gather again and head on to the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t follow them, and instead walk around. I mostly look around stalls and the local delicacies. Not everything is good, but it’s not bad at all.</p><p class="calibre2">After I finish eating, I go to a weapons store to ask to do maintenance on my equipment, and continue walking around while checking the prices of ore. I feel like tools in general are slowly getting more expensive, probably because the road to the capital is blocked. Potions have gone up twenty percent too.</p><p class="calibre2">“Orcs…”</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve never actually seen one. Unlike goblins, they’re about two meters tall, and while they’re muscular, they’re also agile. Their skin is tough, and a dull weapon isn’t going to put a scratch on them.</p><p class="calibre2">I want to avoid danger, but part of me also wants to fight. To be more precise, I want to know if I can defeat one…</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-28"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 30 &ndash; Training</h1><p class="calibre2">I go to the guild after taking it easy for a day.</p><p class="calibre2">There are less picking quests. Rewards are going up, so more and more people with nothing else to do are taking them.</p><p class="calibre2">Hunting quests are the opposite, they’re being left here. These are the bread and butter of adventurers, and competition over them can be fierce. People come here early in the morning to scramble to take them, and a lot of these people are very hot-blooded.</p><p class="calibre2">The fact that these quests are still here is a side-effect of the orc hunt. There’s simply a shortage of hands.</p><p class="calibre2">There are people like Siphon and the others coming from different places, so it’s not like no one can accept them, but I don’t know what will happen if this gets dragged out for much longer.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ou, you’re here looking for quests too, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You accepted one, Siphon? You’re full of energy right from the start of the day.”</p><p class="calibre2">They arrived yesterday and are already accepting quests. I know this is hypocritical coming from me, but they have too much energy.</p><p class="calibre2">“Nah, not today. Maybe I would’ve if I was alone.”</p><p class="calibre2">His hearty laugh shows no sign of him being tired from a long journey.</p><p class="calibre2">They have to resupply, and the other members of his party want to go have a look around, because they haven’t been here in a long time.</p><p class="calibre2">“So people aren’t taking hunting quests, uh…”</p><p class="calibre2">He thinks so too.</p><p class="calibre2">“What are you thinking of accepting, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m not very good at hunting quests. If I go somewhere and I encounter monsters, I have no choice, but I don’t really want to take the initiative to go out and fight. Safety first.”</p><p class="calibre2">I feel more comfortable fighting monsters I’ve taken down before, but I don’t think I’m going to go out of my way to accept a quest to hunt monsters I’ve never seen. To be honest, I’m scared.</p><p class="calibre2">“What kind of monsters have you fought so far?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wolves and goblins.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve actually hunted more, but I know those would be hard for me to deal with… And it’s not like I was alone anyway.</p><p class="calibre2">“So the gatekeepers for beginners. Things that are relatively easy to fight. Snakes, spiders, bees, and stuff like that are harder to deal with.”</p><p class="calibre2">Snakes are blood snakes, spiders are just called spiders, and bees are killer bees.</p><p class="calibre2">They all have distinctive characteristics, and come with notes on reference books too.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hunting alone is tough, isn’t it? Fighting monsters is something you get used to as you get more experienced doing it, and if you form a party, you can cover for each other’s weaknesses.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What about you Siphon? Have you been with this party for a long time?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Me and Yuno formed a party, and joined in with Jin and the others. There was a joint hunting quest, and we hit it off. Other than that…”</p><p class="calibre2">He points to the guild’s board.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s a paper pasted there about recruiting party members. The current members and their skills are written there, and so is the kind of person they’re looking for. Is there somewhere to write my own skills?</p><p class="calibre2">“But they’re mostly going to work in the place where they’re recruiting people, right? “</p><p class="calibre2">“It should say their goals too. It says this party here wants to conquer dungeons.”</p><p class="calibre2">It really is there. Most people are low ranked.</p><p class="calibre2">“And then there’s this.”</p><p class="calibre2">He’s looking at… A pathway?</p><p class="calibre2">“There’s a training area there. People gather there to test their skills, but some end up taking the opportunity to form parties.”</p><p class="calibre2">So it’s like a place where people can meet…</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you going to try looking for a party too?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m fine. I’m not that interested in forming a party for now.”</p><p class="calibre2">That’s half true. The other half is that I just don’t feel like I’m a part of this place.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve been in this world for around fifty days, but I don’t really get the feeling that I’m living here. I feel like I’m in a foreign country, going around looking at the sights.</p><p class="calibre2">I get it, but I can’t really wrap my mind around it. I keep thinking that they’re going to defeat the demon king, and then all of a sudden I’ll be back in my world. Or I guess it’s more like that’s what I’m hoping.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m excited about magic and skills and all that, but the comfort of my daily life just isn’t the same.</p><p class="calibre2">“Even though this is very clearly real…”</p><p class="calibre2">When I was with Rurika and Chris, I definitely wanted to be of help, but now that I’m alone, and the more time goes on, the more that resolve is wavering.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s like I got motivated, but as time goes on that enthusiasm is going away.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ou, you’re here too, Geitz?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I’m done with what I had to do, so I figured I’d do a little exercise.”</p><p class="calibre2">“That’s perfect. We’re gonna help this lost newbie.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m lost in thought, when suddenly I feel a slap on my shoulder.</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You think too much, and at times like these, it’s better not to think about anything and move your body instead. Right, Geitz?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You think too little leader, but you do have a point. Come train with us for a bit. Doing it with the same people all the time gets repetitive. “</p><p class="calibre2">“You heard it. Come on.”</p><p class="calibre2">I try to resist them as they forcibly take me away, but stop.</p><p class="calibre2">Maybe it really is a good idea to clear my head and just do some exercise.</p><p class="calibre2">“No one handles a shield better than Geitz. Try hitting him first.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m given a wooden sword, and face Geitz.</p><p class="calibre2">He has a smallish wooden sword and a shield. He drops his stance, and waits for an attack.</p><p class="calibre2">I try going to the left and right to go around the shield, but he points it at me with minimal movements. I try attacking, but he easily dodges and takes advantage of the fact that I’ve lost my balance to come at me with a counterattack.</p><p class="calibre2">I have to fall back, and this time swing the sword down hard.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s a dull noise, and the feeling in my hands is like if I just punched a boulder. The shield didn’t even budge. His stance is even lower than before, and this time he doesn’t counter, probably because he’s focusing on defense.</p><p class="calibre2">Then I try to mix it up by doing strong attacks and not so strong attacks.</p><p class="calibre2">At first it goes well. I’m able to take advantage of the moment when he stops and manage to attack again. But I’m guessing he’s gradually getting used to it, because he changes the way he deals with each blow depending on what kind of blow it is, and counterattacks.</p><p class="calibre2">I attack, trying to land at least one hit, but it all gets guarded, and the training ends when the wooden sword slips out of my hand.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-17"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 31 &ndash; Orc hunt &ndash; Part three</h1><p class="calibre2">Ever since I trained with Geitz, I’ve been asked to go train every time I show up at the guild.</p><p class="calibre2">“…You’re not weak, you’re actually better than a lot of people on the lower end of the spectrum. You’ll become a good attacker if you keep piling on the experience and learning techniques.”</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like Geitz saying this has made me accepted by people here.</p><p class="calibre2">On days when I’m not out of town doing quests, I’m always fighting someone. I get offers to join parties, but I say no, because I’m headed to the capital once that becomes possible again.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve learned something after fighting several people.</p><p class="calibre2">I never thought about it until this point, but my physical abilities are excellent. At the very least strength, stamina, and agility are all above average. I only lost in an exchange of blows against one person, and he was a muscular guy with tree trunks for arms.</p><p class="calibre2">If I could see my opponents’ status, I could very easily check, but even at Appraisal level nine, I still can’t do that. Will that restriction be lifted when I max out its level?</p><p class="calibre2">Siphon and his party have been vigorously accepting hunting quests, and we meet and train on their days off.</p><p class="calibre2">Siphon also trades blows with me, but I’m keeping it a secret that Geitz’s teachings are actually more helpful.</p><p class="calibre2">Geitz doesn’t talk much, but apparently he’s known for his skills with the shield. His power of insight is great, and he can observe his opponents’ movements while blocking their attacks, so people often ask him for his opinions.</p><p class="calibre2">This goes on for a few days, until eventually the group that went out hunting for orcs returns.</p><p class="calibre2">The townspeople were eagerly waiting for news about the hunt, and gather in front of the gate to get a glimpse of the heroes.</p><p class="calibre2">The group can be seen coming this way from far away. Everyone starts cheering, but once they get a better look at them, the cheering suddenly stops, and is replaced with perplexed expressions.</p><p class="calibre2">Everyone is in tatters. I can’t help but feel that they look like soldiers who escaped from a losing battle.</p><p class="calibre2">They don’t look elated at all about completing their hunt, and there’s a heavy mood in the air as they go through the gate,</p><p class="calibre2">It looks like their numbers have decreased quite a bit too. I get the feeling that less than half the knights that left are returning.</p><p class="calibre2">The townspeople are speechless, and watch them in silence.</p><p class="calibre2">“It doesn’t feel like the hunt was a success.”</p><p class="calibre2">But I also feel like they would be a lot more flurried if the hunt failed and they came back running.</p><p class="calibre2">I also see what looks like defeated orcs loaded onto the wagons, but it’s less than you’d expected from such a large group.</p><p class="calibre2">The answers I’m looking for come later that night when I’m sitting in the dining hall.</p><p class="calibre2">Siphon invites me to have dinner with him again, and when we sit down, we’re sharing a table with one of the adventurers that participated in the orc hunt. Apparently Siphon knows him, and he says they’ve accepted joint quests a few times.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re here too, Siphon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I was thinking about coming here from Physis and then heading back to the capital. Have you been working here, Draco?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. There’s not as many quests here as in the capital, but it’s not bad. But more importantly, it’s not as cutthroat as the capital, there’s less competition over quests here.”</p><p class="calibre2">“So, what actually happened? Is there a gag order?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There isn’t. It’s going to be announced by the guild tomorrow anyway. Honestly, this isn’t the sort of thing we can let people be in the dark about.”</p><p class="calibre2">Siphon waits for Draco to continue while pouring a drink.</p><p class="calibre2">Draco takes a sip, and says the next phrase like he’s spitting it out.</p><p class="calibre2">“There was a demon.”</p><p class="calibre2">“A what…?”</p><p class="calibre2">The eyes of everyone who was listening are fixated on Draco. Even people sitting at other tables are now looking at him.</p><p class="calibre2">Confusion, bewilderment, and shock spread throughout the room.</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re kidding…”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s true. That was a demon.”</p><p class="calibre2">Draco’s expression twists with fear, like he’s remembering what happened there.</p><p class="calibre2">Sweat suddenly starts dripping from his forehead. He tries to start speaking, but closes his mouth, like he’s hesitant to talk about this.</p><p class="calibre2">This happens a few times, until he finally starts speaking quietly. It sounds like he wants to put it all out there and forget that fear.</p><p class="calibre2">They found out about a settlement of orcs deep in the forest, so they were going to assault it along with the knights. The plan was to rescue the hostages and crush every single orc.</p><p class="calibre2">Since they had A ranked adventurers and knights, they defeated even the superior species of orc that were present, like the high orc and orc general, even if they suffered some damage.</p><p class="calibre2">There were only a few orcs left, when he appeared.</p><p class="calibre2">He came flying out of the clear open sky, and glided as he observed what was happening on the surface.</p><p class="calibre2">An uproar broke out as people started noticing him, and as if waiting for it, he raised his hand.</p><p class="calibre2">According to a magic user Draco knows, that magic energy felt explosive.</p><p class="calibre2">Light fell down, and a group of knights were flung away with an explosion. When the dust settled, there was a hole in the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">It happened again, and a third time, until it was quiet again.</p><p class="calibre2">His eyes were clearly deep red like blood even from a distance, and they sent a chill down everyone’s spines. They made people tremble, even if they weren’t looking him directly in the eyes,</p><p class="calibre2">He approached them as if he was strolling, and casually swung his arms. Adventurers who were near were flung, blown away, and it literally started raining blood.</p><p class="calibre2">Draco doesn’t remember the rest very well, he just ran frantically. Before he knew it, he was trembling in the forest, waiting for the noise to stop. The screams were burned into his eardrums, and it felt like he could still hear them even after he covered his ears.</p><p class="calibre2">He doesn’t know how long it was, but eventually the noise stopped, and he followed others as they went back to the settlement. He didn’t want to go, but felt like he had to at least check how it was.</p><p class="calibre2">He says that if there is a hell, he saw it. It was horrible. Pieces of flesh splattered around, corpses everywhere… There was a mess of both people and orcs.</p><p class="calibre2">The adventurers and knights that stayed there said they fought the demon back, but in reality, they dealt next to no damage to it. In the end, he said ‘this isn’t it’ and left.</p><p class="calibre2">The survivors buried the dead, gathered whatever mementos remained, and retrieved orc materials and magic stones as proof that they at least defeated the orcs. They then came back quickly, or rather, ran back. Draco laughed self-deprecatingly as he finished telling us his story.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-7"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 32 &ndash; Hunting quest &ndash; Part one</h1><p class="calibre2">The next day, the guild is wrapped in a heavy mood.</p><p class="calibre2">A third of the adventurers that went out to hunt orcs didn’t return.</p><p class="calibre2">The knights weren’t too bad when compared to the adventurers, but many are shaken by the thought of people they knew suddenly being gone.</p><p class="calibre2">People who choose to be adventurers do so with the knowledge that they’re constantly dancing with death, but the fact that it was something as shocking as being trampled by a demon is part of why people are so shaken.</p><p class="calibre2">Demon… They are said to have appeared in this world at the same time as the demon king.</p><p class="calibre2">They are like the demon king’s vanguard. Three years ago someone saw an oracle about the return of the demon king, and in this world that still only half believes it, this encounter can be said to have solidified the existence of the demon king.</p><p class="calibre2">Contrary to everyone else in the guild, I’m going about my business as usual. I decide to accept a hunting quest, in part to test the results of my training.</p><p class="calibre2">Wolves are the most profitable. Their materials can be sold, and I can use their meat to practice cooking too. They’re tasty in two different ways. And since I used a gun last time, this time I’m thinking about using a sword to take them down.</p><p class="calibre2">But goblins would be better to test the results of my inter-personal training. Although that feels unimportant compared to getting more money.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, you’re here to accept quests too, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">I turn around, and see Siphon. I feel like he always shows up even when he’s not called.</p><p class="calibre2">“Good morning. I was wondering what happened, since you didn’t show up to have breakfast.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I drank too much last night. Yuno got mad at me too…”</p><p class="calibre2">His wife, Yuno, is said to be scary when she’s mad. At least that’s what I heard from Geitz.</p><p class="calibre2">I do remember hearing him say he would be drinking with Draco to console him.</p><p class="calibre2">“And since you’re here, are you going to accept a quest too?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, hunting quests are really piling up. I’m not going to have peace of mind when I go to the capital unless we at least reduce their number to some extent. So, what are you accepting, Sora?”</p><p class="calibre2">“This wolf hunting quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Aren’t you going to challenge something new?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Safety first.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then I’ll take this one.”</p><p class="calibre2">“You’re just deciding that on your own?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We talked about it yesterday. I’m the leader, but I can’t just pick whatever I want. And look at that, it looks like we’ll be going together for part of the way.”</p><p class="calibre2">Now that he mentions it, the village that put out the wolf hunting quest is on the way to his quest. Was that a coincidence? No, I think he’s just more caring than he looks. That’s probably why he’s popular.</p><p class="calibre2">They’re happy when I accept the hunting quest. The quests must really be piling up.</p><p class="calibre2">I have an early lunch, and hop on a wagon. It would take me two days to get there on foot, but this way, I’ll reach the village today.</p><p class="calibre2">We talk about all sorts of things on the way. Siphon and his party want to go to a place called Dungeon Town, to make a lot of money and be happy and secure in their old age. It’s not just Siphon and Yuno either, the other three feel the same way. Jin and Geitz said they want their own stores.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m asked what my aspirations are too, and when I say I want to travel to different countries, they’re kind of taken aback. But then they say that means we’ll probably meet in the Dungeon Town. Now that I think about it, the Kingdom of Elesya doesn’t have any dungeons.</p><p class="calibre2">We have fun talking, until it’s time to say goodbye, as the wagon stops at a crossroad. I jump down from the wagon, and don’t forget to say thank you. Siphon and the others still have two more days ahead of them before they reach their destination, where apparently they are going to hunt spiders.</p><p class="calibre2">Yuno doesn’t like that, but it seems they took the quest anyway because the pay is just too good. I don’t think anyone would want to hunt giant spiders. It’s so creepy.</p><p class="calibre2">The path gets narrower for me from this point forward, and the pavement is worse compared to the main road. It’s not like a wagon would be unable to pass through here, but it wouldn’t be comfortable.</p><p class="calibre2">I reach the village just before the sun goes down.</p><p class="calibre2">Village…?</p><p class="calibre2">In front of me is a crumbling gate. The gatekeeper… Shows up after I stand here for a while.</p><p class="calibre2">“What do you want!?”</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like I’m asked something like this in every village. Do I really not look like an adventurer?</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m here for the wolf hunting quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Wolf hunting…”</p><p class="calibre2">He seems disappointed. It’s not like I said anything wrong.</p><p class="calibre2">“Ah, sorry. I’ll take you to the village chief. Follow me.”</p><p class="calibre2">I guess my expression shows what I feel, and he apologizes.</p><p class="calibre2">“Chief. I brought someone who accepted the wolf hunting quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">A middle-aged man appears from the back, looks at me, and then looks around.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you alone?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. I’m Sora, a D ranked adventurer. I work alone.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I see. Thank you for coming all this way. Lantz can tell you more about this. Please take him to Lantz.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. This way.”</p><p class="calibre2">The gatekeeper takes me to this Lantz’s house. We’ve been walking through the village, and I feel like I’m being watched. The village looks like it’s in tatters too, but did wolves do this? That house looks like it’s slanted.</p><p class="calibre2">“Lantz, an adventurer is here about the wolf hunting quest.”</p><p class="calibre2">Ou… A man comes out with his head and one of his arms wrapped in cloth.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wolf hunting? Do you know about the terrain of this land?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s more or less in my mind.”</p><p class="calibre2">Lantz explains it to me in a way that’s both easy to understand and correct. It matches what I see in Map. I actually feel bad for having him explain it to me.</p><p class="calibre2">“This village…”</p><p class="calibre2">My question is interrupted by the voices of the many men and women surrounding me. Although I saw them coming with Map.</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you an adventurer?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Please, my daughter… Save my daughter.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Please take those things down.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…My wife was taken. I implore you to bring her back.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you the only one?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Take revenge for…”</p><p class="calibre2">T-too close. Their faces are too close. And their eyes are scaring me. It feels like they’ve gone mad.</p><p class="calibre2">“Calm down, all of you. I’ll explain, but know that this is too much for him.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Lantz, but…”</p><p class="calibre2">“He came here to hunt wolves. And he’s D rank too, so it’s impossible for him. You’re basically telling him to go out there and die.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But Lantz…”</p><p class="calibre2">He glares down another man that’s still trying to insist, until he quiets down. This guy is scary, there’s so much pressure coming from him.</p><p class="calibre2">People reluctantly leave.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry. Everyone’s on edge.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What happened? By the looks of things, it looks like the village was attacked.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, it happened just the other day. But before we get into it, come to my house. We do have an inn, but it’s in no condition to accept guests right now.”</p><p class="calibre2">I take him up on his offer.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div><p class="calibre2"> <a href="https://hidamarisoutranslations.com/walking-in-another-world/" class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3">Index</a> </p></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-38"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 33 &ndash; Hunting quest &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">“It happened just the other day. Orcs attacked while men were away from the village, and women and livestock were taken. We rushed there to try to rescue them, but as you can see, we were beaten back. I’m pretty sure they’ll be back too, now that they’ve got a taste of it.”</p><p class="calibre2">He says, obviously frustrated and clenching his fists.</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. So that’s why they all came to ask me.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. Do you have experience fighting orcs?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No. And I should say this upfront, I don’t have a lot of combat experience to begin with.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…You say that so confidently.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well, it’s the truth.”</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t help but smile awkwardly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Still, orcs… Someone should go put out a quest tomorrow.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, you’re right.”</p><p class="calibre2">I just don’t want them to get their hopes up. Yes, that makes sense.</p><p class="calibre2">“Were there orcs in this area before?”</p><p class="calibre2">“There shouldn’t be. Even goblins haven’t been seen around here for years.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">They probably wandered here from far away. There’s a good chance that they slipped by the adventurers and knights, because it all became so hazy when that demon appeared.</p><p class="calibre2">“Should I hunt the wolves like I planned?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, do that. We have orcs to worry about too, but wolves are still a threat. Ironically, they haven’t come close recently because of the orcs.”</p><p class="calibre2">They have a keen sense of smell, so they don’t go near a village that smells like orc.</p><p class="calibre2">“Shouldn’t you evacuate? You said there’s a chance the orcs might be back, right?”</p><p class="calibre2">“We thought about that, but we’re hesitant because we have a lot of elderly people here.”</p><p class="calibre2">If they’re attacked while they’re walking away from here, they’d have to use their livestock as a decoy to escape. And orcs aren’t the only threat either.</p><p class="calibre2">“You can sleep over there. Sorry it’s so cramped.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Having a roof over my head is enough.”</p><p class="calibre2">I am treated to a modest meal, and borrow a simple empty room.</p><p class="calibre2">“Status open.”</p><p class="calibre2"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3"></a>Name &ndash; (Sora Fujimiya ) / Job &ndash; (Scout) / Race &ndash; Otherworlder / No Level</p><p class="calibre2">HP &ndash; 360/360 / MP &ndash; 360/360 / SP &ndash; 360/360 (+100)</p><p class="calibre2">Strength…350 (+0) / Stamina…350 (+0) / Agility…350 (+100)</p><p class="calibre2">Magic power…350 (+0) / Dexterity…350 (+0) / Luck…350 (+100)</p><p class="calibre2">Skill &ndash; (Walking Lv36) &ndash; Effect &ndash; (User won’t get tired no matter how much they walk) &ndash; (Get one experience point with each step)</p><p class="calibre2">Experience points &ndash; 3/36000</p><p class="calibre2">Skill points &ndash; 6</p><p class="calibre2">Skills learned</p><p class="calibre2">(Appraisal LvMAX) / (Appraisal Obstruction Lv5) / (Parallel Thinking Lv5)</p><p class="calibre2">(Sword Master Lv6) / (Physical Strengthening Lv7) / (Presence Detection LvMAX) / (Magic Energy Detection Lv3) / (Natural Recovery Boost Lv6) / (Presence Concealment Lv6) / (Throw &ndash; Shooting Lv3)</p><p class="calibre2">(Magic Energy Control Lv7) / (Basic Daily Life Magic Lv6) / (Fire Magic Lv3) / (Water Magic Lv2) (Spatial Magic Lv7) / (Alchemy Lv7)</p><p class="calibre2">(Cooking Lv4)</p><p class="calibre2">New</p><p class="calibre2">(People Appraisal Lv2)</p><p class="calibre2">People Appraisal. This new skill became available when Appraisal reached level ten. Although I had to spend two skill points to learn it.</p><p class="calibre2">Now I can use Appraisal on people, but since its level is too low, I can only see their name, job, and race.</p><p class="calibre2">For example, using it on Lantz shows…</p><p class="calibre2"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3"></a>Name &ndash; (Lantz ) / Job &ndash; Hunter (Former adventurer) / Race &ndash; Human</p><p class="calibre2">Lantz says hunting orcs is too much for me because he’s judging it based on his experience as an adventurer.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, I learned a Barrier spell from Spatial Magic. If I focus only on one side, it creates something like a magic energy shield. I can increase its strength by pumping magic energy into it, but just using it normally consumes a third of my MP.</p><p class="calibre2">After doing some testing, I learned that by reducing its area, it can even deflect a bullet. It didn’t budge when I fired ten rounds into it, but the shield disappears after it hits its time limit.</p><p class="calibre2">Also, if I activate it around me, it breaks if it gets hit with one bullet. It still kills the bullet’s momentum, so it can at least stop one, but I’m going to have to test it more to see if it can reliably stop one attack.</p><p class="calibre2">“Orcs…”</p><p class="calibre2">I activate Map, and see seven wolves where Lantz told me they are.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s also a place with five reactions of monsters and seven reactions of people. These are the orcs and the kidnapped villagers.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m surprised to see neither place is very far from the village. Map wouldn’t have picked up an unexplored area if it was far.</p><p class="calibre2">And on the opposite side, away from the village, there is a different reaction. It’s still displayed faintly, even with a maxed out skill. I feel like I’ll lose track of it if I don’t focus, but it’s definitely there.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s that…”</p><p class="calibre2">The same reaction I saw when I was doing that picking quest. Now I don’t lose it if I focus.</p><p class="calibre2">“I have to do something about that too…”</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like I’m being watched. It was like this when I was doing the picking quest, but they’re even following me here.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t know why, but I get an indescribable sense of eeriness from it.</p><p class="calibre2">“But more importantly…”</p><p class="calibre2">Orcs being displayed on Map overlap with people.</p><p class="calibre2">Humanoid monsters kidnap females to use as seedbeds to increase their numbers.</p><p class="calibre2">I put away Map, as if looking away from it, and try to focus on sleeping. Those seven reactions stay there, like they’re burned into the back of my eyelids.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-29"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 34 &ndash; Hunting quest &ndash; Part three</h1><p class="calibre2">“Can I ask something?”</p><p class="calibre2">We finish eating, and after doing a lot of thinking, I face Lantz and decide to ask him something.</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Do you know how many orcs are there and how many people were taken?”</p><p class="calibre2">He looks at me with dubious eyes, but I can also see hesitation in them.</p><p class="calibre2">His expression makes me think there’s a conflict going on inside his head.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why are you asking?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m just curious. I’m sorry if that’s insensitive. I was thinking about this yesterday before I fell asleep, but I will hunt the orcs if you can help. No, I think all I can do is draw them away, but I’ll help rescue the people they took.”</p><p class="calibre2">This house is too big for one person, and the amount of tableware seems strange too. And above all else, the back and forth between Lantz and that other villager yesterday makes me think he’s trying to stifle something inside him.</p><p class="calibre2">“If what they said yesterday is bothering you, forget it. That’s just what being an adventurer is like.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you speaking from experience?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I am.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s not really about people here. I want to fight orcs. Rather, I want to see if I can take them down.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you saying it’s just a test of strength? Is that…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m not trying to get permission or anything. If you can’t do it, I’ll ask the people from yesterday. I’m sure they will say yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">Although to be honest, I want Lantz to come along if that’s possible. All the others who spoke to me yesterday were regular villagers. One of them was a hunter, but I doubt he knows a lot about orcs. Not that I know a lot either.</p><p class="calibre2">Lantz stares at me without looking away, and I respond in kind.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t know how much time passes, but eventually he turns away first.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why are you going that far for complete strangers?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Well… I was treated kindly by complete strangers too. And I really do want to fight orcs.”</p><p class="calibre2">If I was asked if I really do want to fight, I would have to say that’s half true, if I was completely honest. I feel like it would all come to nothing if I ended up dying.</p><p class="calibre2">But I think what I’m feeling right now makes sense. Rurika, Siphon, and all the others probably didn’t teach me all those things just out of the goodness of their hearts, but still, for someone like me who was fumbling around in this world, their outstretched hands made me happy and helped me a lot.</p><p class="calibre2">“This is just for my own self-satisfaction. Don’t worry about it.”</p><p class="calibre2">I say that bluntly and wait for a response.</p><p class="calibre2">Lantz seems indecisive. It’s like he’s weighing his options as a former adventurer, villager, lover or parent. He seems like a genuinely nice guy with a kind heart.</p><p class="calibre2">“All right. I’ll speak to everyone.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Great. I can draw the orcs away, but I don’t know how many people were taken, so you’ll have to get the people to rescue them.”</p><p class="calibre2">I actually do know, but I obviously can’t explain it.</p><p class="calibre2">They talk in the village chief’s house, and in the end, it’s decided that five villagers, Lantz included, will be coming along.</p><p class="calibre2">As for the others, young people who are fast runners will be running to the guild to put out a quest, and the rest will stay in the storehouse. The storehouse is tougher than the other buildings, and has a basement that can be used as a shelter.</p><p class="calibre2">“Please be careful.”</p><p class="calibre2">Says the village chief while bowing deeply.</p><p class="calibre2">We move out with Lantz leading the way. They don’t know exactly where the orcs are, so we head in the direction where the villagers say they saw the orcs go.</p><p class="calibre2">After advancing for a while, the forest starts to become thicker. I also pretend to look around for clues, and guide people by pointing to things that might be tracks.</p><p class="calibre2">Lantz looks at all of this like he thinks it’s strange.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’ve been to forests a lot because of picking quests, so I’ve gotten into the habit of tracking monsters and beasts without even thinking.”</p><p class="calibre2">I say, and apparently he accepts it.</p><p class="calibre2">I actually do see some tracks as we head there. Some trees were damaged, probably in a show of force.</p><p class="calibre2">“Wait… There is a clearing up ahead. Wait here while I go check it out.”</p><p class="calibre2">“On your own? Are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s better if no one is holding me back. Lantz, you take everyone and hide around here.”</p><p class="calibre2">To be perfectly honest, I feel restricted.</p><p class="calibre2">It would be bad if they did something wrong. They’re all on edge, and I’m worried that something might happen that causes them to lose control. Although that’s understandable, since people dear to them were taken.</p><p class="calibre2">“If you move carelessly and are discovered, that will put the people who were kidnapped in danger. If you can’t follow directions, you should head back.”</p><p class="calibre2">I warn just in case.</p><p class="calibre2">Some people look unhappy about some youngster telling them this, but I ignore them and look at Lantz. Are you all right? If you do something careless, you might put the others in danger.</p><p class="calibre2">It looks like he understands, and he nods before prompting everyone to move.</p><p class="calibre2">I see them go, and move too.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t see any movement from the orcs. First I have to see what kind of place they’re in.</p><p class="calibre2">I get closer while using Presence Obstruction, and see one orc standing alone. Is it standing watch? From what I can see using my naked eyes, there’s one orc standing in front of a crumbling building.</p><p class="calibre2">Looking at the building, this place seems relatively big. And behind it is a rocky mountain, so going around and assaulting it would be hard. I need to find a way to lure those five orcs out.</p><p class="calibre2">Would they come out if I attacked directly from the front? Or would they see the attack, and use the people in there as hostages? This might be kind of a gamble. I don’t think I can make this call on my own, so I should go back and talk to the others.</p><p class="calibre2">I check the terrain and the environment around us and go back, where I meet up with the others and explain the situation quickly.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hostages…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, we don’t know what the orcs might do. What I can do now, is use an item I have to make a lot of noise. If I use it and the orcs come out, I can show myself and lead them away. If that doesn’t work, I have no choice but to just attack. Do you know how many orcs there are?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Four or five. I don’t think there are more than that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see. So is this how we’re going to do it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…How about we watch for a bit and see if they come out? It’s almost lunch time, so they might come out to eat.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Lantz is right. We should avoid danger if possible.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But do orcs have meals the same way people do?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That I don’t know.”</p><p class="calibre2">“All right, we’ll take positions and watch. But if they don’t move, we have to go with the first idea. Agreed?”</p><p class="calibre2">There aren’t any more good ideas, so we have to go with this one, even if it’s risky.</p><p class="calibre2">If we attacked at night, we would have to escape in complete darkness, unless we took down every orc.</p><p class="calibre2">The others know this too, so although they don’t completely agree with my idea, they accept it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Oh, and take this. Use them if you need to.”</p><p class="calibre2">I hand over a bag with recovery potions and stamina potions.</p><p class="calibre2">Lantz is reluctant to accept it at first, but after imagining the condition of the people inside, he takes it.</p><p class="calibre2">Potions are probably high-class items for these villagers. Would they be surprised if there were ten of each inside?</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-18"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 35 &ndash; Hunting quest &ndash; Part four</h1><p class="calibre2">I came here to hunt wolves, and now I’m fiddling with my gun to try to distract myself from how nervous I am.</p><p class="calibre2">The first time I hunted wolves, I did it out of necessity, and didn’t even have time to think.</p><p class="calibre2">The first time I fought goblins, I chose to do so, but I also had Rurika and Chris with me.</p><p class="calibre2">And now, this will be my first time fighting orcs, and sadly, I’m on my own. I’m probably not ready to fight orcs, physically or mentally, but there’s no doubt that I’m here right now because I chose to be here.</p><p class="calibre2">Lantz and the others are all where I told them to be.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs are moving around inside the building, and the one standing watch outside doesn’t look happy. It looks irritated.</p><p class="calibre2">The sun is pretty high in the sky, and I don’t think we’re going to get anything by waiting any longer.</p><p class="calibre2">I point my gun towards the sky, and just as I’m about to pull the trigger, Map shows me two orcs that appear to be leaving the building.</p><p class="calibre2">I wait for a bit, and they do come out and approach the other orc. Are they talking to the one standing watch?</p><p class="calibre2">I watch them for a bit longer, but the other two don’t show any sign that they’ll come out.</p><p class="calibre2">Now I just have to get lucky. I pull the trigger, and the sound of the gunshot echoes.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs look surprised, and start to look around with caution.</p><p class="calibre2">I undo my Presence Concealment and show myself to the orcs, before running towards them with my sword in hand.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs let out a threatening war cry, which I ignore as I close the distance and swing my sword at the orc in front.</p><p class="calibre2">The sound of metal clashing against metal echoes, as the orc blocks my sword with its own.</p><p class="calibre2">I push forward, but it meets me head on. I can’t try to beat them with raw power. I can’t let myself be overconfident when there’s such a big size difference.</p><p class="calibre2">I push forward again like I’m trying to push the orc back, but then jump back.</p><p class="calibre2">The orc is now pushing against nothing, and pitches forward. I don’t let this chance get away, and swing my sword.</p><p class="calibre2">Despite the timing being perfect, the spear that lunges at me from the side messes up my aim, and I only manage to lightly cut the orc’s skin.</p><p class="calibre2">The other orc attacks from the other side with an axe. Looking at that thick blade makes it clear that facing it head on would be dangerous.</p><p class="calibre2">I regroup by putting some distance between us, like I’m running away.</p><p class="calibre2">The orc that was cut composes itself, looks at the wound, and howls in anger.</p><p class="calibre2">Maybe the two remaining orcs heard it, because they come outside too.</p><p class="calibre2">And as for the people inside… They’re all gathered in a corner.</p><p class="calibre2">I take out a knife and throw it at one of the orcs that just came out.</p><p class="calibre2">The knife goes straight for its forehead like it’s being sucked into it, but the orc repels it like it’s swatting a fly.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs’ eyes are all fixated on me, glaring at me with anger. Do I have their attention?</p><p class="calibre2">An orc attacks me right after I threw the knife, but I ward it off with my sword.</p><p class="calibre2">I take a good look at the orcs while being careful about the distance between us. They are all holding different weapons. Sword, spear, axe, club, two handed sword… Do monsters have strong points and weak points when it comes to weapons too?</p><p class="calibre2">Also, one of them is a slightly different color. It’s a slight difference, and I wouldn’t have noticed it if they weren’t lined up like this, and when I use Appraisal, it classifies all of them as just orcs.</p><p class="calibre2">But I also notice that this one is holding the two handed sword, and they are coming at me in a shoddy formation that centers on this orc.</p><p class="calibre2">I repeatedly engage them with my sword and then dodge and flee in an exaggerated way. All to get them as far away from the building as possible.</p><p class="calibre2">“I’m almost there…”</p><p class="calibre2">I move towards stopping two orcs that are getting near, and slash at the one holding the axe.</p><p class="calibre2">The orc was waiting for this and repels my sword, making me lose my balance and fall.</p><p class="calibre2">That’s when the one holding the club sees an opportunity to attack. I block it with my sword with one knee on the ground, but receiving a blow like this sends me flying back pretty hard, because I wasn’t able to kill the attack’s momentum.</p><p class="calibre2">I rush to my feet and raise my sword, and as I try to compose my rapid breathing, I fearfully look around at the orcs.</p><p class="calibre2">I look the one holding the two handed sword in the eyes, and it laughs like it’s mocking me.</p><p class="calibre2">I slowly fall back.</p><p class="calibre2">“Uwaaaaaaaa!”</p><p class="calibre2">I yell, and jump into the forest behind me immediately after.</p><p class="calibre2">Not a second later, I hear the orcs coming after me, and sure enough, Map shows the five orcs are in pursuit.</p><p class="calibre2">I run, but not so fast that I lose my pursuers. It’s hard to control my speed in a way that they don’t lose me, but also don’t catch up with me…</p><p class="calibre2">With footsteps, howls, and angry roars behind me, I run and run and run.</p><p class="calibre2">I can see five spots moving towards the building. They met up…</p><p class="calibre2">That’s when I hear the sound of wind being cut, and dive to the ground after sensing danger. A spear passes right where my head was and shakes a tree as it pierces it. That was close.</p><p class="calibre2">I didn’t mean to be careless, but it attacked right when my attention was on the map.</p><p class="calibre2">I run as I try to stay focused, weaving between the trees and using them as shields.</p><p class="calibre2">I run for five, ten minutes, sometimes showing myself to throw knives as a way to keep provoking them, until I reach the small open area I was running towards. I stand near its edge, ready to jump back into the forest if that becomes necessary.</p><p class="calibre2">I turn back, and wait for the orcs to come out of the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Map to check both the orc’s position and Lantz and the others’. They’re heading in the opposite direction, towards the village.</p><p class="calibre2">The first mission has been accomplished, but it’s just getting started for me.</p><p class="calibre2">I take a deep breath and hold up my sword. I also have my gun ready to be fired at any time.</p><p class="calibre2">I’m really nervous. Now that I really stop to think about it, those orcs are a head taller than me and have really thick bodies. I tremble just thinking about it.</p><p class="calibre2">But on the other hand, that means they’re bigger targets.</p><p class="calibre2">I slowly exhale the deep breath I took, and rid my body of any unnecessary tension.</p><p class="calibre2">Three, two, one… The orcs, mad about being made to run around like that, jump out of the forest.</p><p class="calibre2">When the one in front crosses half the length of this open area, I pull the trigger. It’s not even twenty meters away from me.</p><p class="calibre2">Two gunshots echo, and the orc falls to the ground with a thud and an angry expression still on its face.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-8"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 36 &ndash; Hunting quest &ndash; Part five</h1><p class="calibre2">The noise stops, and it’s completely quiet. The angry yells, roars, and footsteps are completely gone.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs all look at their fellow orc on the ground with surprised expressions.</p><p class="calibre2">It feels like time has stopped, and I don’t let this chance get away.</p><p class="calibre2">I get close to one of the baffled orcs without making a sound, and plunge my sword into it.</p><p class="calibre2">This attack from the back with my full weight behind it breaks the orc’s skin, rips its flesh, and pierces through its body.</p><p class="calibre2">It screams, and the eyes that were on the fallen orc turn this way.</p><p class="calibre2">I quickly pull my sword and get away.</p><p class="calibre2">The orc’s body is now supported by nothing, and gravity takes over as it sends it crashing to the ground. That’s two down.</p><p class="calibre2">The scornful attitude of the orcs, like they were ridiculing and harassing something weaker, is gone completely.</p><p class="calibre2">Now they look like they’re ready to fight.</p><p class="calibre2">They drop their stances and ready their weapons. The three orcs keep some distance between each other, so as not to get in each other’s way when they swing at their prey.</p><p class="calibre2">This is where it really starts.</p><p class="calibre2">As I face them, I start thinking. They’re going to be waiting for the move I already used, so I have to pick the right time to use it.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t get cocky. The difference in numbers is a threat in itself, and the longer this battle drags on, the more the gap in our stamina is going to matter, so I need to keep this short. I can only win a pure physical contest when it comes to walking.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Parallel Thinking to gather my thoughts and ready a spell, a fire spell.</p><p class="calibre2">The remaining orcs are holding a sword, an axe, and a two handed sword. The one holding the axe seems like it would be the easiest to kill. Its handling of its weapon seems a bit slower, and the burden of its weapon makes me want to take it down before the others too.</p><p class="calibre2">I face the one holding a sword and attack. At the same time, I try to move around and use it as a shield to keep the others from attacking. Constantly moving around puts a burden on my stamina, but I have to do it to keep the fight one on one.</p><p class="calibre2">This works for a while, but then the orcs’ movement changes. The other two spread out to the sides, and charge forward.</p><p class="calibre2">I attack the orc in front of me, and could use the momentum of the attack to dodge by its side, but I really don’t think it would let me get away with it.</p><p class="calibre2">However, this is an opportunity. I grab a knife I have on my waist and throw it forward. At the same time, I change direction and run towards the axe wielding orc.</p><p class="calibre2">It stops and gets ready to intercept me, but I raise my sword, and as I get closer, I shoot out my spell.</p><p class="calibre2">“Fire Arrow!”</p><p class="calibre2">The arrow of fire shot out at close range hits the orc right in the face.</p><p class="calibre2">Maybe it’s because its level is too low, or maybe it’s because I’m not used to using it, but it’s not enough to take the orc down.</p><p class="calibre2">But it does succeed in making the orc lose its balance, and I swing down at it with my sword.</p><p class="calibre2">The sword slashes its neck with little resistance. I thought the wound was too shallow, but blood starts gushing, its body shakes, and it falls to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave it behind me as I turn around and waste no time moving on.</p><p class="calibre2">The orcs just happen to be lined up here, so I close the distance between us, and cross swords with the one in front. It swings down its sword, I ward it off with minimal movements, and use the momentum to use a skill I haven’t had the chance to really use before, Sword Rush.</p><p class="calibre2">This is a sword technique I learned as Sword Master leveled up. It increases the speed of my sword, and more than doubles its power.</p><p class="calibre2">The tip of my sword pierces the orc’s torso and goes in without much resistance.</p><p class="calibre2">The blood stains my robe, and as I swing it off my sword, the skill’s effect runs out. At the same time, I feel like my strength is leaving my body, probably because I used a lot of SP.</p><p class="calibre2">Because of this, I’m slow to react.</p><p class="calibre2">The remaining orc approaches me without me even realizing it, and swings its two handed sword at me with such force that it would destroy even a fellow orc.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t evade in time…</p><p class="calibre2">I use Sword Rush again, although my position means it’s not as fast as before. But that should still mean I’ll just barely make it.</p><p class="calibre2">My sword borrows power from the skill and jumps at the orcs sword, and as they clash violently, the tip of my sword breaks, but I at least succeed in changing its trajectory. The orc’s sword passes by me and sticks to the ground.</p><p class="calibre2">I run away, almost like I’m falling over. My body isn’t moving the way I want it to anymore. I check my status, and see my SP is at zero.</p><p class="calibre2">I face the orc again, as it swings its sword horizontally.</p><p class="calibre2">As I look up at its face, I see it’s smiling, completely confident in its victory.</p><p class="calibre2">I take my gun out of the Item Box, and activate a barrier to protect myself from the incoming slash.</p><p class="calibre2">The barrier manages to deflect the two handed sword, and the orc’s face is painted with shock. Since the shield is transparent, only its user knows it’s there.</p><p class="calibre2">I pull the trigger multiple times, firing every bullet.</p><p class="calibre2">The orc looks like it can’t believe what just happened, and after it slowly falls, it doesn’t move again.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-39"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 37 &ndash; Chance meeting &ndash; Part one</h1><p class="calibre2">I take out a mana potion and a stamina potion from my item box and drink both.</p><p class="calibre2">They still taste like bitter tea. It’s not like their taste is really bad, but I wouldn’t drink them just because I want to either.</p><p class="calibre2">But they do work. The languid feeling in my body is going away.</p><p class="calibre2">Can I rework them so they taste like juice? I use Purification to get rid of the lingering bitter taste in my mouth, although I kind of feel like it’s a waste of magic.</p><p class="calibre2">As I think about this, I turn around, and see a person standing there.</p><p class="calibre2">That person seems to be standing normally, but there are no gaps in his posture.</p><p class="calibre2">Is he on guard? We’re a bit far from each other.</p><p class="calibre2">“Who are you?”</p><p class="calibre2">If this person isn’t attacking me, I can only assume he’s here to talk. Probably.</p><p class="calibre2">But what is that outfit? It’s completely black, with a mask covering his eyes. What is it, a ninja? This person is also about two heads shorter than me.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Number Thirteen. Otherworlder Sora. Your strength has been confirmed. Have orders to take you.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Have you been watching me? Why?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Don’t know. I was only told to take you if you acquired power.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I only hunted monsters. Any adventurer can do that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…You hunted five orcs alone. Not everyone can do that.”</p><p class="calibre2">This voice sounds so plain and unemotional. Almost like a machine.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Confirmed use of unreported magic.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What if I refuse?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…You will come. Refusal is not an option.”</p><p class="calibre2">I see his body tremble, and suddenly approaching me with an incredible speed.</p><p class="calibre2">This person has a knife in hand, and when I jump back, the distance is instantly closed again.</p><p class="calibre2">When I take my gun and point it, my target jumps back diagonally as if running away from the muzzle.</p><p class="calibre2">Does that mean my opponent knows what this does?</p><p class="calibre2">We are about thirty meters apart, and he is now observing me while keeping that distance.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s a happy misunderstanding that he is being cautious, but this gun doesn’t have any bullets left. I get the feeling that it’s all over if he notices this, but that’s not my main concern.</p><p class="calibre2">I put the gun in the Item Box, and pick up the sword an orc was using.</p><p class="calibre2">I try swinging it lightly, and it doesn’t feel heavy, so I hold it as I face my opponent.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry, but I don’t want to go back there. You people abandoned me in the first place, and now you’re telling me to go back because I’ve gotten stronger? What kind of joke is this?”</p><p class="calibre2">This provocation leads me to close the distance between us myself.</p><p class="calibre2">What I really want to avoid here is letting them get away. He’s alone right now, but it would be a big problem if word got out and more came. I need to make sure to finish this here.</p><p class="calibre2">I swing my sword down, and it’s easily avoided. I don’t even have time to breathe before a counterattack comes.</p><p class="calibre2">There isn’t a single wasted movement in his step.</p><p class="calibre2">He uses his flexibility to its full advantage to slowly pile on the damage.</p><p class="calibre2">None of the attacks are fatal, but my skin is cut and blood starts dripping.</p><p class="calibre2">Did I pick the wrong weapon? Then again, the sword is what I’m most familiar with. Even if I used a knife, the difference in skill and experience would be clear.</p><p class="calibre2">I thought I couldn’t let them get away, but at this rate, I can’t get away.</p><p class="calibre2">I slash and use Fire Arrow multiple times, but it’s all evaded, so I fall back to try to put distance between us again.</p><p class="calibre2">I try going for a feint, but it doesn’t work, and just as I’m getting ready to go at it again, the sword slips out of my hand.</p><p class="calibre2">What? I try to pick it up, but it’s then that I notice my body isn’t moving too well.</p><p class="calibre2">My senses… No, my hand is getting numb.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel eyes are locked on me, so I raise my head. He shouldn’t be able to see me through that mask, but I feel like I’m being watched.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Appraisal and look at the knife… I see…</p><p class="calibre2">I take out a potion from the Item Box, but a knife is immediately thrown at it and breaks it.</p><p class="calibre2">I tried to dodge, but my body isn’t moving how I want it to.</p><p class="calibre2">The numbness is getting worse, but strangely enough, my opponent isn’t coming near me.</p><p class="calibre2">Is it because he knows he just has to wait until I can’t move at all?</p><p class="calibre2">No no no.</p><p class="calibre2">This is really bad.</p><p class="calibre2">I chant status open in my head, and see the status ailment ‘Paralysis’.</p><p class="calibre2">Drinking that mana potion restored some of my MP, but not enough for me to be able to deploy a magic barrier. It looks like it will take a while for Natural Recovery to do something about this too.</p><p class="calibre2">What do I do?</p><p class="calibre2">I’m looking at my opponent while checking the status panel.</p><p class="calibre2">Are there any skills that might help… I search as I try not to panic.</p><p class="calibre2">No, nope, not this one, no…</p><p class="calibre2">But wait, I found something.</p><p class="calibre2">Status Ailment Resistance. Grants resistance towards status ailments, and its effect improves as it levels up.</p><p class="calibre2">Is this the one? I don’t see anything else that might work. But I don’t know for sure if it will help resist this paralysis.</p><p class="calibre2">I hesitate for a second, before deciding to learn it.</p><p class="calibre2">I have five skill points left.</p><p class="calibre2">Skill, ‘Status Ailment Resistance Lv1’. Effect, ‘resistance against poison’.</p><p class="calibre2">This is no good.</p><p class="calibre2">I use more points, leaving me with three.</p><p class="calibre2">Skill, ‘Status Ailment Resistance Lv2’. Effect, ‘poison nullification’.</p><p class="calibre2">Still no good.</p><p class="calibre2">That’s not what I want right now.</p><p class="calibre2">I use more points, leaving me with zero.</p><p class="calibre2">Skill, ‘Status Ailment Resistance Lv3’. Effect, ‘poison nullification and resistance to paralysis’.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel the numbness in my body getting better, and see the proficiency increasing.</p><p class="calibre2">I test my grip, and pick up the sword.</p><p class="calibre2">Then I get up again, looking like even this is difficult for me.</p><p class="calibre2">I ready my sword while breathing rapidly and staggering as I slowly walk.</p><p class="calibre2">This is acting. Not bad if I may say so myself, but will it work?</p><p class="calibre2">I get closer, one step at a time, and Number Thirteen hasn’t dropped his guard, and is still holding that knife.</p><p class="calibre2">When I get close enough, I lift the sword with all my strength, and activate ‘Sword Rush’.</p><p class="calibre2">As I slash down, the sword goes flying half-way through.</p><p class="calibre2">My eyes follow the sword in disbelief, and my opponent takes the opportunity to slash at me.</p><p class="calibre2">But I move my hand towards the knife and grab that wrist, before putting all my strength into my hand like I’m going to crush that wrist.</p><p class="calibre2">We’re evenly matched when it comes to speed, but I have the upper hand when it comes to strength.</p><p class="calibre2">This is the decisive moment, as Number Thirteen looks shaken. I put all my weight into pushing him down.</p><p class="calibre2">His mouth twists with pain, and he struggles to try to escape, but I won’t let that happen, and keep pushing. But then, the still active Appraisal skill picks something up.</p><p class="calibre2">‘Slave Mask’. Wearer is robbed of free will, creating a doll that follows orders. Physical abilities are dramatically increased.</p><p class="calibre2">It takes my attention for a bit, before I turn to my opponent again.</p><p class="calibre2">This person is small and slender. I can’t tell his expression because of the mask, but his nose, mouth, and skin all look pretty young now that I look at them closely. Is this actually a kid?</p><p class="calibre2">People appraisal won’t show me ages.</p><p class="calibre2">I struggle to decide what to do now. We were fighting as enemies, but I don’t think I can kill.</p><p class="calibre2">This didn’t happen when I was fighting monsters. I guess it’s because now I’m fighting another person.</p><p class="calibre2">Do I take off that mask? Destroy it?</p><p class="calibre2">“The noise brought me here, but this is quite a scene.”</p><p class="calibre2">A voice coming from behind me interrupts my thoughts.</p><p class="calibre2">I was so focused on Number Thirteen that I didn’t notice someone else approaching.</p><p class="calibre2">I turn around and see blood red eyes, two horns, and bat-like wings. All belonging to someone who looks very calm.</p><p class="calibre2">…It’s a demon.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-9"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 38 &ndash; Chance meeting &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">Right away, my focus is drawn completely to this demon, but someone else sees this moment as an opportunity.</p><p class="calibre2">Number Thirteen feels my grip loosening and escapes.</p><p class="calibre2">By the time I notice it’s happening, it’s already too late.</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t help but regret letting him escape, but that problem over there takes precedence.</p><p class="calibre2">I try to act natural as I turn to face them.</p><p class="calibre2">To my left is a demon, and to my right is Number Thirteen. If we drew lines from our positions, they would make a triangle.</p><p class="calibre2">“A slave mask? Humans never change.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon says with cold eyes that look like they’re looking at garbage. Those words make me tremble as they are spat out.</p><p class="calibre2">“But your existence is a bigger problem, isn’t it, otherworlder?”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon’s eyes aren’t moving. It’s not like they’re glaring at me or anything, but those eyes make me shrink back.</p><p class="calibre2">I need to get a grip.</p><p class="calibre2">“How do you know what I am?”</p><p class="calibre2">In a way, isn’t it convenient that an underling of the demon king appeared right in front of me? If we can talk, that is.</p><p class="calibre2">I’ve already heard from people who experienced it first hand just how menacing a demon can be. There’s no way I stand a chance if I were to fight him right now.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph, I can tell by your skills. Do you understand what that means? Now I will ask a question. What are you doing here?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hunting orcs… And then that attacked me.”</p><p class="calibre2">I say while pointing at Number Thirteen.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hunting? That answer just invites more questions. Is that a reason to leave an otherworlder alone in a place like this?”</p><p class="calibre2">I can tell the demon really doesn’t understand.</p><p class="calibre2">“Why do you feel that way?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Otherworlders are weapons to kill the demon king, correct? I struggle to understand the thought process of today’s kings, if they send one to be wasted in a random place like this. Although I guess that’s convenient for me.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon happily laughs. But wait, do otherworlders have some sort of skill that works well against the demon king?</p><p class="calibre2">To be perfectly honest, I think high ranking adventurers are stronger than me. I don’t think I can even beat C ranked adventurers. Then again, the others probably can.</p><p class="calibre2">“Unfortunately, while I am an otherworlder, I’m so weak that I was discarded the same day I was summoned. Honestly, all I feel is irritation towards those people, and I have no intention of letting them tell me what to do. So if you could just turn a blind eye to me, I’d really appreciate it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That’s an interesting story, but I’m obviously not going to take it at face value. Humans are a treacherous species that hurt and lie with no issue.”</p><p class="calibre2">I can’t argue with that. It’s the same in this world and mine. Very few people are not selfish and don’t put themselves before others.</p><p class="calibre2">“Aren’t you going to argue?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I think it’s true.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hm… But the best course of action would be to eliminate an uncertain, but dangerous element. Wouldn’t it be best to execute you here?”</p><p class="calibre2">Overwhelming bloodlust is being released.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like I would pass out if I took it head on, but I manage to just barely brace myself for it.</p><p class="calibre2">But then, something happens that neither I or the demon saw coming.</p><p class="calibre2">Number Thirteen reacts to the bloodlust, and suddenly attacks the demon.</p><p class="calibre2">The demon is taken completely by surprise and attacked from a perfectly blind spot, although I can still see it.</p><p class="calibre2">The timing couldn’t be more perfect, and yet, the attack is blocked with one arm wave without the demon even needing to turn around.</p><p class="calibre2">“First you fight, then you protect? I’m really struggling to understand your actions.”</p><p class="calibre2">Number Thirteen bounces back and flies like a ball.</p><p class="calibre2">He then rolls around on the ground, but immediately gets back up when the momentum dies down.</p><p class="calibre2">“Executing orders. That is to be taken back. Anyone in the way is to be removed.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Can’t you even understand the power of your opponent? You really are nothing more than a doll. I should just break you here.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon has a new target, but I don’t think I can run away.</p><p class="calibre2">If I’m attacked, I’m dead. I would just be slightly prolonging the time until my death.</p><p class="calibre2">I look around, looking for a weapon, and see Number Thirteen’s knife.</p><p class="calibre2">I move when Number Thirteen moves, pick up the knife, and then throw it.</p><p class="calibre2">The knife flies toward Number Thirteen, obstructing his move.</p><p class="calibre2">“Hou? Are you going to get in my way? To help an enemy no less?”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon was definitely headed for the kill. Number Thirteen would certainly be dead right now if I did nothing.</p><p class="calibre2">“I want to ask that person some things if I can. That slave mask for example. Is it possible to liberate someone from that?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Hmph. What would I gain from that? And you’re both going to die anyway, so what’s the point?”</p><p class="calibre2">There’s no point because we’re going to die?</p><p class="calibre2">I feel like I’m at a crossroads of life, and if I choose the wrong path, there’s no future for me.</p><p class="calibre2">I swallow, and the gulping noise echoes in my head.</p><p class="calibre2">“In this world… No, can you use enslavement magic?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Enslavement magic? No.”</p><p class="calibre2">“But can you use something similar, like something that stops people from betraying you, or causing harm to you?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I do have something like that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Then…”</p><p class="calibre2">If there’s a chance, I have to grasp it. It’s all over if I die.</p><p class="calibre2">“Put restrictions on me.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon stares at me with probing eyes, and I look straight ahead without averting my eyes.</p><p class="calibre2">Sound stops.</p><p class="calibre2">Time stops.</p><p class="calibre2">There’s a tense air around us.</p><p class="calibre2">Every minute, every second feels long.</p><p class="calibre2">I don’t even know how long I wait.</p><p class="calibre2">But eventually the demon’s mouth opens.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Interesting. Why are you willing to go that far?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Because I can’t accept being brought into this weird world and having my life end in such a nonsensical way.”</p><p class="calibre2">No, what I feel now is different from what I felt when I was expelled.</p><p class="calibre2">“No, I want to go around and see this world that’s new to me. Things like the culture and scenery in general of this world are so different from mine’s. And obviously, I just don’t want to die. So if you spare me, I’ll obey you… At least to a certain extent…”</p><p class="calibre2">That’s pretty much how I actually feel. But I want to say no to things I really object if I can. That’s important.</p><p class="calibre2">Those probing eyes are still watching me.</p><p class="calibre2">“…Fine. If you accept a restrictive curse, I will let you live.”</p><p class="calibre2">Is this what they call a deal with the devil?</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-19"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 39 &ndash; Chance meeting &ndash; Part three</h1><p class="calibre2">“To begin with… I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon casually approaches Number Thirteen, like he’s going out for a walk.</p><p class="calibre2">Number Thirteen seems wary, but he’s caught before he can even react.</p><p class="calibre2">The demon grasps the slave mask and pulls, leaving under Number Thirteen an opening as big as their height difference.</p><p class="calibre2">“What…”</p><p class="calibre2">Is that an explosion of magic energy?</p><p class="calibre2">I can feel the concentrated magic energy on my skin, like the air itself is shaking.</p><p class="calibre2">And then, I can see what looks like a layer of magic energy, even though magic energy is not supposed to be visible.</p><p class="calibre2">After a shrill cracking noise, Number Thirteen falls to the ground, leaving the broken slave mask in the hand of the demon.</p><p class="calibre2">“What was that?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I hit the slave mask with magic energy to break it. It’s not a technique everyone can use, and if you want to safely, and definitively undo this, it’s faster to kill the contractor.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon says like it’s nothing. More like no one else can use it.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then, should we do the restrictions next? Are you ready?”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon is right in front of me before I can even begin to answer.</p><p class="calibre2">It’s not like it’s at all unexpected, but I can only laugh at just how much stronger he is than me.</p><p class="calibre2">“What should I do?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Just stand there, I’ll handle the rest. The restriction itself… You’re prohibited from harming the demon king.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon announces, and then chants some words I don’t understand, before capping it off by sending magic energy into me.</p><p class="calibre2">Thickly concentrated magic energy is released from the demon’s fingertips and coils around my body, before being sucked into my heart.</p><p class="calibre2">“Can I ask something?”</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I can’t harm the demon king. Are you basically telling me not to treat the demon king as an enemy?”</p><p class="calibre2">“No. It means you’re not allowed to hurt the demon king.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Physically?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. So?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Nothing, it’s just different than I expected.”</p><p class="calibre2">I figured I’d be bound by all sorts of rigid restrictions.</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s not magic I’m very good at using. Rather than applying all sorts of restrictions, it’s better to keep it simple. That means the restriction will be stronger, and also, more complicated ones tend to fail.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is the demon king that important to you…”</p><p class="calibre2">Did I say something weird? The demon looks surprised.</p><p class="calibre2">I guess I accidentally said something strange.</p><p class="calibre2">“So what should I do now?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Whatever you want. As long as you don’t break your restriction.”</p><p class="calibre2">It sounds so simple.</p><p class="calibre2">“So I can keep hunting monsters?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s not like they are under our control. Do as you like.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What about your fellow demons? If there are others, what happens if I meet them?”</p><p class="calibre2">“You can treat them as your enemies if you don’t like them. We generally do whatever we want.”</p><p class="calibre2">I’m having trouble following this train of thought.</p><p class="calibre2">I had restrictions put on me, but aren’t I basically free?</p><p class="calibre2">It just feels weird.</p><p class="calibre2">“And is that all right?”</p><p class="calibre2">I point to Number Thirteen, who is still on the ground and hasn’t moved for a while.</p><p class="calibre2"><a class="pcalibre1 pcalibre pcalibre2 pcalibre3"></a>“That’s probably recoil from having the mask forcibly removed. Leave it be, and they will eventually regain consciousness, although I can’t say what happens then. Some have their hearts broken, some continue to follow orders, and sometimes nothing happens. It depends on the person.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon says very plainly, but that sounds terrible.</p><p class="calibre2">Worst case scenario, he could become disabled.</p><p class="calibre2">“Well then, it’s time for me to leave. I doubt we will see each other again, so honor your promise.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Wait. I still have questions.”</p><p class="calibre2">“What?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I heard you appeared during the orc hunt. Were you leading the orcs?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That was just a coincidence. I felt the waves of a summoning, and went to take a look when I saw that large group because I figured an otherworlder might be among them. Ah, and I fought because I was attacked, and they needed to be put in their place.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Does that mean you don’t attack humans unprovoked?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That is the case for me. Others are probably different. Different people have different ways of thinking.”</p><p class="calibre2">People? I guess we’re the ones who decided to call them demons. They probably have a different name for us too.</p><p class="calibre2">“One last thing. When I was summoned into this world, I was told that if I defeat the demon king and use the demon king’s magic stone, I can go back to my world. Is that true?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Nonsense. I’ve never heard of such a thing. At the very least, I’ve never seen anything like it. I mean…”</p><p class="calibre2">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">“You don’t look surprised.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It’s not unheard of. People saying you need to do this and that to make your dreams come true, or using something as bait to make someone else do what you want. But, I see…”</p><p class="calibre2">They really are sly. Unforgivable.</p><p class="calibre2">“Sorry, but can I ask a favor from you?”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon looks fed up. Then again, I get how all these questions might be annoying.</p><p class="calibre2">“If you can, can you safeguard the other otherworlders if you meet them?”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon’s expression changes into an intrigued one, but it shouldn’t be that strange.</p><p class="calibre2">I get annoyed at some people when I remember their faces back then, but considering the situation we were all in, it couldn’t be helped.</p><p class="calibre2">“They were summoned here without their consent, and are being tricked into doing what the ones who summoned us want. So if you get a chance to talk and they stop fighting, spare them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I can’t promise you anything, but I can try, otherworlder.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes, thank you. And I’m Sora. I’m counting on you, Ignis.”</p><p class="calibre2">The demon… Ignis seems surprised at first, but it seems like he understands, and he flies away without saying anything.</p><p class="calibre2">Flying freely through the sky… I’m jealous.</p><p class="calibre2">But now I have a mountain of things to do.</p><p class="calibre2">I use Presence Detection after activating Map, and enlarge it as much as I can. I can see a group moving on the edge of the map. It feels like they returned to the village and are evacuating.</p><p class="calibre2">I approach two of the orcs, the ones killed with gunshots, and put them in the Item Box along with their weapons. I need to cover my tracks.</p><p class="calibre2">First, I take off and rip my bloody robe and throw it.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave my broken sword where it is, break off the clasp of my spare pouch, and throw it near the orc corpses.</p><p class="calibre2">Inside my pouch are a broken potion bottle and my guild card.</p><p class="calibre2">I leave the broken slave mask where it is, and rip the tunic off Number Thirteen and throw it too. Wait, she’s not wearing anything underneath.</p><p class="calibre2">Her small chest is moving up and down, so she’s still alive. Wait, so she’s a girl. I figured her voice was a bit high, but I figured it was a boy whose voice hasn’t changed yet. I quickly cover her with a spare robe.</p><p class="calibre2">I feel more tired than when I was negotiating with Ignis.</p><p class="calibre2">Ah, and I also collect Number Thirteen’s knife. It’s a useful item.</p><p class="calibre2">I need to get moving before the sun really sets, so I carry Number Thirteen on my back, and step into the vast forest in front of me.</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>

<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-40"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 40 &ndash; Intermission &ndash; Part two</h1><p class="calibre2">“…Report. After saying goodbye to the others in the Relay City Physis, the target stayed there for a few days, and it seems he is headed to the Southern Gate City Epica.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…What did he do while in Physis?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems he accepted quests to collect medicinal herbs.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…And the difficulty of those quests?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems it would be difficult for normal adventurers to gather many of them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Aren’t there many who deliver useless weeds? They are just adventurers after all…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes. Thinking about it that way, one must probably need to be very sharp to be able to do it.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Hm. And what about the tigerwolf?”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems the investigation led to the discovery of a lair deep within the forest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That’s a problem. Can adventurers deal with it on their own?”</p><p class="calibre2">“They are A ranked adventurers, but several parties seem to be staying there. I believe we can leave it to them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“The distance means it can’t be helped. What about the heroes’ equipment?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It is currently a work in progress, as we are setting up a discussion with a blacksmith.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Send them on a trial run as soon as the weapons are complete. If there aren’t any problems, send them to the dark forest.”</p><p class="calibre2">“The dark forest? Are you sure?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It doesn’t have to be the deeper parts. Have them camp on the outer edges and see how they do.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Should we intervene?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Only if the situation calls for it. Continue observing until the very last minute, but don’t lose them. Make sure to remember that.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Understood. What instructions should I give to the commander of the chivalric order?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Mobilize the third order this time. They have been getting soft lately, and could use the stimulus.”</p><p class="calibre2">　◇ ◇ ◇</p><p class="calibre2">“…We have a report from the South Gate City.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is it about the orc hunt? Did it end without issue?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…”</p><p class="calibre2">“What is the matter?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It seems the orc hunt is over, and it seems there were superior species among them.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is that how big their scale was? So? Did something else happen?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes. There are reports of a demon attack during the hunt.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Demon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Did they get it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…It seems the demon got away, and we suffered considerable losses.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I see. We finally confirmed the presence of a demon…”</p><p class="calibre2">“The damage was so severe, that rumors are already circulating in the South Gate City.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I don’t care. In fact, send word to the guilds to contact other countries. That should make them start paying attention.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Understood.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Do you think the heroes can stand up to a demon as they are now?”</p><p class="calibre2">“That seems unlikely, according to the reports we received.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…They had no problem fighting in the dark forest, did they? Would it be impossible even if they accepted it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I believe they wouldn’t stand a chance. It has also been reported that the aforementioned fighting didn’t raise their levels.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…So they have to go deeper if they are to raise their levels…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…The deeper parts are demon king territory. I believe there is a good chance they will encounter demons there.”</p><p class="calibre2">“I know. But then where?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Should we send them to a dungeon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Dungeon?”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes. It’s possible to acquire not yet known magic items and weapons in dungeons. I believe it will increase their strength, and fighting various kinds of monsters will be good for them as well.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…And demons won’t appear in dungeons? Look into what dungeon would be best to send them into.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Our connection to Number Thirteen has been cut.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Was it watching that other one?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Is it possible that other one realized he was being watched and fought it?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I don’t believe that to be the case. It seems all he can do in terms of hunting quests is hunt wolves. I can’t expect him to get the upper hand in a fight.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Is that your unbiased opinion?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Where is he?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…About that. He heard about damage caused by orcs in the village that put out the quest to hunt wolves, and it seems he fought said orcs.”</p><p class="calibre2">“It seems?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…No one actually saw him fighting orcs. But we sent adventurers to bring him back, since we waited for days and he never returned, and they found a damaged sword used by him, his guild card, and his blood-stained robe. There were also orc corpses.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Are you saying he defeated them?”</p><p class="calibre2">“I do not know. According to the villagers, there were five orcs, and we found only three. We also found a broken mask.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Are you saying Number Thirteen intervened because that other one was about to be killed?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…That is possible.”</p><p class="calibre2">“Did Number Thirteen defeat the orcs?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…I believe she has the ability to do so, but it would be a bad match. And according to one of the villagers, who is a former adventurer, it’s possible that one of the orcs was a superior species.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Could you confirm their deaths?”</p><p class="calibre2">“…We did not find their corpses. Orcs eat human meat, so…”</p><p class="calibre2">“…So it’s possible that they took them along as food…”</p><p class="calibre2">“Yes.”</p><p class="calibre2">“…Investigate that area. It’s dangerous to leave a superior species alive anyway. Also… Don’t forget to make sure this information doesn’t reach the ears of the other heroes.”</p><p class="calibre2"></p><p class="calibre2">Join my patreon to support me and read ahead.</p><div class="wp-block-image"><figure><div class="wp-block-image"><img src="images/000001.png" alt="" class="calibre3" /></div></figure></div></div>
