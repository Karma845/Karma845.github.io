<h3>Chapter 17 &#8211; The True Identity of Kiyokawa Ayane ③</h3>

<div class="calibre3">"Kiyokawa-san wore...... a wig?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. Were you surprised?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">I'm not surprised. Rather, I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.</div><div class="calibre3">If my grandfather, who's on the verge of the end of his life, had been here, he'd have immediately ascended to heaven.</div><div class="calibre3">"What the, what is the meaning of it――――?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Before I have time to ask, Kiyokawa removes the hairnet that keeps her natural hair together―――― then, a cute, fluffy bob perm descended on the head of the neat and tidy idol.　</div><div class="calibre3">That curly look is probably.............</div><div class="calibre3">"Can that hairstyle, be......?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes, this was a natural perm." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"――――!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">O-oh MY GOD.</div><div class="calibre3">This is a fact that will surely shock the public!</div><div class="calibre3">That Kiyokawa, who is famous as a neat and tidy idol and yet is also a young lady, has a natural perm!</div><div class="calibre3">......No, wait. I do remember something about it.</div><div class="calibre3">The other day, when I saw Kiyokawa after her bath, I had a strange feeling about her hair.</div><div class="calibre3">It was a wig, so she took it off when she took a bath. Now I understood.</div><div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></div>
<div class="calibre3">"More to the point, I'm not rich." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm extremely poor. I live in an apartment with my mother. My computer has extremely potato specs, and I've set the graphic settings on the Black Plains to the lowest possible." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's a d*mn lie! Kiyokawa-san is well-known as a young lady after all!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's just a matter of characterization. In the past, Star☆Mines wasn't selling well, so I had to resort to characterization." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"B-but even so......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Then, let me ask you, have you ever seen the Kiyokawa family's mansion? You haven't, have you?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">".......I haven't, neither on TV, nor even on the Internet......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I've seen many scenes of Kiyokawa acting like a young lady, but I've never seen any scenes that support the fact that she is actually rich.</div><div class="calibre3">It was only when she told me that I realized it.</div><div class="calibre3">"In other words, my life was built on lies, so to speak, a masked life. This level of impression manipulation is just a piece of cake." (Ayane) <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17"><b class="calibre4">(PTW/N: So this is the lore behind 'Masked☆Aaya'.)</b></span></i></div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa, with her calm facade, says something horrible.</div><div class="calibre3">I had been fooled by the image the public had given me and by her behavior.</div><div class="calibre3">No, surely I wasn't the only one who was fooled.</div><div class="calibre3">I can tell that by looking at Kiyokawa's classmates.</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you wearing a wig to create the character of a neat and tidy young lady?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. It's sad to say, but it's difficult for this natural perm to create the character of a neat and tidy young lady." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't think so though......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Then let me ask you, who looks more like a neat and tidy young lady...... the earlier me or the current me?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It's clearly the earlier half-up.</div><div class="calibre3">Perhaps realizing the answer from my silence, Kiyokawa smiles resignedly.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not that I'm making fun of her current hairstyle. It's just the gap was way too great.</div><div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">"This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~"</div></div><div class="calibre3">"Besides, I didn't originally want to be an idol, I actually wanted to be a novelist." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're kidding, aren't you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, I'm dead serious. Actually, before I became an idol, I was extremely shy. I was a really dull girl who...... was forgotten by my classmates." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She didn't look like that at all.</div><div class="calibre3">However, it is a fact that some of the most successful figures who appear on TV have a history of being bullied or being a loner. Kiyokawa seems to be one of them.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's probably why I loved novels that allowed me to enter a world of my own. However, when I was enthusiastically solicited by Senior Nana, I had no choice but to accede to her demands and turned to the path of an idol." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Shocking facts are revealed one after another.</div><div class="calibre3">Is this, something I'm allowed to know?</div><div class="calibre3">"But that doesn't mean I've given up on being a novelist. After I graduate from my idol career, I plan to make my debut as a glamorous novelist." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see. That sounds like a wonderful dream." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you very much." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What did the members of Star☆Mines say about your aspiration to become a novelist, Kiyokawa-san?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"They're very supportive. They are really kind people." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa responded, as she's smiling softly.</div><div class="calibre3">Just by looking at her warm expression, I can tell how well she got along with the other members of Star☆Mines.</div><div class="calibre3">"This is the true identity of Kiyokawa Ayane. Are you surprised?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Rather than I am surprised, I just can't believe it's real. Please give me some time to sort it out." (Kazuto)</div>
<div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</div></div><div class="calibre3">Let's see, first of all, Kiyokawa Ayane is a neat and tidy young lady idol who belongs to Star☆Mines.</div><div class="calibre3">And by her own admission, she has a troublesome personality, which has made her a bit of a loner at school.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's hairstyle is a half-up, but it is actually a wig, and her real hairstyle is a cute natural perm.</div><div class="calibre3">She lies about being a young lady and has a poor family.</div><div class="calibre3">It was all an act of matter of characterization.</div><div class="calibre3">Originally, she was so shy that her classmates forgot her.</div><div class="calibre3">Her real dream is to be a novelist!</div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">.............</div><div class="calibre3">I thought that Rinka is the one with the widest gap among the idols.</div><div class="calibre3">But I'm wrong.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa Ayane has――――surpassed it greatly.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kiyokawa-san. Why did you confide so much truth to me?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's because I believe you. Senior Ayanokouji said with straight eyes that he wanted to be my friend. Also, Senior Ayanokouji's feelings for Senior Rinka are genuine....... In other words, he won't do anything that can bring Star☆Mines down. I thought about these things and decided that even if he knows my secret, he won't disclose it to the public." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa states her thoughts.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know what to say, so I keep my mouth shut.</div><div class="calibre3">Not too long ago, we were having a silly conversation, but now we're having a serious one.</div><div class="calibre3">"What do you think, Senior Ayanokouji?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......What?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not a neat and tidy young lady. The real me is a shy and troublesome girl&nbsp; with a tendency to nitpick." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Toward such me, would you like to be friends with me?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">When Kiyokawa asks me that, she seems somewhat frightened.......</div><div class="calibre3">It's as if she's asking me to accept her.</div><div class="calibre3">I can only imagine, but it must be hard to have friends leave you once you have made some.</div><div class="calibre3">After that experience, it was perhaps natural for Kiyokawa to feel intimidated by the idea of making friends.</div><div class="calibre3">If anything, she might be just nitpicking too much so people are keeping away from her. If she doesn't make friends, she won't have to experience the pain of being left by them.......</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">With a fragile smile on her face, Kiyokawa calls my name in a quiet tone.</div>
