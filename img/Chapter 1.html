<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; The New Daily Lives</h3>

<div class="calibre3">On a weekday night, at 20:58.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm laying on my bed in my room, looking at the screen of my smartphone.</div><div class="calibre3">What playing on the screen is a music video of <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b>.</div><div class="calibre3">The group's five members are dancing happily on a special stage, wearing refreshing light blue and white dresses.</div><div class="calibre3">"Rinka is a good singer after all." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Beautiful and cute are also added.</div><div class="calibre3">The one I'm paying attention to is Mizuki Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">She is popular among the public as a cool idol, and her singing ability is so high that she is regarded as a diva.</div><div class="calibre3">Her appearance also gives off a cool aura.</div><div class="calibre3">She has a well-developed face, but the most attractive feature is her sharp, piercing eyes.</div><div class="calibre3">It is often said that the eyes speak more than the mouth, and I believe it to be true.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka's eyes convey a strong conviction and innocence, and you can tell that she is serious about her idol career.</div><div class="calibre3">It's also true that she has an uncompromising personality, which makes it a little difficult for her to fit in with her surroundings at school.............</div><div class="calibre3">"It's a little late to say this, but, amazingly, three members of <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b> are in my school." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Moreover, Mizuki Rinka is in the same class as me.</div><div class="calibre3">This is probably the only thing I can be proud of, being a nerd gamer.</div><div class="calibre3">However, the fact that we were just normal classmates is in the past.</div><div class="calibre3">Because it's different now.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">Ping♪</i></b>. A light notification sound is heard from my smartphone. It's from a chat application for a game. The sender is listed as "Rin".</div><div class="calibre3">We've been friends for a few years and even got married in the game.</div><div class="calibre3">If I have to describe Rin in one word, it'd be......, a bright and innocent girl, I think.</div><div class="calibre3">Her comments and reactions are honest and cute.</div><div class="calibre3">Just the other day, she saw Fountain Square, one of the dating spots in the game, and said,<i class="calibre5"> "Woaa~! Look at that~! It's so beautiful~!"</i> It was not an act, but her genuine emotion.......</div><div class="calibre3">When she got a rare item, she would say, <i class="calibre5">"Yaaayyyyy~! I've got something amazing~!"</i>, and innocently pleased.</div><div class="calibre3">However, she didn't show this side of herself to everyone.</div><div class="calibre3">Or rather, she only showed it to me.</div><div class="calibre3">Whenever she was approached by other players, she basically responded with a <i class="calibre5">"Hnn".</i></div><div class="calibre3">That's why Rin's friend list only has my name on it.</div><div class="calibre3">It seems that Rin has had a lot of trouble with people in the past, so she may have adopted an exclusive style.</div><div class="calibre3">[It's past the appointed time! What are you doing?] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Oh, man. It's already past 21:00, huh?</i></div><div class="calibre3">It seems that I was a little too absorbed in Rinka on the screen.</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm sorry, I'll log in now.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">I quickly reply.</div><div class="calibre3">I get out of bed, boot up my computer, and sit down on my chair.</div><div class="calibre3">"Well......, let's do it again today." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I launch Black Plains as usual.</div><div class="calibre3">After a few moments of loading, the computer screen showed a menu with a magnificent plain in the background.</div><div class="calibre3">This is a divine game that I've been playing since I was in the second year of middle school.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm a sophomore in high school now, which means I've been playing the game for four years.</div><div class="calibre3">In other words, I've known Rin for about four years.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm amazed that I don't get tired of playing this game.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, there's no way I can get bored.</div><div class="calibre3">As long as I have Rin, I'll never retire from the Black Plains.</div><div class="calibre3">After logging in, a small fishing village appeared on the screen.</div><div class="calibre3">In the center of the screen is Kazu, the character I'm controlling.</div><div class="calibre3">His occupation is Warrior, and he is a man in armor who wields a shield and sword.</div><div class="calibre3">By the way, Rin's avatar is a vivacious-looking blonde elf. She wears an ethnic costume with a sexy chest area and carries a bow on her back. She is a so-called Archer.</div><div class="calibre3">[Late again? I don't mind waiting for Kazu, but I'm still lonely. ・゜(゜⊃ω⊂゜)゜・.] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">I receive a personal chat from Rin.</div><div class="calibre3">From the mood of the chat, it seems that she isn't that angry.</div><div class="calibre3">However, I'll still have to apologize for being late.</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm sorry. I'll be careful next time.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Why were you late? If you don't want to tell me, that's fine.......] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[I was watching a music video. <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b>' MV.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Hee. There are five members of <b class="calibre4">Star☆Mines</b>, right? Who were you watching in particular?] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[Mizuki Rinka. I'm a big fan of Rinka.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">I answer with confidence.</div><div class="calibre3">Then the chat from Rin is cut off.</div><div class="calibre3">Is there something wrong?</div><div class="calibre3">When I have a bad premonition in my head, I receive a shocking message from Rin.</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm, Mizuki Rinka.] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">Normally, I'll have laughed and replied, <i class="calibre5">"That's a lie"</i>.</div><div class="calibre3">But.......</div><div class="calibre3">[Yep, I know. Rin's true identity is Mizuki Rinka.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">Due to some reasons, we knew each other's identity.</div><div class="calibre3">I was really surprised when I found out Rin's true identity.</div><div class="calibre3">You wouldn't normally think that the player you married in the game would be a popular idol from your class.</div><div class="calibre3">She was the cool idol, Mizuki Rinka, the only one I ever admired. My surprise went through the roof.</div><div class="calibre3">Yes...... I, Kazuto Ayanokoji, and Mizuki Rinka were so close that we got married in the game.</div><div class="calibre3">It didn't stop there......!</div><div class="calibre3">[Tomorrow, you know. I'll make lunch for Kazu. So, tell me what you want me to put in it, yees~.] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[Anything is fine.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Geez! That's the biggest problem! You make this wife cry!] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">......This is it, this is.</div><div class="calibre3">If <i class="calibre5">"Rin"</i> behaves as Kazu's wife, I can understand it.</div><div class="calibre3">However, it'll be wrong for <i class="calibre5">"Mizuki Rinka"</i> to behave as my wife.</div><div class="calibre3">At the very least, people with normal sensibilities should be able to recognize this abnormality.</div><div class="calibre3">But not Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">For Rinka, the world of online games is a world where one can interact with each other more purely and genuinely than in real life. In other words, she believes that marriage in the game is more precious than in real life.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, to put it simply, Mizuki Rinka acts like my wife even in the real world.</div><div class="calibre3">I was really surprised about this.</div><div class="calibre3">Or rather, I was scared.</div><div class="calibre3">Just finding out who Rin was was enough to make me lose my mind, but then she went on to call herself my wife.</div><div class="calibre3">I believe that all of mankind can understand the confusion I was in at the beginning.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, a lot of things happened after that, and we ended up going out officially.</div><div class="calibre3">I became a popular idol's lover.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Yes, became a lover.......</i></div><div class="calibre3">However, Rinka still behaves like she is my wife as usual.</div>
<div class="calibre3">[I'm Kazu's wife, right? Don't hesitate to request me what you want.] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[......, then mini hamburger steak.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Sorry! I don't have the ingredients!] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[You don't have any? Wiener then.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[Ah, we just ran out yesterday.] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[Is the fridge empty? Even if I make a request, It won't be fulfilled........!] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">[I'm sorry, Kazu. I'm immature as a wife. ：゜(。ノω＼。)゜・.] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[............] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">This is what kind of exchanges we do every day.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm tossed around in my daily life by a cool idol who behaves as a wife even in real life.</div><div class="calibre3">[Ah, that's right. Let's spend lunch on the rooftop tomorrow. The roof is closed so no one will come!] (Rin)</div><div class="calibre3">[Okay. Let's do that.] (Kazu)</div><div class="calibre3">As a popular idol, Rinka can't spend time with a man in public.</div><div class="calibre3">So, in the real world, we have to keep our relationship secret and never let anyone find out about it.</div><div class="calibre3">It's a very heart-pounding and thrilling life.</div><div class="calibre3">Even so, I also love Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, ...... no matter what the situation, I'm still looking forward to tomorrow's lunch.</div>
