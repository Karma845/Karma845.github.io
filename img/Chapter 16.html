<h3>Chapter 16 &#8211; The True Identity of Kiyokawa Ayane ②</h3>

<div class="calibre3">"This was the second time I'd visited Senior Ayanokouji's room, right?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I guess.", I respond appropriately and urge Kiyokawa to sit on a chair.</div><div class="calibre3">After school. Kiyokawa had really come to my house, so I have no choice but to let her in.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa takes a glance at my room, which is as messy as ever and sits down on the chair at the computer desk.</div><div class="calibre3">"Let us get right down to business. How long had you been following me?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Since the beginning of lunch break, I suppose." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"In other words, you knew about the special case in the aforementioned school building?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">In the aforementioned school building....... Did she mean the lavatory meal?</div><div class="calibre3">I nod to Kiyokawa, whose face was strained with nervousness.</div><div class="calibre3">It's useless to lie and say I didn't know it. I can't provide any proof of that after all.</div><div class="calibre3">"I see. I was convinced now. I was not sure why Senior Ayanokouji asked me to stop the surveillance only today.......So it was to follow me and take advantage of me, wasn't it?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, I've been wanting you to stop the surveillance for a while now. And I never imagined that Kiyokawa was having a lavatory meal." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">When I say "Lavatory Meal", Kiyokawa shuts her eyes and falls silent.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't know what to say, so I fall silent too.</div><div class="calibre3">I guess it's a mistake to say "lavatory meal".</div><div class="calibre3">It's just impossible for Kiyokawa to have a lavatory meal.</div><div class="calibre3">The fact that she is silent now might be because she thinks I've misunderstood her and is about to lose her temper.</div><div class="calibre3">After a few seconds of silence, Kiyokawa gets up as if she has made up her mind.</div><div class="calibre3">She stands up and drops a proudful declaration to me.</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes,....... I, Kiyokawa Ayane, wam a loner! I wam unquestionably a loner!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's a wonderful declaration of her being a loner.</div><div class="calibre3">If anything, it's full of pride.</div><div class="calibre3">She's shouting unabashedly as if to say that this's her genuine self.</div><div class="calibre3">"So, what would you do now?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Pardon?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji had grasped my weakness. Ermm, if the fact that the neat and tidy idol in the reality was a loner...... became known to the world, it would surely damage my image. In other words, Senior Ayanokouji had taken hold of my life as an idol." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I-I don't think that far ahead." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">A neat and tidy idol is actually an all-alone one. In fact, I feel that somehow that gap will increase her popularity.......?</div><div class="calibre3">While I'm thinking about that, Kiyokawa, whose face is bright red, and with a trembling voice, drops some shocking lines.</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-you were taking advantage of my weakness, blackmailing me, a-and then, ordering me to do something n-naughty, weren't you!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"H-HUUUUUHHHHHHHH!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">What is this girl saying all of a sudden? She's making a terrible assumption.</div><div class="calibre3">"What were you going to do to me...... by taking me into your room?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What do you mean by "taking me in"? You came here of your own volition!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"It was Senior Ayanokouji who made me do this, wasn't it? If I hadn't told you I was coming, you would have said, "I've got your weakness, you know! Guhehehe", something like that." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not saying that! I'm not even going to take advantage of your weakness." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I absolutely won't.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm further surprised by the fact that a neat and tidy idol who had been having a lavatory meal is actually won't stop delusional.</div><div class="calibre3">"This was the worst! Ah, now all the mysteries were solved! Senior Ayanokouji had also grasped the weaknesses of Senior Rinka and Senior Nana, that was right!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Aren't you thinking too much? Mainly in the er*tic area." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Please let me told you, my body was inferior compared to those of seniors! ......Who was inferior! I'd cry⁉︎" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's take a deep breath, okay? You're talking all by yourself and you're angry all by yourself." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She let her imagination run wild, getting out of control, and self-destructing herself.</div><div class="calibre3">Such an idiotic girl is right in front of me.</div><div class="calibre3">Yes, this is the true identity of the popular idol Kiyokawa Ayane.</div><div class="calibre3">The inside of her head must be dyed pink.</div><div class="calibre3">"AAAH, I never thought I would lose my chastity in this way....... But I would not give in to my heart. No matter what kind of condemnation I received from Senior Ayanokouji, this Kiyokawa Ayane, would never be drowned in pleasure! ......Ah, if you were going to tie me up with rope, please made sure you didn't leave any marks." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"This girl is hopeless, I have to do something soon...... No, it's already too late. My deepest condolences." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">In front of Kiyokawa, who holds out her hands for me to tie her up with rope, I raise my hands in a pose of capitulation. I even will raise the white flag if I have to.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Would you like to know the reason why I became a loner?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh, you're going to tell me yourself?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"After all this far, I thought it would be more comfortable if I just told you everything, or perhaps, I just wanted someone to have an ear......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I-I get it. I'll listen." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you very much......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa, who seems to have regained her composure, sits back on the chair.</div><div class="calibre3">"I knew a lot of people. I had a lot of acquaintances, I talked to my classmates normally, and it was not like anyone hated me." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I guess so. I could see that at lunch break today." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Rather, they looked at her with admiration. That's why I'm surprised that Kiyokawa is a loner.</div><div class="calibre3">"But we couldn't be friends, or rather, everyone was reserved with me." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Because you're a young lady and a popular idol?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. I'm often told that we have different views of the world." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Well, that may be true.</div><div class="calibre3">I remember what happened during lunch break today, and it was extraordinary. Everyone was giving way to Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">"Some of them wanted to be friends with me,............ but after we got to know each other a little, they simply left." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"For what reason?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"There were several reasons. First of all, I didn't spend much money." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"......What do you mean?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"The common knowledge was that I was rich, right? But I only spent the minimum amount of money I needed. Simply put, I was a stingy person. Among the ones who approached me, many of them were looking for money." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Seriously?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa, her eyes sadly downcast, says "Yes......." as she nods.</div><div class="calibre3">"Whenever I went to a clothing store or something, they would ask me to buy something for them. Of course, I refused. And eventually, the number of people around me decreased." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's such a terrible story that it hurts my ears just to hear it.</div><div class="calibre3">If I have such an experience, I'm sure I would lose faith in people.</div><div class="calibre3">"And the second reason. This was due to my natural personality........ I had a tendency to nitpick and tried to look after others. I also had too much imagination and make strange misunderstandings....... That was why the people around me had started to distance themselves from me." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I know what you mean. I know. I've experienced it firsthand." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I was treated like a womanizer and a lolicon........</div><div class="calibre3">I was annoyed and retorted it, but some people might not like it wholeheartedly.</div><div class="calibre3">And by the way, Kiyokawa had a hard time with Nonoa-chan.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, let's not mention this.</div><div class="calibre3">"In the end, everyone told me that the world of a neat and tidy young lady and themselves were different." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"In other words, it was my character that was all the reason why I became a loner." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you not going to improve yourself?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No. In fact, the way I live now was more in line with the image of Kiyokawa Ayane. She behaved neatly, elegantly, and gracefully without being crowded with her surroundings...... What did you think? It was very young lady-like, wasn't it." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Except for the lavatory meal." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, I couldn't help it! I didn't have any other friends I could spend time with, and if they found out that I was a loner, it would ruin my image....... So, I had no choice but to have a meal in the lavatory." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</div></div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa looks somewhat forlorn. Ahaha, she lets out a dry laugh.</div><div class="calibre3">......I wonder what it is, but what Kiyokawa has saying bothers me.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm not sure how to put it, but isn't it as if she was protecting the image of Kiyokawa Ayane as "a neat and tidy idol" as hard as she can?</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, idols are supposed to create their own characters. It's a way to gain popularity.</div><div class="calibre3">But in Kiyokawa's case, she's indeed a young lady, right?</div><div class="calibre3">If so, I think we should just be normal.</div><div class="calibre3">"By the way, do Rinka and the others know? Do they know that Kiyokawa has become a loner?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I didn't think they knew. I hadn't told them. If they knew that I was a loner, I was sure they would come to visit me during lunch break." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">She's right. If I think again about the nature of Kurumizaka-san, she will definitely go to see Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka is also going to see her regularly with good reason.</div><div class="calibre3">'Well, umm..., do the members of Star☆Mines hate you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, they didn't hate me. The five of us were good friends. There was a time when we didn't get along, but now everyone respected everyone's individuality and abilities." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see. It's a really good group." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Of course it is. Without them, I wouldn't be where I am today......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Perhaps having pictured the members in her mind, Kiyokawa smiles softly.</div><div class="calibre3">That smile is so innocent that makes me forget that Kiyokawa is a neat and tidy young lady, it reminds me of an innocent girl.</div><div class="calibre3">......I wonder if it's because I saw such a Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">I can't help but say to myself.</div><div class="calibre3">"Then, will you be my friend? I already know everything about you after all." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......Eh?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa blinks, seemingly unable to understand.</div><div class="calibre3">"Would you like to...... be friends with me?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I feel embarrassed and hesitate to say again in a conscious way.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Is it because I'm a loner? If you're feeling sorry for me, please don't." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"You're wrong. I was genuinely interested in becoming friends with Kiyokawa. The reason I was observing Kiyokawa in the first place was to gather information so that I could become friends with her." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You were kidding, weren't you? I'd said rude things to Senior Ayanokouji many times. I'd even been monitoring you......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I know that act is to protect Star☆Mines and us......, though I'd like you to take it a little easy on me. Also, about you've been rude to me....... Well, we can just leave it, right?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"W-were you okay just with that?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's okay. I've been retorting back for some reason." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"W-was that so......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">~"(This is a Translation Content of pemudatunawisata[dot]my[dot]id. so, read only on there, kay~)"~</div></div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa turns her head down again.</div><div class="calibre3">I can't see the expression on her face, so I can't guess what she's thinking.</div><div class="calibre3">But, she's cowering a bit and shrinking.</div><div class="calibre3">"I was surprised. There was someone other than Star☆Mines who would still want to be my friend after learning about my personality......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I don't think you have to be that surprised." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"......This was the gentleman that Senior Rinka had chosen, he did have a broad-minded." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"No idea. but it'd be nice if you don't overestimate me." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Speaking of myself, I don't think I have such broad-minded.</div><div class="calibre3">I just think it's a normal thing.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I understood. Then I'd tell Senior Ayanokouji my secrets." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Secret?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. This was a fact that only Star☆Mines' members and related people knew....... This was my, Kiyokawa Ayane's true identity." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">As she says that, Kiyokawa grabs a handful of her own hair.</div><div class="calibre3">And then, spontaneously, she removed her half-up hairstyle――――.</div><div class="calibre3">"What......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's head is covered with a hairnet that keeps her natural hair together.</div><div class="calibre3">It can't be......</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes, my half-up hair was――――a wig." (Ayane)</div>
