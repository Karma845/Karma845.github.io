<p class="block_11" id="calibre_pb_11">Chapter 60 <br class="calibre2"/>Academic Research Team</p>
	<p class="block_10">The next day, Ryo’s schedule was overturned since the morning.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Initially, he was planning to go to the North Library early in the morning, but when he tried to have breakfast at the guild cafeteria, his plan was derailed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“You’re sold out?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">He came to the cafeteria at the same time as usual after 7 am, but it was already sold out.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Sorry, Ryo. The academic research team from the royal capital took all the breakfast portions. For the afternoon meals, we’re going to go around the market to buy ingredients so it will be okay but… I feel sorry for the other guys too.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">The chef, who always seemed to have fun cooking at the back of the kitchen, bowed apologetically.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The chef was, of course, a former adventurer, a former C-class adventurer of a generation slightly before the Guild Master.</p>
	<p class="block_12">From the perspective of young adventurers, he was like a father who always cooked delicious food.</p>
	<p class="block_12">If such a person bowed, they couldn’t complain strongly.</p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">On the contrary, the impression of the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Academic Research Team</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> that caused such a chef to bow his head had already reached the worst at this point.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The academic research team was a research team sent from the royal capital to investigate the cause, progress, and future outlook when something abnormal happened in the kingdom.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Scholars from the Kingdom Central University, researchers from the Magic University, or magicians from the Court Magic Group itself may form the core team of investigators to lead the investigation.</p>
	<p class="block_10">This time, the location was the only dungeon in the Central Nations and it was the first Great Tidal Bore in about 10 years and at an unprecedented scale at that so the size of the academic research team was also unprecedented. It turned into a huge group.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The Kingdom Central University, the Magic University, and the Court Magic Group sent out as many people as they could.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Their numbers were 5,000 in total.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The research teams were usually formed with about 50 people and the number would not exceed 100 at most.</p>
	<p class="block_12">When it reached 5,000… the accommodation in the city was completely overwhelmed.</p>
	<p class="block_10">The people who didn’t have a place to stay were often those at the lower rung of the study team who came along as luggage carriers and guards and were forced to camp just outside the city.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“What on earth is the meaning of this!”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Hugh’s angry voice echoed in the Guild Master’s office.</p>
	<p class="block_10">In front of Hugh were the three executives of the research team.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Clive Staples, President of the Kingdom Central University.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Christopher Bratt, Chief Professor of the University of Magic.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Arthur Verasis, Court Magic Group Advisor.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">All of them were big names in the academic world of the royal capital.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">In particular, the Kingdom Central University seemed to be putting in extra effort by having the president lead the research team.</p>
	<p class="block_12">President Clive Staples had an air of both a scholar and a bureaucrat.</p>
	<p class="block_10">He was undoubtedly one of the pinnacles in academia in the royal capital.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">But that had nothing to do with Hugh.</p>
	<p class="block_10">No, he understood that showing hostility would lead to trouble but it was still too much.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“As soon as you arrived, you requisitioned all the food from the Adventurer’s Guild. Moreover, since you’re planning to enter the dungeon from today, you want us to lift the seal? In addition, you demand to have adventurers as guards? Even jokes have a limit to them.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">But Hugh’s shouts didn’t seem to have had much effect on any of the three.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">President Clive had a frosty look on his face, Chief Professor Christopher looked in a different direction, and Advisor Arthur was sipping tea with a feeling of exasperation.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Master McGrath, in this investigation, His Majesty the King has appointed the Lord of Home Affairs, Count Harold Lawrence, as the Chief of the Investigation Team, and we have received a full power of attorney from the chief, Count Harold Lawrence.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">McGrath was Hugh’s family name. His full name was Hugh McGrath.</p>
	<p class="block_12">With that said, President Clive presented a sealed letter and a power of attorney.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Full power of attorney…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It literally delegates full power to the one who carried the power of attorney… that is, the three in front of him were not to be disrespected and were equivalent to the chief, Count Harold Lawrence, and in relation, the King who appointed him.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Hugh then looked at the sealed letter.</p>
	<p class="block_12">The seal was a stamped wax seal that showed who it represented just by looking at the seal.</p>
	<p class="block_10">And the seal presented was that of the Lord of Home Affairs, Count Harold Lawrence.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“…Sure, it says to accommodate your group as much as possible.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’m glad you understand.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">President Clive replied with a smile, albeit it was somewhat cold.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“But there are still things I can and cannot do. I can’t provide food from the guild.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">“Master McGrath, do you understand the meaning of </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">accomodate</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">?”</span></p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">“Clive Staples, do you understand the meaning of </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">as much as possible</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">?”</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">The glares between the two were interrupted by another voice.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Clive, Hugh, why don’t the both of you take a step back? We are all leaders of the same kingdom. Regarding the food from the guild, Hugh’s claim is reasonable. I apologize for requisitioning food from the guild cafeteria. From now on, we will not enter the guild cafeteria or force the guild to provide food. We can talk about getting food delivered from the neighboring town of Kyradea or Acre. Is that okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">The conversation was placed back on track by Arthur Verasis, the eldest among the four of them and an advisor to the Court Magic Group.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">He had a long white beard, wore a gray Magician coat, and held a large staff.</p>
	<p class="block_12">He looked exactly like a Magician and was a Magician.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Yes… thank you very much.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Speaking of Arthur Verasis, he was still one of the top ten Magicians in the kingdom.</p>
	<p class="block_10">When he was young, he was also active as an adventurer, and as expected, Hugh could not slight the mediation of a great senior adventurer.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Okay. If Advisor Verasis says so, we’ll give up on the food. But the dungeon seal is the only thing we can’t give up. After all, if the dungeon is sealed, there would be no meaning for us to come here.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">President Clive would not give up on the lifting of the dungeon seal.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“We have no idea what’s going on inside. To unseal up such a place…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">As if to ridicule Hugh’s slight resistance, actually, President Clive was mocking him as he argued.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Aren’t we here precisely because we don’t know? The research team is formed for that very purpose.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Hugh also knew that was true and could only grumble to that.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“…Okay. But when you dive into the dungeon, take full responsibility for your actions. No matter what happens, the City of Rune, the Adventurer’s Guild, and adventurers will take no responsibility. Regarding that matter, I will ask that the three of you sign jointly to that agreement.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Y-you.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“If you don’t like it, I will not unseal the dungeon!”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Clive and Hugh glared at each other again.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Clive, that can’t be helped either. Hugh, it won’t be a problem to hire adventurers for more than the regular amount as guards, right? As adventurers, they will still have to earn money in the end.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Former adventurer Advisor Arthur… He suggested a part that was acceptable to each party.</p>
	<p class="block_12">The basics for negotiations were in place.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Although for Hugh, that was just a nuisance.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“Okay. That is up to each adventurer. But don’t forget this. There are almost no data on what goes on inside the dungeon after a Great Tidal Bore. You will encounter things you have never experienced before and it will be the same for the active adventurers. Please proceed with great caution.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Thus, the blockade of the dungeon was lifted on the fourth day after the Great Tidal Bore.</p>
	<p class="block_12">.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo, who missed breakfast at the guild cafeteria, was walking down the street looking for a stall where he could eat breakfast.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">When the dungeon was open, the street leading to the dungeon entrance in the center of the city was lined with many food stalls, but since it was closed after the Great Tidal Bore, only a handful was open.</p>
	<p class="block_12">That was partly because the number of adventurers around the dungeon had decreased leading to decreased sales, but more importantly, the supply of monster meat from the dungeon had also decreased.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Goblins were found on the fourth and fifth floors of the dungeon so the meat from those floors could not be used, but quite delicious meat could be obtained from the other floors up to the tenth floor.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">And now that the dungeon was closed, the few open stalls weren’t even ready at this time.</p>
	<p class="block_10">So Ryo looked for a restaurant along the street instead… but they weren’t opened yet either.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“This… does this mean I have to skip breakfast…?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Breakfast was important.</p>
	<p class="block_10">The energy for the day came from breakfast.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">He had to eat it!</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">With that in mind, while looking for an open shop, he arrived in front of the Golden Wave Pavilion.</p>
	<p class="block_12">That is the place where Ryo got drunk at Abel’s Return Celebration Party.</p>
	<p class="block_12">The taste was guaranteed.</p>
	<p class="block_10">And it was also the residence for Abels and the Crimson Sword.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">When he entered the Golden Wave Pavilion from the entrance, there was an inn counter in front of him. And on the right side, there was a dining room.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“No way… the Crimson Sword is already out?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, just… they left as a party about thirty minutes ago… they did not vacate their rooms, so I don’t think it’s a request to go far…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">At the inn counter, the inn’s landlady and a guest-like person were talking.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The guest was as short as Rin, wore a black wizard robe similar to Rin, and had a large staff similar to Rin.</p>
	<p class="block_12">From the voice, it sounded like she was still a teenage girl.</p>
	<p class="block_10">But the girl was visibly depressed when she heard that the Crimson Sword was not around.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Maybe you might meet them if you go to the Adventurer’s Guild…?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Right, there might be a possibility.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Then, the proprietress noticed Ryo coming in.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Oh, Ryo-san, welcome.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Hearing that voice, the girl turned around and looked at Ryo.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then she ran to Ryo, grabbed his arm and said.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Onii-san!”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Onii-san?!”</p>
	<p class="block_12">The landlady cried out when she heard the girl’s call.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“No, she’s not.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">She might have been thought that they were siblings who lived separately, but of course, Ryo had never seen the girl before.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Onii-san, you’re an adventurer, right? I have to go to the Adventurer’s Guild right now. Please take me there.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Huh……”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Will Ryo ever get the chance to have breakfast…?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Of course, he could ignore the girl’s request and have a delicious breakfast at Golden Wave Pavilion, but Ryo was fundamentally a good person.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Therefore, he brought the Magician girl and walked in the opposite direction of the main street that he had just walked.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“As I said, if you go south on this street, you would see the guild…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Yes, but if I miss it, it would be a big deal. I’ve just arrived in this city and I really don’t know my way around.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The name of the Magician girl was Natalie.</p>
	<p class="block_12">She said that she just came from the royal capital last night as a member of the academic research team with the court magic group.</p>
	<p class="block_10">The court magic group was staying separately in several inns around the area, similar to the Golden Wave Pavilion, but Natalie stayed at the Golden Wave Pavilion alone.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“My magic teacher’s teacher, basically my grand teacher, sent me a letter to hand over to Abel from the Crimson Sword. That’s why I have to go to the Adventurer’s Guild…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“I see, that’s troublesome in a lot of ways.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">While talking, the two arrived at the Adventurers Guild.</p>
	<p class="block_12">It could be said that their timing was perfect.</p>
	<p class="block_10">When they arrived, Abel and the Crimson Swords just came out of the guild.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Abel, just in time.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo, what’s wrong?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I heard that this lady wants to give Abel something. It’s okay, it’s not a fan letter.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I don’t know what a fan letter is, but for some reason, I feel like I’m being ridiculed?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Abel then looked towards Natalie.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“A-ah, this is from the royal capital, Ilarion-sensei.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Natalie then handed Abel a sealed letter.</p>
	<p class="block_10">When they heard that it was from Ilarion, not only Abel was surprised but also the Wind-Magician Rin.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“It would be better to read this now. Let’s sit down and read in the dining room. Ryo and you too… uh.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“It’s Natalie.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Rin was even more surprised to hear the name Natalie, but no one noticed it.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, with Natalie, I might need you to send a reply.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then, the Crimson Sword, Ryo, and Natalie entered the guild cafeteria.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">However, at present, there was nothing to eat in the cafeteria…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">After reading the letter from Ilarion, Abel scratched his head and handed the letter to Rihya.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Meanwhile, Rin asked Natalie a question.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Natalie, Natalie Schwarzkopf?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, that’s right…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Speaking of Schwarzkopf, that’s the Water-Attribute expert house…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">With that said, Rin thought a little.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">(Water-Attribute Magician… Maybe this is the first time I’ve met a person with Water Attribute other than me…)</p>
	<p class="block_12">It was a secret that Ryo was a little excited inside.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“My magical skill is still not complete… I am working hard every day.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Natalie said and faced down.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The letter from Ilarion went from Rihya to Warren to Rin.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I see……”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Whether Rin’s short comment was for Natalie or for the letter… Ryo wasn’t sure.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“In short, he wants us to support the court magic group diving into the dungeon.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Dungeon? Even though it’s blocked?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo asked a natural question.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Oh, it seems that bigwigs of the research team will negotiate for it. Guilmas will eventually have to allow it. The research team was sent by the country after all. Then, of course, the research team will want to hire adventurers who are accustomed to the dungeon… so the current letter is to utilize personal connections first.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">That made Abel look more troubled than ever.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“If Abel has such an expression, is the dungeon quite tricky after a Great Tidal Bore?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“You are half correct. In the first place, diving in the dungeon itself is prohibited after a Great Tidal Bore. That convention began decades ago, after the A-rank party at that time did not return from the dungeon after a Great Tidal Bore. Furthermore, it was not just A-rank… the leader was an extraordinary Swordsman who was said to have reached S-rank. The rule was made because even such a party couldn’t return.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Isn’t that troublesome?… Why am I only half correct?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“No one knows what happens in the dungeon after a Great Tidal Bore, including why the A-rank party didn’t come back. Half of the reason is that I hate going to places where I don’t know what’s happening.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then Abel shrugged.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">(Yeah, it’s a good idea to stay away from this.)</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo firmly vowed to stay away from the dungeon for a while.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	</body></html>
