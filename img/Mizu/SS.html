<h2>Short Story: The Troublesome Night</h2>

<p>It was a weekend. After all the recent commotion, it finally seemed like we could call it a peaceful Saturday.</p>

<p>After finishing the dinner cleanup, I returned to the living room where Kirihara, unusually, was watching TV. Her attire was the usual camisole and shorts.</p>

<p>She was fiddling with a character-themed bead cushion we had recently bought, known for its squishy texture, while staring at the screen.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Watching TV? That&rsquo;s rare. Is there a favorite celebrity of yours on?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nope. Some kids from class said this show was interesting.&rdquo;</p>

<p> </p>

<p>According to Kirihara, keeping up with classroom trends was also a sort of life strategy.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Huh,&rdquo; I responded, intrigued, as I focused on the bead cushion. It looked soft, but what was even softer and more voluminous, resting on top of it, were Kirihara&rsquo;s breasts.</p>



<p>It&rsquo;s a measure against stiff shoulders, I guess&#8230; Absolutely scandalous for a high school girl.</p>



<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re interested in the TV, why don&rsquo;t you sit down, Gin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sounds good.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Taking a break from games and spending some relaxed time together wasn&rsquo;t a bad idea.</p>

<p>As I sat next to her, her slender fingers intertwined with mine without a word. I leaned back, feeling the warmth of her hand as my attention drifted to the screen.</p>

<p> The TV show was a typical talk program, with the regulars and guests discussing love-related topics like &ldquo;Those who cheat are the worst&rdquo; and &ldquo;Jealousy is just love and insecurity flipped.&rdquo; With each point, Kirihara nodded along thoughtfully.</p>

<p>The conversation soon shifted to &ldquo;Love is a losing game for the one who falls.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Ah, I totally get that.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Seemingly deeply agreeing, Kirihara finally spoke up, clearly enjoying herself.</p>



<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same for us too, right? Gin, you&rsquo;re totally smitten with me.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Huh?</p>



<p>&ldquo;Wait. That&rsquo;s you, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? What do you mean? Are you saying I&rsquo;m smitten with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that the case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t deny it, but if we&rsquo;re talking wins and losses, I&rsquo;m clearly the victor, right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh? And why is that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always the one blushing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Internally, I flinched, but I couldn&rsquo;t let her see that and give her the upper hand.</p>

<p> At that moment, Kirihara&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Oh, really? You won&rsquo;t admit it? Well, well, that&rsquo;s how it is.&rdquo;</p>



<p>She wasn&rsquo;t truly upset, but her words had a hook. She grinned mischievously.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Got it. Then let&rsquo;s make it a game and settle this once and for all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A game?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The one who gets embarrassed loses. Whoever can make the other blush from now until bedtime wins.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It was a simple and somewhat childish rule. But given the context, there was no backing down.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Alright. I&rsquo;ll show you the dignity and poise of being older, among other things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so, a battle I couldn&rsquo;t afford to lose began.</p>

<p>Surprisingly though, Kirihara didn&rsquo;t make her move right away.</p>

<p>Even after the game started, she continued watching TV. Once the program ended, she was texting her classmates, likely sending messages like &ldquo;I watched it.&rdquo;</p>





<p>&ldquo;Gin, you&rsquo;re not making any moves. Aiming for a surprise attack?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the battle ended too quickly, where would that leave Kirihara? First, I need to show that your attacks have no effect on me. Then, I&rsquo;ll finish things off elegantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty confident, aren&rsquo;t you? But are you sure? If you get knocked out, you&rsquo;ll be teased by me forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No problem.&rdquo;</p>





<p>She was trying to rattle me by outlining the risks.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s a cunning one, resorting to tricks right from the start.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Well, do your best. By the way, want some snacks? I bought those ones again from the other day.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Saying so, Kirihara took a box from the snack shelf and showed it to me.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Yeah, I&rsquo;ll have some. Those are delicious.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It was a thin, long stick snack, heavily coated with crushed nuts and chocolate.</p>

<p>Kirihara approached me with a bag from the box, skillfully opened it, and took one out. She held the snack between her perfectly shaped lips and turned towards me.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Here you go.&rdquo;</p>



<p>&#8230;Ah, I see where this is going.</p>

<p>Understanding her intention, I calmly bit into the offered snack.</p>

<p>With each bite, our lips drew closer until they nearly touched, then I pulled away. As I chewed the snack in my mouth, we locked eyes.</p>



<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still some left. Make sure to eat it all.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Despite holding the snack with her lips, she continued to speak adeptly.</p>

<p>Without saying anything, I gratefully accepted the shortening piece of snack. After our lips touched, we naturally moved into a kiss.</p>

<p>The taste of sweet chocolate lingered from Kirihara&rsquo;s lips. She wrapped her arms around my back, pressing her body against mine, inviting me with entwined tongues. As always, it was a deep kiss. When I wrapped my arms around her back and pulled her closer, she let out a small gasp in my embrace.</p>

<p>We continued the passionate kiss until Kirihara pulled away.</p>

<p>Neither of us acted as if anything had happened.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the treat,&rdquo; I said, and she replied, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, you thought that wouldn&rsquo;t make me blush?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. After all, I&rsquo;m the elder here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. &#8230;So, Gin, do you like my body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Caught off guard by the sudden change in topic, I hesitated.</p>





<p>&ldquo;You once complimented me, saying I was very beautiful. Which part do you like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uh, well&#8230;,&rdquo; I stammered, then realized my mistake.</p>



<p>Don&rsquo;t panic, Hajima Gin. This is Kirihara&rsquo;s trap. She&rsquo;s trying to make me reveal secrets to embarrass me. How cunning. If that&rsquo;s the case, it&rsquo;s time for a counterattack.</p>



<p>&ldquo;First, your skin is beautiful. Maybe it&rsquo;s because you take good care of it, but it&rsquo;s so smooth and soft, it&rsquo;s comforting to touch. And I like that your breasts are big. Not that I&rsquo;d be disappointed if they were small, but right now, I like Kirihara&rsquo;s size the best.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Really?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way your back curves down to your hips and butt is also captivating. It&rsquo;s artistic, and I&rsquo;m more moved by the beauty than anything else. It feels like I&rsquo;m appreciating high art rather than getting turned on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hmm&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>She tried to keep a straight face, but I could see Kirihara&rsquo;s cheeks twitching. They seemed a bit red too.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Since we&rsquo;re being honest, I&rsquo;ll say it: your face is my type too. There was a time when I saw a cute girl from afar and thought, &lsquo;Wow,&rsquo; and it turned out to be Kirihara.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;So, you like that many things about me, huh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Plus, your smile is the best. I even like the way you smell. Maybe we&rsquo;re genetically compatible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Pervert. I&rsquo;m calling the police.&rdquo;</p>





<p>Kirihara turned away from me with a huff and started to take off her camisole, revealing the praised back.</p>





<p>&ldquo;&#8230;What&rsquo;s with the sudden change?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to take a shower.&rdquo;</p>



<p>She slid off her shorts, leaving her in just her underwear.</p>

<p>I realized this was the first time Kirihara had shown me her changing.</p>

<p>She glanced over her shoulder in just her panties.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Did you get excited seeing me undress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Nah, I&rsquo;m more impressed than anything, really.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Disappointed her attempt didn&rsquo;t work, Kirihara pouted. However, it seemed my compliments made her happy. She smiled at me.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Thanks. See you later.&rdquo;</p>



<p>With that, Kirihara hurried off to the bathroom.</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;That was a close call.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Fortunately, Kirihara had quickly left, so my reaction went unnoticed. Upon reflection, I realized I had answered questions I normally wouldn&rsquo;t have.</p>

<p>But the game was still on, and showing any sign of disturbance was not an option.</p>

<p>The passage of time on a holiday flies by in the blink of an eye. The hands of the clock are inching closer to the top, signaling that the date is about to change soon.</p>

<p>After her bath, Kirihara roams around wrapped in a bath towel, and at times, she puts her hair up to show off her nape in a rare fashion. It&rsquo;s a strategic play, knowing full well what tends to capture a man&rsquo;s attention. However, I had steeled myself beforehand to remain calm and not lose, understanding that under normal circumstances, I might have reacted. After all, men are social creatures. When it comes to a contest, even I can control myself.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Should we go to bed soon?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>



<p>Kirihara, sounding a bit sulky, nods obediently. As we move to the bedroom, I speak up again.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll share the bed, alright?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>



<p>We lie down together and turn off the lights. A silence so profound it almost hurts the ears stretches on for a few seconds, then Kirihara quietly asks,</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Gin, you&rsquo;re not going to do anything, huh?&rdquo;</p>



<p>So, it&rsquo;s finally come to this. Kirihara, you might not understand this at your age, but&mdash;this type of contest is lost by the one who becomes impatient first.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Gin? &#8230;Are you mad about something?&rdquo;</p>



<p> Perhaps feeling uneasy over the silence, her voice lacks its usual firmness.</p>

<p>Instead of replying, I roll over to face Kirihara, who had her back to me. I embrace her from behind.</p>

<p>After a slight gasp, Kirihara clutches my arm tightly.</p>



<p>Then, she places her hand over mine.</p>



<p>Slowly, she moves my hand to her chest, onto the softness I had complimented earlier. She&rsquo;s not wearing any undergarments, so I can feel a slight hardness in the center.</p>

<p>Huh? I sense something off.</p>

<p>Kirihara begins to sway our hands. The sound of the camisole fabric rubbing against my hand fills the bedroom, interspersed with Kirihara&rsquo;s seductive moans.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Nh&#8230; Nhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Is she trying to force me into embarrassment through sheer force&#8230;?</p>



<p>If that&rsquo;s her game, then I slide my other hand between Kirihara&rsquo;s body and the bed, circling around to her front. I place my hand on her stomach.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s firm but has the softness characteristic of a woman. Another enticing area.</p>



<p>As I wiggle my fingers, Kirihara lets out a high-pitched moan.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Hyann&#8230;!&rdquo;</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Perhaps frustrated at making a sound, Kirihara begins to groan. Meanwhile, the hand pressed against her chest continues its circular motion, gradually becoming more intense.</p>



<p>Actually, I can feel Kirihara&rsquo;s fingers tightening on my hand above hers. Her movements seemed to be stimulating her chest as if massaging it. Perhaps it&rsquo;s my imagination, but I think there&rsquo;s a change in the scent coming from her nape. Her breathing has become shallow and quick, and her body trembles as if in agony.</p>



<p>&#8230;Wait. Is this really&#8230;?</p>



<p>&ldquo;Gin, aren&rsquo;t you going to touch&#8230; my stomach?&rdquo;</p>



<p>She wants me to touch her.</p>

<p>Responding to her request, I gently caress her, treating her tenderly. Yet, Kirihara still lets out a pained voice. Occasionally being a bit mischievous, when I let my fingers wander over her shorts instead of her stomach, she reacts violently with a jolt! Ignoring that and returning my hand to her stomach causes her to squirm with a &ldquo;nnnnn&#65374;&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be mean&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Finally, she no longer hides her unusual state. When I let my fingers crawl between her legs, a wet sensation is distinctly felt. Slight movements of my fingers elicit a moan, &ldquo;ahnn&#8230;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Touching her directly through the gap in her shorts makes her body jump with a &ldquo;huh!?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Exploring by touch alone&#8230; it&rsquo;s warm and soft. The indescribable firmness that&rsquo;s usually felt when nothing is happening is completely absent. Her body is fully receptive.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Did you touch yourself?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Silence falls. The rough breathing and the sound of fabric rubbing against each other, everything stopped.</p>

<p>The next sound I hear is&#8230; a sniffle.</p>



<p>Half in panic, I turn Kirihara&rsquo;s body towards me.</p>



<p>Even in the dark, I can see her face is flushed, and she&rsquo;s almost crying.</p>

<p>With a mix of embarrassment and longing on her face, Kirihara appeals to me.</p>





<p>&ldquo;Because, Gin, you said so much about me&#8230; realizing that you see me that way made me so happy, I started to ache&#8230; I meant to just touch a little in the bath, but I couldn&rsquo;t stop, and it just went on&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Come to think of it, she did take a longer bath than usual&#8230;</p>



<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t calm down even after getting out&#8230; I&rsquo;m sorry for being so lewd&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>While sobbing, Kirihara delivers a final blow.</p>







<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get disgusted&#8230; don&rsquo;t hate me&#8230;&rdquo;</p>





<p> </p>

<p>&#8230;I&rsquo;ve lost.</p>

<p>I kiss her, stroke her head, and then whisper in her ear.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Idiot. How could I ever hate you?&rdquo;</p>



<p>I slip my hand into her shorts. She made a distress faces.</p>

<p>Inserting a finger inside make her moan, &ldquo;no, ahhh&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>&ldquo;Wait, I&rsquo;m embarrassed&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>Ignoring her, I push my finger gently against the inside of her stomach.</p>

<p>The reaction was dramatic. Kirihara lets out an inaudible scream, pressing her fingers into my shoulder. Though her face is down, I can read her expression. Knowing her reaction makes her weak spots obvious.</p>

<p>It was easy to find what Kirihara enjoys.</p>



<p>Even when she shakes her head vigorously or tries to escape, I don&rsquo;t let up, pulling her back. Her breathing intensifies, and she gazes at me with moist eyes.</p>



<p>Her voice and expression completely melted, I ask.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Adding another finger will allow us to do something slightly different&#8230; What do you think?&rdquo;</p>



<p>Kirihara freezes for a moment, breathing heavily twice. The hesitation lasts only for that brief period.</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Do it.&rdquo;</p>



<p>In a barely audible voice, blushing, she pleads.</p>

<p>After inserting two fingers and bending them separately, or rotating my wrist to do the same motion, Kirihara writhes as expected.</p>



<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Gin, I&#8230; oh, Ahnnn&#8230;&rdquo;</p>











<p>Her eyes are tightly shut, and her quivering lips, as well as her hunched shoulders and back, stiffen.</p>

<p>After a sigh of relief, her lower abdomen still rhythmically twitches.</p>

<p>When we kiss, her tongue responds with leisurely movements.</p>



<p>&#8230;Upon pulling away, she gives me a resentful glare.</p>



<p>&ldquo;You saw my face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always look at you, don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean! You know it! Monster! Meanie! &#8230;Ah!&rdquo;</p>



<p>Stimulated by my movement, Kirihara trembles adorably.</p>

<p>The hand that emerged from under the blanket was sweaty and clammy. I gaze at Kirihara.</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;It&rsquo;s not my fault. I didn&rsquo;t know anything.&rdquo;</p>



<p>She was incredibly bashful. With her face still beet red, Kirihara continues.</p>



<p>&ldquo;&#8230;But, it felt good. Ehehe. Thanks. Gin, you&rsquo;re a technician!&rdquo;</p>



<p>Whether she was being defiant or trying to hide her embarrassment, she said it in a bright voice.</p>

<p>After all, Kirihara&rsquo;s smile is the cutest.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/embed0014_HD.jpg" />

<p>&ldquo;Ah, did you blush just now, Gin?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Correct. &#8230;Should we call it a draw?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&#8230;Yeah, that sounds right.&rdquo;</p>



<p>It would probably be the most reasonable outcome. It prevents any unnecessary arguments, offering the most benefit.</p>



<p>&ldquo;By the way, it seems like you&rsquo;re quite&#8230; excited over there&#8230; But are you going to hold back? Can you do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course. I&rsquo;m an adult, after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. &#8230;That&rsquo;s a bit disappointing. But, gotta endure, endure&#8230;&rdquo;</p>



<p>The exact time was unclear, but afterwards, Kirihara began to breathe softly in sleep while snuggled up against me.</p>



<p>I, left with my body temperature awkwardly raised, couldn&rsquo;t sleep at all. (tln : kekw, he got b*ner )</p>



<p>This would later be remembered as the beginning of a long night.</p>
