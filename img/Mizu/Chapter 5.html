<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 5: Dusk, Hounds, and Doubts Brought on by Scars</h2>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Look how
beautiful the sky is."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, yes, it
is."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Those clouds
look kind of weird, don't they?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, it looks
like a cat curled up asleep."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, not that
one. It's the one right above that mountain."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmm?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With their
conversation devoid of any productivity, the two somehow managed to mask the
disturbing scent.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is not clear
whether the person tailing them could hear their conversation, but it is not
surprising that a person who is appointed as a spy by the school headmaster
could at least use lip-reading skills.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two of them
wandered aimlessly through the school grounds until they arrived at the woods
near the girls' dormitory, which they had set as their final destination. They
passed several students on their way to this place, and heard whispers about
they are being in a relationship, but Nina did not have the time to worry about
such things.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Because she could not
hear the footsteps of the person who had been following her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was nothing that
could be a concealment except for a faint street lamp on the path she was
walking now. If Jin had not told her, she would not have believed that there
was someone following her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just how powerful
could the school principal's pawn - the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;, who has yet to
be seen, be?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, this person
undoubtedly has psychic abilities. And if he is capable of such advanced
tailing techniques, he may have the same level of combat ability as a combat
soldier.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Naturally, this is an
opponent that Jin and Nina would never be able to defeat in a frontal battle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only chance for
them to win would be that they were already used to fighting such opponents.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the center of a
thicket of trees shrouded in darkness, Jin stopped in his tracks.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A smile welcoming the
extreme thrill is plastered on his face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">At last, the battle against the stalker is about to
begin.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... By the
way, Nina, do you smell something disgusting?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, it smells
like an annoying fox."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What shall we do
then?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Isn't that
obvious?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina briskly turned
around with a wicked smile on her face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm gonna twist
him to death right here so he won't make me feel any more uncomfortable."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Standing behind her
was a figure dressed in a black coat with a hood. He was wearing an inorganic
white mask with lenses for eyes, and his face was indistinguishable. The coat,
which was fluttering in the wind, made it difficult to discern his physique.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was obvious that
this was not an ambush by a mere student.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh, it seems
that he is not a student of the Heiberg Academy. What was the proper way to
deal with this case again?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Looks like we
don't have to go to the trouble of getting such an intruder to agree to a
&lt;duel&gt; before we kill him."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Or so he said,
poor fox. I guess I don't need to warn you anymore, do I?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina raised her palm
to the sky and waved her arm as if to grasp the air and throw it away.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With that as a signal,
the trees that covered the sky began to make noises.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The next moment, a black
mass was shot out of the trees.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The assailant, who
rolled on the ground to avoid it, realized that it was a stone the size of a
human head that had attacked him from above.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, a direct
hit from this would have resulted in more than minor injuries.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......You're
surprisingly soft, Nina Stingray."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A thick male voice
could be heard coming from the mask.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The voice seemed to
have no sense of humanity, with a great deal of noises mixed in. Nina never
heard of such technology before, but perhaps that mask has a function to change
voices.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I thought you
would dismember my limbs without question. ...... Or is there some reason why
you can't attack a human body directly?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm just trying
to be considerate of those janitors who do the cleanup afterward. If I get
serious, you know ...... the battlefield tends to become horrible."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A normal student would
have screamed and fled at this point, but the assailant didn't seem to be
phased. With military knives in both hands, he gradually closed the distance
between them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Behind her ruthless
smile, Nina was fighting desperately against her own fright.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">There are only about ten traps left.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She has to somehow
conquer this formidable opponent before he realizes that her psychokinesis is
just a bluff.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina recalled the
night she was summoned to this woods.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> One Week Ago </span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina, your
&lt;Queen of Calamity&gt; needs to go to the next stage."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Relying solely on the
moonlight, Gasta and the other landscapers were working on something.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There is no end to the
questions that need to be asked. But for the time being, Nina decided to start
with the biggest question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do you mean
the next stage?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There will be
more and more people to whom bluffing alone won't be enough. It was the same
with Bennet Lohr."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">That's for
sure</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">, Nina bit her lip.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The monsters who were
exempted from the entrance exam are not the least bit afraid of the bad rumors
about Nina.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter how much she
tried to scare them with her outstanding acting ability, it would be difficult
to get them to surrender on that merit alone.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"From now on, it
will be necessary for you to produce some physical manifestation with your
psychic abilities."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, so that's
why we set up such a large-scale mechanism ......."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Diagonally ahead, on a
tree, two workers were working together to install a device painted green.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Judging from the huge
stones they were placed on top of it, it might be some kind of projectile. A
string, the same color as the tree trunk, was extending to the ground, and it
seemed to be activated by pulling it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the back, a similar
device was covered with branches and leaves by the president, Gasta.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The purpose is not
just to defeat the enemy, but to demonstrate Nina's psychic abilities, so it is
a process that must be carried out with particular care.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My prediction
tells me that assailants will arrive not too long from now."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Does that mean
they know who we are?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, I'm sure
they haven't got the evidence. But I think they will attack us when the level
of suspicion exceeds a certain level."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh? Such a vague
thing......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The best way to
get evidence is to torture us and make us spit it out ourselves. Even if turns
out that we were innocent, they could just dispose our bodies by making it look
like an accident or suicide. Nina, you are well aware of what the &lt;White
Knights&gt; are doing behind the scenes, no?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The &lt;White
Knights&gt;, who are hailed as heroes of salvation and to which Nina's two
older brothers belong to, had once killed Jin's foster parent. Torturing them
horribly and burying them in the darkness of history.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When great power and
violence join forces, the idea of choosing one's own means easily disappears.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The &lt;Shepherd's
Dogs&gt;, who share the same ideology as them, must have similar ethics.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If someone is
about to target us, let's lead them to this place first."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin continued,
pointing his index finger toward the ground.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"When the battle
begins, Nina, I want you to use your best acting to get their attention. I'll
make sure to mask my presence and activate the trap myself."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If one thinks about it
calmly, this is a childish trick.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Nina knows that
Jin's tricks always have a double or triple purpose.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She finds herself even
looking forward to the decisive battle that will sure to come.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The assailant, with
knives in both hands, was attacked by an attack that was disguised as Nina's
psychic ability.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A stone shot from a
sling on a tree.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Explosions from
gunpowder buried in the ground.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sun is already
setting, and there is hardly any light in the woods. Although the assailant was
wearing a mask that restricted his vision, he easily evaded all the attacks.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Superhuman physical
ability and reaction speed. It is amazing that he can move so agilely in this
darkness, but how can he even avoid the gunpowder that is supposed to be buried
in the ground?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Don't tell me that he has clairvoyant ability.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You sure love
meaningless attacks, huh?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You, on
the other hand, seem to enjoy running away in an ugly manner."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, not
really."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, the
assailant rushed toward Nina at a tremendous speed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Oh no, I'll be killed!</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as she was about
to scream, the assailant's feet suddenly caved in.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A pit that was
cleverly concealed - the reason Jin had specified in detail where to stand was
probably to lead the assailant into this trap. Nina quickly turned her palm to
the ground and made a show of causing the assailant to sink into the ground
with psychokinesis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The assailant, now
sunk into the ground up to his waist, could no longer move. A projectile with a
perfectly calculated trajectory had already launched as a finishing blow.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I see, so you
can use such a tactic."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The assailant, who
muttered in an inhuman voice, reacted in a way far beyond the human realm.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He lifted himself up
using only the strength of his arms from the pit, and finally leaped up to
evade the projectile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The stone seemed to
have slightly grazed his right hand, but that would only be a minor scratch.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This is bad, this is bad, this is bad!</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina desperately tried
to remember the layout of the traps, but all that came out was that she was
running out of ammunition. Even Jin, for whom she was relying on, looked bitter
as he hid behind a tree trunk.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The other party had
not even used its psychic ability, but their strategy had been easily
destroyed.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You sure
are quite persistent."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only weapon left
for Nina is her acting.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was planning
to just knock you out, but now I have changed my mind. I don't care what
happens to you anymore."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina put her hand on
the brooch that glowed red on her chest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her removing the
brooch is a requirement for fully releasing her psychic ability. It is a signal
that she is willing to kill her enemies. It is like a de facto sentence of
execution.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin and Nina had
painstakingly created this rumor, and of course, the other party knew about the
rumor as well.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And yet, the assailant
did not even show the slightest sign of retreating. Is he simply pretending to
be calm, or does he really feel no fear?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Either way, if things
continue as they were, the future ahead of them is clear.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, well, this
is truly amazing."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if to lighten the
tense atmosphere, Jin made silly clapping sounds.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't know
whether I should describe you as someone who's fearless - or someone who's
desperate to die, perhaps? Surely, only such a fool would think of fighting
Nina head-on."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's up with
you all of a sudden, Jin Kirihara? Did you feel lonely because you were being
left out?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm just giving
you some advice for your own safety."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With dark eyes and a
playful smile, Jin walked toward the assailant.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Although this
school is almost like a lawless zone, there are still at least a few rules. An
outsider like you isn't supposed to be allowed to fight against the
students."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's new to
me. And I don't really care about it."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I think you should
be a little concerned about it. Because-......" Jin said in a theatrical
tone, spreading his hands out. "-there's such a big audience here."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The assailant's feet
stopped.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Looking around with an
unreadable mask on his face, he saw a group of students who had gathered after
hearing the explosion.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From the beginning,
Jin had never thought that such a trap alone would be enough to defeat his
opponent. It was only a matter of showing a glimpse of Nina's psychic
abilities, so he had to prepare another way to win the battle.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What Jin came up with
was a plan to force the battle to end.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, it was not
as simple as calling the students nearby with the sound of explosions. The
biggest trap of all was the fact that Jin and Nina had been walking around the school
grounds together in a random fashion until they led the assailant here.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They deliberately
chose a route with a lot of pedestrian traffic to make as many students as
possible aware of their presence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All of this was a
preparation to efficiently gather a crowd of onlookers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I don't
know who you are or what your purpose is, but if you're hiding your face from
us, you must have some kind of dark secret, right? Are you sure you want to
risk your time here?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina decided to take
advantage of Jin's words.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll let you off
the hook this one time out of concern for your safety. The next time you come
into my sight, ...... you know what the consequences will be, don't you?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The assailant made a
gesture of a deep sigh and tucked the two knives around his waist.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then, with the agility
of a cat, he ran up the thick trunk, through the trees like stepping stones,
and disappeared into the darkness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Seeing that the danger
was over, Nina whispered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Can we
call this a victory?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"At least that's
how it seems to everyone."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The onlookers gathered
near the entrance to the wooded area were staring in awe at Nina. The smoke
rising from the gunpowder and the holes drilled in the ground were also
interpreted favorably by the onlookers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Today, too, Nina Stingray
broke the spirit of the daredevil who foolishly confronted her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Yet the girl in
question realized that her situation was not getting any better.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Perhaps
it's time to stop doing the scheme thing for a while."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're damn
right."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I wonder if I'm
going to be attacked in my sleep......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, at least,
I don't think they'll do it today."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Doesn't that
mean they might do it tomorrow!?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It'll be fine.
So far, it's as I predicted. All we have to do next is wait for the final piece
to come together......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do you
mean?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, the
last light from the setting sun disappeared, and Jin's face was covered in
complete darkness.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Meet me at the
hideout tomorrow after school. I'll tell you the final plan there."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Just to what extent does that man's strategy reach?</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she peeled off her
black coat and mask, she regulated her ragged breathing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Normally, she had no
intention of taking such a forceful action. It was clearly too risky a gamble.
But the situation surrounding her was getting worse by the minute, and she had
reached a point where she could no longer afford to make any mistakes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The mastermind behind
everything was probably Jin Kirihara.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Before she knew it, an
elaborate mechanism had been activated, and a seemingly endless chain of
events, seemingly unrelated to each other, was hunting her down like a
nightmare.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was impossible to
put it away as overthinking.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she didn't assume the
worst, it wouldn't make sense.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was nothing short
of hilarious that she had to retreat as soon as possible.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the first place,
there was no need to make the decision to retreat because of a mere gathering
of onlookers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was completely
hiding her face and body shape, so there should be no problem with killing
them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Aside from the
formidable Nina Stingray, it would have been easy to finish off an ordinary
person who pretended to be a schemer. It didn't matter to her even if he were
able to nullify her psychic abilities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Don't tell me that I hesitated because of my emotional
ties?</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She carefully
considered this possibility.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It certainly is true
that she is friends with those two at school. Of the countless friends she has,
these two are the most closely connected.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But that is when she
is Emma Licorice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Armed with a hooded
black coat, a mask, and a knife clutched in both hands, she is clearly a
different person than the [Emma] in the classroom with a carefree smile on her
face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They share the same
body, but are completely different personalities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She is the other half.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unlike [Emma], whose
role is to blend in with society and expand her circle of friends, she does not
need a specific name as she simply performs her work in the darkness. In fact,
[Emma] does not even aware of her existence.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Recently, a doctor in
some countries has given her an official name for her disorder, but the upper
echelons of the organization find this characteristic of hers invaluable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[Emma] is a
personality that knows nothing of her own true nature and makes those around
her feel no sense of caution.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On the other hand,
[Emma]'s other personality, who understands her mission perfectly, is willing
to do dirty work for her country.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She is able to switch
between these two personalities at will, and no one is better suited for
espionage than her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......I will not
hesitate any longer."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She reaffirmed her
decision by saying it out loud.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Don't forget
why you are here. Dedicate everything you have to your country.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With such a wretched resolve
in her heart, she put on her mask once again.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who had not
slept a wink for fear of being attacked, came to class with makeup covering the
circles under her eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Over the course of the
night, Nina realized what it really means to fight with the empire.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fear that
everything in the world would seem like an enemy and that she would not even be
able to sleep peacefully. She had been prepared for this when she had formed an
accomplice relationship with Jin, but she had never expected it to be this bad.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">In the first
place, who exactly is the identity of the assailant?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">It was in
dimly lit woods, so it was hard to be precise, but I think he was about the
same height as Jin.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">However, both
Karen and Casper were of similar height as well. I couldn't even discern his
gender because his body shape was hidden by his coat.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good morning,
Nina-chan. What's with the serious look on your face?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was so deep in her
thoughts that she was unaware of Emma's presence until she called out to her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She would not be able
to hold herself together if she kept worrying about it all the time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina shifted her mind
to everyday life and made a gentle smile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, I've been
having a little trouble sleeping lately......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Exercise is the
best thing to do at times like that. I also run around the school grounds after
school, you know?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was wondering
why you weren't in the dorms sometimes, so that's what you were doing."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Would you like
to join me for a run sometime, Nina-chan?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Will do.
Please give me a call the next time you run."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she talked with
Emma, she felt her heart gradually lighten.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina had never had a
friend in her life with whom she could have a casual conversation like this.
She felt a little guilty for putting on a thick act, but she still wanted to
cherish this relationship.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, Emma-san,
what happened to your right hand?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina could see a
bandage plastered on the part of Emma's hand that was peeking out from the hem
of her uniform.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is not unusual
for Emma, who has an energetic personality and a bit of a wild side in her
personality.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, this? I fell
when I was running......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, be careful,
will you?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, well, I
can handle this much!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is hard to imagine
Emma, who has excellent physical ability, falling down, let alone Jin, who is
extremely unathletic. Was she very tired or did she trip over something?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thinking to that
point, Nina noticed something strange that she couldn't ignore.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">The bandage was placed
a little below the back of her hand. She wondered if she could get a wound in
such a position, no matter how badly she had fallen.</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Normally, one would injure the palm that was extended

person with a wound in that spot.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The answer was so
obvious that she could have easily traced it if she had wanted to.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Nina did not want
to acknowledge it. She wanted to keep the question as a question and wait
patiently for the day when it would fade away. She wanted to turn away from the
painful reality.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, the memories
were vivid in her mind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hadn't the person in
the black coat who attacked Nina and Jin yesterday evening been wounded in the
same spot?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hadn't a stone aimed
at the assailant as he escaped from the pit grazed his right hand slightly?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Don't tell me, the identity of the &lt;Shepherd's

was talking to herself about something.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">「　　　　　　　　　　　」</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She wanted to reply
quickly, but she couldn't gather up even the slightest bit of the words her
lips were weaving.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">「　　　　　　　　　　　」</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The scenery of the
classroom flickered like the surface of the water, and even all sense of
perspective vanished.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Who is this
girl laughing in front of me? What reason did this girl have for being close to
me? Why am I sitting next to her without a second thought?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The floor beneath her
feet fell away, and Nina felt as if she were falling into a bottomless pit.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only relief was
that before the conversation could continue any further, the first chime of the
school day sounded and an instructor in military uniform entered the classroom.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">On her way to the
gymnasium, wary of being followed, Nina repeatedly asked herself the same
question.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">What am I thinking!? There is no way that Emma is
deceiving us! ......</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">That's right.
Emma couldn't possibly be a &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma is the
first friend I've ever had in my life who lives outside of the intense survival
struggles of the academy, and who I can count on to lend me a hand when I need
it.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Besides, there

match, it could be dismissed as a mere coincidence. For in the art of deceiving
oneself, there is no one better than myself.</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">But, it's futile.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter how many
excuses Nina tried to come up with, she just couldn't get the doubts out of her
head.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's because of the
fraudster's mindset that she has acquired during her days with Jin.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who doubts
everything around her, was certainly wary of the girl smiling in front of her.
Nina intensely hates herself for imagining cruel and irredeemable things.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I see, Jin has been living with this kind of pain all

cruelty of being suspicious of everyone who comes near her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Should I
really tell Jin about Emma?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Or is he

really a solid reason within me to still keep moving forward?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The gymnasium on the
outskirts is getting closer. Nina finally regains her senses and notices a
young man in a military uniform coming out from inside.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He is a business
associate of Jin's disguised as an instructor, who says he is a detective
specializing in the underworld. As Nina recalls, his name was Heath or
something like that.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After hiding in the
shadows and getting past him, Nina hurried into the warehouse.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Upon arriving at the
hidden room in the attic after fulfilling certain steps, Jin was contemplating
something while looking at the schematic paper on the wall. There were more
black-and-white photos and sticky notes than she had seen before, but Nina was
not sure what Jin was after.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin stopped filling in
the sticky notes and turned around with his usual languid expression.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's now or never if I'm going to tell him about that

umm......."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina almost said that
Emma might be the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;, but then she held her tongue in a
panic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The frighteningly
cautious Jin would surely not ignore it and decide to take measures.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without a doubt, Nina
would be assigned to find out more information about Emma, and the friendship
that had existed so far would collapse.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina realized the true
nature of what she feared.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was about her own
sins.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen, Casper, and
Emma. If one of them were the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;, it meant that the other
two had approached Nina with pure intentions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">And now, I am inevitably betraying someone else's good
intentions.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is what it means
to deceive people.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is the karma that
a fraudster equally has to bear.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once she became aware
of such a fact, she could no longer do anything but switch to another topic of
conversation.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... I just
passed that detective guy. What were you commissioning him to do?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aa~, I asked him
to run a few errands for me."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Another one of
those [I-can't-tell-you-about] kind of things?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina breathed a sigh
of relief when Jin gave her an affirmation with a wry smile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She felt relieved that
her agitation was not noticed. If he were to find out that she was tormented by
guilt and couldn't even find a simple reason for being here, it would make her
accomplice uneasy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"As you're
probably aware, Nina, the other party is now taking a full-blown [punish anyone
suspected of being guilty] stance. It's impossible to leisurely gain their
trust and extract information from them now."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So what do we
do?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Drag the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; into the chaos."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Tapping his schematic
paper covered with photos and sticky notes, Jin went on.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"First, we're
going to ask Karen and Casper to fight a three-way duel, and tell them both
that we'll cooperate with them when the game begins."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Karen sees
Casper as an enemy, which is good, ...... but can we convince Casper to
cooperate?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If anything, he seemed
to want to avoid a fight against Karen.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No matter how much
Nina assured him that she would help, it was unlikely that he would sign the
pledge.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's okay,"
Jin answered immediately. "Actually, he's challenged me to a &lt;duel&gt;,
and I've been on the run for a while now. I think if I accept it under the
condition of us working together to take Karen down, he'll most likely get on
board."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What is
your purpose of having them fight each other?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll let you
know after the &lt;duel&gt; is concluded. There's one piece of the puzzle
that's yet to come together."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina couldn't read his
true intentions, but this accomplice of hers had a look of confidence in his
eyes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This expression.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Whenever Nina saw this
expression, which did not doubt his victory and even welcomed the looming
danger, she felt as if she could bet everything on him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Perhaps that is the
proof of his talent as a fraudster.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is too dazzling for
her, who is just trapped in a cage of guilt.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll be in
charge of convincing Casper. Nina, you go talk to Karen."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Yeah, I'll
try my best."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The message on the
blackboard, the scar on Emma's right hand - no matter how much she thought
about these uncertainties, it was no use.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All she has to do now
is visit Karen and persuade her as instructed. It's a simple job that anyone
can do.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's gonna be
okay</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">, she found herself appeasing herself more than necessary.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nevertheless, the
reality that she had no choice but to move forward made Nina feel as if her
chest were about to tighten.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Two bags of tea
leaves from Agilyl-san. I will also select some tea snacks for you. As for
other daily necessities, we were out of toothbrushes and soaps, so I'll stock
up on those as well."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">It was always
a series of idle conversations that came to mind.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">When was the
last time this memory surfaced?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">It was
probably about a week ago, around the time I formed an alliance with Nina
Stingray.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That reminds me,
we're running out of perfume as well."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We have already
arranged for a shipping company to deliver it. &lt;Aerys No. 6&gt;, is that
correct?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Fufu, as
expected of Satya."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Also, the hem of
your nightgown is a little frayed, so I've had a craftsman make you a new
one."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... It's
getting a little scary now."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen's cheeks relaxed
as she looked at Satya, who reported with the same blank expression as ever.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Rodel family,
where Satya was born, has been in the service of Karen's family for about four
generations.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The Ashby family, who
run a weapons manufacturer whose biggest customers are the imperial army, are
very busy. Naturally, the staff working at the mansion are also expected to
work to the highest standards. Satya and Karen have been together since
childhood, and other than her bad habit of developing creative teas that make
people's taste buds go crazy, she is a perfect maid with impeccable standards.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was thanks to
Satya's devoted support that Karen was able to spend her time training for her
psychic abilities and engaging in battles. Satya's presence was essential for
Karen to become a member of the &lt;White Knights&gt; and to continue to devote
herself to the glory of the empire.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, it is impossible
to evaluate her existence in such a casual manner.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For Karen, Satya was the
first best friend she had ever had, a confidante to whom she could expose her
weaknesses that she usually hid, and an irreplaceable existence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In her memories, Satya
has always been expressionless, but her features are framed by a soft light.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">But then, she
was attacked by someone.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was only in the
afternoon that Karen noticed something unusual.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At lunchtime, Karen
usually went to the cafeteria with Satya. Today, however, Satya rushed to the
dormitory, saying that she had been asked to do some work by the main family.
Satya did occasionally receive work from the main family through phone calls,
so Karen did not harbor any suspicion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Satya did not
return to the classroom after the lunch break.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At first, she thought
she might be having trouble with her work, but by the time two hours had
passed, her doubts had turned to frustration.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Something happened to her.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Judging this to be the
case, Karen ran out of the classroom and headed for the girls' dormitory.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To deny the bad
premonition, she ran, gasping for breath.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She entered the
dormitory by slamming her body against the heavy door, and crossed the deserted
entrance to the second floor. When she opened the door to her room, Satya would
be there, and she would say, "What's the matter?" with her usual
expressionless face. Believing in such a boring and mundane outcome, she kept
on running. However, the outcome was not what she had expected.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen saw Satya's
disfigured figure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The bruises on her
entire body looked extremely painful.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had bruises in
various places, and her forehead was lacerated and dripping with blood. Her
left arm was the most severely damaged, with the joint at the elbow twisted far
beyond its normal range of motion. A bone protruded from the reddened arm,
though Karen hoped it was all just some kind of joke.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Satya! Are you
okay!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She assumed the worst,
but fortunately, Satya was still breathing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her injuries were
severe, but they were mainly fractures and bruises, so there was little danger
of blood loss and death. Nevertheless, there was still a possibility that her
internal organs might be damaged, so she had to be taken to the infirmary as
soon as possible.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After calling the
doctor stationed at the school from the phone in her room, Karen calmly
pondered,</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Who in the
world could have done this?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Was it the
work of someone with a grudge against me?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Could it be a
group of rats who have infiltrated the school?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">If so, why target Satya?</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Satya, don't
worry. I'll definitely kill the fool who hurt you."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then a knock was heard
on the door behind her. She explained the situation to the doctors who came in
with a stretcher and watched as first aid was administered. After watching her
being carried out of the dormitory, Karen finally gave up trying to control her
anger.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◇</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Is this situation really part of Jin's plan?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, it could not be.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This was definitely a
miscalculation, and the plan Jin had in mind went down the drain.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> </span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When Nina opened the
door to the first girls' dormitory building to persuade Karen, her eyes were
met with visions that were completely out of the ordinary.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What in the
world is happening here ......?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's questions were
mercilessly drowned out by the screams of the students as they fled outdoors.
She bumped shoulders with one of the students, but she ran off without looking
back.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The students who live
here must have heard of Nina's notoriety. However, this was probably of little
importance in the face of the horror that lay before them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As far as the eye
could see, there was a majestic scene of destruction.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A swarm of beautiful
crystals, multiplying at a tremendous rate, was about to fill the inside of the
girls' dormitory.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina caught the girl
with a cut on her cheek and asked her what was going on.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Can't you tell
by looking at this!? Karen Ashby is running amok!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I would like to
know the reason."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"There was a girl
named Satya who hung around with her, wasn't there? That girl was attacked and
is unconscious. Karen said she's going to keep on rampaging until the culprit
comes forward! She's totally losing her mind!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank you. I
understand the gist of it."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What are you
planning to do!? Don't tell me, it was you who-......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She felt she was being
terribly misunderstood, but she didn't seem to have the time to explain
herself.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A figure was
approaching from behind the cluster of shiny weapons.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The girl who had told
Nina what happened screamed and fled, and before she knew it, the dormitory was
empty except for her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina Stingray.
Why are you here?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen's pupils were
completely dilated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was not using any
of the breathing techniques she had trained in the dojo.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had no intention
of controlling her abilities, so it was only natural that she didn't need to
control them.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yesterday, I got
a message from Satya-san. She said you wanted to see me after school
today."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, there was
something like that, huh? Just forget about it."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even as she spoke so,
the crystals kept multiplying, destroying the chairs and tables placed at the
entrance.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even so, the shining
torrent of light kept growing.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At this rate, it would
eventually break through the walls and even the ceiling.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I have a few
guesses as to who the culprit might be."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What are you
talking about? Let's talk about this situation first......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Satya was
attacked head-on. There was no sign that the lock to my room was broken. The
only thing I can think of is that Satya opened the lock herself and invited the
perpetrator in. If that's the case, that narrows down the suspects, doesn't
it?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... It was
someone she knew."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I hate to say
it, but there aren't many people who know her. Satya was always with me. As far
as I know, there are only a handful of people."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why don't you
calm down first? We can wait until Satya-san regains consciousness......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm telling you,
you're the most suspicious of all."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The killing intent
emanating from Karen pushed aside the atmosphere and approached Nina.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Even if it were
someone she was acquainted with, she would be wary of anyone who would visit my
room during lunch break. Satya is not that dumb. ...... but what about if it
were someone I had promised to meet after school? That person can make up any
number of excuses, like being on the wrong time or something."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even in the midst of
her rage, Karen seemed to be able to maintain a rational train of thought.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, perhaps she
remained calm and simply used her hatred and madness as a card to play in order
to hunt down her opponents.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Either way, though, it
was clear that Karen misunderstood something.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Of course, Nina had no
recollection of ever attacking Satya, and Jin would not be the type to do such
a thing. He had never met Satya, either. The person who attacked Satya was
probably a third party that Nina did not know</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">no, there was only one
person who could have attacked Satya.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Someone who knew Satya
and could make up an excuse to meet her during lunch break.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had received a
dropped item from Satya at that time. It was something so important that she
should never have dropped it, because it was necessary for the activation of
her psychic ability. A paper bag containing lollipops.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If she knocked on the
door, saying that she wanted to thank her for that time, Satya would likely
comply, right?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Could it be, that Emma
Licorice is the one who attacked her?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">But if so, for what
purpose</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's that look
on your face? Are you upset?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... It's
nothing like that."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was so
unintentional that she couldn't control her expression.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen was no longer
willing to accept any excuses and had already determined that Nina was the
culprit. No, she probably doesn't even care if it's true or false.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">If she could unleash her seething hatred on anyone,
she would do so.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen's dilated pupils
were certainly screaming so.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Our alliance is
over, Stingray. As for beating up Casper, ...... ha~, I can't believe I've been
distracted by that idiot for so long, I still have a lot to learn."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What am I
supposed to do?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Should I try
to intimidate her with my usual act?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No, Karen has already made up her mind to fight.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Should I try
to buy some time by proposing to settle the matter in a &lt;duel&gt;?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No, Karen does not want such a peaceful solution.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">She wants to
keep fighting until one of us is dead.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's the
matter, Stingray? Activate your psychic abilities."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Are you
sure? There'll be casualties, you know."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's what I
want."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen stuck her palm
out toward Nina.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In response, the
crystals that had spread across the entrance moved and surrounded Nina, who was
standing in the center of the room. Numerous sharp blades protruded from the shifting
crystals, making it look as if a huge, bloodthirsty monster was about to devour
her to death.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was over, she
thought.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was nothing she
could do now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a foolish idea
to try trapping such a monster in the first place. No half-baked trickery would
work against an overwhelmingly powerful monster who could play the
"rampage" or "out-of-control" card at any time.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The crystals, shining
in seven colors by refracting the light, became huge jaws and approached from
both sides.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What would happen in
the next few seconds was obvious.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Whether she would be
crushed to death or die of blood loss, she did not know what the cause of her
death would be. But it would only take a fraction of a second for the answer to
become clear. Once she turned into a bloody mass of flesh, all that remained
was to be locked up in a beautiful coffin.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This must be retribution.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Isn't this a
fitting end for a fraudster who has been deceiving people without regard?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina gently closed her
eyes as she was engulfed by the deadly and beautiful weapons.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"............
Huh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although Nina should
be completely prepared to die, she hasn't been crushed by the crystals yet.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nor does she feel any
pain.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instead, she was
immersed in a feeling of levitation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The moment she opened
her eyes, Nina realized she was flying through the air.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, eehh!?
What's going on ......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't flail
around."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A low, electronically
processed voice could be heard in her ear. It was the person in the black coat
who had attacked Nina and Jin yesterday.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The situation was
finally becoming clear.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who was nearly
eaten alive by the crystalline jaws, succeeded in escaping from the dormitory,
carried by this person who had jumped in through the window.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Her mask obscures her
true face, but her true identity is most likely</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Emma?
You're Emma, right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Be quiet."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I suspected you
....... I'm so sorry."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"As I said, be
quiet."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, why are you
dressed like that ......?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No answer was given.
Holding Nina with both hands, she jumped from one building roof to another
without uttering a word.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two of them
reached the front of the gym warehouse as they kept moving across the grounds
at an inhumanly fast speed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Wondering how she knew
of this place, Nina quickly came up with an answer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she recalled, this
was the place that Bennett had originally used as a venue for his tournament.
Jin had said that he happened to run into Emma when he was doing
reconnaissance, so it was no surprise that she would choose it as a place to
hide.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Was it really a coincidence that she ran into Jin in
the first place?</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Enter."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Told by a voice mixed
with noises, Nina complied obediently.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The mechanism is
designed so that if one doesn't follow the procedure of inserting the master
key and turning it twice to the right and again to the left, a warning light
will shine in the attic, but Jin is probably at Casper's place anyway. Besides,
it would be unnatural to worry about such things now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Locking the warehouse
door from the inside, the hooded person slowly removed her hood and mask.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had orange
short-cut hair, dark green eyes, a lollipop, and a moderately toned figure. The
girl in front of Nina was definitely Emma Licorice.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Umm ......
thanks, Emma."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Have you given
up your usual, annoying, polite tone already?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Eh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her vision perceived
the girl in front of her as a friend she had been with for a while, but the
tone of voice that shot through her eardrums and the aura of rejection
emanating from the girl's entire body negated her naive thoughts..</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Who is this person?</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, we both
hid our true identities from each other. No hard feelings."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"H-Hey, what are
you talking about? You just saved my life, didn't you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Do you really
think so?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A muzzle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A foreign object that
is so out of place in school life is being pointed at her right now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She is glued to the
abyss where not even light escapes, and she can barely breathe. The pressure
emanating within the darkness of the .38 caliber was so overwhelming and vivid.
Surely it was not rigged to prevent bullets from being released.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry, Nina
Stingray."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without even giving
her a chance to question it, Emma pulled the trigger.</span></p>
