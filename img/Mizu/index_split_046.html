	<p class="block_12">Afternoon the day after the four people from Room 10 returned to the City of Rune after completing the request for Avery Village.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">Ryo ate curry with Sera at </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Houshoku-tei</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> for the first time in a long time.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">Then, Sera returned to the lord’s mansion while Ryo headed to </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Golden Wave Pavilion</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">(Abel still owes me a few favors. The one week’s worth of dinner that he promised in the dungeon… I haven’t even had him treat me once. Oh yeah, I didn’t freeze that Fire Magician in ice for Abel’s sake. Yeah, I have to get him to help with this!)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The time was 2:00 pm.</p>
	<p class="block_12">The people who had lunch at the Golden Wave Pavilion were almost all gone.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Meanwhile, a B-rank Swordsman was sitting on a chair in the dining room reading a book.</p>
	<p class="block_10">It was a very convenient development since Ryo was thinking he had to ask the reception to call him.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Abel, I came to get back what you owe me.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Hmm? Ryo? Don’t surprise me. I mean, what do you mean… Did I borrow something?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“In the dungeon, you promised me dinner for about a week.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“!”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel seemed to have forgotten.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“O-o-o-of course I didn’t forget. I just lost the timing to invite you because Ryo seemed to be busy. It’s true.”</p>
	
		<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/00014.jpeg">
	
	<p class="block_12">“Hah…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Upon hearing Abel’s excuse, Ryo deliberately sighed.</p>
	<p class="block_10">And then, he sat opposite Abel.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I would like you to help me with something instead of a week’s dinner.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Eh… what’s that? I have a feeling it will be more difficult than dinner…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel asked about Ryo’s offer with a sense of fear.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“Actually, my roommates Niels and Etho are about to leave the dormitory soon since 300 days have passed since they registered as adventurers. It seemed that they decided to buy a house and Amon would be staying with them too. So, I also decided to leave the dormitory and get a place of my own…”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“You don’t wish to live with the other three?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeah. I want to do a lot of magic and alchemy experiments, so I want to live in a house with a large garden.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Hmm, how much money did you get for those magic stones again?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel asked as he remembered after Ryo spoke about getting a house.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“When I checked this morning, there was an amount that appeared to indicate that another one was sold.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I see. One of them was bought by the lord’s mansion right away, so maybe it was sold somewhere else… Gilmas is really good at it.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel nodded many times.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“That’s why I came today intending to have Abel help me find a house.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“I see. If that’s the case, leave it to me.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">After all, Abel was the face in the City of Rune.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Not to mention his overwhelming popularity among adventurers, he was well known to the people of the city as one of the few B-rank adventurers.</p>
	<p class="block_10">If he had the support of such a person, he wouldn’t be fooled, and he thought that the real estate agent that Abel introduced would be reliable.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Lands and buildings are also handled by the Adventurer’s Guild, you know?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It seemed that the Adventurer’s Guild also had a real estate department…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">In the end, the two of them traveled to the Adventurer’s Guild.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I didn’t expect it to be handled by the guild…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Apparently there are even properties that the guild handles exclusively. Well, the reality is that adventurers often buy or rent vacant homes. Perhaps it is related to the fact that only new adventurers can stay in the dormitory for up to 300 days.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Underhanded! The higher-ups are underhanded!”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo shook his head many times to Abel’s possible reasoning.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ah, but like Abel and others, there are parties that stay at inns without renting or buying.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Stay… We’re paying regular fees to stay there too. Well, I don’t want to say it like this but we can do so because we have reasonably high rewards as B-ranks.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">It was like the presidents who lived on the top floor of luxury hotels in modern Earth…</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo thought to himself.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">If the inn did all the cleaning and washing, and if you could order drinks and light meals and have them brought to your room immediately… you could certainly lead a comfortable life.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">As long as you have money!</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“If Ryo also lives in an inn… oh right, you said you needed a house with a large garden because of your experiments…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes. As a standard in such cases, if you spend a certain amount of money, you can buy an old aristocratic mansion or a cursed aristocratic mansion at a bargain price… I think there should be such a development.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“What are you talking about… standard or development…”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo’s expectations for a light novel-like development seemed to be unfamiliar to Abel.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Well, of course.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo, this is hard to say, but I don’t think that’s possible…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Huh?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’m sorry. Even with Abel-san’s introduction, aristocratic mansions can only be purchased by those with aristocratic rank.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Eh……”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Well, that’s how it is.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Replate, the head of the Adventurer’s Guild real estate department, responded but… Ryo was tragically struck by reality.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Then, my large garden…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“No, it’s not even yours yet. Replate-san, for the house that Ryo needs, he just wants a large garden no matter what. To experiment with magic and alchemy. He’s rich so any price is okay to a certain extent.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo wondered if it was necessary to say that much and that would he be taken advantage of.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Abel, that’s…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“It’s okay. Replate-san is the most proper employee in the guild. If you give him all the necessary information, he will find a property that really suits you.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It seemed that the department head, Replate, was enthusiastic after he was praised so much by the popular Abel.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">He nodded happily and said.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I see. But… there aren’t any properties I have that meet Ryo-san’s requirements… How about waiting for a day? I will visit the real estate agents in the city to gather properties that haven’t been gathered here or new properties. Why don’t you come again tomorrow afternoon?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">The face of the department manager, Replate, was the face of a man who took pride in his work.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Facing the request of a man with such an expression, Ryo could not refuse.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Okay, thank you then.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Three o’clock… It’s still a little early to have Abel treat me for dinner.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“You’re choosing the activity on the premise that I’m going to treat huh… I recall you said that we would be even because I’m helping to find a house…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Even though I didn’t kill that Explosive Blaze Magician on the shores of Whitnash for Abel’s sake… Now you nitpick on lending and borrowing…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Ah, ah, okay. That’s right, thank you for that time. Look, I’ll treat you to an afternoon snack, so we can go to whichever store you like.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">With a half-resigned expression, Abel said to Ryo.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Even if you say that… I don’t know of any delicious afternoon snacks. Do you know somewhere good?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“In that case, there is a delicious cake and coffee shop right there. Should we go there?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Coffee!?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">That was Ryo’s first time hearing the word </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Coffee</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> since he came to </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Phi</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">No, of course, he heard of </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Coffee Maker</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">but…</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo knows about coffee?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“It’s the drink that’s black like the devil, hot like hell, pure like an angel, and sweet like love, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“There were a lot of words I didn’t understand, but I guess that’s it. It’s a black drink.”</p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">Ryo was overwhelmed emotionally by the reality that Talleyrand’s famous words became </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">black drink</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">” when it was applied to Abel.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“This menu…”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The store where the two of them entered was “Cafe de Chocolat Rune”.</p>
	<p class="block_12">However, even though the store name had chocolate in it, there were no cakes made with chocolate.</p>
	<p class="block_10">There weren’t but…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Mont Blanc, strawberry shortcake, Rindo tart…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’ll have a Mont Blanc. As for coffee, I’ll have Blue Mountain.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Coffee too… Blue Mountain? Kilimanjaro? Mandheling…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">(What is this déjà vu… This is not the level achievable with just reincarnated people…)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Have you decided?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">A lovely lady came to ask for their orders.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’ll have a set of Mont Blanc and Blue Mountain.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I-I’ll… have strawberry shortcake and Kona.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">After hearing their orders, the lady left.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo knows about cake too? I don’t imagine the Rondo Forest having them…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Because my hometown had them…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“I see……”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The cake and Kona coffee that came out were very delicious.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Even if this café was opened in modern Japan, it wouldn’t be a problem because it was recreated so perfectly.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">However, the Kona coffee wasn’t the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Hawaiian Kona</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> that he used to drink when he was on Earth.</span></p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo concluded that the coffee was just given an arbitrary name.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">However, the taste was…</p>
	<p class="block_12">“It’s amazingly delicious…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Isn’t it? It’s just a stone’s throw from the guild, but it’s delicious here.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Absolutely, did Rihya bring you here?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Cough.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It seemed that it was a bull’s-eye.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Well, it’s delicious, so it’s okay.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo should also come for a date. With Sera.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">He sounded like he was trying to dig up something.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“My relationship with Sera is not like that.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“When did you stop addressing her with -san…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“She heard that I don’t do so for Abel, so she requested I do that for her too… It was an unavoidable compromise.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then Ryo shook his head a little.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Sera mentioned Ryo’s teacher but… how are the two of you acquainted in the first place? You didn’t have any contact with her. Sera doesn’t even show up in the guild, and she’s the instructor of the Knights……”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“She taught me various things in the North Library.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“I see, the library huh?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo’s explanation finally resolved Abel’s long-standing question.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Actually, it was only about a week.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Also, recently we’ve been training with swords, such as before her training with the Knights.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Mock battle with Sera using swords…?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes. She’s insanely strong. I lost all matches.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo laughed casually.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">It was proof that he had not yet approached the level of regretting his losses.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo felt that there was such an overwhelming difference in strength.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">“Her </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Wind Equip</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> is amazing. Sera’s wind magic is perfect. It raises all her speeds. Her original sword technique was already superb, and with the added speed and weight from </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Wind Equip</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">, it’s horribly troublesome.”</span></p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">“Sera, uses </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Wind Equip</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">?”</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeah. That’s what I said. Abel, you have to listen to people properly, okay?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then Ryo drank the remaining coffee.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">(No no, fighting Sera when she’s using </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Wind Equip</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">, he must be mistaken… I am barely equal with her when she’s not using </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Wind Equip</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">… No, can I even fight her evenly without it? Honestly, I’m not confident… Ryo is supposed to be a Magician, but why is he honing his sword skills so much… what is he aiming for…)</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">What he’s aiming for… Ryo himself probably didn’t know…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The two had another serving of the cake set.</p>
	<p class="block_12">For adventurer men which was a physically-demanding job, one cake set was not enough.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Well, that said, the idea of filling the stomach with a cake set was wrong.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“In the first place, I didn’t know that there was such a store near the guild.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“This is… I think it was last year that a store opened in the City of Rune. It’s a long-established cafe in the royal capital. If I recall correctly, it had a history of about 40 years…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel replied, remembering.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">(No matter how I think about it, this cake and coffee set is definitely the idea of a reincarnated person… If the reproduction of the taste is perfect, the person didn’t only input the idea but was also involved in manufacturing… Did they come to </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Phi</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">20 years before me? No, that’s not the case, because when Michael (pseudonym) greeted me in that white world, he said ‘It’s been a long time since I had a visitor’. Would he consider 20 years as ‘a long time’? he was an angel-like existence after all.)</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">No matter how much he thought about it, Ryo couldn’t find a consistent answer.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">And the next question from Abel cut off his thoughts on the reincarnated.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo, about the incident at Whitnash…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“You tried to kill the Empire’s Oscar, the Explosive Blaze Magician. If Ryo actually followed through, he would have been killed. How serious were you?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Oh… well it was tit-for-tat, isn’t it? Does Abel think there was such a huge gap between me and him?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo replied while eating the last piece of the second cake.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Finally, he called Oscar ‘him’.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeah, it seemed that way.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“But in fact, I don’t think there was that much of a difference. At that time, he was in a state of attack and I was defending, so it may have seemed that there was a difference in power as I intercepted everything…… but I think that even if I was in the opposite position and attacked while he defended, I don’t think I could easily break through his defense.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo replied, remembering that time.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Water magic was good for defense.</p>
	<p class="block_12">He even thought that Ice Wall must be the strongest and hardest defensive magic.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Of course, it was still sometimes broken.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“And it’s also related to my attribute being water and his attribute being fire. Doesn’t water extinguish fire? Any fire can be extinguished with a lot of water. It was probably an issue of affinity.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo continued as he remembered.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“As for magic generation speed or construction speed… that guy was surprisingly fast, right? That’s why I think it’s highly likely that even if I launched an attack, he could intercept it.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Why did you continue to taunt him then?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I must have been upset. My mood was probably elevated because of the festival.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then, Ryo finished his second cup of coffee.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeah, I came to understand that Ryo is a dangerous guy.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Compared to Abel, I still have much to learn…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Why’s my name dragged into this!”</p>
	</body></html>
