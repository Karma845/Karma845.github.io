<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 2: Things I Dislike: Cheating, Thieving Cats </h2>

<p>It&#8217;s July, and the heat is becoming more intense. Messages from my ex, which used to carry some meaning, have now turned into complaints about the temperature, like &#8220;It&#8217;s so hot&#8221; and &#8220;Its really hot~.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even with the windows closed at school, the sound of cicadas can be heard, making it feel instantly like summer.</p>
<p>As summer vacation approaches, I see students discussing their summer plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;But before that, we have final exams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing such conversations motivates me too. This will be my first time dealing with final exams.</p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been spending my days after class with Kurei-san, working on creating questions while making sure they are confirmed.</p>
<p>Finding the line between too hard and too easy is surprisingly difficult.</p>


<p>Creating questions that all students can understand without misunderstanding the examiner&#8217;s intention proved to be unexpectedly challenging.</p>
<p>I draft all the questions first, and Kurei-san checks them.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s the fourth draft, and she&#8217;s reviewing it in the staff room after school.</p>
<p>&#8220;How does it look?&#8221;</p>
<p>Since there was no immediate reaction, I cautiously asked.</p>
<p>Lifting her gaze, Kurei-san smiled softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it&#8217;s good. You&#8217;ve worked hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, I let out a sigh&#8230;</p>
<p>Not of joy, but of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh dear. Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes. I&#8217;m relieved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really put a lot of effort into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san smiled happily too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei is so earnest. I wonder if you felt a lot of pressure because of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s my first time dealing with final exams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;During the midterms, I was the one making them, and you were just watching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps because we&#8217;ve been talking more day by day, the distance between Kurei-san and me seems to have slightly narrowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for all the trouble, and thank you very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t mention it. For a first attempt, this is excellent. Normally, to create exam questions, you&#8217;d have to solve several textbooks for the subject matter. The fact that you managed without having to do that shows you&#8217;ve been studying hard up until now. You did struggle with the scoring and balancing the quantity and quality of questions, but really, it&#8217;s very well done.&#8221;</p>
<p>While being praised, the printed drafts were handed back to me. Now, all that&#8217;s left is to print enough copies for the students before the exam.</p>
<p>I had started working on it early, but in the end, it was a rush against the deadline.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve worked hard, so ideally, you&#8217;d rest this weekend&#8230; But&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I know. I have various other tasks piling up&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the final exams, there&#8217;s the grading of the practical tests to be done. The notebooks submitted by the students (mostly loose leaf, though) are almost untouched.</p>
<p>Of course, there are also things that need to be done by Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s already later than usual. Maybe take it home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, at least take it easy tonight. I&#8217;ll stay a bit longer and finish up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>After exchanging goodbyes, I left the staff room.</p>
<p>Stepping out of the school and getting on the bus, I tapped on my smartphone.</p>
<p>There were messages from Kirihara and my ex. My ex sent a message with a picture, asking, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to the pool with my boyfriend tomorrow, which swimsuit looks better?&#8221; I replied casually and then focused on Kirihara&#8217;s message.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about dinner today? Should I order something? Or can you come over to my place?&#8221;</p>
<p>The message was sent about an hour ago.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, just finished. I&#8217;d rather not cook, if that&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>I sent the message, then sighed, looking up at the bus ceiling.</p>
<p>A reply came back immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it. Then, how about pizza? Is one L-size enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pizza. I haven&#8217;t had it in a while, so I&#8217;m quite welcome to the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;That should be enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Okay. Sorry to trouble you, but could you buy some soda? Pizza and soda are a must!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Agreed!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yayyyyy!&#8221;</p>
<p>The last message included a sticker of the mascot from the online game we play together, dancing wildly.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but smile, despite being tired.</p>
<p>Once again, I thought about something I&#8217;ve thought about many times before.</p>
<p>If only Kirihara wasn&#8217;t a student, there wouldn&#8217;t be any problem at all.</p>
<p>She might have been the ideal girlfriend.</p>
<p>After all, since I started visiting her on weekends regularly, I hardly have any unpleasant memories.</p>
<p>When I arrived home, there was a freshly delivered pizza on the dining table.</p>
<p>Glasses filled with ice were also prepared. Kirihara, who came to greet me, sat on a chair, swinging her legs lightly like a little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pizza pizza, pizzza♪&#8221;</p>

<p>After singing cheerfully, she suddenly switched to a serious expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, let us proceed with the opening ceremony. Prepare yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>With words like those from a game&#8217;s opening, she opened the pizza box for us.</p>
<p>A classic piece topped generously with cheese, tomato, and salami.</p>
<p>We clapped our hands in unison.</p>
<p>Pouring the soda I bought into glasses, we put our hands together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>We devoured the first few slices as if we were ravenous.</p>
<p>In the latter half, we took our time, enjoying each bite while sipping our juice.</p>
<p>&#8220;The blatant violence of calories&#8230; Yet, so delicious. Why is pizza so good?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s bad for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a healthy statement from a teacher.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Am I being praised?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. You&#8217;re the man who taught me the taste of home cooking.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t supposed to be anything grand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Junk food like this tastes good precisely because it&#8217;s occasional.&#8221;</p>
<p>With some small talk in between, we neatly split the L-size pizza in half and put it in our stomachs.</p>
<p>Rubbing her belly, Kirihara smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall we play a game after a food break?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry&#8230; Actually, I brought some work home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, you did bring your bag.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t apologize. It&#8217;s inevitable. What kind of work is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Related to grading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see that. I&#8217;ll have to clear this table soon, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara stood up and disposed of the pizza trash.</p>
<p>Then, she moved to the room where we usually play games and spread out a kotatsu that had been folded and placed in the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to eat something else there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I thought I&#8217;d study a bit too. Finals are coming up. If I play games near you, I&#8217;ll just distract you from your work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite everything, Kirihara knows when to be serious and reads the atmosphere well.</p>
<p>I brought my bag over and spread out textbooks and notebooks.</p>
<p>Though her posture looked serious, she was wearing her usual shorts and a camisole&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;And because she was facing me, I could see her cleavage.</p>
<p>No matter the situation, she&#8217;s nothing but a temptation. Absolutely outrageous.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230;? What?&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s one of those with sharp instincts.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just realized it&#8217;s the first time you&#8217;re studying in front of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was just a random topic I brought up to divert the conversation, but Kirihara nodded without suspicion.</p>
<p>&#8220;During the midterms, the scope wasn’t very wide, so yeah. For the finals, I figured I should at least do a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s so like an honor student to get by with just a little study.</p>
<p>Silently focusing on my work for a while, I occasionally found myself glancing at Kirihara.</p>
<p>She had a cushion spread out on the floor, but her posture changed every time I looked over, perhaps due to discomfort from maintaining the same position. She&#8217;d either collapse her legs, stretch them out, or lean forward.</p>


<p>Kirihara&#8217;s legs were toned but also soft at the same time. She really had beautiful legs.</p>
<p>&#8230;Come to think of it, I used to study like this with my ex-girlfriend during college. We were in the same faculty, so we&#8217;d exchange notes and when bored, tease each other and maybe share a kiss.</p>
<p>Such nostalgic memories.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? You keep peeking, are you frustrated?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Just reminiscing about the past.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About your ex?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;How did you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You told me a bit about her when we talked on the phone, remember? From your college days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yup. You were drinking then. You always forget things when you drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only when I drink too much. I don&#8217;t get drunk off one or two drinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re weak then.&#8221;</p>

<p>Laughing, Kirihara continued to fervently copy her notes onto a blank loose leaf. It seems she&#8217;s the type to learn by writing.</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze back to my work and resumed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei, when you said you were making the final exam questions, did you do that alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not. It&#8217;d be impossible for a newbie to do it alone. Kurei-san has been helping me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurei-sensei, huh? She&#8217;s super popular with the guys. They say she looks like she&#8217;d be really sexy&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t just make things up&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is your assessment about her different?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a colleague at work. I&#8217;ve never looked at her that way. Though I guess she would stand out if she dressed up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or so you say, but aren&#8217;t you always nervous around her? Just the two of you in the staff room&#8230; Ah, no, Kouhai-kun! Like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Not even a little bit of hope? Not even once? Never thought about what it would be like to be lovers with such a senior?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;Well, to say not at all would be a lie.</p>
<p>&#8220;How boring.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t said teasingly, but rather with genuine disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara, you&#8217;re quiet at school but surprisingly romantic, huh? You like love stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&#8217;d see signs of her watching love dramas or reading romance manga.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because, when it comes down to it, conversations between a man and a woman often lead to that, right? Whether it&#8217;s at school or work, that doesn&#8217;t change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the company I quit, there were seniors who ended up marrying after an office romance. Now that I think about it, my ex&#8217;s current boyfriend was also a colleague.</p>
<p>&#8220;In college, when guys and girls got together, they often ended up in such relationships.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the prime time for wanting to hook up, right? Did you have your share?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, somewhat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gross.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one who brought it up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even as we joked, the work progressed.</p>
<p>It seems we both concentrate better on our tasks when exchanging casual conversations.</p>
<p>&#8220;You might not make moves on me, but you have your own history, huh, Sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that supposed to mean? Are you jealous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not really?&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling her gaze, I looked towards Kirihara.</p>
<p>She smiled satisfyingly, almost wickedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because right now, I&#8217;m almost entirely yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>I turned my attention back to my work, trying to focus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei, your face is a bit red.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was laughed at but ignored it.</p>
<p>&#8230;She really is troublesome.</p>
<p>●●●</p>
<p>As expected when I barely made the deadline for the exam questions, the period for the final exams came in no time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Creating them is tough, but once the exams start, having no classes makes things a bit easier,&#8221; Kurei-san said, and I found that to be true.</p>
<p>At first, I was nervous about whether there were any mistakes in the questions&#8230; but as the exams proceeded without any questions or complaints from the students, I felt relieved.</p>
<p>There were no comments about the exams being too difficult or too easy.</p>
<p>It seems everyone thought Kurei-san made the questions for this exam. Kirihara was the only student who knew I had made them.</p>
<p>&#8230;I secretly asked for her feedback.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was just normal? The questions were usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before I finished typing my response, Kirihara sent several messages in a row.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means Sensei did a great job. Well done.&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little happy.</p>
<p>When I graded the returned answer sheets, the average score was almost the same as the midterm&#8217;s. Kirihara&#8217;s feedback was correct.</p>
<p>By the way, Kirihara&#8217;s score, despite supposedly not studying much, was near perfect. Just like during the midterms.</p>
<p>As expected the honor student, I thought.</p>
<p>Not just in studies, but Kirihara is smart overall.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s even better at games than I am, and whenever there&#8217;s new content or an update, she quickly finds the correct approach. She solves game levels even before strategies begin circulating online.</p>
<p>Not only is she good at studies, but she&#8217;s also favored by other teachers. Kirihara, unlike me, will likely live a future without making mistakes.</p>
<p>&#8230;So why is she so fixated on someone like me?</p>
<p>&#8220;─sei, Hajima-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was snapped back to reality by a somewhat stern call, and turned to see Kurei-san looking at me worriedly next to my seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you okay? Lost in thought again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had gotten lost in thought while grading the exams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hear what I said?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230;sorry, what was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about tomorrow&#8217;s drinking party. Can you make it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The final exams ended today. And tomorrow is the much-awaited Friday.</p>
<p>Although there are still exams to grade, a break was in order, and I had been invited to the drinking party several days in advance. I heard that almost everyone plans to attend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I plan to participate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good. After all, Hajima-sensei, you&#8217;re the guest of honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard that this drinking party would also serve as my welcome party. I couldn&#8217;t miss it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei, do you drink a lot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like drinking, but I&#8217;m quite a lightweight&#8230; but I don&#8217;t get drunk off one or two drinks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a bit disappointing. You like it but can&#8217;t handle much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about you, Kurei-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll see on the day. It&#8217;ll be fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;This means she probably drinks quite a bit.</p>
<p>Seeing her smirk confidently, I had that gut feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, they&#8217;re collecting fees for the day in advance, right?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to pay, Hajima-sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Is that okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, you&#8217;re the guest of honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is that really okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. You&#8217;ve worked hard this semester, so please enjoy without worrying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I really did well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It feels like I mostly just troubled Kurei-san for help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither the principal nor I praise someone who hasn&#8217;t worked hard, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>The mention of the principal&#8217;s name probably comes from the meeting involving Kurei-san and me the other day.</p>
<p>──You&#8217;ve worked hard this semester.</p>
<p>──We&#8217;re grateful you&#8217;ve been here without taking any days off. You did well.</p>
<p>──Your responsibilities will gradually increase, but let&#8217;s keep working hard.</p>


<p>That was the gist of the conversation.</p>
<p>Kurei-san also mentioned, &#8220;You managed to create the exam questions properly, and there were no issues with how you conducted your classes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Being humble is important, but being too humble can be troublesome for those around you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll be careful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hehe. Whether praised or not, the next challenges will come soon anyway. In fact, it feels like you&#8217;re already facing them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You mean managing the class, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the final exams started, a little problem had arisen in my class.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plan for the school presentation day isn&#8217;t decided yet, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>At Mori Kawara Academy, right after the summer vacation starts, there&#8217;s a presentation day for middle school students considering our school and their guardians.</p>
<p>The students also plan mock shops and events to liven up the presentation day. It&#8217;s somewhat like a cultural festival.</p>
<p>Each class receives a budget from the parents&#8217; association and uses it to do something. What they do is up to the students to decide.</p>
<p>&#8220;You still can&#8217;t get the opinions to come together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I really want to decide during tomorrow&#8217;s homeroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. Considering the preparations, tomorrow is the deadline.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t interfere, should I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Preferably not. If things get too messy, you might have to step in—but the students who didn&#8217;t have their opinions favored will be unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;Hmm, I scratched my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Make sure to decide within time so you can come to the drinking party feeling good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if we can&#8217;t decide?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been bad at resolving conflicts.</p>
<p>&#8230;It would be best if the students decided on their own.</p>
<p>●●●</p>
<p>The next day. All the final exams were finished.</p>
<p>Normally, classes would end at noon, but only my class was scheduled to stay in the afternoon for a homeroom session.</p>
<p>The agenda was what to do for the presentation day.</p>
<p>Opinions were split right down the middle.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, it&#8217;s gotta be a maid café,&#8221; argue a few boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, we should do something more reliable like a mock shop,&#8221; counter a few girls.</p>
<p>Both sides include members of the class’s top caste. The boys are led by Azuma. The girls, by Kasahara.</p>
<p>Students who don&#8217;t actively speak up just silently watch the debate unfold.</p>
<p>Thanks to several days of discussion, opinions have started to converge somewhat.</p>
<p>Initially, besides the maid café, there were suggestions like a haunted house or a dart bar causing a clutter.</p>
<p>After much debate, it was narrowed down to two options.</p>
<p>But they can&#8217;t seem to settle on one. Kasahara, representing the girls, passionately argues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are we going to do a maid café for the presentation day and then the same thing for the cultural festival? Won&#8217;t that get boring? Why not go with a standard mock shop this time? Though we won&#8217;t know which one until we draw lots.&#8221;</p>
<p>The school can provide equipment for takoyaki plates, yakisoba or okonomiyaki plates, and cotton candy machines.</p>
<p>All of them are relatively easy profit-makers as long as the cost of ingredients is managed.</p>

<p>Classes without their unique ideas almost always apply for mock shops.</p>
<p>And the profit from the summer presentation can add to the budget for the autumn cultural festival.</p>
<p>In essence, it&#8217;s possible to save up in the summer and go all out for the festival.</p>
<p>The girls opposing the summer maid café are focusing on this point.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there are people who do the same shop in summer to improve the quality for autumn, right?&#8221; argue the boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;You guys just want to see us in maid outfits, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; accuses Kasahara.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not it,&#8221; defends Azuma, the boys&#8217; representative.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, what do boys even do in a maid café? Dress up with us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That could be fun. It&#8217;d make for a good laugh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who would want to see that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ultimately, Azuma and Kasahara end up arguing, and the discussion hardly moves forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is a maid café even that interesting?&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion doesn&#8217;t progress but seems to regress.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s a café, you&#8217;re going to prepare tea and snacks, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just some random snacks and boxed juice are fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wearing clothes we don&#8217;t usually wear, serving whatever, and that&#8217;s it? Isn&#8217;t that just boring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we could set up a stage in front of the blackboard, sing songs or something&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>With no consensus in sight and the atmosphere turning sour&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m tired.</p>
<p>&#8230;I want to go home.</p>


<p>Everyone feels that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;So, what do you think, Sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pushed by the girls, Azuma seeks my help.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; I&#8217;d rather not interfere too much. We&#8217;re encouraged to let students decide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment I voiced my honest thoughts, I could feel the entire class cooling off.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the face of my former company&#8217;s boss flashed through my mind, and I tried to connect my words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since it&#8217;s not decided yet, that&#8217;s why you&#8217;re asking me, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Right, right, students nod here and there.</p>
<p>Both the heated debaters and those eager to leave turn their attention to me.</p>
<p>&#8230;What should I do?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s still a long way to go until the class shuffle. Having someone reliable during tough times makes work easier.</p>
<p>Is there a good plan&#8230;?</p>
<p>As I pondered, a certain person&#8217;s gesture caught my eye.</p>
<p>It was Kirihara.</p>
<p>While sending me an earnest gaze, she subtly pointed to herself as if trying not to be noticed by others, signaling, &#8220;Leave it to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Kirihara, what do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Following my words, all eyes turned to Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Kirihara? I mean, she&#8217;s the student council president, but still&#8230;&#8221;</p>


<p>Someone mumbled just loud enough to be heard.</p>
<p>Ignoring them, I continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s been just quietly listening, not only today but on other days as well. I&#8217;d like to hear her opinion. Can you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Kirihara replied with a clear voice.</p>
<p>Then, she slightly adjusted her glasses as if to compose herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we need to properly organize everyone&#8217;s opinions once more&#8230; I&#8217;d like to confirm with both the boys and the girls, but we&#8217;ve worked hard over the past few days to narrow it down to the maid café and the mock shop, right? There are quite a few people who want to try the maid café, aren&#8217;t there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara looked around the room from her seat.</p>
<p>No one voiced any objections. She then directed her gaze to Kasahara, the most vocal among the girls.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kasahara-san, you&#8217;re not against doing the maid café in autumn, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. But, I mean, we don&#8217;t have to do it in summer, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, it&#8217;s the issue of doing it consecutively in summer and autumn. And also, as discussed earlier, if we&#8217;re doing a café, we&#8217;d want to prepare properly, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. If it&#8217;s a food shop, we should serve something tasty, or it won&#8217;t be exciting, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I personally think that&#8217;s important. But preparing something authentic from now might be difficult. I was in the student council last year, so I know, running a café shop is pretty tough. There&#8217;s no refrigerator in the classroom, right? Though we could serve baked sweets, if we&#8217;re going to do handmade cakes, we need to think about how to keep them chilled. If we use the mock shops provided by the school, they already have the know-how, but if we run our own café, we have to submit a plan for hygiene. If we&#8217;re doing it in summer, we can&#8217;t overlook that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230;&#8221; someone sounded impressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;First off, my opinion, but if everyone agrees to do the maid café, focusing on fund-raising in summer and going full-scale in autumn would be best. This isn&#8217;t just supporting the girls; there are benefits for the boys too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara turned her gaze to Azuma.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember what Azuma-kun mentioned earlier? Setting up a stage in front of the blackboard and singing. That&#8217;s a pretty good idea. Doesn&#8217;t it sound fun? You could all wear maid outfits and play idols, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yeah. Right, that&#8217;s what I meant.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, you definitely weren&#8217;t thinking that, dude.</p>
<p>However, Kirihara continued without jesting, nodding.</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest advantage of postponing the maid café to autumn is getting time to develop ideas like this. We can discuss the shop&#8217;s food and how to liven up the interior. Deciding on what we want to do from now is a significant advantage. Keeping that in focus during the preparations will give meaning to the discussions we&#8217;ve had so far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That makes sense,&#8221; a boy&#8217;s voice chimed in.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like baking, so I want to come up with cupcake recipes,&#8221; a girl said excitedly.</p>
<p>The classroom atmosphere brightened instantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Wait, if we have the money, could we potentially go all out on the attire?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Azuma and Kasahara&#8217;s conversation was interrupted by another boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Maid outfits vary a lot in price. Just adding a little bit can make a huge difference.&#8221;</p>
<p>Azuma and Kasahara made subtly awkward faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Why do you know so much about that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oops, my bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>Laughter erupted.</p>

<p>Even the usually serious Kirihara was smiling.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;So, are we decided?&#8221;</p>

<p>When I asked, voices of agreement came from various corners, &#8220;Okay,&#8221; &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll submit the application for the mock shop. Whatever we end up selling, let&#8217;s aim to make a good profit for the autumn festival. I&#8217;ll attend the food hygiene course.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, we reached a consensus.</p>
<p>&#8220;Class Rep!&#8221;</p>
<p>The command for &#8220;Stand up&#8221; was given. After the bow, students started leaving in groups.</p>
<p>I could hear girls talking at the front.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so Kirihara-san, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s really dependable in times like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, &#8220;Kirihara-san in a pinch&#8221; is a well-known fact among those who know.</p>
<p>I heard about it from Kurei-san.</p>
<p>Normally not standing out, seemingly plain and often burdened with thankless tasks, why Kirihara was the student council president.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t simply thrust upon her. The president of Mori Kawara Academy&#8217;s student council is elected by the heads of cultural and sports clubs, so it&#8217;s a position that requires trust.</p>
<p>Kirihara uses her intelligence and ability to read the room to smoothly consolidate everyone&#8217;s opinions.</p>
<p>Even when opinions clash, she can neatly organize everyone&#8217;s thoughts and find a compromise that everyone can accept.</p>
<p>What just happened was probably an example of that.</p>
<p>To students who never interacted with her much, Kirihara might just be &#8220;a plain student council president.&#8221; But those who&#8217;ve been in the same class, held positions in clubs, or teachers hold her in high regard.</p>
<p>&#8230;That&#8217;s kind of cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei, bye-bye.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeah, see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>After seeing off the girls leaving the classroom, I started preparing to head back to the staff room.</p>
<p>On my way, I felt my smartphone vibrate and checked the screen.</p>
<p>&#8230;There was a message from Kirihara.</p>
<p>There were still some students lingering in the classroom. Not just Kirihara, but others were also using their phones.</p>
<p>Thinking it&#8217;s safe, I checked the message.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be able to go to the drinking party feeling good?&#8221;</p>
<p>Today is Friday. If I hadn&#8217;t had plans, I would&#8217;ve gone to Kirihara&#8217;s house, so I had already informed her about the party.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. You helped a lot. Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. Glad I could help.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another message followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re coming over after, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had left a complete set of disguises in a coin locker near Kirihara&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me know if you&#8217;ll be late.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Got it. I&#8217;ll be waiting while playing games.&#8221;</p>
<p>I put away my phone and headed for the staff room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodbye, Sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>The one who said goodbye was Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodbye. See you next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. See you next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>We are liars.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s wrong, and I&#8217;m fully aware, but it&#8217;s a little exciting&#8230; I&#8217;m getting poisoned, aren&#8217;t I?</p>
<p>After school, as we waited for the drinking party to start, Kurei-san and I split the remaining grading of the final exams. When the reservation time approached, we moved with the other seniors, Kurei-san included.</p>
<p>Normally, the teachers who commute by car, today, it seemed, had come by bus.</p>
<p>The opportunity to go out for drinks isn’t easy to come by, so everyone says they make do on occasions like this.</p>
<p>We were guided to a major restaurant chain near the station.</p>
<p>The basic course was a two-hour all-you-can-drink and eat, which isn’t exactly my go-to place as a former private restaurant part-timer, but its free, and it was my welcome party, so naturally, I had no complaints.</p>
<p>In the spacious private room reserved for gatherings, almost all the teachers were assembled, including the principal and the vice-principal.</p>
<p>The evening started with words of appreciation for the first semester and welcome towards me, and in the end, I was prompted to give a brief greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been a very busy few months since I joined the company. Thanks to everyone, every day has been fulfilling. I look forward to your continued support,&#8221; I said, delivering a safe greeting and leading the toast.</p>


<p>Of course, the expressions on the faces of my seniors were brighter than when we are in the staff room.</p>
<p>&#8230;Or rather, too bright.</p>
<p>The middle-aged teacher who normally never cracks a smile now had his face and his sparsely-haired head flushed red from just one beer, grinning foolishly.</p>
<p>Kurei-san, sitting next to me, muttered, turning towards me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since our work is usually so rigid, everyone becomes cheerful once the alcohol kicks in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san herself was drinking her generously poured beer as usual.</p>
<p>Her complexion, expression, and tone of voice seemed unchanged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, Hajima-kun. That&#8217;s not good.&#8221;</p>
<p>A senior teacher in his thirties seated on my other side suddenly slung his arm around my shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks like Kurei-sensei&#8217;s glass is about to be empty. Better order some beer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. Kurei-sensei, would you like more beer? Or something else to drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;No, beer is fine. Sorry for the trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before calling the server, I checked if anyone else wanted to add orders.</p>
<p>In the end, we decided to order about five more beers. Since it was a hassle, I also added a pitcher.</p>
<p>After the exchange with the server, the senior teacher next to me started talking to me again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-kun, you&#8217;re quite unusual these days. Quitting a new job at a company to take on a teaching position. Did you enter a regular company but then decided you preferred teaching and switched to this field?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, yes, something like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Only the principal and Kurei-san know the true story behind my decision to become a teacher. Since everyone is busy, I haven&#8217;t had much interaction with other teachers, so there hasn&#8217;t been much opportunity to talk in depth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Admirable! That&#8217;s something! A teacher really needs passion, right? When I decided to become a teacher, my parents were worried and opposed it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>As he began a story about his life, I silently listened, nodding along.</p>
<p>I kept an eye on the timing when the beer was about to run out and continued to pour from the pitcher.</p>
<p>Kurei-san, sitting quietly next to me, was called over by the vice-principal.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you pour some for the principal? It&#8217;s always nice to have a drink poured by a beautiful lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What an honor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san stood up. Then, the teacher who had been continuing his life story smirked slyly and whispered to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem quite close to Kurei-sensei, but do you like her or something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? No, it&#8217;s not like that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just looking after you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since there wasn&#8217;t really anything else, I ended up genuinely confused.</p>
<p>Judging that there was no ulterior motive, the senior teacher seemed disappointed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought there might be something between you two since you seemed to get along so well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurei-sensei is kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm. I still think she treats you quite specially.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it seems that way because we&#8217;re both in charge of the same subject?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san was pouring drinks for the principal. The principal seemed to have made a joke as she laughed elegantly, covering her mouth with her hand, with the principal and the vice-principal also laughing. They seemed to be enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the very least, I thought Hajima-kun might have some ulterior motives. She’s beautiful, after all. &#8230;Really, you’re not interested?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a beautiful person, but I don’t particularly have those kinds of feelings&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have someone you&#8217;re dating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is someone I&#8217;m in an unmentionable relationship with, but not a girlfriend.</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven’t been in a relationship with anyone before, have you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had a long relationship with a girlfriend during college, but we broke up before graduation, and that’s been it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn’t catch a new one, huh? You’re young but quite dried up, eh? No rush to get married? Having a family is nice, you know! My daughter was just born recently&#8230; Ah, want to see her photo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sen-se~, that’s not good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san returned just as he was about to bring out his smartphone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone has their own views on marriage. I know you love your wife and daughter deeply, but please don’t impose that on our junior here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; Yes, sorry about that. Sorry, Hajima-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No problem. Your daughter must be adorable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Hehe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The alcohol seemed to make him uncharacteristically loose and embarrassed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oi, Hajima-kun, you’re out of drinks. What’ll it be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, no, I’m probably good for now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei isn’t very strong with alcohol. Please don’t push him too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san spoke up before I could refuse.</p>
<p>It seemed quite some time had passed, and the first round of the party was nearing its end.</p>
<p>After leaving the restaurant, other teachers were recruiting members for the second round of drinks.</p>
<p>Kurei-san, being popular, had received multiple invitations but skillfully declined, saying, &#8220;It’ll become too late, and that causes trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was also invited, but I declined, saying, &#8220;Unfortunately, I have plans.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was past ten in the evening. It might take about an hour to get to Kirihara&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>Those heading home grouped up so no one would have to walk alone, catching taxis together. It was all about sharing a ride with those heading in the same direction.</p>
<p>I ended up with Kurei-san.</p>
<p>Though I wanted to head to Kirihara&#8217;s house instead of home, I couldn&#8217;t just leave Kurei-san alone. It seemed like I would lose some time, but I had no choice but to head home first.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when it was our turn, the taxi line broke once.</p>


<p>And the follow-up was slow to arrive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you enjoy the drinking party?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you for everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn’t pay for it, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But since everyone contributed, I was treated by Kurei-sensei too, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That’s true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san smiled softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you had fun, that’s what matters. That&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>She kept smiling, but I tilted my head in confusion.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure, but maybe Kurei-san was&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; Are you angry about something?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san stopped blinking, surprised, her eyes a bit wider than usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Why would you think that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just have a feeling&#8230; There&#8217;s a sense of disharmony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmmm&#8230;&#8221; Kurei-san hummed as if intrigued.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really pay attention, don’t you, Hajima-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh, did I do something rude?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm,&#8221; Kurei-san pondered, touching her chin with her finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, would you mind sitting somewhere for a bit? The taxi isn’t coming anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed like a conversation that wouldn’t end with just standing and talking.</p>
<p>Kirihara might be waiting, but&#8230; if I just left like this, I’d be bothered by it. And I didn’t want that to linger until Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wondered what Kurei-san found displeasing about me.</p>
<p>With a sense of unease, I followed Kurei-san, who had started walking.</p>
<p>Several minutes later, I found myself sitting at a bar&#8217;s counter with Kurei-san.</p>
<p>Instead of the noisy place we were in before, this was a calm venue with an adult atmosphere.</p>
<p>I thought we might sit on a park bench or something, so being led here left me quite bewildered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for dragging you along.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san took a sip from her cocktail glass with a graceful gesture. She truly seemed to enjoy her drink, a stark contrast to her expression while drinking beer earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei, go ahead. That’s non-alcoholic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Accepting the drink Kurei-san offered, I moistened my mouth. It was a cocktail with a refreshing flavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn’t angry at you, Hajima-sensei. If anything, I was angry at the situation&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san hesitated to articulate her thoughts.</p>
<p>Alcohol seemed to make her more expressive than usual, her emotions more readily surfacing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Due to our rigid work, once everyone starts drinking, they really get out of hand in the worst way. Power harassment, sexual harassment, moral harassment – wasn’t it all on display?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah. Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I hadn’t particularly minded, but thinking back, maybe that was the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like your story about your ex-girlfriend matters, right? It&#8217;s unrelated to work. Everyone just finds it amusing to make a toy out of you. Even being asked to pour drinks, what’s the difference from the Showa era tea-serving? It was your welcome party, and yet they had you working&#8230; That’s what I was thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much. Kurei-sensei, you really are kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really. In the end, I’m just irritated with the principal and vice-principal&#8230; When they asked me about marriage plans, I really snapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s&#8230; unfortunate&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I had thought they were laughing over a joke from afar, but I was mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You were spoken to quite a bit as well, but before, that was done to me. I was the youngest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. With the youngest changed, the roles swapped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for your welcome party turning out this way. Bringing you here was my way of making amends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn’t have to worry. Do you like this place?&#8221;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/embed0008_HD.jpg" />

<p>&#8220;Sometimes. When I’m feeling down or, conversely, when I’m in high spirits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s a nice place. The drinks are delicious&#8230; But, was it okay? Wasn’t it your secret spot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was, but I thought it’d be okay with Hajima-sensei.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kurei-san traced the rim of her cocktail glass with her finger, giving me a sidelong glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, that came off as rather arrogant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s okay if it&#8217;s Kurei-sensei. After all, I’m under your care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that’s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san let out a sigh, looking down.</p>
<p>&#8220;No good. I might be quite drunk today. I’m usually not like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did drink quite a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even though I’m always like that. Maybe I got carried away because there’s a junior now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shyly covered both of her cheeks with her hands. Seeing Kurei-san embarrassed was quite refreshing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please forget about me today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll try.&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn’t promise I could. Today&#8217;s Kurei-san had too much of a gap from her usual self.</p>
<p>She had an allure, almost like a &#8216;bad girl&#8217; mode Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8230;Ah.</p>
<p>Realizing I had forgotten, I checked the time on my phone.</p>
<p>It was eleven in the evening. There was also a message from Kirihara, &#8220;Are you still coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Sorry. I’ve made you wait too long. We should go—&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san finished her cocktail and followed suit. I did the same. Kurei-san spoke to the waiter, &#8220;Check, please,&#8221; then got off the bar stool.</p>
<p>Immediately after, she staggered slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurei-sensei!?&#8221;</p>


<p>I managed to catch her before she fell.</p>
<p>Kurei-san then leaned her weight against me, fitting snugly in my arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry!&#8221; Kurei-san pulled away from me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah… I guess I really am drunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gently let go of her supporting arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for helping me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san, blushing shyly, was still stunningly beautiful.</p>
<p>After leaving the bar, Kurei-san was still a bit unsteady on her feet.</p>
<p>She held onto my arm for support as we walked to the taxi stand and got into the car together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that lady okay? I&#8217;d prefer not to take drunk passengers alone&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Though it was a detour, we decided to head near Kurei-san&#8217;s place first to drop her off.</p>
<p>By the time we arrived, most of her drunkenness had worn off, and she was walking at a steady pace. She seemed fine. She also paid her fare diligently.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Sorry. I can head over now, but did you fall asleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have a key, so if Kirihara was asleep, I&#8217;d have no choice but to go home.</p>

<p>However, her response came back quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Waiting,&#8221; it said.</p>
<p>I informed the taxi of the new destination, spending the rest of the ride in restless anticipation.</p>
<p>I got dropped off in front of the coin locker where I&#8217;d stored my disguise gear. After collecting it, I headed to Kirihara&#8217;s place without changing.</p>
<p>It was past 1 a.m., and the streets were almost empty. I figured it was fine by then.</p>
<p>I messaged &#8220;I&#8217;m here&#8221; in front of the entrance, and the door was unlocked almost immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Thanks for your hard work. It’s late, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara looked sleepy, rubbing her eyes in her usual camisole and shorts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, got held up with a few things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? …And you didn’t even disguise yourself. Come in quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once inside, Kirihara took my bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;You’re taking a shower, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah… I&#8217;d appreciate it if I could.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. …Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara sniffed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>
<p>She grabbed my arm, bringing her face closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;…I smell perfume.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah, I immediately realized the cause.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right. Well, actually…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Who were you with?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara cut me off, squeezing my hand tightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who did you get close to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurei-san, but…&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite there being no wrongdoing, I felt pressured and gave a weak response.</p>
<p>&#8220;…I see, Kurei-sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara suddenly looked sullen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm, so Kurei-sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mood noticeably soured, quite blatantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you hit on her? Or did she hit on you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn’t like that. Just got invited for another drink, stopped by one place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Close enough for her scent to transfer?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurei-san drank a bit too much. She was staggering, so I just supported her to prevent her from falling…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her displeasure didn’t fade. If anything, it deepened.</p>
<p>&#8220;What’s the deal?&#8221;</p>
<p>I, too, was annoyed by the sudden confrontation.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sorry. I suppose it&#8217;s unfair from your perspective.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara, still holding my hand, looked down and started mumbling.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s all because I insisted on keeping you close. I have no right to monopolize. I understand that, logically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; Kirihara looked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was extremely annoyed.&#8221;</p>
<p>In that instant, she pulled me with a surprising strength.</p>
<p>Though not as much as Kurei-san, I was a bit tipsy too. To keep from falling, I staggered after Kirihara, who dragged me into the bedroom and threw me onto the bed.</p>
<p>Kirihara, now on top of me, began to violently unbutton my shirt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, Kirihara.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Calm down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it off!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before I knew it, my upper body was exposed, and my pants were thrown across the floor.</p>
<p>Straddling me, Kirihara removed her camisole and bra, tossing them far away.</p>
<p>In the dimly lit room, the beautiful lines of her body came into view.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m also to blame, but so are you and Kurei-sensei. You stepped on my landmine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though I didn’t quite understand, it was clear Kirihara was genuinely angry.</p>
<p>She collapsed onto me, pressing her body firmly against mine.</p>
<p>Our chests met, a soft sensation trapped between us.</p>
<p>&#8220;…I was waiting. Got out of the bath, put on body cream, and even wore perfume.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her moist skin rubbed against mine, like an animal marking its territory.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a gesture of affection but of defending her turf, erasing Kurei-san&#8217;s trace.</p>
<p>She picked up my left hand, lying on the bed, and gripped it tightly. The other hand wrapped around my back did the same. Both were a bit painful. This wasn&#8217;t a comforting embrace but a restraining confinement.</p>
<p>It was clear; this was the first time Kirihara had shown such attachment to me.</p>
<p>Until now, Kirihara had always maintained a distance, teasing me. But now, she was desperately making her presence painfully known.</p>
<p>It was unexpected.</p>
<p>I thought she’d be content with anyone who pampered her.</p>
<p>I believed she valued the existence, not me personally.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be Quiet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sweating in the non-air-conditioned room, Kirihara continued to press her body against mine.</p>
<p>Then, shifting her position towards my face, she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me kiss you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without waiting for my response, Kirihara stole my lips.</p>
<p>She attacked greedily, causing our teeth to clash.</p>

<p>Such roughness was uncharacteristic for her. Normally, she’d enjoy the sensations delicately. But not now, not Kirihara.</p>
<p>For my part, perhaps because of the alcohol, I began to feel angry.</p>
<p>As Kirihara herself said, there was no reason for her to be angry. I did nothing wrong.</p>
<p>Once that thought took hold, a retaliatory mood set in. So, I decided to fight back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm… Nn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still locked lips, I released the hand I was holding and began to run my fingers along Kirihara&#8217;s back. There was no significant reaction as I followed the indentation of her spine. Then I explored around the center between her ribs and her back, feeling the firmness of her ribs under my fingers. When I found a spot, Kirihara jerked her body with a small sound. This was it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nhnn…&#8221;</p>
<p>No doubt. Gently circling the area with my fingernail, Kirihara made a sound like a fussy baby. Shifting my finger slightly and focusing on the sensitive spot, I teased her. Kirihara tried to focus on the kiss again, but as soon as I poked again, the bed squeaked from her abrupt movement.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pah. Wait, sensei, why suddenly… hyan!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the first time I had taken the initiative, probably catching her off guard. But I didn’t care.</p>
<p>While my left hand continued to explore the weak spots on her back, my right hand ventured to her inner thigh. Near the groin, where it dips in, I let my fingers slide. As I explored the crease of her thigh, Kirihara visibly panicked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Hyan…&#8221;</p>
<p>This spot was loved by my ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>&#8212;Remember, Gin. A girl&#8217;s body is a treasure trove.</p>
<p>&#8212;You&#8217;re sure to find pleasurable spots, so search thoroughly.</p>
<p>With those words in mind, I continued to explore Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you always go for the distant spots&#8230; uuuuu.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were indeed good spots, but seemingly not the decisive ones. However, satisfaction wouldn&#8217;t come easily. Her breathing became erratic, cutting into short gasps, and her body&#8217;s trembling grew more frequent. Finally, I touched the center of her underwear with my palm, gently swaying it. I couldn&#8217;t tell if it was sweat or something else, but there was a moist sensation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hyah, ah&#8230; nn, ahn nnn~~~aahhh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara tensed her body and continued to tremble for several seconds. Then, she relaxed, seemingly exhausted on top of me. &#8230;Maybe I went a bit too far. Or rather, she&#8217;s quite vulnerable when attacked.</p>


<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/embed0009_HD.jpg" />

<p>To apologize, I sought Kirihara&#8217;s hand with my left and gripped it. My right hand was placed on her back.</p>
<p>The moment I touched her, her body jerked defensively, but as I continued to stroke to soothe her, she relaxed again. Feeling the tension release, I moved my hand to her head.</p>
<p>&#8230;After a while, Kirihara initiated a kiss. Perhaps she wanted to regain control, as her tongue became more assertive.</p>
<p>&#8230;After being tantalized to her satisfaction, &#8220;Fuhaa,&#8221; our faces separated, and our lips were freed.</p>
<p>Our eyes, now at close range, drooped lazily.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Cooled your head?&#8221;</p>
<p>That was a poor choice of words. Her eyes suddenly sharpened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Troubled&#8230; I was satisfied with my retaliation, having no desire to continue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want my Sensei stolen away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a misunderstanding.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you were close, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t argue with that.</p>
<p>Kirihara straddled me again, looking down at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know. I could get so annoyed at girls hitting on my Sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since her anger wasn&#8217;t directed at me, there might still be a chance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought it was wrong of me to be possessive, but I can&#8217;t help it anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hm&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do as I please.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Kirihara straddled me, she began to remove her underwear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, wait!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t wait. Besides, you started it. Take responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Completely nude, Kirihara dived in, burying her face in my neck and lightly biting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re doing it today.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an undeniable determination.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my body was already responding to our previous play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, damn it. Let it be.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps driven by the alcohol, I abandoned all thought, deciding to go with the flow.</p>

<p>I might regret this later.</p>
<p>But if Kirihara needs me this much&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>Her sweet whisper melted my last resistance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say it&#8217;s okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and opened my mouth.</p>
<p>Just as the words &#8220;It&#8217;s okay&#8221; were about to escape my throat, a loud crash of cymbals from another room interrupted us.</p>
<p>The mood was utterly destroyed.</p>
<p>Upon opening my eyes, I saw Kirihara also detaching and stirring.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? What&#8217;s happening?&#8221;</p>
<p>With a clearly displeased expression, Kirihara answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;My phone. A call.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara set individual ringtones for her contacts, so she knew who it was before even answering.</p>
<p>Both before and after picking up, her disgust was evident.</p>
<p>&#8220;End of term? It&#8217;s over. Not sure about the scores yet&#8230; No problem there. Yeah. Uh-huh&#8230; I know, okay? I haven&#8217;t dropped in grades. I&#8217;m managing the household too. Anyway, what time do you think it is? &#8230;Yeah, I was awake, but this could&#8217;ve waited till tomorrow, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s words trailed off, sensing the caller had more to say.</p>
<p>In a moment, Kirihara&#8217;s voice filled with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always about some woman with Dad, right! &#8230;Work-related? Ah, I see. If it&#8217;s necessary, that&#8217;s fine. But don&#8217;t make it obvious to me! I don&#8217;t plan on stopping you anymore, but I dislike it! It makes me sick! Do as you please, but don&#8217;t forget the money transfer for living expenses. I&#8217;m hanging up.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ended the call one-sidedly and placed the phone on the table. Naked, Kirihara crouched down, resting her forehead on her knees, sighing deeply.</p>
<p>Before I could say anything, Kirihara sneezed cutely.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;ll catch a cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>While still crouching, Kirihara glanced over.</p>
<p>The air conditioning was left on. I crossed the living room and turned it off.</p>

<p>&#8220;What now? Wanna shower?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m a bit tired. I want to lie down together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pulling her hand, I led her to the bedroom.</p>
<p>We lay down together on the bed, and I covered us with a towel blanket.</p>
<p>She still seemed cold, so I hugged her from behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sorry for everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps the call had sobered her up, as Kirihara sounded more demure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Was that call from your parents?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. &#8230;Can you hold me tighter?&#8221;</p>
<p>I did as she asked, and she played with the arm I had wrapped around her, tracing back and forth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are things bad with them?&#8221;</p>
<p>It felt like the right moment to ask, so I did.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with me, but I don&#8217;t have much to do with him either. It was my decision to live on my own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara continued her story.</p>
<p>&#8220;Both of my parents have been unfaithful since I was little, always.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words initially, but she kept talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;They both blame each other for starting it&#8230; But I think it was my father. He&#8217;s a city council member, you see. His job involves putting on a good face everywhere, so there are bound to be various entanglements. That&#8217;s probably why&#8230; But my mother isn&#8217;t innocent either&#8230; No matter how you look at it, I feel like she would have ended up sleeping with another man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do your father and mother not love each other?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that&#8230; I think. It&#8217;s just that their sense of affection or romantic feelings are sort of bugged. They&#8217;re just a bit off from what&#8217;s normal, those two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it hard, being their child?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not fun, that&#8217;s for sure. I&#8217;ve come to terms with it now, but there were times when our house felt like a cold war zone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they ever talk about divorce?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they did. But they were concerned about public image and decided against it. I was told not to meddle in adult affairs, so I wasn&#8217;t given many details. I don&#8217;t really know&#8230; Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had sensed there might be complexities in her family life, but it seemed even more tangled than I had imagined.</p>
<p>I felt the complexity of the situation was something not easily intervened in.</p>
<p>&#8220;My father has apologized to me before. But at that moment, something about it just made me snap. I told him if he was going to apologize, he should let me do as I please. I said I didn&#8217;t want to live in a house with the two of them together. That I&#8217;d rather live alone. Then, they actually let me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how it came to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother seems to have rented her own place too. Maybe my living alone gave her that idea. Now, our family is scattered, but it seems to work out best that way. As long as I don&#8217;t get calls like last night, I&#8217;m free from weird stress. It&#8217;s more comfortable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that really true?&#8221; I wondered inwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that were the case, you wouldn&#8217;t have gotten so angry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>After a few seconds of silence, Kirihara sniffed lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I understand why Kirihara becomes lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Was it too presumptuous of me to think that her getting fiercely angry at sensing another woman around me was triggered by her parents&#8217; infidelity?</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too kind to me, or I might attack you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Liar. You&#8217;re not in the mood anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You know me well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve spent enough time together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. &#8230;Ah, this sucks.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she said that, Kirihara sneezed again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should take a shower. You&#8217;ll really catch a cold.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;&#8230;I will. You going in first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go later. I&#8217;ll bring your clothes to the dressing room, so make sure to put them on, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>After seeing Kirihara off, I took the clothes we had discarded earlier to the dressing room.</p>
<p>When I came back to the bedroom after my shower, Kirihara was already asleep in bed.</p>
<p>No wonder. It was past two in the morning. I was at my limit too.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>She was deeply asleep.</p>
<p>But there were traces of tears on her closed eyelids.</p>
<p>I gently wiped them away before getting into bed myself.</p>
<p>Wrapped in a single towel blanket, we lay down side by side.</p>

<p>The next day, when I woke up, Kirihara was in my arms.</p>
<p>Facing me, she stared intently with her eyes. After saying good morning, she called me softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you been using your arm as a pillow for me the whole time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Seems like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>My arm was numb, completely devoid of sensation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Hehe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara smiled happily and gave me a quick kiss.</p>
<p>Just a fleeting touch, then she pulled away. A light kiss was all it was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her gesture was purely endearing.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t felt this way last night, but my usual sense of crisis returned. A slight feeling of panic arose.</p>
<p>&#8230;But well, maybe today it&#8217;s okay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I make something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Afterward, i spent a leisurely day off with Kirihara.</p>
