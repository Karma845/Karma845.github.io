<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 8: Behind-the-Scenes Fiction, Fraudsters Gather in a Deserted Warehouse</h2>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What are
you talking about? I don't understand what you mean."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya Rodel said
calmly, but her frustration grew.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Where in the world did it go wrong ......?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Standing in front of
the door of the infirmary, she thought back over what had happened so far.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was two weeks ago
that she received a directive from the higher-ups in response to the increasing
espionage activities by the Republic. It was still only at the level of
concern, but there was a possibility that rats might have gotten mixed up in
the Heiberg School, which is the root of the Empire's monopoly on psychic
abilities.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She first set her
sights on a few students.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Caspar Crawford, who was
exempted from the entrance exam but flatly stated that he was not aiming for
the &lt;White Knights&gt;. Nina Stingray, who defeated Bennett Lohr less than a
month after enrolling in the school. Jin Kirihara, who seemed to be playing the
role of her strategist. And Emma Licorice, one of their few friends.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, after
investigating for a while, she could not find any connection to the Republic.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Impatient to gain
achievements, she decided to take measures in accordance with the barbaric
logic of [punish those who are suspected].</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First, she took
advantage of Casper's love of women to create a conflict with Karen. Since
Karen had been brainwashed since childhood to acquiesce to all of Satya's
demands, it was easy to induce her to form a tentative alliance with Nina to
defeat Casper.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All that remained was
to strike them both down at the appropriate moment by making false accusations.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If it was the result
of a legitimate &lt;duel&gt;, no one would suspect the connection between her
and the headmaster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, normally,
the process would have taken several months - or even six months - to proceed
carefully.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The need to accelerate
the plan arose when she saw the scribbles on the 6th class blackboard.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[I know there are rats
in this class. This is a declaration of war.]</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There have been plenty
of reports circulating about the &lt;White Knights&gt; capturing spies from
enemy countries.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Although she dismissed
it as a silly prank by an unrelated third party, one of her targets</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Emma Licorice</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">was clearly shaken by the graffiti.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her pupils dilated
violently, and then she quickly tried to maintain her cool. That was not, by
any stretch of the imagination, the reaction of a student who just saw a prank.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was a sudden and
fortuitous turn of events.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya was almost
jubilant, but quickly regained her composure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">What if this is not just a prank?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What if
whoever wrote this knew about the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; and was using Emma
Licorice as bait?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What if all of
the targets are working together behind the scenes?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">If that's the
case, I can no longer afford to waste any more time.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">I must purge
all the suspicious people and restore peace to the school as soon as possible.
I must extinguish the fire before causing trouble for the headmaster.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Nothing to
fear in going with my baseless intuition.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">This is my
chance to prove my usefulness and climb to the top.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her plan went like
this.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Give Karen the excuse
that her best friend had been attacked and start a rampage. After rampaging for
a while, when she had the attention of the entire school, she would declare war
on Nina Stingray in the name of revenge. Nina, who was feared as the &lt;Queen
of Calamity&gt;, would have no choice but to accept the &lt;duel&gt; in order
to protect her reputation. Normally, it would have been preferable to purge
Caspar Crawford, who was in an alliance with Nina, as well, but that could
wait.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After converting that
monster into a lump of meat, it would be Emma Licorice and Jin Kirihara's turn.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The only reason why
she did not target the most suspicious Emma first was because she did not have
a relationship with her at the moment. However, such a problem could be easily
solved as long as she could make a good excuse that she was cooperating with
Nina, the enemy of her best friend.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a result, Karen had
to be sacrificed, but at least the objective could be accomplished.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As far as she could
see through her binoculars, there were three people who were killed in the
bombing on the roof of the old school building.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Two of them other than
Nina were wearing masks, but given the circumstances, it could not have been
anyone other than Jin and Emma.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">And yet.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Why is Jin
Kirihara here?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">How did he
survive the explosion</span></i><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">────</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"> no, that's
wrong.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">The fact that
he was wearing a mask was unnatural in the first place, even though his true
identity had been obvious from the very beginning.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya finally figured
out the truth.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't
tell me, the you who was on the rooftop is-"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">a completely different person.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no need to
check with the person in front of her. Looking back on it now, there was no way
that these two people could be the same person.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The boy in front of
her and the masked boy she heard through the wiretap - they clearly have
different voices.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, you don't
have to blame yourself. There's no way you could have recognized my voice
coming out of the speakers with all those noises going on. That's why I went so
far not to meet you or Karen until now. Even if your voice were to change
slightly over the speakers, it would be enough to fool someone you've never met
before, right?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She almost dropped the
pistol she was grasping behind her back.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Indeed, Satya had
never heard the voice of the boy in front of her. It was unbelievable to think
that he had calculated all the way down to that point.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">So what about
the three people in the old school building? </span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Were they
sacrificed to keep this man alive? Is that really so?</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"T-Then, that
masked man is-......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Unfortunately,
I'm under a contract that I can't tell you that. ...... but, well, I'm sure you
already know the answer."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Casper
Crawford, huh?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Who knows? I
can't comment on that."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">What schemes
were being played out that I was unaware of?</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">One thing I do
know is that it's pointless to dwell on these dead-end thoughts.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">The only thing
I need to think about now is how to get rid of this man.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Right, it's no
use trying to escape through the window. My friends are standing guard
outside."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Thank you for
your pointless advice."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee~, your eyes
haven't given up hope yet."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">You will die here.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The hammer has already
been raised. It won't be a second before she lifted her hand grasping the
pistol, aimed it at his heart, and squeezed the trigger.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That's more than
enough time to kill a man who thinks he has the upper hand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">But the moment she put
strength into her right hand that was behind her back</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya saw something
she could not believe.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't
move."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The muzzle of a gun,
like an abyss, was pointed at her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">One step earlier than
Satya, Jin Kirihara had severed her last card.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A foreign object too
unsuitable for this psychic academy. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">How could a
mere boy obtain such a thing?</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... If you
use such a thing, though, there will be deaths."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You say the
obvious. Are you making fun of me?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Can you really
fire it? You know, that's-......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">It's pointless to try to bargain.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">By the time she
realized this, it was too late.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The trigger was
squeezed far too easily, and her body was subjected to a tremendous shock.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When exactly had this
man's scheme begun? It was impossible for her to remain conscious, let alone
ask such a question.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the center of the
world being dragged away by the darkness, the mysterious fraudster quietly
muttered.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You are
finished, heretic. You weren't even worth deceiving."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">◆</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was one night
before when all the cards were laid out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A chilly breeze blew
through the thicket of trees at night.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Jin's business
associates surrounded him, he informed the Republic Agent with whom he had
allied just a few moments before.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry if this is
too abrupt, Emma. Can I ask you a favor?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Certainly, this
is too abrupt. ...... Fine, go ahead, say it."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'd like to
borrow that mask until tomorrow afternoon."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh? Mask? What
are you gonna use it for?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You'll find it
out later. Maybe tomorrow night."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After receiving the
mask from Emma, who was still wondering about it, Jin hid it in the inside
pocket of his school uniform, and the next day arrived. He proceeded down the
corridor bathed in morning light and vigorously opened the door to a different
classroom than usual.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper Crawford, who was
talking to the girls with a relaxed smile, seemed to have understood everything
as soon as he saw him.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Looks
like you're finally determined to have a &lt;duel&gt; with me, you son of a
bitch."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh? Casper-kun? Your
voice was suddenly-......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aah~, don't
worry about it, Sally-chan! Just wait for me, I'll finish my errand
quickly......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper, who seemed to
have somehow shushed the girl he was interested in (though it was doubtful how
many), followed Jin, who had started to walk ahead of him, out of the
classroom.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even though it was so
early in the morning, he already seemed to be ready for a fight.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper grabbed both of
Jin's shoulders and yelled at him.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You bastard! You
should think about your timing a little bit! What are you going to do if Sally-chan
gets scared!? I'm playing as the serious, honor student in the classroom, you
know that!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What the
heck. Am I actually surrounded by people with dual personalities?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hmph, forget it.
If you're willing to play fair and square, I'll let you off the hook for what
happened earlier. It might make me feel a little better to beat up a fool who
doesn't even know the difference in ability."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Now that
I think about it, why did I ever suspect you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ha? What are you
saying? You sure are a difficult guy to understand."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry
about it. I'm just talking to myself."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Together with Casper,
who has no idea what's going on here, they headed for a deserted wooded area.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The trees and the
ground were as rough as ever, as if this was a place often used for
&lt;duels&gt; between students.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a few seconds of
glaring at each other at close range, Jin pulled out a four-folded pledge form
from his pocket.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, what are the
rules for the &lt;duel&gt;?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You only have to
wager one point. This is a fight for honor. If you faint or surrender, you
lose. And the loser has to give up on Nina-chan completely."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hey, weren't you
hitting on another girl just now?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm not the kind
of coward who can only love one girl. I'm a philanthropist."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know you don't
have a dictionary in your house."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Your
sarcasm is so roundabout it's hard to understand. Come on, let's get
started."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as both
parties had signed their names, Casper began to move without even waiting for
the tin witnesses to come flying in.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The surrounding
landscape suddenly became distorted.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper's own figure
was also incorporated into the distortion, and chaos was generated in front of
Jin's eyes as if several paints had melted into water.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The chaos stirred as
if it had a will of its own.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Eventually, an
enormous arm like a withered tree emerged from the midst of the chaos. The
palm, so huge that it could wrap around a human body, moved as if beckoning,
slowly extending toward Jin.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This was the very
thing that had made the robbers whom Jin had previously chased shrink back in
fear.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A power so
supernatural, so disastrous, and so mysterious that it would be impossible even
for a person with extraordinary abilities - Casper was truly a monster, living
up to the name of the group that was exempted from the entrance examinations.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Jin did not back
down one step.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even in the face of
such a horrifying sight as the manifestation of an evil god, the fraudster's
conviction remained unshaken.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Wearing a mask
borrowed from Emma, he muttered with his usual fearlessness.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......I knew it.
Just as I thought."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin calmly turned
around and sent a front kick toward the empty space.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was a solid
response.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sensation of the
tip of his shoe, which had a metal plate embedded in it beforehand, crushing something
soft.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Guoh, ugh
.........!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as he thought
he heard a groan from the empty space, the abnormal scene that had filled the
surrounding area disappeared as though it were a lie.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Confirming that the
mundane thicket had regained its form, Jin took off his mask.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He called out in pity
to Casper, who was crouching while clutching his crotch.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Sorry,
Casper-kun. That was hurt, right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gah,
a~......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I know, I know.
You won't be able to talk for a while. So, all you have to do is listen to my
guesses."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin couldn't have
smiled more refreshingly.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The first time I
felt something was wrong was when I took Nina to the café where you were. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as you found
me, you aggressively grabbed me by the shoulders and started yelling at me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Hey, if you think
about it calmly, isn't that weird? Why would someone who hates men to the point
of changing his personality try to touch me? Come to think of it, you also
tapped the shoulder of a robber at the knife workshop. That's why I'm convinced
that the condition for activating your psychic ability is [to touch the other
person's body]. The reason you knew I was behind the hidden door was because
you already marked me with your psychic ability."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What
about it!? It's not like it's something new!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"No, no, isn't it
strange? If the instantaneous movement you showed me afterward was your psychic
ability, why did you have to specify your target? How do you explain why the
robbers were so scared of you that they ran away?</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">　</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Besides, I found a number of things that didn't feel
right when I was following you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Oi,
stop."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The size and
density of your shadow as you walked in front of me were always constant. It
was so unnatural, even though the sun was sometimes obscured by clouds. Then
there was the route you took. You chose to walk through a construction site so
that people wouldn't hear your footsteps, didn't you? Well, that was a
brilliant move, but at the same time, there was a miscalculation that a steel
frame was protruding from the building. Your shadow was projected in slightly
different shades in the steel frame's shade. That doesn't seem right
physics-wise, does it?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And all the proof was
now complete.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Using a special lens
fitted into the mask he borrowed from Emma.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He didn't tell Casper,
of course, but these lenses have an infrared detection function.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason Emma was
able to spot the gunpowder traps in the ground and her friends hiding in the
bushes was because she was able to visualize the temperature of objects with
this lens.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This military
technology was not yet available in the Empire, but Rusty, who had stayed in
the Republic, had already heard of its existence.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Looking through this
lens, it would be possible to see that the arm of the evil god that appeared in
front of him had no substance, and to uncover the current location of Casper,
who was assimilated into the landscape.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Your psychic
ability is indeed powerful. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If I could have any
ability, I would want that ability first and foremost. But I'm afraid I'm not a
good match for you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"S-Stop......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're going to
tell me everything. About the true nature of your psychic ability......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wa-! Wa-! Stop,
please!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper suddenly
interrupted Jin with a loud voice.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason for this
was obvious.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jake, the tin doll,
arrived on the scene a minute or so after the pledge was filled out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jake, who connected
with the headmaster, could not have known that Casper's psychic ability was
only to show fake visions to those whom he touched.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Now it's checkmate.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jake, sorry that
you had to come here, but the &lt;duel&gt; is over."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[What the hell are you
saying? The written oath says the condition of victory is that one of you must
either pass out or surrender.]</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, right, I
surrender then. Is that okay with you, Casper?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Y-You bastard,
what the hell are you playing at ......?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After waiting until
Jake was out of sight as he complained in a synthesized voice and flew away,
Jin finally got down to business.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In exchange for
conceding the victory, you're going to have to lend me some of your psychic
abilities."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Haaaa~!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What happened next was
simple.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He began with the
topic of Karen being a common enemy of both Nina and Casper, and then proceeded
to entice with the idea that Casper's image projection abilities would be
necessary to save Nina.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Negotiating was easy,
as it was also painful for Casper to have Karen, who boasts overwhelming
firepower that is unapproachable, keeping an eye on him.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the end, Jin
succeeded in establishing a time-limited alliance under the condition that he
would not reveal the true nature of his psychic ability to anyone.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Fortunately, Casper
had touched Karen's body before and had already met the activation conditions.
All that remained was to successfully execute the operation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">First, they had to
face their first adversary.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Wearing a mask and
pretending to be Jin, Casper hid under the floor of the room where Karen was.
All that remained was to generate a noise outside the window and use the
opportunity to push up the floorboards and attack Karen.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, the attack
was just an image, and the real Casper remained hidden under the floor, but
there was no way Karen could have known.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thanks to Karen's
devastating destruction of the old school building. The noises and dust that
filled the area cleverly masked the fact that the source of the voices and
perfume was coming from under the floor, and that no sounds was coming from the
man who was attacking her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once the death of [Jin
Kirihara] was faked by showing the image of his clone being crushed by the
crystals, all that remained was to disable Karen's psychic ability by using the
real spray on the rooftop, which could be seen by Satya, who was in the
infirmary.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The last thing to
consider is the possibility that Karen, brainwashed by Satya, is hiding a trump
card which is self-destruction. As the daughter of the Ashby family, which made
its fortune in weapons manufacturing, it is not surprising that she would have
at least one grenade in her possession.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, as long as
they were informed of this possibility in advance, Emma would surely take care
of it.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The grenades made by
the Ashby family are designed to explode five seconds after the trigger is
pulled.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Five seconds is far too long on a tense battlefield.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma could easily
snatch the grenade from the girl whose psychic ability was blocked. All she had
to do was throw it in the right location before it exploded, and the mission
was complete. From the position of the infirmary on the first floor, it was
impossible to see if the people on the roof of the distant building had managed
to avoid the explosion.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Thinking to that
point, Jin realized a fact that he had overlooked.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Come to think of it, I never told anyone that the me
who was there was actually Casper.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper,
pretending to be me, might be hugged by Nina amid all the chaos. It's a little
unpleasant to think about, but it's unlikely to happen.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Anyway, the
operation is a success.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Now we
just need to get plenty of stories out of this girl."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin muttered, looking
down at Satya, who was knocked unconscious by a blow from the Taser he had
borrowed from Emma.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆ ◆ ◆</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma and Nina were
being transported somewhere in a car driven by Gasta, who claimed to be a
companion of Jin.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper Crawford, who
had been impersonating Jin, took off his mask and revealed himself, then winked
at Nina, who was in a state of utter shock, and left. Nina was completely
mistaken in thinking that he was Jin, and she kept her head in her hands the
entire car ride.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't
worry about it. It's a normal human reaction to hug someone when emotions run
high."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Uuuu...... You
absolutely mustn't tell Jin about this, okay?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I don't know,
but I'll do as you say."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The car drove for
about an hour along a mountain road until it arrived at an abandoned warehouse
in the middle of nowhere. The brick warehouse was large enough to hold three
cars and was guarded by a group of men who were armed to the teeth.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin Kirihara, standing
in front of the door, raised his hand and called to them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He was reunited with
his accomplices for the first time in several hours. And Nina was somewhat
hiding behind Emma’s back.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're
truly......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was natural for
Emma to mutter that in an initial reaction, since she had heard the whole story
of the scheme that Jin had set up this time in the car.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The boldness to use
everything around him for a single purpose.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The imagination to
combine disparate pieces of information to create a victorious outcome.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the art of
deception to force a foolhardy plan to work.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She had seen many
monstrous people in her life, but the fraudster in front of her was far beyond
the scope of her imagination.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This guy is fighting on a completely different board.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">To defeat a powerful
psychic, one does not need a well-trained body or mysterious powers beyond
human understanding.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just a bit of artistic
Lie is all that is needed.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's wrong,
you froze. Are you perhaps impressed by my ability?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... Don't be
so conceited. I'm just disappointed that you don't trust me."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I would never
lie to my friends. It's true. You can see it in my eyes."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How can I
believe you if you say that while looking away!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, you're not
going to argue with me about the "friends" part?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Wha......."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as her brain was
about to boil with emotion, she heard a soft chuckle from behind her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ahaha. Don't be
embarrassed, Emma."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I'm not
embarrassed at all! Look, I have no choice but to do it for the sake of my
country......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gosh, you should
be more honest with me. Let's continue to work together, shall we?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a smile that
could light up the night, Nina extended her right hand to her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The lone battle with
no one to rely on other than herself was at once attacked by the sensation of
being saved. Subconsciously, she squeezed the offered hand back.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma tried to deny
what she had done, but Jin was staring at her while grinning.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Welcome Emma.
You are now officially our accomplice."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-We just happen
to have the same interests!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright,
alright, let's leave it at that."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The fraudster
intercepted Emma's rebuttal with his hand and returned to his serious
expression.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'd love to
throw you a welcome party, but ...... we're not done yet. Now we have to find
out the secrets of the school from the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a theatrical
tone, Jin opened the door of the abandoned warehouse.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the dimly lit room,
illuminated only by the flashlight hanging from the ceiling, was the target he
had been searching for ever since he enrolled at the school. Just in case, Emma
decided to put on her mask.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya Rodel maintained
an expressionless face like an ice statue while both her arms and legs were
strapped to a chair with ropes. There was no warmth in her eyes, which were
fitted behind her glasses, and coupled with her light blue-colored patient
garment, it was impossible to sense any life in her overall appearance.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... So this
woman is the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;, huh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A spy loyal to the
school's headmaster, Jill Will Weiser, and is an important figure who may be
privy to the school's secrets.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How many of Emma's
compatriots were killed before she arrived here after receiving information
leaked by the legendary fraudster, who was being hunted as an enemy of the
empire?</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma secretly clenched
her fists.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You see, at
first, I honestly thought that ...... Karen Ashby was the most suspicious
one."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin sat down on a
chair placed in front of Satya.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Because that
girl fits the criteria for what I consider to be a &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;
perfectly. If one is good enough to be exempted from the entrance exam, it
should be easy to get rid of anyone who gets in the way, besides, the Ashby
family, which distributes weapons to the imperial army, is closely connected to
the government.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But halfway through, I
broadened my perspective.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If a person can
control such a monster at will, why would he need to make the move himself?
Wouldn't it be convenient for him to use the monster as a cover for his own
dark activities on behalf of the school? Just like the relationship between me
and Nina.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Besides, according to
the information Nina gave me, Karen had been looking at Satya with a sideways
glance many times while they were talking. Contrary to the superficial
master-servant relationship, this is evidence that the other side was totally
dependent on you. The fact that you've been taking care of Karen's personal
needs since she was a child, it's not hard to create a gentle state of
brainwashing, right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... That
alone only makes me a suspect though."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Satya replied
indifferently, perhaps still not admitting her true identity.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's right. My
doubts turned to certainty after I saw your reactions to the two gifts I gave
you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gifts
......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The first was a
message I wrote on the blackboard in class six yesterday. By writing a sentence
accusing the existence of rats that have infiltrated the school, the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; would surely come to check it out. You showed up in
front of the classroom as I expected. ...... Of course, at that point, there
was the possibility that you were just there on Karen's instructions. What's
important is the other present."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... That
perfume, huh?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, that one.
...... Karen saw through the perfume's &lt;hollowing-out&gt; trick and started
changing the [Forced Deactivation] a week ago. But, you know, isn't that just
plain strange if one thinks about it calmly?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Why would she, who has
her maid take care of all her personal needs, have to check the packages sent
from her parent's house by herself? It was none other than you, ...... Satya,
who noticed the tampering with the bottles and suggested changing the perfume."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's my job as a
maid to remove any traps set by the enemies before they can cause a problem.
Isn't that natural?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, it's
strange. There is something fatally wrong with your actions."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin pointed his finger
in the shape of a gun.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Who the hell was
Karen going to fight at that point a week ago?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......What do
you mean?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That trick would
never be noticed unless someone was planning to fight at that point a week ago.
Because, of course. The only person who would ever consider the perfumes being
switched would be the one who was planning everything a week ago."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Even at that
time, Karen-sama was at odds with Casper-sama. That's why she was telling me to
be on my guard."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... But,
doesn't that make the motive make sense? Karen's &lt;Jolly Undertaker&gt; went
berserk because you were attacked by someone, right?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If Karen was
just putting on a charade, Nina would definitely notice it. She was genuinely
outraged by the assault made on her best friend. Then who attacked you? Was it
me? Nina? Casper? A spy from an enemy country?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, it's been proven
that none of them are true. This leaves us with the conclusion that you staged
this whole thing yourself. To force Karen to go out of control and get rid of
us. You planned that far in advance, as of a week ago, which is why you were
able to convince Karen to change her perfume."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"To think that,
you used that scheme to expose me......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If Karen is the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;, she won't be able to figure out the perfume trick until
I defeat her. If the perfume is switched, then Satya the maid is the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;. I must say, I think it was a decent move to force my
opponent to choose between two unfavorable options.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">...... Well, the fact
that you are still alive and well, even though you were supposedly seriously
wounded, pretty much proves that you are just making it up. I also found a
report addressed to the school headmaster under your bed."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You are
dangerous, Jin Kirihara."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Did you think
you could beat me in a game of deception?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even in the face of
decisive defeat, Satya's expression did not waver.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was not as if she
was still hiding some kind of hand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This woman has killed
her emotions in order to pledge her loyalty to the headmaster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma inwardly clicked
her tongue.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's not easy to get
someone like this to give up information. Torture would only strengthen their
loyalty and be ineffective.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now, shall we
begin the interrogation then? ...... Emma, take her pulse."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As instructed, she
placed her hands on Satya's wrists, which were strapped to the chair.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But not good. The
blood flow, which kept a steady rhythm, proved that she had been highly
trained.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Despite Emma's
uneasiness, her accomplice began the interrogation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Okay, first
question. Are you really a &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt;?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is customary to
begin an interrogation with an obvious question to compare the pulse rate with
that of a normal person.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And as expected, there
was no change in her pulse.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Have you ever
met the headmaster, Jill Will Weiser?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No change.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How many
&lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt; are there in the school now? Is it true that there is
one in each grade?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No change.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How much do you
know about the plot the Empire is trying to carry out using the Heiberg
School?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There was no change in
her pulse.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Unless he asked a
sharper question, he would not be able to elicit any agitation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Inhaling deeply inside
her mask, Emma asked the next question.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"...... Then how
about this one? People believe that psychic abilities were born as a result of
the new bomb that was dropped on the capital, but</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">──</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">there is no evidence
that the Republic has ever dropped a bomb.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That genocide itself
was staged by the Empire. As a member of the &lt;White Knights&gt; and under
the command of Jill Will Weiser, I would think you would know that as
well."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her pulse quickened,
albeit slightly.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This must be new
information to Jin and Nina as well. Both of their eyes widened.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Thanks,
you're shaken up for the first time."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma, taking advantage
of the opportunity, gave a follow-up attack.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What was that
all about for you and the upper echelons of the Empire? What kind of lies are
hidden there? Answer me, heretic."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The agitation was
visible only for a moment, and the pulse quickly regained a steady rhythm. Emma
clicked her tongue in frustration.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We're not
getting anywhere. Should I inject her with a truth-telling serum?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hold on."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina stopped Emma, who
had taken a syringe from her coat, with her hand.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was neither tinged
with emotion nor intimidated.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her azure blue eyes were
full of conviction.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Satya-san,
you are not as tough as you think you are. You have brainwashed Karen-san since
she was a child and pretended to be some kind of mastermind, but after all, you
are just a weak child who fears the power of the headmaster, aren't you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... That's
just a silly guess."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin caught the
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; with his miraculous deception.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma put her
body on the line to save us from death.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Then now is my
turn.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina took a deep
breath, as if she were storing power in the pit of her stomach. It was the
sham-like breathing technique she had learned at the dojo where she and Karen
had attended.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, depending on
the user, it can be a powerful weapon.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Triggered by the
breathing technique, Nina succeeded in instantly entering a deep state of
concentration.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Over the past
few weeks, someone has drilled into me the art of psychological analysis."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The words were now
flooding out of her mouth, without going through her conscious mind.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The frequency
with which you glance at Karen-san, and the length of each glance, is a true
sign of affection. The fact that your voice is slightly lower than when you
speak with others shows that you cared about her that much. And you couldn't
bring yourself to be ruthless, even to the very end."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was wondering
what you were going to say....... Have you forgotten that I encouraged Karen
Ashby to blow herself up?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina did not miss the
slight rise in Satya's voice as she responded.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then why were
you relieved when we entered this warehouse?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......
Pardon?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Emma-san and I
are here because we survived the grenade explosion. If that were the case, then
of course Karen-san's safety would be confirmed as well. You were relieved
because you were able to confirm that with your own eyes, weren't you? In
truth, you didn't want that girl to die, right?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This is just a wild
guess.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All of this is just
speculation without any proof.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But Nina wanted to
believe.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She wanted to believe
that a solid friendship had developed between the two of them, having spent
time by each other's side since childhood. She knew that Karen's words about
Satya as her [best friend] were not a one-way thing. Satya did not become a
pawn of the headmaster of her own volition.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">In this cruel world, there will always be hope, even
if it is only one meager hope.</span></i></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Just as you
wished, Karen-san didn't die in the explosion. But is that really what you
wanted? She might have been happier if she had just died peacefully."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Just what
are you trying to say?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My friends are
currently transporting Karen-san to a distant town. It is a desolate town with
only one small harbor, so the government and police have little access to it.
No one will notice the horrific torture being carried out there, or the
unwanted girl being chopped up and dumped into the sea. So many horrible
stories out there, aren't there?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen, who lost
consciousness and her memory of the school after losing the &lt;duel&gt;, is
actually being protected by Jin's friends right now and is being carried to a
safe house in the suburbs. But Satya would have no way of knowing that.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina went on,
pretending to be something other than a human being - something that made a
distorted expression that resembled a smile - played the role of such a demonic
being.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Listen here,
Satya-san. The future of your precious friend depends on your decision. My
people are capable of doing anything, no matter how horrifying, at my
command."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Please don't
mess with me. That woman has nothing to do with me......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Poor girl, are
you that afraid of being punished by the school principal? ...... If one thinks
about it, there is no way you would become a &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; of your own
volition, no? Brainwashing the only friend you've had since childhood is not
something a normal child would think of doing."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... That's
just unfounded speculations."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Indeed, there is no
basis for this speculation.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She was simply using
the technique of &lt;Cold Reading&gt;, which Jin taught her, to decipher the
psychology of the person in front of her from the slightest gesture or speech.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, if one
applies the technique of [Method Acting], in which one melds oneself into the
role, the accuracy of this technique jumps dramatically. By imitating Satya
Rodel's thoughts with a high degree of precision, she was able to reach the
deepest depths of her emotions, of which she herself was unaware.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And the truly
frightening thing about this technique is that as Nina uttered a series of
guesses - even if they were off the mark - it was possible to convince the
audience that they were indeed their own true feelings.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What if you were
coerced by the adults around you? For example, what if they had originally
wanted to recruit Karen, the daughter of the Ashby family, to be a spy, but her
overly unrestrained personality was deemed unqualified? Is it too much of a
leap to assume that you, who have been together with Karen since childhood,
were appointed in her place?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Stop, please. No
more......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aah, perhaps you
were also brainwashed. If you were taught from an early age that it is normal
to devote yourself to the headmaster's cause, and if you are given an education
that involves fear and pain, the child's behavioral principles will be tainted
with a single color. You will be left with no other choice but to sacrifice
your only best friend to suicide for the sake of a noble cause...... What a
truly, wretched thing to do."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Almost there.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">One more
trigger of some sort, and Satya's stronghold will be broken.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">We can pry
open the locked room that resides deep in her heart.</span></i></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... Rest
assured."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was Emma who took
over.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Even if you
disclose the information, the Republic will guarantee your and Karen's safety. You
can change your name and live peacefully in a remote land, away from the
influence of the headmaster and the &lt;White Knights&gt;. ......Aren't you
actually sick and tired of this stifling life?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">After giving a glimpse of the worst possibility, then
presenting hope.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A deceitful
negotiation technique Nina learned from Jin sometime ago.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although it is the
most basic of all, Nina's acting ability to cast a heartless monster onto
herself and the foul card that only a Republic intelligence agent possesses
make her a powerful trump card that can sway the emotions of even the best of
spies.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The corners of Jin's
mouth contorted into a smile as he confirmed that his accomplices had cornered
their opponents with their joint cooperation.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What do you say,
Satya? There doesn't seem to be any reason to be stubborn now, is there?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A long, really long
silence descended on the abandoned warehouse.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The three of them
waited patiently watching Satya, who was struggling behind her expressionless
face.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a while, she
finally spoke, with sweat beading on her forehead.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... I am
merely a marginal member. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">There are limits to
the information I can provide."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The way you put
it, it sounds like there isn't only one &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; in each grade.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I heard there
was an information leak a few years ago, so they had to reinforce their
structure."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Is it about Rusty's case?</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the past, he was
hunted by the &lt;White Knights&gt; because of the information he accidentally
obtained when he scammed a high-ranking government official. It would not be
unnatural for the upper echelons of the organization to have felt threatened by
Rusty's actions, and to have reinforced their forces in anticipation of an
unexpected enemy.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What are the
names of the other members besides you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wha, pull
yourself together......!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if possessed by the
devil, Satya suddenly started screaming with her white eyes peeled.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She went berserk and
fell down in her chair, repeatedly slamming her head violently into the floor.
Jin hurriedly covered Satya's head with his hands. A possibility flashed
through Jin's mind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">─</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Conditioning.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, it is possible for
the school principal to do so.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It would not be
surprising if the &lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; was programmed to automatically erase
its memory when it attempted to reveal information to a third party.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gah, ugh.
L-L-Listen carefully, Jin Kirihara."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The will to entrust
something dwelled in Satya's eyes, which were wreathed in wounds.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The &lt;Fruit of

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After letting out a
final scream as if she were spewing out her entire being, Satya passed out.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No need to wait for
her to wake up to find out for sure.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She must have had her
memories of the school completely erased. In other words, no further
information could be extracted from her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Quickly switching his
thoughts, Jin decided to move on to the next step.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Emma, can
I leave the rest to you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah. My boss in
the academy has already arranged for Satya and Karen to go into exile."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright, please
make sure there is no trace of third-party involvement."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma walked out of the
warehouse, nimbly carrying the unconscious Satya. After making sure her figure
had disappeared behind the shutters, Jin cut in.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Now. We
need to get back to the academy as soon as possible.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wait, the plot's
moving too fast for me to keep up......!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina, I want you
to drill everything I am about to say now into your head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">1. Satya, unable to
stand being a pawn of the headmaster, conspired with Karen to destroy
everything in the school.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">2. Nina, sensing the
danger of such a move, took out the out-of-control Karen and Satya on behalf of
the headmaster.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">3. Nina's psychic
abilities dismembered them so that there were no more remains of their
corpses."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"E-Eh
......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Things have just
changed, you know. If we are to believe Satya's words, there is more than one
&lt;Shepherd's Dog&gt; in each grade. They are now functioning as a single
organization. If that is the case, we can't just keep on capturing the
lowest-level members and extracting information from them. There seems to be
some kind of memory manipulation as well.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, we must
infiltrate into the heart of &lt;Shepherd's Dogs&gt; by doing a favor to the
school principal."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eeeeehhh!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm sure the
higher-ups at the academy will praise you for unintentionally eliminating the
traitor. Besides, the Stingrays have two members among the &lt;White
Knights&gt;. If all goes well, they may even send a scout to you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-Isn't that too
risky!? Such things bound to turn out badly......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This time we
gained a powerful ally."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In contrast to Nina's
dismay, Jin's expression was full of confidence.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"With Emma
providing us with cutting-edge science and technology, physical prowess, and,
on top of that, an unusually wide network of connections, the scope of our
fraud will be greatly expanded. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instead of just acting
and intimidating people to win by default, we might be able to fight and win in
a normal fight.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although difficult to
manipulate and potentially hostile, ...... we may be able to use Casper's
psychic abilities in some crucial moments.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And Nina, your skills
at deception have improved rapidly in the last few weeks."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin smiled and
extended his right hand, as he had done once before, when they formed an
accomplice relationship in the rainy courtyard.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll write the
script. The stage is well set. The newly recruited behind-the-scenes personnel
are all highly competent. All that remains, Nina, is for you, the actor, to
make up your mind."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even without being
told like this, Nina had already made up her mind.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What she remembered
was the image of her brother with that cruel and beautiful smile on his face. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">I must stop
them from running amok, even if it means deceiving the world.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">That is why I
am standing here now.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Not to be outdone by
her accomplice, Nina made a fearless smile and held his hand in return, so that
she could stand next to him forever.</span></p>
