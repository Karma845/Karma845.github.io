<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 1: The Fraudsters' Everyday Life, Surely the Ceasefire Agreement Will Not Be Upheld</h2>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"In other words,
your current targets are those two, huh?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The stall owner
muttered as he handed over a paper bag filled with a large amount of lollipops.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Lunch break was almost
over and there were no other students in the vicinity. So there was no need to
worry about the students wondering about his sharp eyes, which were out of
character for the harmless-looking large man who was so friendly to the
students.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After receiving the
paper bag, she answered while checking its contents.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course, we
still have no proof that they know about the existence of the &lt;shepherd's
dog&gt;."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But I'm sure you
have your reasons for assuming so."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yes, boss. There
must be some purpose for those two to be poking around the academy."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You mean
the Bennet Lohr incident?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She nodded with a
mysterious expression.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The news that Bennett
Lohr, one of only six students in the school exempted from the entrance examination,
had fallen after only one month of enrollment sent shock waves throughout the
school.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two people who
defeated Bennett, who possessed the powerful and unparalleled unique ability
known as the &lt;Executioner of Immolation&gt;, were Nina Stingray, who was
also a student exempted from the entrance exam, and Jin Kirihara, who was
considered a mere low achiever.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why did they
suddenly target someone as powerful as Bennett? If their goal is to survive
until three years later and become candidates for the White Knights, such a
hasty approach is unnatural."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Certainly, Nina and
Jin's reputations rose drastically as a result of that incident, and some even
believe that they are now in the lead group in the race for survival at the
school. But it also led to an increased risk of being targeted by monsters of
the same or greater caliber as Bennett.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We don't have
any evidence yet, but for the moment let's assume the worst. ......They are
probably using the fact that they defeated Bennett as bait to lure the
&lt;shepherd's dogs&gt; to their doorstep."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's
troubling."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Yeah, very
troubling. They can now suspect everyone who approaches them."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But you're
already in their group. You don't have to worry about them getting
suspicious."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Over the past month,
she has expanded her network within the school in many different directions. Of
course, she has also established friendships with Nina and Jin, who are in the
same class.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">This way, if there
were any dangerous elements that could interfere with the plan, she would be
able to notice them right away.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She really thought
that no one would be better suited for this job than she was.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"By the way, I
heard that Jin Kirihara can nullify psychic abilities. But the &lt;rear
window&gt; in the admissions and ability measurement materials seems to be
recorded it as a psychic ability of the psychological type, though......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Perhaps that's
fake. I was there myself, and he did indeed nullify Bennett's abilities."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If that's true,
then he's capable of being involved in the school's secrets."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Either way,
there is no doubt he is a dangerous individual."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is almost time for
the next class to start.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Finally, the
shopkeeper decided to check her intentions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If Nina Stingray
and Jin Kirihara prove to be an obstacle for us ...... you know how to deal
with them, right?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Of course, boss.
I'll simply exterminate those annoying insects as quickly as possible."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... Good. I
expect you to do a perfect job."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If there are those who
are forcibly moving the wheels of fate and trying to bring the Heiberg Academy
into chaos, they are tantamount to the enemies of the country.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without the slightest
hesitation, they must be crushed thoroughly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While saluting to her
boss, who was disappearing into the back of the store, with only her eyes, she
chanted so in her mind.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">All to achieve a noble cause.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was on her way back
to the classroom building that she happened to see one of her targets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She spoke in a
cheerful tone of voice to the back of the black-haired boy who was walking
lazily. By then, she was already back to her usual cheerful self.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, Jin-kun!
Hurry up or you'll be late!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What? Emma,
huh?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin Kirihara's eyes,
the same color as the depths of the night, squinted glaringly.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It doesn't
matter. The instructor for the next class has never taken attendance
before."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're still as
disorganized as ever. Nina-chan will be furious if she hears about this, you
know?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Why the heck is
her name mentioned?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After letting out a
hefty sigh, Jin showed a sarcastic smile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I mean, you're
walking along with me, are you sure you'll be on time?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah~! What do I
do, I'm going to be late!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She hurriedly took the
wrapper of a lollipop and put it in her mouth.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The &lt;Fierce
Sweetener&gt;, which doubles her physical capabilities, can only be activated
once a day, but if she didn't do that, she wouldn't be able to make it in time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Emma,
don't you have a &lt;practical exam&gt; today?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Aaaaah~! Look
what I did!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she crouched with
her head in her hands, Jin spoke words that could be considered either
comforting or sarcastic.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She is a harmless
classmate who is amiable and a little ditzy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">That's how she must
appear to everyone now. No one knows that behind her harmless mask, she is
observing her target's facial expressions closely.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â—‡</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh? You can't
use your psychic ability anymore today!?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of a brick
building on the outskirts of the school grounds, Nina Stingray shouted in
disbelief.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At the Heiberg
Academy, where fierce competition for points is fierce, the &lt;practical
exams&gt; held every other weekend are a valuable opportunity for actual
competition.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, Nina has a
score of 1253 points, far above the average, so even if she loses this exam,
she will not fall to the bottom five students who will be expelled from the
school. Nevertheless, the disadvantage of damaging her reputation as an
overwhelmingly talented competitor would be immeasurable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Therefore, it was
difficult not to be shocked by the sudden revelation from Emma, with whom she
was supposed to be tag-teaming this time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina lowered her voice
a little so that the other students gathered in the exam room would not hear
her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Um, may I
ask you to elaborate a little more?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm sorry,
Nina-chan....... When I was almost late for class earlier, I inadvertently used
my psychic ability ......."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, I mean, you
were still late in the end, though ......?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Uuuuu~! I'm
sorry!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina held her head in
her hands and cursed her own bad luck.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina, who has no
psychic ability, was relying on Emma's psychic ability to get through this
&lt;practical exam&gt;. The usual method of intimidating opponents by putting
on a tough act would not be very effective under the current rules.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, she and her
accomplice, Jin, had already devised a plan, but the risk of failure was
inevitably high.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She tried to convey a
message to her accomplice, who was a short distance away, just by her gaze.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Hey, Jin, are we going to carry out the plan as it is?</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, Jin only
tilted his head and gave her a troubled smile.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I can't get the message across at all......!</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even so, she kept
trying to send her thoughts, but all she got back from Jin was a hand signal of
[copy that].</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">What do you mean by [copy that] ......?</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, she couldn't
just sit there in despair.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina Stingray is the
daughter of a famous family that has produced two members of the &lt;White
Knights&gt;, a celebrity who is infamous throughout the Empire, a person of
overwhelming ability who was exempted from the entrance examination, and on top
of that, the person who defeated Bennett Lohr, who had powerful psychic
abilities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Well, it
doesn't matter."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Even if Emma is her
friend, she can't show her impatience to her.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Since Emma-san
isn't at her best, all I have to do is to give it a little effort. I think I
have to exert at least 5% of my strength this time."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A-Are you sure
you can do it with only 5%!? You're too reliable, you know......!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Oh no, I got carried away!</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Regret crossed her mind,
but her thoughts were interrupted as the students around her began to make a
commotion. Following everyone's gaze, the instructor in charge of the school
year, Isabella, appeared in front of them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well gathered,
you half-witted pigs!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The icy voice of the
beautiful instructor brought silence to the entire area.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You've been
slacking off lately. I see that many of you have dropped out of school
voluntarily, perhaps because you were so frightened by the Bennett-Lohr
incident.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What are you
expecting, you worms? Didn't you come here to become candidates for the
&lt;White Knights&gt;, the greatest fighting force of the empire? You should be
willing to accept the risk of being killed by a rampaging monster. Am I
wrong?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Without caring that
she had created a ridiculous atmosphere, instructor Isabella explained the

advantage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"All participants

only watch as the boy was forcibly dragged away by the instructors. The
school's ironclad rule is to accept tragedy as tragedy and switch to practical
thinking.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How to contend in this

one of the pairs drops out of the test. When Nina first heard this, she
thought, "A pretty benevolent rule for the Heiberg Academy".</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, the eyes of
her accomplice who was sensitive to malice could not be fooled.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In the back of her
mind, she recalled the speculation that Jin had made the other day.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's not a

only one person who survives wins all the points, there won't be a single

this school is all about?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina really thought
that this school's system was cruel.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With the rule that the
five students with the lowest points each month will be forcibly expelled from
the school, even betrayal and deception are part of the daily routine.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">And Nina and Jin are
planning a spectacular scheme in such an academy.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No matter how one thinks about it, such a benevolent

by now, but the time for the exam to start was already at hand.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina and Emma stepped
into the old school building, where the smell of mold was in the air.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The remaining two
pairs that they were going to compete against had already entered the building,
so it was possible that they were already waiting to ambush them somewhere. The
game would start only after instructor Isabella's signal, but they could not
afford to let their guard down.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As they walked
carefully so as not to make any noise on the damaged flooring, Emma flashed a
mischievous smile. A red balloon sprouting from her helmet swayed without a
trace of tension.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Speaking of
which, why did Nina-chan want to team up with me?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We always take
classes together, so I thought it would be reassuring."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ehh. I thought
Nina would surely team up with Jin-kun."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-I never said
that......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Most of the students
in the same grade know by now that Jin and Nina are working together. Many
students seemed to have strange misunderstandings, but Jin did not deny the
rumor and left it alone, as it was more convenient for him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Still, there is, of
course, a strategic reason why the two are working separately this time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina ruminated over
the plan in her head, and resolved herself once again.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Don't worry.

Emma could not use her ability, but that was no reason to give up.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Because Nina is also
one of the villains who are trying to deceive the world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Emma-san.
It seems our time for chit-chat is over."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sound of a whistle
coming from outside the old school building signaled the start of the
&lt;practical exam&gt;.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">From this point on,
the two could be ambushed from any direction.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Of course, the four
opposing contestants are all psychics, so even if they hid behind a wall, they
would not feel safe.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We'll have to
find our opponents first!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Ah, that
won't be necessary."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina quickly became
immersed in her acting.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Since everyone
seems to be gathering around us already."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She made a vicious
smile and tried to intimidate them, and then noises indicating unrest could be heard
from several directions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As Jin had predicted
beforehand, the two pairs must be joining hands to target Nina and Emma.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"....... I'm
surprised. How did you notice?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The voice of a boy who
seemed to be desperately trying to hide his fear could be heard from ahead.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It was probably a
diversion. While he distracting Nina and Emma, the other three would aim for
Nina's balloons.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's not even a
psychic ability, you know? It's just a predator's instinct ....... No matter
how hard you try to stifle your breath, there's still a delicious scent wafting
through the air."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You're bluffing
......!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"By the way, why
haven't you guys attacked us yet? I'm getting bored."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina reached for the
brooch that glowed red on her chest.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she removed the
brooch, the excessively powerful psychokinesis that had been sealed up until
then was released, thoroughly destroying everything around her - it was the
first Lie that Nina and Jin had created.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Everyone, stand
back! She's about to activate the &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt;!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Bullshit!
There's a rule that prohibits direct attacks......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"This monster

been hiding could be heard running away all at once.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Here is where the problem begins.</span></i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Originally, the plan
was to have Emma, whose physical abilities had doubled, chase after them.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, due to the
previous activation of Emma's psychic ability, the &lt;ferocious sweetener&gt;,
which has a use limit of once a day, could no longer be used.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In other words, Nina
would have to do something about it using only her overwhelming acting ability.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It would be
troublesome if you guys keep running away from me like this. ...... Ah, right.
I've come up with a good idea."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A cruel idea was
spoken in a voice as innocent as that of a child who did not know the rules of
the world.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How about I use
my abilities to clear out the old school building? I remember that the
instructor could restore the old school building with his ability as much as he
wanted, right? Besides, even if the building collapses, only I, who can use
psychokinesis, will be alright.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Well, you will all be
destroyed though, which is fine with me. It would be quite exhilarating, and it
wouldn't be against the rules."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ni-Nina-chan?
Your face scares me. ......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina replied with only
a glance, "It'll be all right", as she slammed the finishing move
onto the board.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If you don't
want to be crushed to death, I recommend you surrender as soon as
possible."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With that statement as
a signal, an explosion could be heard coming from the top of the old school
building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As if to pursue the
screaming students who were running away, intermittent explosions gradually
shattered the brick exterior walls.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It took less than a
minute before all the opponents with blue and green balloons attached to their
heads surrendered.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-We surrender

expression that seemed to say, "This is a violation of the rules."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Their dissatisfaction
is understandable.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Given that direct
attacks on their bodies were prohibited, and that the test emphasized stealth
and surveillance skills rather than simple brute force, it was understandable
that they felt that they had a chance to defeat the strong.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">However, they would never
have imagined that there would be a monster who would think of destroying the
examination site itself.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's a little
bit unsatisfactory, but oh well, I suppose it can't be helped."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Finally, with an
innocent smile, Nina declared so.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now then, everyone.
Could you please pop your own balloons on my signal?"</span><p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin Kirihara watched
from afar as Nina and Emma, with red balloons on their heads, came out of the
old school building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Emma's inability to
use her psychic abilities was unexpected, but in truth, Jin was not that
worried. He trusted that Nina, who had deceived even the members of the
&lt;White Knights&gt; in her family with her outstanding acting ability, would
be able to get out of a pinch of this magnitude with a simple humming of her
voice.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Trust.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A word that was
unfamiliar to Jin, but he had come to accept it for what it was. Incidentally,
Nina might be the first accomplice he's ever had that he's connected to without
involving money.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">While feeling
self-conscious about this, Jin moved into the bushes, away from the crowds.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After making sure no
one was around, he muttered into the small walkie-talkie hidden under the
collar of his uniform.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Good job,

&lt;landscaper&gt; who will take care of all the work necessary for the fraud
for a fee, laughed heartily with a voice tinged with alcohol.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He was probably still
grinning at him from afar.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[But aren't you being
too cautious? It's one thing to simply install explosives, but is it really

heretics are truly terrifying."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Once the opponents'
locations were identified, Nina, who was inside the building, would give the
signal with a pre-determined line.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Gasta would activate
the remote ignition device, and the explosives he had planted the night before
would instill fear into the enemies. Nina would then use her unstable monster
act to force them to surrender, and the job would be done.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since this was a trick
that required precise coordination, this time Jin had to lead the entire
operation from outside the building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The other reason is
that it is better to work with a different party from time to time so as not to
unnecessarily increase the number of people who try to find out the
relationship between Jin and Nina.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">[...... Look, Jin.
Your beloved accomplice is walking towards you.]</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't tease me,
it's annoying. Can you not call me again until it's my turn?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Turning off the
walkie-talkie, Jin turned his attention to Nina, who was walking toward him
with her presence completely erased. The students, who were praising the
monster who had won a spectacular victory, seemed oblivious to the fact that
the person in question was here.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Nina, can
you please not invoke your monstrous skills every single time?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"EH, what are you
talking about?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Are you doing it
unknowingly......? Well, never mind."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">His accomplice, who
did not seem to be aware of the miracle she was currently performing, turned
her azure blue eyes towards him.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Next is your
turn, Jin. Who are you teaming up with?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A~, it's a guy
named Bailey from the same class. He forced me to work with him."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What kind of
psychic ability does he have?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I think it's
called &lt;Cowardly Hound&gt;. His sense of smell is enhanced to that of a
dog."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee, that sounds
like a perfect person for this test!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It doesn't
matter. I'm going to intentionally lose this time anyway."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina looked
unconvinced, but Jin explained in a nonchalant manner.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"My situation is different
from yours, where you have to win all the time as an overwhelmingly powerful
person. I'm being watched closely because I'm a rare user with the ability of
nullification, so I have to leave some room for maneuvering. If the target
won't even come close to me, everything will be all for naught."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt;,...... huh?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">In the past, Jin's
foster father, the legendary fraudster Rusty Yellowkid</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">ã‚ </span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Wale, had accidentally obtained some information when
he scammed a high-ranking government official, which led to his death by the
&lt;White Knights&gt;, the Empire's intelligence agency.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The journal he had
hidden away contained only fragments of various words, but Jin and his friends
sniffed out traces of a grand scheme being hatched by the Heiberg School and
the empire behind it.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In order to win the
game of uncovering the truth, Jin and his friends are searching for the
identity of the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;, a spy under Headmaster Jill Will
Weiser, who is also a member of the &lt;White Knights&gt;.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If the information is
correct, there is one &lt;shepherd's dog&gt; in each grade, and it is said that
they are in charge of secretly dealing with those who are doing harm to the
academy. In other words, if one could get in touch with this person, one might
be able to extract the school's secrets.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin's slanted eyes
flashed sharply.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"The
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt; will definitely come in contact with us in the
future."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"They're trying
to figure out whether we're a danger to the academy, ...... right?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If they identify
us as enemies, they will try to eliminate us without mercy. As far as I've
heard the news about the &lt;White Knights&gt; thoroughly killing all the enemy
spies and insurgents in the country, I don't think we can expect any human
compassion from the empire."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Speaking
of which, Jin..." Nina said, her whole body radiating anxiety, "When
you searched Bennett's room, you found a strange note, right?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What was left there
was a piece of paper with just one word written on it: [Nice to meet you].</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Could this be
a declaration of war from the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Had they
already discovered what we were up to?</span></i></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina clearly had a
look of anxiety on her face.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't worry. We
are still just under suspicion. They won't attack you, the daughter of the
Stingray family, without any evidence. ......At least, not until they have
conclusive evidence."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But we should be
suspicious of everyone who approaches us, right ......?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh, so you knew.
From now on, we'll keep doubting and distrusting everyone."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh, what a
lousy school life ......."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The two have already
attracted the attention of the entire school year after defeating Bennett Lohr,
one of the students exempted from the entrance exam. Even Jin, who had assumed
the air of a lone wolf, was being swarmed by students who wanted to hear his
tale of heroism.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">But there is no need
to search through the crowd of students one by one.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The candidates for the
&lt;shepherd's dog&gt; have been narrowed down to a certain extent.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina, let's
review again. What are the requirements to become a &lt;shepherd dog&gt;?</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"A child from a
family with close ties to the upper echelons of the empire. And also an
overwhelming ability to get rid of anyone who gets in the way."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina's expression
stiffened a little.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It's understandable.
The only people who would meet the requirements she just mentioned would be
those who were exempt from the entrance exam - monsters with supernatural
powers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"But how do they
plan to approach us?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I think they're
going to try to contact us right after school today."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Eh? Do you
have any basis for that?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"All the students
who are exempted from the entrance exam will be summoned by Instructor Isabella
after class today."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"W-Where did you
get that information from?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"From that handy
slav- ..." Jin cleared his throat once as he was about to say what he
really meant. "This information was leaked to us by that kind and gentle
Rudy-sensei, who has been so devoted to helping us out."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Ever since Jin and
Nina previously blackmailed him with a scam, Rudy, the history instructor, has
become Jin's puppet. For the most part, he must be coaxed to report every
suspicious activity in the instructor's office.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Jin, you
shouldn't treat him like a convenience tool too much!"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He begged me to
cooperate with him, you know? I'm doing this out of the kindness of my
heart."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh, I can
easily imagine the scene......"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He's the kind of guy
who would rub his head on the ground with impunity to get a debt collector to
let him off the hook. Down the road, if they were to be exposed as incompetent,
the relationship might not even change.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At that moment, a
voice over the loudspeaker called out Jin's name.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Shrugging his
shoulders in a troubled manner, the fraudster walked toward the old school
building.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't get
hurt, Jin."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh~, since when
did you become so overprotective?"</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-It's not that
I'm worried about you, but..."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Alright,
alright. Well, I'll just go out there and get defeated pretty badly."</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">At a school where
everyone is aiming to become a candidate for the &lt;White Knights&gt;, the
heroes of the country, only Jin is fighting on a completely different board.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina secretly felt a
sense of dependence on her accomplice, who has always been looking at the big
picture and is cleverly trying to manipulate even his own reputation.</span></p>


<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In front of the heavy
wooden door, which reminded her of its age, Nina took a deep breath.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">There are monsters lurking behind this door.</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The information Jin
had obtained was correct. After &lt;Hide and Seek&gt; was over, Nina was
summoned to this conference room by Isabella.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although she had not
met any of the students who had been exempted from the entrance exam except for
Bennett since the welcome party on the first day of school, Nina, who was not
as sharp-eared as Jin, had still heard a lot of bad rumors about them.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Don't
worry. There is no need to be scared."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina chanted in a
voice that no one could hear.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If anything, perhaps
she is the one who is feared the most.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a dangerous person
who has been infamous throughout the empire since childhood and who defeated
Bennett after only one month of enrollment, she will have to behave in a manner
befitting a truly dangerous person.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as she stepped
into the conference room, Nina gave a fearless smile to the four monsters
around the round table.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's been a
while, everyone. How have you been?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">They looked at her as
if they wanted to shoot her dead.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina desperately held
back her desire to scream and run away, and put on the act of a monster that
could unleash its murderous intent at any moment.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Sweat on the face is
strictly forbidden.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A monster without a
human heart must always observe its surroundings with a calm gaze.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... You're pretty
good at pretending to be a decent person, huh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The person who
suddenly hurled a sarcastic remark at her was a girl who was sitting arrogantly
with her legs up on the table.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She has short,
jet-blue colored hair that is trimmed at the base of her neck. Her healthy
tanned skin is free of makeup, and her slender but supple limbs fully reveal
her physical prowess. Her eyes, which were a fiery red, were staring straight
at her.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Karen Ashby, am
I right? I heard you're earning points at an amazing pace."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hee, it's nice
to be recognized by a celebrity like you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You don't have
to be so modest. You're probably the most prominent person in our grade right
now."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to the chart
posted in front of the classroom building the other day, Karen currently holds
the most points in the school year. This not only shows her ability but also
her aggressive nature in that she is willing to challenge students to a
&lt;duel&gt; without regard to their feelings.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">According to
information provided by Jin, she has an ability called &lt;Jolly
Underwriter&gt;, which specializes in destruction.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've always
wanted to talk to you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'd be honored,
but I'm not in the mood for that right now."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Ugh, your eyes scare me! Why are you getting so
involved with me!?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Normally, this is
someone one should never make an enemy of. Nina was doing her best to suppress
the feeling of wanting to start crying.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Now, now. You
two, please don't fight-"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">A male student sitting
in the back of the room interceded in a gentle voice.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Nina-chan, this
seat is empty. Here, have a seat."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"......Thank
you."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina searched for
information in her brain again.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Casper Crawford. His
distinctive red hair and round eyes give him the impression of a half-breed
somehow. Since the details of his abilities had not been revealed, she had
imagined him to be a shy and secretive person, so she felt as though she had
been betrayed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Thank God, there is someone who seems to be kind as
well .......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Her relief was
short-lived, and her expectations were shattered the moment she sat down next
to him.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wow, you're
really cute up close....... What do you think? Would you like to go out with
me?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Pardon......!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina brushed off the
hand that was about to wrap around her shoulder and glared at Casper.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If one were to look
closely, silver jewelry shone on his wrists and fingers, and a T-shirt with a
flamboyant design made an impact on his blazer.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">In short, he looked
exactly like a frivolous womanizer.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Huh? What's the
matter? You've gone quiet. Do you have a low tolerance for romance?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Please stop
messing with me."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Whoa, you
startled me! If you stare at me with such an intense gaze, you'll make me go
nuts......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'll kill you, I
swear."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Uhyoo! Hey, say
it again! This time look at me like I'm a piece of trash!"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina had never wished
that she had a psychic ability as much as she does now.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">If the psychokinesis
known as the &lt;Queen of Calamity&gt; were real, she would tear this man's
limbs apart right now, and then .......</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After a round of cruel
imaginations, Nina huffed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">I have to suspect everyone who approaches me.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as Jin had said
before.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The boy beside her
might actually be the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt;. He might be trying to catch her
off guard by making her think that he is just a helpless womanizer, but behind
the scenes, he might be calmly probing her.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Â </span>Â </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, Nina-chan.
When do you plan to respond to my confession?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You see,
Casper-san. I'm......."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Oh! Are you
flustered because it's so sudden? All right, I'll wait until you realize how
you really feel."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You lascivious
bastard!" a voice that made no attempt to hide its anger could be heard
from the other side of the round table. "Could you cut the crap, you
a*shole!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Karen Ashby, who had
previously confronted Nina, slammed the round table.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Casper, your
disease is going to pollute the atmosphere. It would be better for the world if
you were butchered right now."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Wha, that's a
terrible thing to say! I'm just excited about my new love!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's not even
love. It's just a fit of emotion."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"O-Of course
not......!"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Besides, you
flirted with my best friend the other day, remember? What the hell are you up
to?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I love
Satia-chan too, of course. And I want to go out with her."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haa......?"
Nina couldn't help but raise her voice as well.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's alright, I
can love everyone equally. You can surrender yourself to me with no
worries......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">*Crackle*.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The sound of crackling
ice echoed through the room.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All eyes were on the
object that appeared at the tip of Karen's outstretched palm. A translucent
mass no bigger than the tip of a pinky finger, glistening in the light of the
room.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">With a small sigh,
Casper raised both hands in surrender.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Haha,
Karen-chan...... don't tell me, you're going to use that in such a small
room?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's your fault
for making me angry."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm just
kidding, calm down. Some of us are going to die, you know?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Under the round table,
Nina was trying hard to hide the trembling in her knees.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">For ordinary people
like Nina, people with psychic abilities who can twist the laws of physics with
impunity are objects of terror.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Especially the four
people here were beyond even her comprehension.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">All of them have
powers equal to or greater than the fearsome Bennett.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">It is not just Karen,
who is about to go berserk, or Casper, who is smiling despite the murderous
intent directed at him. Alice Pearson, who maintains her fingernails without
worrying about such a perilous situation, and Gilrein Bloodnote, who wears a
tiger-patterned eye mask and is sleeping soundly, are also incomprehensible
monsters.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Ugh, I want to go home ....... I can't wait to take a
bath and go to bed early ......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As she cried behind
her fearless smile, a rescue party finally showed up.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instructor Isabella,
who entered the conference room with several armed subordinates in tow, said in
a cold voice.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Don't play
around without my permission, you monsters. Do you want to be expelled right
now?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After having her
subordinates lined up behind her, the instructor got straight to the main topic
without much of a prologue.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You know why I
gathered you guys here, right, you bastards?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina clearly felt that
Isabella was glaring at her, but she had no idea specifically why.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Could it be that she
has found out that Nina and Jin are not psychics?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">No, if that were the
case, there would be no need to gather the other students.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You know that
Bennett Rohr, who was exempted from the same entrance exam as you, was expelled
from school, right? After only one month of school at that. This is
unprecedented.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">You hear me? Think
about why you are being given special treatment. The reason we exempted you
from the entrance exam and gave you an initial 1000 points, which is far above
the average, is because you were supposed to help us weed out the pigs from the
pack. It would be fine if you were to drop out in a year or two, when there are
only the best and strongest left in your grade, but to be dropped at a time
like this is outrageous."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Instructor Isabella
was clearly meeting Nina's eyes as she spoke. Although she thought about
refuting her, it seemed unlikely that she would give her any room to interject.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Listen, you must
be aware that you are carrying the future of the empire on your shoulders. It
is unforgivable that, as a result of your careless actions, people who would
not normally have the ability to join the &lt;White Knights&gt; will survive
until the graduation ceremony."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina understood what
she meant.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Although Instructor
Isabella said a lot of things in a roundabout way, in essence, the reason why
they were gathered here was to put a nail in their head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The reason for this is
to make sure that the students who are exempted from the entrance examination
don't crush each other any further.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I understand~",
Casper replied with a goofy smile.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The others kept their
mouths shut, expressing indifference with their whole gestures. Everyone
present here was naturally aware of Instructor Isabella's true intentions.
But...</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">No one would ever follow this kind of advice.......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">What kind of attitude
should Nina take now, as she was being criticized?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">How can she protect
her image of an unstable monster?</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina constructs the
best course of action in her head.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As a conclusion, Nina
has to quietly leave the room, apparently.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... Where are
you going, Nina Stingray?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"To the student
dormitory. I feel like taking a quick shower."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"We're not done
talking yet, though, are we?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"If it's advice
worth heeding, I'm sure the rest of us will gladly heed it."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Your Insensitivity
has gone so far as to be a felony. I meant it as advice for you."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"When I was a
child, I learned about this in history class. Thirty years ago, at the end of
the war, the Empire was trying to reach a cease-fire agreement with the rival
Republic. And yet the skies over the capital were suddenly filled with the
white light of a new type of bomb."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What are you
implying?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Cease-fire
agreements are nonsense. I will not hesitate to fight whoever my opponent
is."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After taking one look
at all the people filling the round table, Nina continued.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"That's how it
is, everyone. Let's have a wonderful school life together from now on, shall
we?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â—‡</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Uuuuu .......
That was definitely too much ......."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">As soon as she reached
the hideout, Nina sat down on the concrete floor.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">The huge gymnasium on
the outskirts of the school grounds where Bennett used to hold tournaments for
low-achieving students. It is a useless place in this school, where no proper
sports are played in class, and there are no passersby around it. This was one
of the few spoils of war they had seized from the previous battle.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina took a rain frog
doll, dressed in a sequined suit, out of her bag and began to talk about
something as if she were clinging to it.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Gosh, no more
....... Of course everyone will target me if I declare war on them like that!
Why the hell did I do that!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">She gripped it too
tightly, and the rain frog's face became greatly distorted. But Nina was in the
depths of despair, so there was no way she could notice such a thing.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ah, right! Let's
go apologize to everyone right now......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, no, no, how
come you came to that conclusion?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Hyaaa~!?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she turned around
at the sudden voice, she saw Jin Kirihara, who was at the far end of the
warehouse, giving her a sarcastic look.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"H-How long have
you been there ......!?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I was sleeping
on a gymnastics mat, you see. ...... Or rather, have we had this kind of
exchange before?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina came to her
senses and hastily hid the doll in her bag.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's not like I
have a habit of talking to myself! This is just, you know, an exercise for my
acting......"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It looked so
genuine, though. It didn't look like an act at all."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I-Is that so?
Looks like I was able to pull it off."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, let's put
aside your mental condition for now and get to the point, shall we?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Ugh........."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Since any further
rebuttal would only make her miserable, Nina had no choice but to remain
silent.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">After watching her
face contorted in frustration with satisfaction, Jin spoke up.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"So, how was it?
The meeting with the monsters?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It was ......
tough, very tough."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina switched her mind
and explained in detail what had just happened.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">About the four members
of the entrance exam exemption group have a strong quirk. About Instructor
Isabella who clearly looked her in the eye and warned her. About her being had
no choice but to take a stubborn attitude against her own feelings.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well done. Full
marks for your performance."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Really? I feel
like I just made more enemies unnecessarily, though."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"It's fine. If
the &lt;shepherd's dog&gt; was among the four, you would finally recognized as
a great danger to the academy."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eh, shouldn't it
be a bad thing, ......?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"No, that's
fine", said Jin, his mouth twisted in a sly smile. "Let me tell you a
prediction. The &lt;shepherd's dog&gt; is going to ask you to form an alliance
with him/her."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Eeeh?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I've told you
before, from now on you must be suspicious of everyone who approaches you.
Behind the smile on their face, they may be probing us. Therefore, we have to
clear their suspicions and at the same time extract useful information from
them. This is a very difficult mission."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">"Wait a second,
Jin. Is it really going to be like what you predicted?</span><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">ã€€</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">When I left, everyone was in a very bad mood, you
know?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Then, wanna bet?
If one of the exempted students contacts you today, you have to do me a favor.
If my prediction were to fail, Nina can ask for something from me too."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"How is that even
a fair bet? ......"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Just as she was about
to agree, Nina realized that she was being deceived.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">This is how Jin always acts.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When this fraudster
offers such a proposal, he must already be fully prepared to win the bet.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... That was
close. Jin, you already figured something out, didn't you?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Tch, you caught
me. Even though it was so close."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I'm not your
accomplice for nothing."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina felt proud for
some reason. Of course, she did not think it was a good thing for her to
develop such a liar's mindset.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Suddenly, Nina noticed
that Jin was staring at her with a satisfied expression.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... What is
it?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"You see, my
impression of you has changed a lot since the first time we met. You're
starting to get the hang of it, just like a professional fraudster."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"What's up with
that?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"I mean, you're a
lot better now."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, umm ......
huh?"</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">When she was praised
like this, her eyes became unfocused.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Then she recalled the
faint feeling she had become aware of after the fight with Bennett. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">Couldn't that
possibly be a momentary lapse of thought?</span></i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;"></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">...... No, it
can't be.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><i><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin has been a
fraudster ever since I can remember, and he certainly knows how to get inside
people's heads. To be swayed like this, I'm still a failure as a scammer.</span></i></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Nina somehow managed
to regain her composure.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... So, Jin.
Who is it that's trying to contact me?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Casper Crawford.
Last night, he suddenly sat down in front of me in the cafeteria."</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="background-color: black; font-family: arial;"><i><span lang="JA" style="line-height: 200%;">â”€</span></i><i><span lang="EN-US" style="line-height: 200%;">That man, huh .......</span></i></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">He regarded the
tension-filled conference room as nothing more than a hook-up spot, and it was
easy for her to imagine him approaching her with a nonchalant look on his face.</span></p>



<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Certainly, that
man is suspicious."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Right?
Casper-kun is the first suspect I've identified."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"...... So, what
do you want me to do?"</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"Well, for the
time being, I guess you'll just have to do what he wants."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">Jin said so in a voice
that contained a hint of dismay.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 200%; margin-bottom: 0cm; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span style="font-family: arial;">"He wants an
alliance with you."</span></p>
