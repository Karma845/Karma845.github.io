<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 3: A Place of Memories: Sensei&#8217;s Room</h2>
<p>After the final exams, it was Monday.</p>
<p>Mori Kawara Academy had quickly concluded the first semester&#8217;s lessons and was shifting towards preparing for the orientation.</p>
<p>Due to it being the last morning assembly of the semester, there were reminders about staying safe over the summer break. It was the standard message from the nearest police and fire station about avoiding incidents and accidents.</p>
<p>The students lined up listened quietly, but their expressions were somewhat cheerful.</p>
<p>My ex-girlfriend had messaged me saying, &#8220;The students you teach have such a long summer break, must be nice~&#8221;. I shared the sentiment. We can no longer experience that uplifting feeling again.</p>
<p>After the teachers&#8217; announcements, it was said, &#8220;There&#8217;s a message from the student council for everyone,&#8221; and the stage was passed on to Kirihara.</p>
<p>Adjusting the microphone&#8217;s height and angle with practiced ease, Kirihara began to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;As mentioned, during the summer break, it&#8217;s not uncommon for students to get involved in accidents and incidents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Even though we might feel more relaxed during the long break, let&#8217;s remain mindful of our actions and uphold our responsibilities as students.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara, having said this, had been quite relaxed herself these past two days.</p>
<p>Whether it was due to her father&#8217;s phone call or jealousy towards Kurei-san, she declared, &#8220;I won&#8217;t be apart from the teacher this weekend,&#8221; and she did exactly that.</p>
<p>Being close in bed was a given, and the same went for when we were playing games in the living room or resting on the sofa; we were constantly together.</p>
<p>Even while boiling somen noodles, she&#8217;d cling to me by wrapping her arms around my neck and sticking to my back. Despite it being summer, and both of us sweating constantly, she didn&#8217;t mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara, if you don&#8217;t stop, you&#8217;ll really catch a cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine. I like being close. It&#8217;s comforting.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I tried to gently shake her off, she would murmur, &#8220;Is it not okay?&#8221; making it really troublesome. That was definitely on purpose..</p>
<p>Giving in to her closeness resulted in pain throughout my body. Unlike the youthful Kirihara, I, a working adult, suffer from chronic exercise deficiency.</p>
<p>Kirihara, who enjoys our impure relationship, was advising &#8220;student-like behavior&#8221; in front of the whole student body, making the world truly unpredictable.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, the silently lined-up female students also harbor their own secrets.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a final note, the period leading up to the summer break and until the orientation on the first day will be a preparation period. For the first-year students, this will be their first event. The main event will be the autumn cultural festival, but please enjoy the preparations as well. I ask the upperclassmen to support any freshmen who may be struggling&#8230; That is all. Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;perfect Kirihara-san&#8221; finished her duties and stepped down from the stage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei, could you please close the stage curtain after the assembly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the students began to leave the gym, I headed up to the stage to fulfill the task requested by my senior colleague.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the stage wing, I heard a voice from behind me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Together, we pulled the stage curtain, which was made similarly to regular curtains.</p>
<p>Once closed, we were out of sight.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of that, Kirihara hugged me and buried her head against me.</p>
<p>(&#8230;What are you doing?)</p>
<p>(Charging up.)</p>
<p>(We&#8217;ve been stuck together all weekend.)</p>
<p>(I still want more. It&#8217;s strange. I just want to cling and be pampered; it feels like I&#8217;m about to explode.)</p>
<p>Looking up at me with moist eyes, she said,</p>

<p>(I really wanted to take a break and spend the day just with you.)</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t ask for the impossible&#8230; We&#8217;ll be suspected if we&#8217;re late. Let&#8217;s go.)</p>
<p>(&#8230;Okay.)</p>
<p>Reluctantly detaching herself, Kirihara moved ahead.</p>

<p>&#8230;A cute sneeze echoed through the gym.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine, don&#8217;t worry. Rather, we need to hurry with the mock shop preparations. There&#8217;s so much to do with signboards, stall layouts, and more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pulled by the hand, we moved out of the gym.</p>
<p>Would a normal teacher and student do this&#8230;?</p>
<p>Back in the classroom, I passed on to the students the instructions I had received from my senior colleagues about the mock shop for the orientation.</p>
<p>The mock shop during the orientation is led by students, but the initial broad details must be explained by the homeroom teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;First off, as a result of the lottery, we&#8217;ve been allocated teppanyaki equipment. We&#8217;ll be making okonomiyaki and yakisoba&#8230; Well, I didn&#8217;t actually draw the lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Why not?&#8221; a voice asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I submitted it just before the deadline, so as a punishment, we got leftovers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And we struck gold,&#8221; Kirihara remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teppanyaki is a jackpot among mock shops.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Seems so.&#8221;</p>
<p>After all, okonomiyaki and yakisoba have cheap ingredients.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re easy to make, affordable, and profitable.</p>
<p>I relied on them often during my student days.</p>
<p>&#8220;Also, as other teachers have said, it&#8217;s hard for students to be idle with this setup. There are roles for chopping vegetables in the home economics room, mass-producing batter, cooking on the teppanyaki grill at the stall, drawing customers, serving, cleaning up&#8230; That should cover it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glancing at Kirihara, she nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Good. I got it right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have one week until the event. Decide whether to keep the roles fixed or rotate them by then. Also, there&#8217;s the stall setup. Making the signboard, menu, preparing paper plates, chopsticks&#8230; That&#8217;s it for my part. The rest is up to you guys to decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? That&#8217;s it? Aren&#8217;t we going to appoint a class representative?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s up to you students as well. If you want to decide, go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some students groaned, &#8220;Ugh, so much work,&#8221; while others noted, &#8220;Last year&#8217;s class did the same.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Appointing a representative will definitely make things easier. Plus, we have Kirihara-san in our class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone mentioned, and others agreed, &#8220;Yeah, Kirihara is the student council president; she knows what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>As expected, it came down to that.</p>
<p>Feeling the expectation, Kirihara nodded and said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood up and walked to the platform. I gave her the spot and moved to the window side.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot to decide, but first, we need to choose what to make our sign and menu from. Simply because the school has a limited supply of wood! Do we use cardboard and poster paper, or make something a bit more stylish with wood? It&#8217;ll cost more, but if it&#8217;s too much trouble, buying lots of small blackboards from the 100-yen store is also an option!&#8221;</p>
<p>Her adept handling of the situation was impressive.</p>

<p>By the way, if the preparations for the day are finished, it&#8217;s a period when it&#8217;s okay to go home early, so taking it easy and resting is totally acceptable.</p>
<p>This also sparked a minor divide in opinions, but it was quickly decided that at least the stand&#8217;s signboard should be made properly using wood.</p>
<p>It was decided to manage the menu boards with blackboards from the 100-yen store.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, could someone please go and get some wood? If it looks suitable for the signboard, feel free to take extra. We can always return what&#8217;s not used. Anyone willing to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara led everyone, efficiently making various decisions.</p>
<p>She quickly consolidated opinions regarding the division of roles for the day, deciding to &#8220;go with a rotation,&#8221; and as she roughly remembered last year&#8217;s visitor numbers and the sales of each mock shop, she quickly decided on how many paper plates and chopsticks to prepare.</p>
<p>It was also Kirihara who suggested dividing the rotation groups by drawing lots to be fair, saying, &#8220;If friends group together, work won&#8217;t get done, and besides, it would be tough for anyone who can&#8217;t fit into a group.&#8221; Several students quietly nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>The dates and members for shopping were also decided, so all that was left was to draw the group lots and make the signboard.</p>

<p>As making the signboard was not a task for everyone, they sought volunteers for the signboard-making team and decided on that.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Maybe those not in the signboard-making and shopping teams can take a break until the day of the event?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s suggestion caused a buzz in the class.</p>
<p>She had already been respected by all classmates for her active role in the homeroom, but today, she had completely won everyone over.</p>
<p>Kirihara herself looked satisfied, smiling faintly, with everything going smoothly.</p>
<p>But I felt a sense of disagreement.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wood procurement team is back, so let&#8217;s make the draw for the group division. Could someone write down everyone&#8217;s numbers on a loose leaf and hand it to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara&#8221;</p>
<p>At my call, Kirihara stopped speaking.</p>
<p>The class also reacted with a &#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara, let me see your hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a puzzled look, Kirihara did as I asked.</p>

<p>I touched the hand she held out.</p>
<p>The other students leaned in, curious.</p>
<p>&#8220;…&#8221;</p>
<p>As I touched her hand, I moved my other hand to touch Kirihara&#8217;s forehead, then her neck, in order.</p>
<p>Misinterpreting what was happening, another girl screamed in shock.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have a fever, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment, Kirihara made a hard-to-describe face. It was a mix of surprise and sadness&#8230; Truly, an indescribable expression.</p>
<p>It quickly faded, replaced by a forced smile, but her knees gave way first.</p>
<p>Another girl screamed, this time in alarm. The boys also started to make a fuss.</p>
<p>I knelt beside Kirihara, who had fallen on her rear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. Just now, when you said that, I just lost my strength.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her voice was weak, and her breathing shallow. She also looked unwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Health committee member!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they&#8217;re off today.&#8221;</p>
<p>A boy nearby informed me. Right, there was one absent.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Then, I&#8217;ll take her. In the meantime, finish the group division. Someone draw for Kirihara and the absentee. Once done, everyone but the signboard team can go home. &#8230;Can you stand?&#8221;</p>
<p>Supporting her, Kirihara managed to stand up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take care.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls voiced their concern, to which Kirihara only nodded in response.</p>

<p>As we left the classroom and headed into the hallway, Kirihara whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was nothing for her to apologize for.</p>
<p>Without responding, I hurried to the infirmary.</p>
<p>Upon arrival, the female school nurse immediately prepared a bed.</p>
<p>I explained the situation while helping Kirihara onto the bed, and had her temperature taken.</p>
<p>&#8220;…38.6 degrees. Definitely a fever.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was quite high.</p>
<p>No wonder she felt dizzy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei, could you please contact her guardians to come pick her up using the staff room phone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood. I&#8217;ll go now.&#8221;</p>
<p>I quickly moved to the staff room, traced Kirihara&#8217;s parents&#8217; contact details from the student registry, and found the workplace number listed, not a mobile number. It&#8217;s rare since usually, mobile numbers are listed.</p>
<p>For starters, I tried calling her mother.</p>
<p>The phone was answered before it even rang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for calling Crystal Talent Agency, Kusakai speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;A talent agency?</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry. My name is Hajima, a teacher at Mori Kawara Academy. Excuse me, but is there a guardian of Kirihara Touka-san working there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara&#8230; I&#8217;m terribly sorry. You must be referring to the agency&#8217;s representative, Kirihara, but she is currently in a meeting&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Touka-san has collapsed due to a high fever. If possible, could someone come to pick her up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Understood. Could you please hold on for a moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was put on hold, accompanied by music. After what felt like nearly ten minutes&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to keep you waiting. Naruse-san will be sent by car to pick her up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is there a problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, um&#8230; Who is this Naruse-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an employee of the agency. Would it be an issue if he&#8217;s not a family member?&#8221;</p>
<p>Not exactly&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um?&#8221;</p>
<p>There were aspects that made me hesitant, but I was sure explaining to her would be futile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood. If you&#8217;re coming by car, please use the back gate parking lot instead of the main gate. There&#8217;s security, but I&#8217;ll explain the situation. I apologize for the inconvenience, but could you ask Naruse-san to bring identification? Due to recent concerns about security, we request identification&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood. I&#8217;ll pass on the message. Please wait for his arrival.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even after hanging up, I was haunted by an uneasy feeling.</p>

<p>Still feeling unsettled, I went to the back gate to inform the security guard before heading back to the infirmary.</p>
<p>When I relayed to the school nurse what I had discussed over the phone, she was shocked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her own daughter&#8217;s ill and she&#8217;s not coming to pick her up herself?&#8221;</p>
<p>She whispered this, perhaps out of concern for Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s fine. There&#8217;s no use telling you. Could you keep an eye on Kirihara-san for a bit? I have an urgent matter to discuss with the principal regarding supplies.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>After I replied, the school nurse hurried out of the infirmary.</p>
<p>Now, it was just me and Kirihara in the infirmary.</p>






<p>Kirihara was lying in a bed at the far end, behind a curtain.</p>
<p>Voices of students frolicking could be heard from outside the window.</p>
<p>…I quietly walked closer and peeked at Kirihara through the gap in the curtain.</p>
<p>Our eyes met.</p>
<p>Her eyes, which had been slightly open, widened to their usual size. She smiled at me in relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you come closer?&#8221;</p>
<p>Invited by her, I walked to the side of the bed. I left the curtain closed.</p>
<p>This way, even if someone came in, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to see us. I pulled up a backless chair nearby and sat down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Lying down has made me feel a lot better. It was quite a shock, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kind of. Have you been feeling unwell for a while?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm… I knew I wasn&#8217;t feeling great. But I didn&#8217;t think I had such a high fever.&#8221;</p>





<p>Her voice lacked its usual energy, and small beads of sweat were visible on her forehead. She truly looked unwell.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;From the morning, the day after you went out drinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, sleeping naked wasn&#8217;t a good idea after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems so. I&#8217;ll think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Wait a minute. When you said you actually wanted to take the day off today in the gym, was it because you were feeling unwell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have taken a rest… The exams are over, it wouldn&#8217;t have mattered if you took a day off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh… But you know…&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara started fidgeting midway through.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Covering the lower half of her face with a blanket, she bashfully confessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a lot to decide for the orientation, right? I thought if I took a day off, you might have a hard time again&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Such a thing&#8230; The words of denial reached the tip of my tongue, but since she actually helped me, I couldn&#8217;t say anything.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not as familiar with school matters as Kirihara, nor could I have made decisions as swiftly as her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t just for you. I also thought if we decided everything quickly, we could spend more time together at my house again with some ulterior motives.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…I see. Sorry. And thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seemingly reassured by my sincere acceptance of her kindness, Kirihara smiled happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. I did it because I wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I stroked her head, her eyes squinted as if tickled. She looked like a cat.</p>
<p>Her forehead felt slightly warmer than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Hey, can you kiss me?&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t an unexpected wish. Somehow, I had sensed that might be the mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, but, because of the fever, it might be contagious. Never mind. —Hmm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without a word, I moved closer and gently pressed my lips to hers.</p>
<p>Her tongue tenderly reached out, and I softly welcomed it.</p>
<p>We kept our lips together quietly, carefully not to make a sound, and then quietly parted.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Ehehe, I&#8217;m happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Perhaps due to the fever, her tone was more childlike than usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, sensei… just for a bit, like last time… could you please touch my sweet spot?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but since this morning, my body feels weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s because of the fever, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that… it&#8217;s like… that feeling…&#8221;</p>
<p>Her cheeks flushed red as she pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hold it back because I&#8217;m feeling unwell… you don&#8217;t have to do it too strongly… I&#8217;m not sure I can be quiet…&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hand, stretched out from the gap in the blanket, pulled my arm inside. Guided further into the warmth, my hand reached inside her clothes. The slightly moist sensation of sweat surprised me a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little bit… please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;…Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>I searched around her stomach, but it seemed that wasn&#8217;t quite it. Relying on my memory, I explored towards her back, and she responded with a small &#8220;Mm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Instead of being aggressive like before, I stroked her gently, caringly, and slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Ahn~,&#8221; She moaned softly, as if sinking into a warm bath, and let out a gentle breath.</p>
<p>Her eyes, moist and shining, kept gazing at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Sensei, you&#8217;re good at this. I was surprised last time&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am older than you, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true… Ahn~ Mmmn… really, you&#8217;re really good…&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeing her brows furrow in a pained expression made me feel strange too.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is bad… I thought a little would be okay, but now I want more… my body is so hot…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, you&#8217;re sweating way too much. I&#8217;m going to take off the blanket a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pulled back the blanket and inspected her visually. Her wet inner shirt was clinging to her belly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re drenched in sweat. We should wipe this off. Isn&#8217;t there a towel in the infirmary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It should be on the supply list, so it&#8217;s probably somewhere…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Ah. Found it. Over there, on that shelf.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the top shelf behind a glass door, white towels were neatly stacked. I borrowed a couple and returned to the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wipe you off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no, it&#8217;s fine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No way. You&#8217;re sick with a fever, be still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No… it&#8217;s embarrassing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was the one asking to be touched earlier?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s different, I must smell bad now&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was sticking to me all weekend?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s different at home… I haven&#8217;t wiped off since this morning, and it&#8217;s stuffy under the blanket… I&#8217;ve never sweated this much in front of sensei…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just be quiet and let me do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the school nurse&#8217;s absence, I carefully wiped inside her clothes. Whether it felt good because she was unwell or because of the wiping, Kirihara soon resigned herself to it.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Sensei, you&#8217;re really mean. A demon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t say I feel too threatened with you talking like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips curled childishly. No good. Kirihara with a fever is just too cute.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;By the way, were you able to talk to Mom?&#8221;</p>
<p>To cover up her embarrassment, the topic suddenly changed. Recalling the content of the phone call earlier, I found myself at a loss for words. But&#8230; even if I lied out of consideration, if someone else came to pick her up, it would eventually be discovered.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I couldn&#8217;t talk to your parents, but they said someone else would come to pick you up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Naruse-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; sort of. She&#8217;s Mom&#8217;s secretary. A woman. Sometimes, she brings school documents Mom wrote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are you sad that your mom couldn&#8217;t come?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, really. We&#8217;d just end up fighting anyway.&#8221;</p>






<p>Kirihara&#8217;s face, which had been relaxed, became serious again.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sensei, how did you know I had a fever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;re always together, of course, I&#8217;d notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see. Is that normal?&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something you wouldn&#8217;t say unless you didn&#8217;t know what being normal is.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really do look after me, huh&#8230; Do you care about me?&#8221;</p>
<p>For a moment, I was at a loss for words. I care, but it&#8217;s not my place to say so.</p>
<p>This is a school, I&#8217;m a teacher, and Kirihara is a student.</p>
<p>But, if we put all that aside──the answer was clear.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s eyes moistened.</p>
<p>From the gap between the futon and the bed, a hand reached out, searching for mine.</p>





<p>When I took her hand, she gripped it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ahn~ no good. After all, it&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, my feelings for Sensei, they&#8217;ve grown so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grip on my hand tightened.</p>
<p>As if she didn&#8217;t want to let go.</p>
<p>&#8220;When the cold gets better, it&#8217;ll probably be summer vacation, right? Then, we&#8217;ll have more time to spend together, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So then, when that time comes &#8230;shall we? Go all the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought about various things. In the short time it took to reply, really, various things.</p>
<p>With a deliberately cheerful tone to reprimand her, I flicked her forehead, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get ahead of yourself just because you&#8217;re feeling vulnerable.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But you indulged my selfishness earlier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a different things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara started to say something, but, at the wrong (or right?) moment, the school nurse returned.</p>
<p>I also stood up, ready to report on Kirihara&#8217;s condition.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks to you, I&#8217;m relieved. Hajima-sensei, please return to your class.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the school nurse&#8217;s words, I left the infirmary.</p>
<p>For several days, until the cold got better, I had no direct contact with Kirihara.</p>
<p>＊＊＊</p>

<p><strong>Kirihara&#8217;s PoV</strong></p>
<p>&#8230;After Sensei left, the infirmary felt incredibly suffocating.</p>
<p>The nurse only said, &#8220;Just lie down quietly,&#8221; and without my smartphone, there was really nothing to do. I had a bit of a headache, so sleeping was difficult too.</p>
<p>Staring at the infirmary&#8217;s white ceiling, I thought──about Gin, after all.</p>


<p>That he didn&#8217;t make a move despite being tempted was surprising.</p>
<p>It couldn&#8217;t be that I lacked appeal. He must hold some affection for me. There&#8217;s no mistake about that. I felt deep affection from all his gentle interactions.</p>
<p>──Men will make a move the moment you let your guard down.</p>
<p>At least, that&#8217;s how it&#8217;s always been until now.</p>
<p>There are no signs of him having someone else.</p>
<p>Even though Gin himself should feel lonely, he&#8217;s truly, incredibly stubborn.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like his fear of destroying his teacher&#8217;s pride was holding him back, but lately, even that boundary seems to be shaking.</p>
<p>Yet, Gin stubbornly refuses to get involved with me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really care about me&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara-san? Did you say something?&#8221;</p>
<p>My soft mutter seemed to have been overheard by the infirmary nurse.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing,&#8221; I replied while thinking, but, Gin&#8230;&#8230;this time in my heart.</p>
<p>Right now, this situation is like being kept alive in agony.</p>
<p>Until Naruse-san comes to pick me up, I kept thinking.</p>
<p>About summer vacation. How to make my move.</p>
<p>How to win him over.</p>

<p>──Just you wait, Gin.</p>
<p>＊＊＊</p>
<p><strong>Gin&#8217;s PoV</strong></p>
<p>In the end, Kirihara ended up spending a week recovering at home.</p>
<p>The class was preparing for the model store presentation.</p>
<p>Though, since Kirihara had mostly arranged everything beforehand, the classmates merely needed to follow their roles for the preparations to be completed.</p>
<p>During that time, Kirihara and I exchanged messages personally.</p>
<p>It seemed her condition was gradually improving.</p>
<p>I asked if she wanted me to visit and look after her, but was refused with, &#8220;Thanks. But Naruse-san occasionally visits, so it&#8217;s difficult now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without seeing Kirihara, time passed.</p>
<p>We met again on the day of the presentation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara-san, you must be tired. Are you okay now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Being worried by a classmate she hadn&#8217;t seen in a while, Kirihara looked embarrassed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while for me too, so I should greet her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara. Are you okay now?&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment, Kirihara visibly froze. She lowered her head as if hiding her flushed face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about that time. I&#8217;m okay now. I have to go prepare for the mock shop!&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke rapidly and then ran off. As I stood there dumbfounded, my smartphone vibrated. It was a message from Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sorry. When I saw you face to face, I suddenly felt embarrassed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Embarrassed about what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About that time. I was weird because of the cold, right? I said so many strange things&#8230; And being sweaty and seen like that was embarrassing! Despite me saying stop, you wiped it off! Demon!&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s a straightforward reaction. My ex-girlfriend in college was quite something too&#8230; but I&#8217;ll never understand women&#8217;s hearts.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kirihara&#8217;s strange behavior was only towards me.</p>
<p>In the group rotation for the mock shop work, she seemed to have gotten along well with her group members, looking happy.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t always watching Kirihara, but she seemed to enjoy calling people in for the mock shop and cooking in the home economics room.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s not particularly gifted at cooking, but it seems she can handle making a set menu without any problems.</p>

<p>I was bustling about with the students, serving our mock shop and carrying goods, just as busy as they were. Amidst all this, I was called by the principal, &#8220;Hajima-sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The students in your class are under my watch for now, so please take a look around the school. It&#8217;ll be good for you to see, considering next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wanted a break anyway, so the timing was perfect.</p>
<p>So, I walked around the lively school grounds.</p>
<p>The students stood out, but so did the middle schoolers and their guardians who seemed to be visiting for an explanatory session.</p>
<p>The session had ended, so the atmosphere was entirely that of a cultural festival.</p>
<p>The students from each class were drawing in visitors, playfully interacting with friends from other classes they happened across.</p>
<p>Some students, seemingly on a break, were visiting shops with their close friends.</p>





<p>&#8230;If Kirihara and I had a normal relationship, could we have walked side by side too?</p>
<p>Such thoughts momentarily crossed my mind when I thought I saw Kirihara out of the corner of my eye.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a mistake.</p>
<p>She was walking toward the gymnasium, weaving through the crowd as if to avoid it.</p>
<p>Could she be feeling unwell again?</p>
<p>Concerned, I followed her.</p>
<p>Kirihara passed straight through the main door leading inside the gym and headed towards the back.</p>
<p>As I turned the corner, I saw Kirihara&#8217;s back as she waved her hand.</p>
<p>A male student, who seemed to have been waiting for her, was waving back nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N-no, I&#8217;m sorry. Even though it&#8217;s break time&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Tanaka from our class.</p>





<p>To put it bluntly, he&#8217;s&#8230; well, not to speak ill of him, but he has a rather plain, ordinary mob face. Not that I&#8217;m one to talk.</p>
<p>&#8230;Could they be secretly dating?</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you want to talk about?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230; actually, I&#8217;ve been thinking I like Kirihara-san for a while now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems I was mistaken.</p>
<p>&#8220;And after seeing you during homeroom and the explanatory session, I was totally smitten&#8230; I mean, I always thought you were cool as the student council president, but I fell for you all over again!&#8221;</p>
<p>Tanaka was so nervous, you could almost feel it.</p>
<p>But he was trying his best to convey his feelings in his own words.</p>
<p>And then—</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you&#8230; go out with me!?&#8221;</p>
<p>He said it.</p>
<p>I honestly found myself rethinking my opinion of him, he&#8217;s braver than I thought.</p>
<p>At the same time, I felt apologetic for ending up eavesdropping.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t see Kirihara&#8217;s expression as she was being confessed to.</p>
<p>What kind of face was she making now?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Thank you. I&#8217;m really happy to hear your feelings, but&#8230; I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara bowed her head politely.</p>
<p>Tanaka was visibly shocked by her response.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, that&#8217;s it&#8230; Yeah, I guess, I&#8217;m not noticeable&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Your confession was wonderful. And it&#8217;s not that I dislike you, Tanaka-kun. In fact, I like you. You&#8217;re always doing your best even when no one&#8217;s watching. That&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. &#8230;But, I&#8217;m sorry. There&#8217;s someone else I like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see. Is it someone from our class? Someone I know?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara didn&#8217;t answer. I still couldn&#8217;t see her expression from where I was standing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry. If you don&#8217;t want to answer, it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, thank you for your concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing&#8230; Well, I should be going now!&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Tanaka could turn this way, I managed to hide my body. I wanted to find a good hiding spot, but there wasn&#8217;t any suitable place.</p>

<p>So, I stood in front of the gym&#8217;s main door, pretending to be &#8220;just taking a break,&#8221; and made an innocent face.</p>
<p>Tanaka, shocked from being turned down, didn&#8217;t even notice I was there as he ran off. &#8230;However, the next person to come wouldn&#8217;t be so oblivious.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, Sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>A few dozen seconds after Tanaka left.</p>
<p>Kirihara, who turned the corner, looked genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Why are you here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still embarrassed, her tone was in &#8220;honor student mode,&#8221; maybe she was just being cautious of others around?</p>
<p>&#8220;The principal told me to take a look around the school for next year&#8230; It&#8217;s my break time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I explained in a calm tone, but Kirihara kept staring at me intently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you, by any chance, see?&#8221; Kirihara reverted to her mischievous mode.</p>
<p>&#8220;See what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see Tanaka-kun running off?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, now that you mention it&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara kept staring at me, and I silently accepted her gaze.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kirihara grinned mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You saw? Me kissing Tanaka-kun?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hah?, Its different right?!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, you did see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Damn, it was a trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Peeking, that&#8217;s terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to. I followed you thinking you might be feeling unwell again, and it just happened&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh. You were worried about me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice&#8230; You&#8217;re kind. Hehe. I&#8217;m happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>After beaming with genuine joy, Kirihara&#8217;s face turned mischievous again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a little jealous watching me being confessed to, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I should have just said no, but I couldn&#8217;t respond immediately.</p>
<p>When I mistakenly thought Tanaka and she were dating, a feeling akin to panic had indeed surfaced, which wasn&#8217;t a lie.</p>
<p>Seeing me struggle for words, Kirihara exclaimed in surprise, &#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You did? Get jealous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you got a bit flustered?&#8221;</p>


<p>How does she read me so accurately? Is she some kind of esper?</p>
<p>Or is it that my feelings are just that easy to read without my realizing it?</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow&#8230; Ah&#8230; No way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara covered her cheeks with her hands.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/embed0010_HD.jpg" />

<p>&#8220;You seem pretty happy about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to hide her grin, but it was evident she couldn&#8217;t contain her pleasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m happy. Because&#8230; it means you feel the same way, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>She must be referring to the time i went drinking with Kurei-san.</p>
<p>Kirihara smiled happily, stretched a bit, and whispered to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I love you, Gin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;We&#8217;re in the middle of school.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly reverting to her good girl mode, Kirihara walked away.</p>
<p>Lately, I think both Kirihara and I have been too lax&#8230; We need to be more careful.</p>

<p>Afterward, the orientation concluded without a hitch.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the mock shop were to be stored in the student council room&#8217;s safe after cleanup was completed.</p>
<p>At Kirihara&#8217;s request, I delivered the money just before school was dismissed.</p>
<p>The other classes had all finished their tasks. Kirihara was the only one left in the student council room.</p>
<p>For a little while, we could talk without worrying about prying eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work, Sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good work to you too, Kirihara. The student council work must be tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm-mm. Since I got to leave class duties early, not really.&#8221;</p>






<p>Kirihara counted the money with practiced hands, then entered the amounts into the ledger. Perhaps the incident behind the gym had reset her attitude towards me back to normal.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s amazing. Our class made the most sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s thanks to Kirihara. Since the preparation was done early, everything went smoothly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu. It&#8217;s convenient to have someone who knows a lot about school matters, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Really.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did I manage to be helpful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know you did, even without asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But still, you can&#8217;t help want to be praised, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara looked at me expectantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You helped a lot. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. And my reward?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t prepare one.&#8221;</p>





<p>&#8220;Yeah, I figured. So, there&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to request or rather, something I want to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>Grinning, Kirihara awaited my reaction.</p>
<p>I had a very bad feeling. As expected, Kirihara said something outrageous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tomorrow&#8217;s a holiday, right? I want to visit Gin&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>
<p>●</p>
<p>&#8230;The next day.</p>
<p>As the news and weather forecast predicted the year&#8217;s first intense hot day, I was sweating coldly at the station closest to my home.</p>
<p>As the train&#8217;s arrival time sent via message approached, my tension increased even further.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry to keep you waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>A familiar voice came from the girl who looked like a gyaru and tapped me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Her hair was chestnut-colored, with eyeshadow, false eyelashes, a light touch of cheek, and sunglasses perched on her forehead.</p>
<p>If she had been silent, I would have never guessed she was Kirihara, dressed so differently.</p>
<p>The bare legs extending from her sleeveless shirt and shorts were dazzling, a stark contrast to her school uniform.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Women are terrifying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ahaha. Makeup is amazing, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara easily wrapped her arms around mine. &#8230;Well, if she&#8217;s this unrecognizable, it&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>&#8220;I learned to do makeup while I had a cold, from Naruse-san. Apparently, she used to specialize in makeup.&#8221;</p>


<p>Kirihara&#8217;s expression was very bright. Or rather, she seemed quite excited.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it far from the station?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About a five-minute walk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s close. I&#8217;m excited♪&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a normal one-room apartment, you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried every possible way to convince her, mentioning that my place wasn&#8217;t cleaned, it was small, and I only had one futon, but Kirihara wouldn&#8217;t budge.</p>
<p>She cut off my concerns about being seen by someone with &#8220;I have a secret plan. I&#8217;ll make sure we won&#8217;t be caught.&#8221; Probably, her secret plan was the makeup.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m walking around in my usual clothes without disguising myself. If seen by a neighbor while disguised, it would attract more attention. Even if seen, it would just seem like I have a somewhat flashy girlfriend.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, your bag seems pretty heavy; what&#8217;s in it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara was carrying a travel-sized carry case. It was a compact type for short trips, but too large for just a change of clothes and disguise tools. The stay was supposed to be just for today&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a surprise for tonight. I hope you&#8217;ll be happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite feeling an ominous aura, Kirihara spoke with a lively voice, truly looking happy.</p>
<p>I felt it unbecoming to pry further and walked in silence. Though I had my reservations, walking arm in arm with Kirihara wasn&#8217;t too bad.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse the intrusion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon arriving at my room, Kirihara gazed around the interior with curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh, hmm,&#8221; she mumbled, looking around with interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite clean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cleaned up. Don&#8217;t look too much. It&#8217;s not that interesting, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, not at all. Besides, Gin, you were looking all over my house the first time. With pervy eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you were. I was so embarrassed.&#8221;</p>


<p>While bantering, Kirihara took off her flashy clothes and changed into room wear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well then&#8230; shall we play a game?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, this is what the two of us ended up doing alone.</p>
<p>The game system allowed for cross-play with mobile devices, so Kirihara played with me on a small screen.</p>
<p>It was the opposite of usual.</p>
<p>Though we were doing the same thing as always, having Kirihara in my room felt refreshingly new.</p>
<p>As the evening approached, I reheated the prepared meal to satisfy our hunger.</p>
<p>During that time, Kirihara stood up, saying, &#8220;Actually, I&#8217;ve brought something good.&#8221;</p>
<p>What came out of that carry case was a can of chu-hai. (tln : japanese beer can , Chūhai, an abbreviation of &#8220;shōchū highball&#8221;, is an alcoholic drink originating from Japan. Traditional chūhai is made with barley shōchū and carbonated water flavored with lemon,<strong>)</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re underage!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t drink. I bought it for Gin to enjoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you buy this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At a convenience store.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they ask for ID?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t say anything. It is amazing what makeup can do, huh? Did I look like an older sister?&#8221;</p>

<p>Do your job properly, clerk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, don&#8217;t be so stiff, have a drink.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smirking, what used to hold tea was now being filled with alcohol.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much can you drink?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;One can is my limit. The rest, I&#8217;ll drink another day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. I&#8217;ll put it in the fridge then.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really a lightweight, but I actually love alcohol.</p>
<p>If I had a decent alcohol metabolism, my room might have been filled with empty cans.</p>






<p>Since I can only drink a little, I thoroughly savor the amount I can enjoy. That&#8217;s my way.</p>
<p>I sip and savor my drink slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Gin, you have strange preferences.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was mocked a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s part of what makes you cute, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed happy seeing me enjoy what she prepared. Even though she&#8217;s not drinking, Kirihara is in a great mood too.</p>
<p>The alcohol hits me and I feel lightheaded.</p>
<p>Feels like I&#8217;ve grown wings, and it&#8217;s quite pleasant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You really like alcohol, huh? Want another can?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;No, thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay if you get too drunk and fall asleep. I&#8217;ll take care of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No way. It&#8217;s uncool to black out. Getting deeply drunk goes against my way.&#8221;</p>





<p>&#8220;Since when were you the type to talk about &#8216;your way&#8217;? That&#8217;s funny.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara bursts into laughter.</p>
<p>And I, drunk as I am, laugh loudly too.</p>
<p>It was fun. &#8230;But, that time is coming to an end. The can of chu-hi Kirihara gave me has turned into an empty can. There&#8217;s nothing left in the glass. The meal is also finished.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll clean up. Gin, you rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look different, but you get cheerful, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I don&#8217;t overdo it, I&#8217;ll be back to normal in an hour.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Want some water?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ll have some.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara brings a new cup from the kitchen drawer. When did she check where it was?</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you go,&#8221; she says, and I take it without hesitation.</p>
<p>I gulp down the clear liquid without suspicion.</p>
<p>The aftertaste was strange. It tasted like alcohol.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiriharaa! This is alcohol, isn&#8217;t it!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, is it? I thought it was mineral water. Did I mix them up?&#8221;</p>
<p>What Kirihara was holding was cup sake. The label said something like &#8220;Just Like Water,&#8221; but there was also a big note saying &#8220;※This is alcohol.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh come on&#8230; huh&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>No good, my tongue&#8217;s not working.</p>
<p>A second one&#8217;s bad. Even a sip is bad.</p>

<p>Mixing sake with anything else is even worse. Absolutely bad. Bad × 2.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, sorry. I&#8217;ve laid out the futon, so go lie down.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guided to the futon with support.</p>
<p>Lying on my back, the world felt floaty.</p>
<p>Like I was riding on clouds. It felt incredibly good.</p>
<p>But by morning, I&#8217;ll forget this pleasant feeling.</p>

<p>Actually, I&#8217;m already too sleepy to care.</p>
<p>Most of my mind is muddled from the drunkenness, but a part of it is clear. That distinct drunken clarity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nuhuhu, excuse me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Someone comes to lie beside me.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s only one other person here besides me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gin, sorry. But, you see, I&#8230; just couldn&#8217;t hold back anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hold back what?</p>
<p>Was it just a thought, or did I say it out loud? Even that was ambiguous.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I mean. Hehe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara, seemingly sitting up, peers at my face.</p>
<p>She looks very, very happy.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s do lots of things, Gin.&#8221;</p>
<p>I feel like she said something after that. But my head was too fuzzy, consciousness slipping away.</p>
<p>●</p>

<p>When I woke up, strong light was streaming in from the window.</p>
<p>The clock hands pointed to a morning time.</p>
<p>No hangover. Deep sleep and memory erasure force my body into a super recovery from the drunken state.</p>
<p>I sit up to assess my condition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m dressed. My underwear&#8217;s changed too.</p>
<p>However, the futon&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p>Because I was laid on a towel blanket, my body feels a bit sore.</p>
<p>Right. Where&#8217;s Kirihara? Where did she go?</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, good morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara enters the room from the small balcony. She&#8217;s smiling softly.</p>
<p>Why is she wearing my dress shirt? It seems she&#8217;s wearing underwear, but the appearance is provocatively suggestive.</p>
<p>&#8220;That outfit&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I said I&#8217;d borrow it yesterday, remember?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;The futon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It got dirty, so I&#8217;m airing it out. I also washed the sheets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dirty? How?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow, you really don&#8217;t remember anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened yesterday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is&#8230; hmm?&#8221;</p>
<p>She starts fidgeting, intertwining her fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eh? No way&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The sheets got dirty, which means&#8230;?</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, really? For real?&#8221;</p>
<p>Blushing, Kirihara places her hands on her cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No way!?!&#8221;</p>
<p>I have absolutely no memory of it.</p>
<p>Getting drunk in my own room, with a minor, moreover, my student&#8230;</p>
<p>It took a while for me to recover from the shock.</p>
<p>While I was completely shock, Kirihara happily, almost proudly, went about doing household chores, humming to herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were drunk, but you were a gentleman. It was a blissful night,&#8221; she said, offering me some solace.</p>
