	<p class="block_12">“By the way Ryo, you said you went to the library today but what were you looking for?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">In the evening after returning from the public bath, the four were having their dinner at the guild cafeteria.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Compared to the Swordsman and Apprentice Swordsman, Etho, as a Priest, wondered what Ryo was investigating.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I was looking up Alchemy.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Can Ryo do alchemy too?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“No, I haven’t performed it before but there are some things I want to try when I have the chance.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ultimately, he wanted to make ice golems to cultivate the fields in the Rondo Forest.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, that was a secret that Ryo kept to himself which he had not revealed to anyone yet.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’ve heard that you can make potions with alchemy but it consumes a lot of magical power…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, I bought a recipe book for beginners and that book also wrote something like that.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“You bought a book…?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Niles stiffened.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Etho smiled bitterly.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Amon didn’t understand how much money was needed and just had an amazed look on his face.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“With the reward money I received for guiding Abel…”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“As expected, Abel-san! He can pay enough money to buy a book!”</p>
	<p class="block_12">To the Swordsman Niles, Abel was exactly the hero he admired.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Rihya-san is truly an angel…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">For some reason, at the mention of Abel, Etho seemed to have thought of Rihya and muttered with red cheeks.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Books sound expensive.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Amon’s reaction was very common sense and Ryo was relieved to hear it.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Right, Ryo, tomorrow we’ll be teaming up with Amon to dive into the dungeon as a party of three… How about Ryo come with us?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’m sorry, I’ll have to decline. There are some things I want to do on the surface.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo bowed and refused.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Oh, yeah, I thought you’d say that so don’t worry about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Niles scratched his head and said.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Etho was also smiling wryly.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The difference in ability was too distinct. Between Ryo and the three of them.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Of course, there was also a clear difference between Niles and Etho, who have been diving into the dungeon for more than half a year, and Amon, who had just left a village.</p>
	<p class="block_12">However, that was still insignificant compared to the difference with Ryo.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Both Niles and Etho clearly understood the difference.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">They were slightly aware when he was able to register for D-class immediately but were convinced when they saw him defeat Dan with a single blow today.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Dungeon exploration would certainly go a long way if they had a strong adventurer.</p>
	<p class="block_12">There would be progress, but it would be unreasonable for both parties.</p>
	<p class="block_10">For those who had to do their best to follow, and for those who were carrying the burden of the weaker party members.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Therefore, the guild also recommended exploring by forming a party with the same ability.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Meanwhile, Ryo was in this situation because… normally, a person who had just registered as an adventurer would not be so strong.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo was among the few exceptions… and it may be unavoidable for the guild because it was unexpected that such a person would opt to move into the dormitory.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Next Monday.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Well then, we’ll be setting off.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">With that said, Niles, Etho and Amon went diving into the dungeon.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo was outside the city.</p>
	<p class="block_12">He decided to run outside the walls.</p>
	<p class="block_10">It would have been fine to do so at the outdoor training ground in the guild, but he was also a little curious about what was going on around where he lived.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">And while running outside the walls, he constructed ice Tokyo Towers in both hands.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Just like how he used to do in the Rondo Forest.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Magical control training and endurance… it was training for both aspects.</p>
	<p class="block_10">As his skill with magical control increased, the speed of his magic generation would also increase.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Yesterday, Ryo lost to Leonor in many ways, including power, but he did not lose in the speed of magic generation.</p>
	<p class="block_12">That was because he managed to prevent Leonor’s magic as she was creating it during their sword fight.</p>
	<p class="block_10">And that was precisely why he wanted to be able to use magic faster and more accurately.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">He must pull ahead in the area where he was leading.</p>
	<p class="block_10">As for the areas he lost in, he also had to train further so as not to lose anymore.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">The sense of overwhelming difference was the difference in movement speed after all.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Leonor reduced the distance of several tens of meters to zero in an instant.</p>
	<p class="block_12">That was probably Wind-Attribute Magic.</p>
	<p class="block_12">And Ryo could only use Water-Attribute Magic.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Could he achieve something similar with Water-Attribute Magic…?</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">On Earth, there was something called </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">water jet propulsion</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_10">It was mainly used by surface vessels by sucking in water and expelling it backward… and the opposite reaction of that expulsion would cause the vessel to move forward.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Water Jet… Yes, Ryo had already made use of it.</p>
	<p class="block_10">To cut things.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">He could just use that.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">In fact, he had already experienced moving using Water Jet.</p>
	<p class="block_12">He used it to escape from the sea immediately…</p>
	<p class="block_12">When he was in a battle with the Bait Ball.</p>
	<p class="block_10">And during his escape from the battle with the Kraken.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">He used Water Jet ejected from the soles of his feet to propel him upward.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">At that time, he had his hands full in battle and couldn’t afford to think about the risk of failure but… when it came down to utilizing it, it succeeded well…</p>
	<p class="block_12">It was possible to fire Water Jets from the soles of his feet.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, if he wanted to use it in battles on the ground, he would have to fire them from his back.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">From his back…? Certainly, he would have to fire them from his back.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, he felt that his neck would snap…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Then from the head too…? Certainly, he had to fire simultaneously from the back of his head as well as his back.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, in that case, he felt that it would hurt his arms and legs…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">In other words, from the shoulders, upper arms, thighs, hamstrings, and heels too…?</p>
	<p class="block_10">It seemed like he would have to fire them from the entire back of his body.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">He managed to secure the image for the time being but… he would like to start by trying it with as little momentum as possible.</p>
	<p class="block_12">(If I made the ground ice with Ice Bahn and done well, even Water Jet with minute propulsion would move me forward…?)</p>
	<p class="block_10">“&lt;Ice Bahn&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Then, he drew the image in his head of Water Jets spouting from the entire back of his body.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“&lt;Water Jet 256&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo imagined the maximum number of Water Jets that he could currently generate, 256, firing out from his back… they actually fired but…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“I’m not moving……”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">It wasn’t a surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_12">He sensed that he did move just a little.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo collapsed to his knees, with both hands on the ground.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I lost……”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It seemed that he lost to something…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">One minute later…</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Well, I don’t think I can do it yet… If I can upgrade 256 to 1024, there is a possibility that it would work.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo recovered.</p>
	<p class="block_10">And started running again.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Niles, Etho, and Amon were on the fourth floor of the dungeon in Rune.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Goblins appeared on this floor.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Goblins weren’t a big deal when alone.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Compared to the Lesser Wolf that appeared up to the third floor, they were easier to defeat if there was just one.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">However, goblins had weapons and may attack in groups.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Their weapons were usually swords with chipped blades and broken spears, but rarely some goblins used bows too.</p>
	<p class="block_12">And even more rarely, some goblins could use magic.</p>
	<p class="block_12">But except for those rare goblins, it was easy to beat them unless you were surrounded.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, nothing on their body could be used as material. Nobody would purchase anything taken from them. Except for their magic stones.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“The hunting speed is different with just one additional Swordsman.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Niles laughed energetically while collecting the magic stones of the defeated goblins.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“You’re right. Especially with Goblins, it’s noticeable.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Since Etho was a Priest in the magic class, he concentrated on casting recovery during the battle but helped to strip materials and collect magic stones.</p>
	<p class="block_10">In fact, he was the best in doing so among the three.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Compared to Lesser Wolves, Goblins move slowly so I think it’s easier to beat them.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Amon was less accustomed to collecting magic stones than Niles and Etho.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Still, he managed to harvest magic stones.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Okay, let’s take a break.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Under Niles’ command, all three took a break against rocks.</p>
	<p class="block_12">That said, they were in a dungeon. They could only rest their bodies but couldn’t get rid of mental fatigue.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Nevertheless, it was important to include proper breaks.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Niles was a type of adventurer who maintained a fairly large safety margin.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Amon was very grateful for that as a person who had just begun to dive into the dungeon.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Amon, water is a must but you should lick some salt as well.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">And he also took care of others.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Right, you mentioned it after our run yesterday, salt.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Yeah. After sweating, it’s a good idea to have water and salt. It’s a practice from my village.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">“Mother Goddess, lend me a healing hand, </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Lesser Heal</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">”</span></p>
	<p class="block_10">Etho treated the injury on Amon’s arm.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Phew, it was a little dangerous just now.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Niles was collecting a magic stone from the bow-wielding Goblin Archer.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Yes, there was a goblin using a bow in the group that they just defeated.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Although it was the fifth floor by just advancing a little further ahead, there have not been any reports of encounters with groups that have Goblin Archers on this floor…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“It’s not a good prospect, isn’t it? Goblin Archers on the 5th floor. We are a party of three so we could somewhat manage.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">While Etho was treating Amon, Niles harvested the magic stones from the three defeated bodies.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Okay, let’s return to the surface for today. It’s earlier than usual but even if we divided it by three, we have earned more than usual.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Niles had a big smile.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Surviving was the most important matter.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Needless to say for Abel, Niles also knew the importance of life.</p>
	<p class="block_10">It was from past experience.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Don’t overdo it. Be sure to leave some spare capacity and return to the safe zone.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Niles knew of its importance.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">One hour after the three people from Room 10 withdrew from the dungeon.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">On the fifth floor, the E-class party </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Eternal Waves</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> was being annihilated.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">“Why is there such a goblin on the fifth floor, it’s impossible!”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’m out of magic… I can’t do it anymore…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ugu… shit… but…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Help…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“…”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Five E-class adventurers met their end.</p>
