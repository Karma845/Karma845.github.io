<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 3: Trauma: Separation</h2>


<p>When the students start their summer vacation, the daily life of a high school teacher becomes significantly easierâ€”or not at all.</p>
<p>The Board of Education sends invitations for training, and the school asks for the submission of lesson plans for the next semester.</p>
<p>There are also supplementary lessons for students who performed poorly, and special classes for third-year students who are preparing for entrance exams.</p>
<p>In short, it&#8217;s insanely busy.</p>
<p>The training, in particular, was tough. Giving a mock lesson in front of the gentlemen from the Education Committee is quite nerve-wracking.</p>
<p>I managed to finish it without any issues, but I couldn&#8217;t help feeling anxious. I even messaged my ex-girlfriend for the first time in years saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m tired&#8230;&#8221;, and I ended up venting to Kirihara over the phone.</p>
<p>And then, the next day, I was waiting to help out the girls&#8217; basketball team.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you might be in charge of a club activity someday, it&#8217;s better to have some experience,&#8221; suggested the principal, leading me to spend a day as an assistant coach.</p>




     

<p>Morikawara Academy&#8217;s gymnasium is air-conditioned, but we still need to be cautious of heatstroke among the students. Having no expertise in basketball, my role was to watch for any students who might feel unwell while picking up balls.</p>
<p>The students were grateful, saying, &#8220;The summer tournament is coming up, so your help is much appreciated.&#8221;</p>
<p>No student fell ill, so I spent most of my time just picking up balls, but I still received thanks from the coach.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you a secret, Hajima-sensei will never become a club advisor at Morikawara Academy,&#8221; I was confidentially informed.</p>
<p>Apparently, all the current club advisors at Morikawara Academy, both athletic and cultural, are experienced individuals who voluntarily took on the roles. There are no plans for any changes.</p>
<p>Unless a new club is formed, my workload isn&#8217;t likely to increase.</p>
<p>&#8230;Needless to say, I was somewhat, no, greatly relieved.</p>
<p>Not to boast, but I can&#8217;t think of any club activities I could be in charge of. &#8230;&#8230;Perhaps the trendy &#8220;eSports&#8221;?</p>
<p>&#8220;No way,&#8221;</p>
<p>At night, while playing games at Kirihara&#8217;s house, I mentioned it, and she immediately shot down the idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;The games we play are a different breed from competitive gaming.&#8221;</p>
<p>Games considered as competitive are generally player versus player.</p>



     

<p>Unlike Kirihara and me, who continuously battle against computer programs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s okay not to become a club advisor. It would take away from our time together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Honestly, I felt the same way, so I could only agree.</p>
<p>After a month of July filled with supplementary lessons, training, and a day as an assistant advisor, things finally began to settle down a bit.</p>
<p>I discussed the lesson plan for the second semester with Kurei-san, especially since it&#8217;s the exam season for third-year students.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s necessary to at least be aware of the recent trends in university entrance exams.</p>
<p>After a series of serious discussions, Kurei-san suddenly asked me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei, are you going back to your hometown for the Obon vacation?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even busy high school teachers get a break during Obon. All club activities are completely halted during this period, and the school itself is locked up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t plan to go back home. Every year, my parents use the grave visit as an excuse to go on a trip&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your parents seem to get along well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes. But even without that, since I lived at home after quitting my company, I thought I&#8217;d skip this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. So, you&#8217;re spending it alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The truth is, I plan to spend it with Kirihara.</p>
<p>She has been saying for a while that she wants me to be with her since she has no plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about Kurei-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be at home alone too. The end of the year is stressful because of the students&#8217; exams, right? We need to rest properly sometimes. Besides&#8230; if I go back, I&#8217;ll just be nagged about getting married.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a somewhat disheartening story.</p>


     

<p>Seeing me at a loss for words, Kurei-san sighed.</p>




     

<p>&#8220;Sorry. It&#8217;s pointless to vent to you about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I&#8217;ll also be told to bring a girlfriend home someday&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Depending on your parents&#8217; personalities, maybe&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The conversation somehow became exhausting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have a good break.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Let&#8217;s both do our best.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, the conversation shifted back to finalizing our work for the second semester so we could fully enjoy our vacation.</p>
<p>After work, I leave the school and head home.</p>
<p>&#8230;Except, my destination isn&#8217;t my house but Kirihara&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Arriving at the station, I retrieve my disguise from the locker and change in the restroom of a nearby shopping center. I walk down the familiar path and ring the doorbell at Kirihara&#8217;s front gate, where she greets me with a smile, wearing an apron.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The greeting has changed from &#8220;Welcome&#8221; since I&#8217;ve been coming here almost every day during the summer vacation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perfect timing. I just finished the prep for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pulls me inside, happily reporting her progress.</p>
<p>Lately, Kirihara has taken on the task of cutting vegetables and boiling them.</p>
<p>I taught her how to season the dishes, but she insists that she wants me to do it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making food together that we&#8217;ll eat together feels emotional,&#8221; or so she says.</p>
<p>I kind of get it, but also don&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gin, hurry up. I&#8217;m hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, alright&#8230; If you&#8217;re that hungry, you could just make it yourself.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;No way!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One &#8216;okay&#8217; is enough, Sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>As we stand in the kitchen, Kirihara hangs from my neck from behind.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s menu is okonomiyaki.</p>
<p>Not skimping on the bonito flakes, sauce, and mayonnaise is my way&#8230; or rather, a secret to deliciousness I learned from my part-time job&#8217;s manager.</p>
<p>When the freshly made okonomiyaki is laid out on the table, Kirihara&#8217;s eyes sparkle with joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is more luxurious than what we made at the mock store, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Different budgets, different budgets. &#8230;&#8230;Let&#8217;s eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s eat!&#8221;</p>
<p>We carefully divide it with chopsticks before shoveling it into our mouths.</p>
<p>Delicious! We both beam with joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the best, Gin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The best, Kirihara!&#8221;</p>
<p>We stuff our faces, making sure not to be too vulgar as we quickly fill our stomachs.</p>

<p>I might be Exaggerating  a bit too much, but today&#8217;s okonomiyaki was absolutely spot on. The crunchy texture of the cabbage, the perfect ratio of squid to pork&#8230; and above all, the irresistibly tempting heap of sauce and mayonnaise that&#8217;s undoubtedly bad for the body.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the kind of flavor that makes you crave a drink.</p>
<p>&#8230;At that thought, a silence fell over my mind reflexively.</p>
<p>My mood plummeted in an instant.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Not again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was still feeling down about the worst alcohol mishap, which was still fresh in my memory.</p>
<p>Me&#8230; with a student&#8230; with Kirihara&#8230; and not even remembering it&#8230;</p>




     

<p>Though no complaint was filed, the fact that I had broken the law weighed heavily, very heavily, on my conscience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gin, you&#8217;re too serious. It&#8217;s in the past, can&#8217;t be helped, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the point!&#8221;</p>
<p>I widened my eyes in protest, but Kirihara seemed unfazed, as if asking, &#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t get caught, it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s not about that. It&#8217;s a problem within me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite saying so, not wanting the okonomiyaki to go cold, I took another bite.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t hate it, so it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ever since that night, Kirihara has been in high spirits.</p>
<p>With summer vacation in full swing, and our roles as teacher and student reversed with more time spent at home, she&#8217;s been clinging to me to her heart&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>Moreover, it seems like she&#8217;s savoring the fact that we&#8217;ve crossed a line.</p>
<p>Previously, there was an air of desperation about her, as if she was trying hard to hold on to me.</p>



     

<p>That&#8217;s gone now.</p>
<p>&#8230;Specifically, she stopped saying she wanted to &#8220;go all the way&#8221; with me.</p>
<p>She occasionally mentions how happy she is without needing to do that. Coming home exhausted from unfamiliar training or a day as a substitute advisor, her cheerful welcome is something I&#8217;m very grateful for.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy too, but&#8230; the fact that this happiness stemmed from my worst behavior as an &#8220;adult&#8221; makes it hard for me to accept it openly.</p>
<p>I was feeling really conflicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you hated doing that with me? That would hurt, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the first time in a while, she pouted slightly, starting to sulk.</p>
<p>When it gets to this point, it&#8217;s troublesome, so it&#8217;s better to switch gears forcefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sorry. My bad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No worries. Thank you for the meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara took the dishes to the sink, rinsing them lightly with water. Doing so makes the sauce stains easier to remove.</p>
<p>After finishing with the dishes, Kirihara kissed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was delicious. Thank you, as always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but think she was cute, which was the hardest part to deal with.</p>
<p>&#8230;What should I do about this?</p>
<p>&#8220;Speaking of the Obon holiday.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm? Ah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today, I ordered something like this.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>She cleared a space on the table, where several brochures were spread out.</p>




     

<p>Information magazines about traveling, with covers featuring &#8220;Hot Springs,&#8221; &#8220;Beach Swimming,&#8221; &#8220;Gourmet Tours&#8221; prominently displayed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; what&#8217;s this?&#8221; I asked candidly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we have the holiday, why don&#8217;t we go somewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s sudden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It just came to me. It&#8217;s summer, after all. If we go far enough, we won&#8217;t have to worry about being recognized, and we can go on a date without disguises, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>Normally, whenever Kirihara and I go out together, we always disguise ourselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s unavoidable, but it feels a bit suffocating,&#8221; we had discussed before.</p>
<p>Going to a distant place&#8230; I could understand the sentiment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Booking an overnight stay might be too late now, but a day trip might be possible&#8230; What do you think? The trains won&#8217;t be as crowded as cars. How about this hot spring?&#8221;</p>
<p>She opened a magazine to a page she had bookmarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is recommended to stop by and enter the hot spring of any shop. It&#8217;s famous for being a cool getaway. Even just strolling through the souvenir shops can be a nice change of pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not interested? Want to relax at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not that. We have a few days off for Obon, so I think it&#8217;d be okay to go for one day&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fear of running into someone we know.</p>
<p>If anyone saw Kirihara and me together outside of school, it would be game over.</p>
<p>But Kirihara, looking hopeful, was waiting for my positive response.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>





<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ll disguise myself, but if that&#8217;s okay, then&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face lit up with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s book the train tickets right away! We&#8217;re going on a special express train with a view of the sea!&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara busily arranged the trip on her smartphone while browsing through the magazine.</p>
<p>Though it&#8217;s just a day trip, securing train tickets seemed to be almost all that was needed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about food? Should we buy bento at the station?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those things are usually overpriced for the amount they give, so it might be better to bring some onigiri.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a bitter memory of a slight argument over this during a trip with an ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bento! That&#8217;s a great idea! It&#8217;s getting exciting! Hey, hey, hey, can I request fillings for the onigiri?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I like salmon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want tarako too!&#8221; (tln: salted pollock roe)</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;And umeboshi?&#8221; (tln : salted jp plum)</p>
<p>&#8220;I want! Can we also do tuna mayo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just mix tuna with mayonnaise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? Then, what about&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s requests for onigiri fillings continued for a while. Just discussing what to put in them seemed to make her incredibly happy.</p>

<p>This year&#8217;s Obon vacation is blessed with a full week off according to the calendar.</p>
<p>On the third day of the vacation, Kirihara and I set out early in the morning for a famous hot spring destination to escape the summer heat.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s a day trip, we planned to leave early and return late.</p>
<p>After resting thoroughly for two days, I felt great. I had adjusted my internal clock by avoiding staying up late recently, in preparation for this day. It was perfect.</p>
<p>Only I was in disguise as we walked the streets before dawn to catch the first train.</p>
<p>Kirihara was carrying a small suitcase with her change of clothes, while I had a backpack.</p>
<p>In addition, we were carrying an eco bag stuffed with a bento box full of onigiri.</p>
<p>Salmon, cod roe, pickled plum, tuna mayo, and bonito flakesâ€”these were the onigiri fillings Kirihara had eagerly requested. Wiener sausages and tamagoyaki were also packed in the same bento box.</p>




     

<p>Kirihara, holding hands with me, walked with the expression of a child going on a school trip.</p>
<p>This didn&#8217;t change even after we boarded the train.</p>
<p>As the outside gradually brightened, she pointed out the window without a word, excitedly making me aware of the changing scenery.</p>
<p>She said it had been since her childhood that she last went on a private trip.</p>
<p>&#8220;What about you, Gin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been several years since my university days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess&#8230; It&#8217;s a bit disappointing knowing who you went with before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Come to think of it, my ex also messaged me that she was going on a trip with her boyfriend today.</p>
<p>As my mind wandered, Kirihara reached for my hand and held it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s enjoy this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Holding hands, we transferred from a local train to an express at the terminal station.</p>
<p>Kirihara took the window seat in the comfortably spacious two-seater row. The journey to our destination would take roughly an hour and a half.</p>



     

<p>It was finally time for the much-anticipated onigiri.</p>
<p>Even though it was a simple bento, Kirihara was excited</p>
<p>She picked up a wiener with a toothpick and offered it to me, saying &#8220;Ahh,&#8221; with a smile.</p>
<p>As I hesitated, she unhesitatingly brought it to her own mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You intended to eat it yourself from the start, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you figure it out? But it&#8217;s delicious, this wiener.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bento food does taste different, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe what&#8217;s important about meals is the atmosphere after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>We ate about half, saving the rest for lunch.</p>
<p>Just chatting about trivial things while looking out the window, time flew by. Our conversation might not be memorable, but there&#8217;s no doubt we enjoyed our time.</p>
<p>Arriving at our destination station, we exited through the ticket gate.</p>
<p>Kirihara let out yet another cheer, her excitement indiscernible.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very atmospheric!&#8221;</p>
<p>The station front, lined with traditional souvenir shops, exuded a clear sense of history. Perhaps due to it being right in the middle of the Obon holiday, it was bustling with customers.</p>
<p>We had no specific plans from here.</p>
<p>For starters, we decided to casually browse the first souvenir shop that caught our eye.</p>
<p>Pennants, ornaments, keychains, and more were on display.</p>
<p>Kirihara looked at the merchandise with keen interest. Before heading out on the trip, she had decided to &#8220;buy something to remember it by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;re here, it&#8217;d be nice to get something we can use daily&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keychains are classic, right?&#8221;</p>




     

<p>&#8220;If Gin would carry my house key, that would be fine too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hmm, that&#8217;s a bit&#8230;&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;I never quite understand Gin&#8217;s boundaries for a safe out.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed a bit sullen, but her interest quickly shifted back to the souvenirs.</p>
<p>In front of the shop, several wind chimes were tinkling away, hanging from the eaves.</p>
<p>Before we knew it, we were both looking at the same thing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Nah, not really.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right&#8230; It wouldn&#8217;t be fun to decorate different rooms with the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>The best would be something we could use daily, that wouldn&#8217;t seem suspicious even if we had it in the same space.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; Kirihara pointed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about a fan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Ah.&#8221;</p>
<p>That might be a good idea, I thought immediately.</p>
<p>There were fans suitable for gentlemen, ladies, and even younger demographics with modern designs.</p>
<p>&#8220;That one&#8217;s not right, this one&#8217;s not right, how about this one?&#8221; we discussed together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Really, we&#8217;d like to have different colors of the same design.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please spare me from that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>We found fans we both liked, but decided to visit other shops before making a purchase and left the store.</p>
<p>As we wandered from one souvenir shop to another, we gradually noticed more public baths along the street.</p>



     

<p>Staying too long might lead to heatstroke, and considering our return time, we could only choose one.</p>
<p>Like with the fans, we deliberated on which one to enter.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are many options, but that old-fashioned place has to be the best, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara suggested the shop we had looked up in the magazine beforehand. It looked distinguished in the photos, with a charming atmosphere. Seeing it in person was even more enticing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah!&#8221;</p>
<p>Since it wasn&#8217;t a mixed bath, we split up for the men&#8217;s and women&#8217;s baths right after entering.</p>
<p>Before splitting, Kirihara gestured for me to face her. As I did, she lightly pressed her lips to mine.</p>
<p>&#8220;See you later. I&#8217;ll come back looking refreshed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overdoing it, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Laughing, I headed towards the men&#8217;s bath.</p>
<p>&#8230;The bath was truly wonderful.</p>
<p>Though it felt slightly lukewarm at first, soaking slowly allowed the fatigue to melt away into the water, bringing a profound sense of relief.</p>
<p>It was spacious inside, and I ended up taking a longer bath than usual.</p>
<p>Realizing I might fall asleep if I lingered too long, I decided it was best to get out at a reasonable time.</p>
<p>I picked up my smartphone, which I had tossed into the basket along with my change of clothes, and messaged Kirihara that I was out. Since the message wasn&#8217;t read immediately, I killed some time on a bench in the changing room with a coffee milk.</p>
<p>When leaving, I&#8217;d have to put on the uncomfortable disguise again.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the brief feeling of liberation until Kirihara contacted me.</p>
<p>&#8230;Putting on the wig and sunglasses, I received strange looks from nearby peoples, which was a little sad.</p>

<p>She was dressed in a yukata. Her long hair was gathered at the back of her head with a decorative hairpiece, and she wore geta sandals on her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;How is it? Did I change properly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;m surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay! It was worth the effort choosing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed she bought it off-the-rack.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a cheap one and the pattern is plain, but I thought the atmosphere was more important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Blushing slightly, Kirihara twisted her body to look down at herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, apart from being surprised, any other thoughts?&#8221;</p>




     

<p>It seemed she wouldn&#8217;t let me off until I properly praised her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It suits you well. You look cute.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled happily, &#8220;Nnfufu.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara grabbed my arm and hugged it tightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Travelling really is fun, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of her geta echoed pleasantly from beside me.</p>
<p>Glancing sideways, I noticed her slightly reddened nape. It was incredibly attractive.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tried to hide my true thoughts, but Kirihara seemed to see right through me, looking very pleased.</p>
<p>However, as the path became a gentle downhill slope, she stumbled with a yelp.</p>



     

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sorry. I tripped a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>It might have been because she wasn&#8217;t used to the geta.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not wearing glasses. Are you using contacts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I forgot them this morning&#8230; And I don&#8217;t have any spares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an unfamiliar path, wouldn&#8217;t it be better to wear them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umm&#8230; Yeah, you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;d be terrible to get injured, so let&#8217;s do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed a bit disappointed but reluctantly agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;My glasses are in the suitcase. Can you wait a moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>While she was opening her luggage on a nearby bench to look for her glasses, I casually glanced down the street.</p>
<p>Among the passing crowd, I spotted a woman who exuded presence just by walking.</p>
<p>She wore white pants and a short blue design shirt, revealing a glimpse of her belly.</p>
<p>Large ring earrings adorned her ears, and sunglasses perched on her forehead. Her confident stride in high heels made her look like a model.</p>
<p>When she pulled out a handkerchief from her handbag, something fell out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; Sorry, Kirihara. I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran to pick up the dropped item. It was some kind of amulet.</p>
<p>I then chased after the woman&#8217;s retreating figure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me! You dropped this!&#8221;</p>
<p>People around me turned to look in my direction.</p>
<p>She also turned around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh&#8230; Ah!?&#8221;</p>


 

     

<p>The moment she saw the amulet in my hand, she frantically checked her bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is yours, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Thank you so much!&#8221;</p>
<p>It must have been something very important to her. She thanked me repeatedly, bowing her head.</p>
<p>From a distance, she had seemed like an intimidating beauty, but up close, there was a softness in her manner that made her even more beautiful.</p>



     

<p>&#8230;Suddenly, I noticed a familiar scent wafting my way.</p>
<p>Perfume.</p>
<p>It was a scent I recognized.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I thank you enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, she looked directly at me.</p>
<p>In an instant, I stiffened.</p>
<p>The usual ambiance was different due to her makeup and hairstyle. Her clothes and accessories too.</p>
<p>But, there was no mistake.</p>
<p>Even if her usual attire was different, at such close proximity, it was difficult to mistake her identity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gin, sorry to keep you waiting. &#8230;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the worst possible timing, Kirihara caught up to us.</p>
<p>Half-reflexively, the woman standing in front of me also turned her gaze toward Kirihara, now wearing glasses.</p>
<p>In an instant, the woman&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Kirihara-san?&#8221;</p>



     

<p>It was only natural she recognized her. Kirihara&#8217;s hairstyle was the only difference.</p>
<p>What protected me was only a blonde wig and lightly tinted sunglasses.</p>
<p>There were too many distinctive features. The shape of the eyes, the shape of the nose, the contour of the face.</p>
<p>Just as I realized it, she must have too.</p>
<p>The beautiful woman standing before us. The decisive words came from Kurei-san&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hajima-sensei?&#8221;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/embed0011_HD.jpg" />

<p>I was aware that everything was over.</p>
<p>&#8230;Kirihara and I could only remain silent.</p>
<p>Kurei-san covered her mouth with her hand, at a loss for words.</p>
<p>It felt like waiting for a verdict as a criminal.</p>
<p>In fact, it was just that.</p>
<p>Spending the Obon vacation with a student.</p>
<p>Could there be any other meaning?</p>
<p>&#8220;â”€â”€Kurei-sensei, this is&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san, pale-faced, staggered backward.</p>
<p>&#8230;After shaking her head lightly, she whispered in a subdued voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s talk after the Obon vacation, at school.&#8221;</p>
<p>With those words, Kurei-san left the scene.</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s and my trip effectively ended there.</p>




     

<p>We weren&#8217;t in the mood anymore.</p>
<p>Passing by the souvenir shop we had planned to visit without entering, without buying the fans, we headed back on the train.</p>
<p>During the return trip, we didn&#8217;t speak a word. Couldn&#8217;t speak. Didn&#8217;t know what to say.</p>
<p>But Kirihara gripped my hand so tightly it hurt. I gripped back just as hard.</p>
<p>Two more days were left of the Obon vacation, but Kirihara said, &#8220;Sensei, it&#8217;s better if you go back home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have student council work right after the vacation. Let&#8217;s talk in the evening, with Kurei-sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;After seeing Kirihara off to her home, I returned to my own for the first time in a while.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to do anything. Apart from eating, I spent most of my time trembling in bed. I ignored all messages from my ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>Later on, I would think, &#8220;Kirihara might have felt the same,&#8221; but at that moment, I couldn&#8217;t feel anything but the fear that my life was over.</p>

<p>I was filled with the desire to run away, but the day of judgment arrived.</p>
<p>On the first workday after the summer vacation ended, Kurei-san, Kirihara, and I gathered in the student council room in the evening.</p>
<p>Since the student council work was already completed, no one else approached the room.</p>
<p>In the center of the room was a table and sofa set. Kirihara and I sat side by side, facing Kurei-san, who was sitting with furrowed brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;For now, I haven&#8217;t spoken to anyone about you two.&#8221;</p>
<p>Internally, I felt relieved at Kurei-san&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, I want to hear the circumstances. &#8230;Exactly how did you find yourselves in that place? What is your relationship?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san&#8217;s questions were as expected.</p>




     

<p>During the time at home, I had thought over and over about how to answer.</p>
<p>â”€â”€Telling everything might be best.</p>
<p>That was the conclusion I reached.</p>
<p>Kurei-san, who had taken a liking to me since my appointment, was undoubtedly my benefactor. I had kept lying and betraying her.</p>
<p>At least in the end, I wanted to speak of my mistakes candidly, without hiding anything.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s going to be a long story, but may I speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>At my words, Kurei-san nodded quietly.</p>
<p>Where and how I met Kirihara, how things developed, and how they ended up this way.</p>
<p>I was about to tell everything when a voice came from beside me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Kirihara. Her voice was firm and resolute.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all my fault. I insisted on it, I was the one who approached Hajima-sensei.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;Hey!,&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Approached, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san&#8217;s words overlapped with mine. Kirihara continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what it sounds like. I ended up liking sensei, and so I was the one who&#8230; made advances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does that mean you were dating?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not exactly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wanted to interject at some point, but Kirihara&#8217;s explanation wasn&#8217;t a lie, so I didn&#8217;t know the right timing.</p>
<p>Taking advantage, Kirihara went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei&#8217; is a person of good sense as an educator and as an adult. Even when I asked to be in that kind of relationship, he firmly tried to persuade me. He told me many times that he was happy with my feelings, but it was not right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;It wasn&#8217;t a lie.</p>



     

<p>&#8220;But I couldn&#8217;t give up and kept persisting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you find it hard to believe? Kurei-sensei.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Considering the usual you, I can&#8217;t imagine it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That might be the case. But I can be a bad girl too. I act mature and pretend to be good, but I&#8217;m my age. I may smile outwardly, but inside, I get angry, lonely, and feel a lot. &#8230;I was attracted to Hajima-sensei because he&#8217;s so earnest and kind. It was one-sided, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why were the two of you in such a place?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my fault again. I couldn&#8217;t give up and begged him to take me far away for just that day. We promised it would be just one day, where no one would see us. Sensei didn&#8217;t lay a hand on me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her story began to mix with clear lies. Several times, I thought I should speak up and say that&#8217;s not right.</p>
<p>Yet, at the same time, I realized something.</p>
<p>â”€â”€Was Kirihara telling this lie just to protect me?</p>




     

<p>Or wasn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Was Kirihara fabricating this story to protect herself?</p>
<p>Think about it.</p>
<p>If I spilled the truth, it would not only damage me but Kirihara as well. Even if it would be less than what I&#8217;d face, Kirihara wouldn&#8217;t get off scot-free.</p>
<p>â”€â”€There was nothing inappropriate between us except on the day of the trip.</p>
<p>It should be impossible for Kurei-san to prove this as a lie.</p>
<p>Remember.</p>
<p>Kirihara and I are accomplices.</p>
<p>Is it okay for me to expose my partner to danger just for my easy self-satisfactionâ€”destroying my sin to Kurei-san for my own selfish reasons?</p>
<p>Or am I just trying to ride on Kirihara&#8217;s kindness out of self-love after all?</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;Which is it?</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the truth? What&#8217;s the right answer?</p>
<p>Kurei-san was deep in thought too. She seemed doubtful of Kirihara&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you really find it that unbelievable? Kurei-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara seemed to be coming from a place of realization, even having the leisure to smile.</p>
<p>Only Kurei-san and I had tense expressions.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Aren&#8217;t you just saying this because Hajima-sensei told you to? I&#8217;m a little suspicious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san&#8217;s gaze turned to me.</p>

<p>I silently accept the situation.</p>
<p>Kirihara never ceased to smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? Then, that&#8217;s fine. But even if so, I have no intention of saying anything beyond what we&#8217;ve just discussed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Those words might have been directed at me as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I was being used by Hajima-sensei, I&#8217;m satisfied with that. That&#8217;s how much I like him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Kirihara stated this clearly.</p>
<p>After a moment of stiffness, Kurei-san took a deep breath and sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. There&#8217;s nothing beyond what we&#8217;ve just talked about, and that&#8217;s fine with you, Hajima-sensei?&#8221;</p>




     

<p>She pressed for confirmation.</p>
<p>This was the last chance to deny it.</p>
<p>&#8230;But I couldn&#8217;t find any merit in denying it.</p>
<p>No matter how I answered, the time when Kirihara and Iâ€”we made dinner together and ate togetherâ€”that time could probably never be regained.</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s choice was the right answer.</p>
<p>The moment Kurei-san saw us together, we had no choice but to prioritize minimizing the damage.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s as Kirihara says. &#8230;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Immediately, Kirihara interjected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei isn&#8217;t to blame. That&#8217;s the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san fell silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want to do about us? Will you bring it up at the staff meeting?&#8221;</p>
<p>In response to Kirihara&#8217;s sharp question, Kurei-san shook her head and said &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you before, Hajima-sensei. Students are children, but they are also humans. I don&#8217;t deny that they can be attracted to the opposite sex and to each other. I don&#8217;t want to destroy your lives. I&#8217;ll keep this matter to myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>My heart ached. I was filled with remorse.</p>
<p>&#8220;But make a promise to me. As someone who has lived a little longer, let me advise you. If your relationship or the feelings Kirihara-san has for Hajima-sensei come to light, it will never end happily. It could ruin your lives. &#8230;It might be hard, but keep your distance. Kirihara-san, you understand, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Kirihara agreed immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan. I don&#8217;t want to cause any confusion for the one I like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara looked at me and then bowed her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for insisting too much. I&#8217;ll be more aware from now on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;Shamefully, I wasn&#8217;t able to say anything.</p>
<p>After leaving the student council room, Kurei-san and I returned to the staff room. Once we were sure we were alone, Kurei-san looked at me sympathetically and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You also need to keep the promise. It&#8217;s for the best for both of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;re not angry at me?&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;Getting angry won&#8217;t help. I can somewhat guess why Kirihara-san acted the way she did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san bit her lip as if in regret.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard about the time she had a fever and her parents didn&#8217;t come to pick her up. Wanting to be spoiled by someone isn&#8217;t something I can&#8217;t understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Kirihara-san that if she has any troubles, she can consult with me. And if she comes to you for advice, let me be present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, neither Kirihara nor Kurei-san blamed me.</p>
<p>After returning home, I sent a message to Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was this the right thing to do?&#8221;</p>




     

<p>Her reply came immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was no other way. If we told the truth, it would be bad for both of us, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know how to respond.</p>
<p>Thank you? Sorry?</p>
<p>&#8230;Either response felt like it would disappoint Kirihara.</p>
<p>While I was hesitating, Kirihara sent a video.</p>
<p>It showed her laptop screen.</p>
<p>She was on the network drive management screen, operating the mouse icon to delete some data.</p>
<p>She was deleting a file named &#8220;rokuon data&#8221; (recording data).</p>
<p>&#8230;Probably the data from that day.</p>
<p>The data Kirihara used to keep me tied to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re free now. Let&#8217;s go back to normal from now on.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her messages kept coming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but is it still okay to play online games? haha&#8230; That&#8217;s still a secret relationship.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;After a little thought, I typed a reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s what Kirihara wants.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay then. See you in the game. Thanks for your hard work!&#8221;</p>
<p>And so, the complicit relationship between Kirihara and me was over.</p>
<p>It ended with me being protected unilaterally.</p>
<p>Only a sense of shame and emptiness filled my heart.</p>
