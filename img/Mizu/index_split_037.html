	<p class="block_12">Ryo was in the forbidden archives of the North Library.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Only B-rank and above adventurers could enter the forbidden archives so naturally there wasn’t anybody around.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Next to him was an elf woman with lightly-tied platinum blonde hair that flowed to her back, a literal goddess of beauty. Sera.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Originally, even if they were accompanied by a B-rank or higher adventurer, an unqualified person would not be allowed to enter the forbidden archives.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, Ryo could enter this time because Sera specifically sought the permission of the Lord directly.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">The purpose was to browse an alchemy-related parchment bundle that Sera found in the forbidden archives while Ryo was on a request to the City of Whitnash.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Books, documents, and other materials in the forbidden archives were not allowed to be taken out of the library.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Given that rule, for Ryo to see the parchment bundle, she had to obtain special permission for him to enter the forbidden archives.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo looked up after browsing through the bundle.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“It’s really interesting.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Right? I thought so too so I went to tell Ryo…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Sorry, I was out with the escort request.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">While Ryo was away from the city for thirteen days for the escort request to Whitnash, Sera went all the way to the guild to inform him about this.</p>
	<p class="block_10">He was full of gratitude.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“No, no, it’s okay, don’t worry about it.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Looking at her side profile, she seemed a little elated to Ryo.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Okay, then I’ll take some notes.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo arranged a bundle of paper, pen, and ink on a desk.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Parchment cannot be copied by &lt;Transcription&gt;. It would have been easier if it was written on paper.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Sera said with a look of disappointment.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“……Eh?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“……Yes?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo replied with a strange query, and Sera replied the same way.</p>
	<p class="block_10">It seemed that the meaning didn’t get across.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Did you just say transcription?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Yes, I just said transcription.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">The meaning changed greatly depending on whether or not intonation was raised at the end…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“If this was written on paper and I said &lt;Transcription&gt;, it would immediately transcribe to another piece of paper?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, that’s possible. Going by Ryo’s speech, you don’t know about the spell &lt;Transcription&gt;?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Sara smiled sweetly after finally understanding.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">(I would repeat ‘I’ve not heard of &lt;Transcription&gt;’ any number of times if I could see that smile…)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo’s thoughts strayed.</p>
	<p class="block_10">But he reined his thoughts in with the power of will.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes. I have not heard of a transcribing spell…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo is interesting. You seem to know a lot and although you’re strong, you don’t seem to know the basics.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Transcription is basic?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">After hearing that, one mystery was finally solved.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">The papers often placed in the Adventurer’s Guild… the instructions that Nina showed Ryo when he registered as an adventurer… they were all copied with &lt;Transcription&gt;.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Therefore, there were many copies of them.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">On </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Phi</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">, magic replaced the role of letterpress printing.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">If you think about it, it was natural.</p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">If there was an extremely convenient </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">tool</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> called </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">magic</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">, letterpress printing would not have been born.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Would I be able to use the transcription spell?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Hmm, I don’t know. It is non-attribute magic, but surprisingly not everyone can use it. So, if a person wishes to do commercial activities in the City, they would hire a transcription shop.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">There seemed to be printing companies in this world too…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Huh, I guess if anyone could use transcription, nobody would have to buy a book for a large sum of money…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeah, that’s illegal after all.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">There even seemed to be something like copyright in this world…</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“In the end, you should purchase to read a book. That’s for the sake of the author.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, you’re right.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Sara smiled sweetly as Ryo agreed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">After somehow managing to copy it, Ryo was taking a break before he asked Sera what he had been wondering for a long time.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’ve been wondering for a long time, but Sera-san is often in the library, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeah, I guess.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Wouldn’t the cost of admission amount to quite a sum…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Eh……”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Sera quickly averted her eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“E-eh?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“No… you see… I work in the mansion, so my admission fee is free…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’m so envious!”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It was a cry from the bottom of Ryo’s heart.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“We-well, I did pay at first? But when the Lord knew that more than 90% of the entrance fee income here was paid by me, he felt it was too much so it became free… Ah, but thanks to that, I could get permission for Ryo to enter the forbidden archives this time…”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">For some reason, he felt as though he could hear a proud clearing of the throat at the end and naturally he was grateful for her help.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Of course, I’m grateful for that.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">That was his true feelings.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Oh yeah, I’ll bring you to visit a transcription shop I know, to see the &lt;Transcription&gt; spell that I mentioned earlier.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Sera forcibly changed the topic.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“……I’d like that.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Ryo followed suit too.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I don’t know much about magic so…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Same goes for me. I’m not familiar with human magic, or the magic of the Central Nations, but… well, it’s been a while since I left the forest, so I think I can answer some of Ryo’s questions.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">(How old is Sera actually…)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo… you were thinking about something rude just now, right?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“N-no……”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Sera stared intently at Ryo. While Ryo looked away from Sera’s gaze.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’m about 200 years old.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo looked at Sera with surprise.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“What~? Was that unexpected?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Sera grinned, having succeeded in teasing him.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“No… I’m just surprised that you’re still so beautiful even though you’ve lived for 200 years…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“I-I’ll still feel shy if you say that directly to my face.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">With her face bright red, Sera turned to the side.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">After eating curry together at </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Hoshoku-tei</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">, they headed to the transcription shop that Sera was acquainted with.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">It was located on a street that was just behind the main street, but it was a pretty elegant store.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“The speed of transcription varies considerably from person to person, so the people who can do it faster can naturally increase the amount of work they can do and make a profit.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Sera explained the reason for the fine-looking store.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Well then, let’s enter.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">She said and was about to open the door when a person came out from inside.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Oh, Sera.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Abel, it’s been a long time.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel, holding a bundle of paper that seemed to have been transcribed, came out of the store.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Abel, it’s rare to see you work.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo? I do work, okay… wait, why is Ryo with Sera?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel was surprised and reacted to Ryo’s light tease.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Sera-san is my… so to speak, teacher.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo is my… so to speak, student.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then they laughed with each other.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“You guys are on good terms…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">While Abel was taken aback by the two of them, a person came out of the store.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Abel, close the door after you… Oh, Sera, welcome.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">It was a woman in her mid-thirties who came out.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Oops, I’m out of time. Well, I have to deliver this. Ryo, I have a lot to ask, so I’ll see you again another time.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Abel said and left quickly.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Hi Copyras, it’s been a long time. Ryo, this transcription shop is run by Copyras. It’s the best transcription shop in the City of Rune.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Hey, Sera, that’s an overstatement… Nice to meet you, Ryo, I’m Copyras.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’m Ryo, an adventurer.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Copyras and Ryo exchanged greetings.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Copyras, actually, Ryo said he doesn’t know about the magic &lt;Transcription&gt;, so I brought him to show him it. Sorry, but could you let him watch from the side as you perform some transcription?”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“That’s okay. Abel was in a hurry just now, but I have other orders that can be done slowly, so you could take a look as I do so.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">That said, Copyras guided them to the back of the store.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">The transcription magic that Copyras showed them was a literal </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">copy and paste</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> of the page.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Holding her left hand over the original page and her right hand over the target page.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I wish that a twin is born by the miracle of pen and paper &lt;Transcription&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_10">That made a duplicate page that was an exact copy.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">In addition, it could not enlarge or shrink the size but only transcribe ‘as is’, regardless of the size of the target paper.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Of course, it could not compare to the speed of a modern Earth copier, but it was sufficiently practical because one A4 page could be transcribed in about five seconds.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“This is amazing.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo commented from the bottom of his heart.</p>
	<p class="block_10">It may have been even more so because he just physically made a copy from parchment in the morning.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeap. This magic is one of the magic that changed human life significantly.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Sera, you’re exaggerating.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Copyras replied with a bitter smile to Sera’s heavily proclaimed words.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Was it an exaggeration? It’s an amazing spell and I think Copyras who mastered it is really amazing too.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Being able to see Sera’s way of appreciating things was very favorable from Ryo’s perspective.</p>
	<p class="block_10">Yes, not only flashy things were amazing.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Copyras, thank you for showing me something good.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“No, don’t mention it. You can watch anytime if you want to. Please hire us if you need any transcription done.”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Ryo and Sera left the transfer shop.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, there, Sera suddenly called out to Ryo.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ryo, I have something to say.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It was a surprisingly direct statement.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Eh? Sera-san?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, yes, that Sera-san.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Huh?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Until now, I imagined that you couldn’t help it because I’m B-rank, but… you called Abel without any honorifics, so I’d like you to drop it for me too.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Sera said and pouted.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">That was so cute.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“We-well, I don’t mind…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yes, then do it. Sera.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“…Sera.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">“All right!”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Sera exclaimed and smiled happily as she started walking.</p>
