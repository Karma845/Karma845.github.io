<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 5: Painful Thing: Love</h2>
<p>During the summer vacation at Morikawara Academy, there are school attendance days.</p>
<p>Once at the beginning of August. Once more between the end of Obon vacation and the beginning of the second semester on September 1st. A total of two times.</p>
<p>Having completed the second term&#8217;s lesson plans without a hitch, I am preparing for the school attendance day that is fast approaching tomorrow.</p>
<p>There are no other teachers in the staff room. Kurei-san has been called away for training, and the other teachers are participating in club activities.</p>
<p>Tapping away at the keyboard of my laptop, I let my thoughts drift to recent events.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a week since that day&#8230; when I went along with Kirihara&#8217;s lie in front of Kurei-san.</p>
<p>Kirihara and I have returned to being just gaming buddies.</p>
<p>Since then, I haven&#8217;t gone to Kirihara&#8217;s house even once.</p>




     

<p>I haven&#8217;t even seen Kirihara directly, nor have we communicated via smartphone. If I happen to see her online in the game, we casually invite each other to play. That&#8217;s the extent of our relationship now.</p>
<p>The content of our conversations has also changed.</p>
<p>We no longer talk about school, let alone real-life matters.</p>
<p>Even though no one is listening, those topics have completely disappeared. Now, we only talk about the game.</p>
<p>Since I started going straight home after work, I&#8217;ve had more time for myself. But I am conscious of feeling somewhat unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Right after being bound by Kirihara, I even despised her and my own irresponsible actions&#8230; but now it&#8217;s totally different.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t thrown away the disguise gear, and every time I cook dinner, I worry if Kirihara is eating properly.</p>
<p>I was full of lingering attachments. I wasn&#8217;t this dejected even when I broke up with my long-term college girlfriend.</p>
<p>I wonder how Kirihara is feeling?</p>
<p>Though I can&#8217;t come up with an answer, I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll learn something tomorrow.</p>
<p>If Kirihara doesn&#8217;t take the day off, we will have to face each other.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m a little scared.</p>



     

<p>***</p>
<p>When I head to the classroom at the start of the workday, the class is very lively.</p>
<p>Everyone seems to be happily sharing their recent updates. It looks like they&#8217;re enjoying the silly conversations after a long time.</p>
<p>I enter the classroom and stand at the podium. The noise doesn&#8217;t settle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, quiet down. The chime is ringing.&#8221;</p>
<p>While saying that, I look around the classroom.</p>
<p>I save looking in Kirihara&#8217;s direction for last.</p>
<p>For just a moment, our eyes meet.</p>
<p>There was nothing in Kirihara&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Before, when our eyes met for a moment, she would give me a knowing smile to a degree that wouldn&#8217;t give us away.</p>
<p>Now, she just has a serious expression.</p>
<p>I realized.</p>
<p>The Kirihara who enjoyed our secret and smiled at me affectionately will never appear before me again.</p>
<p>From now on, it will always be the same as with the other teachers.</p>
<p>I will only ever meet the perfect student who smiles at me out of courtesy, nothing more. The Kirihara who troubled me is no more. Like a dream or an illusion, she has vanished.</p>
<p>I felt lonely, but I had no right to say anything. No right to speak.</p>
<p>This is the natural retribution.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei? Hajima-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>A girl in the front row brings me back to reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s quiet now. &#8230;Are you seriously angry?&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;No, no. As long as you&#8217;re listening, that&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I forcefully push away thoughts of Kirihara and proceed to relay the necessary information.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t constantly watching, but Kirihara was expressionless the whole time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Once homeroom is over, there&#8217;s nothing left to do with the class.</p>
<p>Everyone disperses.</p>



     

<p>Silent, Kirihara picks up her bag, says goodbye to her classmates with a reserved smile, and heads to the student council room.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I think.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only natural that I have to face the consequences. I have no right to complain about losing Kirihara.</p>
<p>But&#8230; what about Kirihara?</p>
<p>What will happen to Kirihara&#8217;s feelings, who defended me?</p>
<p>How will Kirihara, who had to rely on someone like me out of desperation, face that loneliness from now on? How is she reconciling with her own heart?</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just involuntarily bound by Kirihara. Kirihara is also to blame.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve done nothing wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t thick-skinned enough to think that way.</p>
<p>Kirihara had protected me.</p>
<p>That left a lump in my heart.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Still, there&#8217;s nothing I can do.</p>



     

<p>&#8230;But once I make up my mind, that&#8217;s not necessarily true.</p>
<p>An incident that would change my mind would occur in the following days.</p>
<p>It happened several days after the school attendance day. That day, I had scheduled parent-teacher conferences.</p>
<p>I was to meet with Kirihara&#8217;s mother.</p>
<p>The parents of the other students had already finished their meetings by early August.</p>
<p>Only Kirihara&#8217;s mother had been put off with the reason &#8220;I absolutely can&#8217;t find the time due to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>She finally had an opening, and she contacted me two days ago.</p>
<p>&#8230;Who could she be? I wondered as I waited nervously in the classroom.</p>
<p>The door was closed to keep the air conditioning effective.</p>
<p>At the appointed time, the classroom door quietly opened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you Hajima-sensei? I apologize for keeping you waiting. I am the mother of Touka Kirihara.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman who appeared was dressed in a sharp suit, giving off an impressive aura. She had a well-kept appearance.</p>
<p>A stylish and beautiful woman, she wore slightly high heels. Maybe it was the mole under her lip, but she seemed strangely sensual. Her demeanor was courteous, but it wouldn&#8217;t be exaggerating to call her a femme fatale.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Hajima. Please, have a seat here.&#8221;</p>
<p>We sat facing each other across a desk.</p>
<p>&#8230;Naturally, she had a resemblance to Kirihara. She looked just like her when she took off her glasses.</p>
<p>Somehow, even her leisurely smile seemed similar.</p>
<p>&#8230;This beauty has been unfaithful?</p>
<p>Such a vulgar thought crossed my mind, and I hastily dismissed it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose all the other parents have already finished their interviews? I&#8217;m sorry for the late timing due to my circumstances&#8230; I truly apologize.&#8221;</p>




     

<p>Kirihara&#8217;s mother bowed her head, looking genuinely sorry.</p>
<p>She had an elegant gesture that made the one being apologized to feel shrunken.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; I understand you were busy. Please don&#8217;t worry about it. You&#8217;re the president of a talent agency, correct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s a small office, but fortunately, we&#8217;re on the right track. In August, one of our actresses had a major play where she was the lead, and just yesterday was the final performance. I&#8217;ve finally reached a milestone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; That must be tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing as an easy job. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s difficult for teachers too, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>While engaging in such small talk, I began discussing the same topics as with the other parents.</p>
<p>Her grades.</p>
<p>Her behavior in the classroom.</p>
<p>In Kirihara&#8217;s case, it included student council activities.</p>
<p>All of them were praiseworthy. She was well-liked by both students and teachers.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a wonderful daughter. She&#8217;s doing very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I say this, Kirihara&#8217;s mother is modest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. She might seem so, but at home, she hardly listens to me&#8230; I&#8217;m relieved to hear there are no particular problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I inquire about Touka-san&#8217;s behavior at home?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course&#8230; but, to be honest, I don&#8217;t have much to say. She spends a lot of time shut in her room. Judging from her grades, I assume she&#8217;s studying. Both my husband and I try to talk to Touka, but it&#8217;s difficult at her age. However, I was the same with my parents at that age, so I try not to be alarmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>While listening, I had many thoughts.</p>
<p>As far as I know, Kirihara is not currently living with this person. They&#8217;re trying to pass it off as &#8220;just a rebelious phase.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, that information is not something I should know. I can&#8217;t mention it here.</p>




     

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine. We only know the excellent student Touka-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so? But it&#8217;s really nothing serious. I was quite rebellious against my parents at her age.&#8221;</p>
<p>Without boasting, Kirihara&#8217;s mother continues as part of the conversation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I auditioned without my parents&#8217; permission and aimed to become an actor. I was strongly opposed, but I rebelled even more. I lived in a state of being halfway disowned&#8230; Compared to that discord, this is quite adorable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. So, your current job is the result of following that dream since then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t justify neglecting Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8230;Despite better judgment, I started discussing something more probing.</p>
<p>&#8220;To a greater or lesser extent, similar stories exist in other families. There&#8217;s no such thing as a perfect parent-child relationship. In that sense, there&#8217;s no need for excessive worry about Kirihara-san. &#8230;However, to be honest, I have some personal concerns about Touka-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s mother&#8217;s previously composed demeanor slightly faded.</p>
<p>&#8220;One day, Touka-san felt ill and had a fever at school. When we called, neither you nor your husband came to pick her up. At that time, Touka-san confided to me that she felt &#8216;lonely.'&#8221;</p>
<p>Bringing this up during the meeting might anger her.</p>



     

<p>But I couldn&#8217;t rest without saying it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your husband is a city council member, and you run a company. I understand you&#8217;re very busy from our delayed meeting. But could you possibly give Touka-san a bit more attention? She&#8217;s excellent and considerate of others. But because of that, she&#8217;s very bad at asking for help. As her teacher, I would be reassured if you could face her directly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s mother was stunned.</p>
<p>She looked as if she&#8217;d heard something unbelievable.</p>
<p>&#8220;I apologize if I&#8217;ve been presumptuous&#8230; If I&#8217;ve upset you, I apologize.&#8221;</p>
<p>Anxiety prompted me to say this, but she remained motionless.</p>
<p>Then, she murmured something.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you are&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I could only tilt my head in confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; Hahaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s mother suddenly smiled as if she&#8217;d come to a realization.</p>
<p>She seemed very pleased. But it was an unpleasant feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. You&#8217;re right. I remember the call about my daughter&#8217;s fever. I apologize for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8221;</p>



     

<p>Although she was apologizing, I didn&#8217;t feel any sincerity from Kirihara&#8217;s mother.</p>
<p>Instead, she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the desk, similar to her daughter, presenting her ample chest on the desk and looking up at me.</p>
<p>I was completely bewildered.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s going on?</p>




     

<p>&#8220;Hey, sensei. I have something I want to ask you, if you have the time? It&#8217;s a bit embarrassing to air my family&#8217;s dirty laundry, but last night, my daughter and I had a big argument.&#8221;</p>
<p>I frowned.</p>
<p>The content of her cheerful conversation seemed unthinkable.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been busy with the play, but things have finally settled down. So, I went to see my daughter for the first time in a while. I felt bad for sending someone else when she was sick, so I went to apologize, bringing her favorite cake. The moment I gave it to her, she threw it on the floor. &#8216;What are you doing here now?&#8217; she yelled at me with such fury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>Though she acted tough, how much Kirihara was hurt that day was evident.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had no choice but to explain that I was busy with a crucial play that could affect the company&#8217;s future. But she accused me of lying. The play&#8217;s director is a big name in the industry. He was also in charge of the play that launched my acting career. &#8216;You went to see him, didn&#8217;t you?&#8217; she said. Since she was right, I couldn&#8217;t argue. I wonder where she gets such information. Just a hunch?&#8221;</p>
<p>I was asked for a response, but I couldn&#8217;t speak. Kirihara&#8217;s mother deepened her smile and continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;I really love the director. Even though I&#8217;ve aged, he still cherishes me. Despite having a beautiful wife, he fulfills me as a woman. I can only return to my vibrant youth in front of him. Isn&#8217;t that wonderful?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told my daughter the same thing. Love is wonderful. It enriches your life and makes you very happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you think she did? She cried and then laughed. And then she said&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;Ah, I understand.</p>
<p>&#8212;It&#8217;s frustrating, but I really do understand.</p>
<p>&#8212;Love is so wonderful, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s fulfilling.</p>
<p>&#8212;I&#8217;ve thought that from a young age.</p>
<p>&#8212;In itself, that&#8217;s fine. Otherwise, it would be troubling.</p>
<p>&#8212;The time spent with a man is more precious and sweeter than with his own daughter. That&#8217;s how it should be.</p>
<p>&#8212;Because if love wasn&#8217;t wonderful, there&#8217;d be no reason for me to be neglected.</p>



     

<p>&#8212;If that wasn&#8217;t more important than his own daughter, then I&#8217;d wonder, why?</p>
<p>&#8212;I too wanted sweet memories, so I tried hard to find a good love early.</p>
<p>&#8212;I&#8217;ve always thought that, always admired it. To find my destined love quickly.</p>
<p>&#8212;Recently, I finally met someone wonderful.</p>
<p>&#8212;I was happy. It was the best. I was cherished.</p>
<p>&#8212;For the first time, I felt glad to be alive. So, I understand what you mean, Mom.</p>
<p>&#8212;I wish you were still that person for Dad.</p>
<p>&#8212;I understand now why Mom, saddened by being cheated on, ran to another man.</p>
<p>&#8212;Because I understand the pain of loss&#8230; It&#8217;s frustrating, but I am, indeed, your daughter.</p>
<p>&#8212;I didn&#8217;t want to resemble you in losing someone important. That&#8217;s the worst. Damn it.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I was desperately trying to suppress my emotions in the midst of the conversation. I was boiling with anger, feeling it churning in my guts.</p>
<p>At myself, and at the person in front of me. Anger kept bubbling up, and I couldn&#8217;t help it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think? What are your thoughts after hearing that story?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&#8230; why would you tell me something like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you should hear it. Weren&#8217;t you the most eager to listen? Or am I mistaken?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her attitude suddenly changed.</p>
<p>And then, that story.</p>




     

<p>I became certain.</p>
<p>For some reason, this person sees right through me.</p>
<p>She realizes that I am &#8220;that kind of person&#8221; for Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a story for you, too. Recently, Touka-san shared an old story with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we went to the hot springs for a day trip &#8212; she told me this story while eating onigiri on the train.</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s mother was bad at household chores, leaving everything to the housekeepers. She never made anything.</p>
<p>But, there was one time. During a family trip when she was a child, her mother made onigiri.</p>
<p>The result was far from skilled.</p>
<p>The shapes were odd, and the seasoning was all over the place &#8212;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, that onigiri was the most delicious, and it was the happiest time. The most important thing about a meal is indeed the atmosphere &#8212; that&#8217;s what she said.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing my story, the person in front of me wouldn&#8217;t be unsettled.</p>
<p>Probably, no matter what I say, this person won&#8217;t change. It wouldn&#8217;t resonate.</p>



     

<p>But that doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Only this person can truly save her&#8230; I couldn&#8217;t forgive her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara-san. You are a remarkable person. You run a company, and you worked in the entertainment industry since you were a student. There must have been unimaginable effort involved, hardships I couldn&#8217;t even begin to match. You&#8217;re amazing. &#8230;But excuse my rudeness, I must say this.&#8221;</p>
<p>I glare at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the worst mother for Touka Kirihara. She&#8217;s pitiful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s mother let out a sigh of exasperation.</p>
<p>Her face flushed, trembling.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine&#8230; you&#8217;re very good. No wonder Touka was so captivated by you.&#8221;</p>
<p>How far will this person go in provoking me until she&#8217;s satisfied?</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were just a typical fearful young man at first. &#8230;But you might not realize, behaving like you are now makes you much more attractive. It&#8217;s thrilling. Being glared at makes me want to be bullied. I&#8217;d even like to bully you a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s mother takes out a business card case from her bag. It&#8217;s a business card printed with &#8220;Miyoko Kirihara,&#8221; from an entertainment office. She writes something that seems to be a cell phone number on the back right there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, my number. If you get tired of Touka, do contact me. I don&#8217;t hold back more than usual. I&#8217;ll show you a side of you no one knows. Don&#8217;t worry. It&#8217;ll be our secret.&#8221;</p>
<p>I felt the worst. After a moment&#8217;s thought, I accepted the offered business card.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will never use it for that purpose, but I&#8217;ll keep it in case Touka-san becomes ill and I need to contact you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I reverted to polite speech to emphasize that I was speaking as a teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re very straightforward, aren&#8217;t you? I like that about you too. But I wonder if Touka will forgive you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, right. Let me advise you. We keep my husband&#8217;s position as a council member a secret. Given the current unrest, the fact that you&#8217;re &#8220;special&#8221; to that child is enough information. Be careful.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Understood. I&#8217;ll keep that in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do that. I&#8217;m hoping for a long relationship. Ufufu.&#8221;</p>




     

<p>In the end, what I lacked was perhaps realization and willpower.</p>
<p>The strength to pursue what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Miyoko Kirihara was a terrible toxic parent, but I&#8217;m grateful she spurred me on.</p>
<p>After finishing a day&#8217;s work, I didn&#8217;t head home.</p>
<p>I bought a baseball cap, sunglasses, and clothes at a discount store known for its low prices, took the familiar route, and headed for Kirihara&#8217;s home. My ex-girlfriend had messaged me saying she &#8220;wanted to talk,&#8221; but I replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m busy right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Upon arrival, I quickly rang the doorbell.</p>
<p>No one came out.</p>
<p>I took out my smartphone and typed, &#8220;I&#8217;m in front of your house. Please open up.&#8221;</p>
<p>From beyond the cold door, I sensed someone hurrying over.</p>
<p>The key turned, and the door flung open with force.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood in her usual camisole and shorts, her eyes slightly swollen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; Before Kirihara could finish, I hugged her slender body.</p>
<p>There was a pause in her breathing within my arms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Um, wait a minute&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not okay, it&#8217;s not right.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was pushed back, but I hugged her tighter.</p>
<p>&#8212;This girl is my benefactor.</p>
<p>Last summer, when I was struggling at work, I shared it with her, as usual, asking for her advice.</p>



     

<p>Even though I didn&#8217;t give any significant advice, Kirihara said I saved her.</p>
<p>&#8220;GIN is really good at giving advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you a sensei or something? No? I thought you&#8217;d be suited for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because of that, I didn&#8217;t end up dying. I chose a new way to live.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s my turn to save her.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a life that might have been dead anyway.</p>
<p>Even if my life gets ruined, I won&#8217;t regret it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s not okay. Really not okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gin&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mooou~&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sniffle. As I stroked her head, her tension relaxed.</p>
<p>We held each other for a while, confirming each other&#8217;s presence.</p>

<p>But, Kirihara only forgave me that one time.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was like an accident earlier&#8230; It&#8217;s troubling when you suddenly show up.&#8221;</p>
<p>After being invited inside due to the presence of others, she said this with a resigned attitude.</p>
<p>We sat in front of the TV where we always played games, and talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand you still have feelings. But, you should stop. We&#8217;ve been found out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s words were reasonable.</p>
<p>My realization was my own issue, and I had ignored the risks of being discovered.</p>
<p>If Kirihara wasn&#8217;t willing to reciprocate, it would end as unrequited feelings. And, if Kurei-san noticed my actions, everything might be exposed this time.</p>




     

<p>The &#8220;unhappiness&#8221; Kurei-san mentioned would be waiting.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can end things cleanly now&#8230; Is that not okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I don&#8217;t like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? You sound like a child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to leave Kirihara alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara, displeased, averted her eyes. &#8220;&#8230;That&#8217;s really unfair,&#8221; her lips moved slightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did something happen with mom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you when the time comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s better not to ask, I&#8217;ll stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, I&#8217;ve made up my mind. That&#8217;s why I came here.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be a lie to say I&#8217;m not happy, but it&#8217;s impossible. Shouldn&#8217;t we at least wait until I graduate? Until then, we&#8217;re just a student and a teacher&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you&#8217;re planning to wait until my feelings fade?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara froze again.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a year and a half until graduation. Can you live without relying on anyone, without seeking comfort from anyone, knowing how much you yearn for love, how you cannot stand being alone to the point your house becomes this messy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara grimaced uncomfortably. The laundry was left undone, there were no signs of the kitchen being used. The garbage bags were filled with convenience store bento boxes. The room was dusty.</p>
<p>&#8230;It was a bit more organized the first time I came.</p>
<p>The extent of the damage was easy to read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, you&#8217;ll find someone better than me. But, that would trouble me. I agree we should progress further after graduation. But, if we can&#8217;t return to the relationship we had before being found out, I&#8217;ll be restless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;What the&#8230; After all the times I&#8217;ve tried to tempt you without any enthusiasm from you, why are you suddenly so proactive&#8230; It&#8217;s unfair, really unfair.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was hit repeatedly, but it didn&#8217;t hurt much.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But still, it&#8217;s impossible. Kurei-sensei is serious, and if we get caught again, we might not get off so easily. It&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>Curling up like a small animal, Kirihara forced out her words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want Gin to become unhappy because of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;The made-up story to get through was indeed for my sake.</p>
<p>Just knowing that made today&#8217;s visit worthwhile.</p>



     

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true. Kirihara has a point. If our positions were reversed, I&#8217;d say the same. However, I have a plan. As Kirihara mentioned, the problem is Kurei-san. As long as she knows our secret, we shouldn&#8217;t return to our previous relationship. &#8230;Conversely, if there&#8217;s no problem with Kurei-san, it would be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The obstacle itself is quite simple.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can ensure Kurei-san will absolutely keep our secret, we can go back to how things were.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand the logic, but&#8230; is that even possible?&#8221;</p>




     

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t plan on doing anything violent. But, I want to look into it a bit&#8230; Actually, I&#8217;ve been curious about something regarding Kurei-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Her behavior when we ran into her at the hot springs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment she definitively recognized us, she inadvertently muttered my name.</p>
<p>After we froze in shock, she covered her mouth as if realizing her mistake.</p>
<p>&#8212;Kurei-sensei, this is&#8230; I was about to make excuses when she became significantly agitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;At that time, I thought she was surprised about us. But, after thinking it over, it&#8217;s different. She was troubled because I called out Kurei-san&#8217;s name.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wasn&#8217;t she also in disguise? She panicked because I recognized her.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;d be beautiful if not for the garish attire, I had always felt. But, the flashy outfit seemed unlike her taste.</p>
<p>It was a look that those familiar with the usual Kurei-san wouldn&#8217;t recognize as her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until I saw her face up close, I didn&#8217;t realize. Until then, I couldn&#8217;t imagine that person dressed like that was Kurei-san. &#8230;I sense the same scent from her. After deciding to talk after the holiday, her rushing off somewhere was concerning. &#8230;And her saying she&#8217;d relax at home during the Obon holiday was also a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;If you find it suspicious, everything looks suspicious, doesn&#8217;t it? It seems too convenient.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. But, I want to look into it. She might have something she can&#8217;t talk about with anyone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eye for an eye. Use poison to counteract poison.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you wouldn&#8217;t be violent, but this sounds pretty forceful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if there&#8217;s a secret, I won&#8217;t misuse it. I&#8217;ll only use it to protect.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;How will you investigate?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll follow her after work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teachers start their day early. Kurei-san is no exception. If there&#8217;s anything private, it would be at night.</p>


     

<p>&#8220;&#8230;How long will you do this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara looked at me worriedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it forever. Getting caught investigating is also dangerous. Let&#8217;s set a deadline?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. How about until graduation?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too long. Two months&#8230; no, one month.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a waste of time to spend on a secret that may not exist. If there&#8217;s nothing after a month, let&#8217;s properly end it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;Considering the balance with work, indeed, there&#8217;s a limit.</p>
<p>It might be a reasonable period.</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood.&#8221;</p>
<p>The time-limited detective game began.</p>

<p>&#8230;However, it&#8217;s not like I could just easily start doing such a thing right away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since you&#8217;re here,&#8221; I said while cleaning Kirihara&#8217;s room, and she asked me this:</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you&#8217;d try tailing her on the way home from work, but is it really that simple?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think most people would agree, but I&#8217;ve never had any experience tailing someone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll look it up.&#8221;</p>
<p>After tying up a large garbage bag, I searched &#8220;how to tail someone&#8221; on my smartphone.</p>
<p>Immediately, I came across several sites warning, &#8220;Do not tail people if you&#8217;re an amateur!&#8221;</p>




     

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feeling somewhat gloomy, I accessed each search result one after the other.</p>
<p>In conclusion, every site stated that tailing someone is not easy.</p>
<p>The purpose of tailing someone is to investigate them. To do that, you need to get as close as possible but being too close risks getting caught.</p>
<p>If that happens, at worst, you could be accused of stalking.</p>
<p>So, you need to maintain a distance where you won&#8217;t be noticed.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re too far away, you risk losing sight of the target.</p>
<p>You might get separated by a traffic light change, they might jump on a train, or suddenly take a taxi.</p>
<p>Successful tailing requires a delicate balance of distance, which in turn requires training and experience.</p>
<p>It seems that the advice against amateurs doing it comes from the physical and mental strength required, more than I imagined.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah, it&#8217;s not good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you hire a pro? Like a detective agency&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s definitely not good. If I&#8217;m asked why I&#8217;m investigating Kurei-san, I wouldn&#8217;t have an answer. Besides, if a professional starts thinking I&#8217;m a stalker, it&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what will you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Even if it&#8217;s hard, even if it&#8217;s not something I should do, I have no choice but to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be sticking around after work and on weekends for a whole month?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t do that. If tailing is hard, risky to get caught, and difficult&#8230; then I have to reduce the number of times as much as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>I knew it was reckless. But I had no other choice.</p>
<p>●</p>
<p>The next day, I went to work as usual and worked next to Kurei-san&#8217;s seat as usual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurei-sensei, I have a question&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, go ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thankfully, Kurei-san was treating me the same as always.</p>
<p>There were no signs of her looking down on me or being wary.</p>
<p>If anything, she seemed more concerned about me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sleeping well?&#8221; or &#8220;If there&#8217;s anything I can do to help, don&#8217;t hesitate to ask&#8221; she would say.</p>
<p>She had said things like that before, but it had increased recently.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of that, I initiated casual conversations during break times.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m thinking of finding a new hobby, do you have any recommendations?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh&#8230; that&#8217;s difficult. What kind of hobbies are you interested in? Sports? Something you can do at home&#8230;?&#8221;</p>




     

<p>&#8220;Anything fun. What do you usually do on your days off, Kurei-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I mostly relax at home. Sometimes, I go out for drinks with friends.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>&#8220;Is hanging out with friends your hobby?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a change of pace. It might not be a hobby per se. Oh, I do watch a lot of foreign dramas.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;ve heard they&#8217;re interesting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are hits and misses, but if you get into it, it&#8217;s enjoyable. You can watch an episode in about an hour, so it&#8217;s doable on weekdays.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I&#8217;ve been curious, Kurei-sensei, you often work late, right? What time do you usually leave school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About eight o&#8217;clock at night. After I get home, eat dinner, take a bath, and watch a drama, I&#8217;m exhausted. I sleep soundly till morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornings are early for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I want to be at school by seven, it has to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;I desperately memorized the content of our conversation.</p>
<p>After Kurei-san left her seat, I quickly took notes before I forgot anything.</p>
<p>Right now, what I needed most was information.</p>
<p>If Kurei-san had a secret, I wanted to find out when she had the time to do &#8220;something she wanted to hide.&#8221;</p>
<p>The work of a high school teacher means late nights and early mornings. There shouldn&#8217;t be much free time on weekdays.</p>
<p>If I knew when that time was, I could significantly reduce the number of times I needed to tail her, avoiding the worst-case scenario of getting caught&#8212;that was my plan.</p>
<p>(Excluding Fridays, weekdays can be disregarded. If there&#8217;s something, it would be on Friday night or sometime during the weekend.)</p>
<p>I have no memory of seeing Kurei-san looking sleep-deprived and struggling in the morning. I also eliminated possibilities from that perspective.</p>
<p>And so, just in case, I decided to confirm the nights of the first few weekdays as well.</p>
<p>Tuesday night. I intentionally slowed down my daytime work to create an opportunity for overtime.</p>

 

     

<p>Around 7:30 PM, I said goodbye to Kurei-san and left the school. Then, I retrieved the disguise gear hidden in a nearby coin locker&#8230; After changing, I returned to the vicinity of the school.</p>
<p>It was ten minutes before the time Kurei-san usually said she left work.</p>
<p>After waiting a bit, Kurei-san came out of the school. She started walking. She must be commuting by bus, like me. I came out of hiding and followed her, trying to empty my mind as much as possible.</p>
<p>Pretending it was a coincidence, I lined up at the same bus stop. All the disguise gear was newly acquired, and Kurei-san showed no sign of looking back. Still, I was quite nervous.</p>
<p>The bus was crowded enough that all seats were taken, which was just right for tailing.</p>
<p>Kurei-san sat towards the front and was constantly on her smartphone. I stood at the back, pretending to look out the window while waiting for Kurei-san to get off.</p>
<p>After about twenty minutes, Kurei-san finally got off the bus. Naturally, I got off at the same place.</p>
<p>It was a relatively wide two-lane road through a residential area. Kurei-san walked briskly along the sidewalk. There was enough car and pedestrian traffic that following her wouldn&#8217;t seem suspicious. I just needed to be careful not to lose her.</p>
<p>Several apartments and smaller condominiums lined the road.</p>
<p>One of them was Kurei-san&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>It was a not-so-large, two-story apartment. She probably lived alone. It felt like a traditional residential building, without a gate or entrance.</p>
<p>It seemed a bit risky for a woman to live alone, but there was plenty of foot traffic, and there was a police box nearby. The area might not have been that bad in terms of public safety.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t enter the apartment grounds but passed by, noting the door Kurei-san stopped at.</p>
<p>There were five rooms on both the first and second floors. Kurei-san entered the corner room on the second floor, furthest from the sidewalk. The only way up to the second floor seemed to be the staircase along the exterior wall facing the street.</p>
<p>There was no other exit leading to a different street from the apartment. The only place facing the road was where I was standing now. Luckily, there was a privately-owned café across the street. If I sat by the window, I could keep an eye on the apartment entrance. Even better, there was a small park on the side opposite the entrance, visible from the balcony, complete with a bench. It was the perfect condition for surveillance.</p>
<p>Grateful for the unexpected fortune, I moved towards the park.</p>
<p>The lights were on in Kurei-san&#8217;s room.</p>
<p>&#8230;I planned to watch until the lights went out tonight.</p>
<p>Even though it&#8217;s still August, the night is quite chilly. While buying unseasonably hot coffee from a vending machine, I simply waited for the lights to go out.</p>
<p>&#8212;Indeed, this is physically and mentally taxing.</p>




     

<p>Classes will start next week with the end of summer vacation. It would be even harder then. Moving today might have been the right decision.</p>
<p>●</p>

<p>The lights in Kurei-san&#8217;s room went out just past 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>Considering she got home at 8:30 PM, had dinner, took a bath, and then factored in the time to watch a foreign drama, the math pretty much added up.</p>
<p>Based on our casual conversation, I could tell there were no lies.</p>
<p>Just to be sure, I tailed her in the same way the next day, and again, the lights went out at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>&#8212;As expected, Friday night and the weekend are the times to keep watch.</p>
<p>With that conviction, I prepared for the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8230;Unfortunately, that&#8217;s where the smooth sailing ended.</p>
<p>***</p>




     

<p>The week began. Summer vacation was over.</p>
<p>The students, having returned to the classroom after the all-school assembly, seemed a bit out of it, possibly due to the summer break hangover. Among them, I was the one who looked the most exhausted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei, you look super tired?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Can you tell?&#8221;</p>
<p>As I responded, I reflected on the hellish three days.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t strange to expect Kurei-san to make a move on the last weekend of summer vacation&#8212;so I thought I&#8217;d try keeping watch at her apartment from Friday night, but it was a complete miss.</p>
<p>Friday was still okay. Kurei-san&#8217;s room lights went out at the usual time, and she didn&#8217;t come out after that, so I could go back home. I hadn&#8217;t had a proper meal after work and was a bit tired from keeping watch, but I was still energetic.</p>
<p>The hardship started from Saturday morning. Since there was a chance that Kurei-san might go out at the first train, I called a taxi before the first train and moved to the usual park.</p>
<p>Until the nearby café opened, I spent a few hours listening to a radio I bought to kill time. I had decided to actively keep watch until someone approached me as a suspicious person, but well, it was tough.</p>
<p>After the café opened, I was seated by the window and spread out a college entrance exam red book. If asked, I was prepared to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a ronin student who can&#8217;t study at home.&#8221; Occasionally, I pretended to solve problems, but mainly I watched outside, not to miss the moment Kurei-san went out.</p>
<p>To be blunt, it was excruciating. Time passed incredibly slowly, and it required both patience and concentration.</p>
<p>Sitting and keeping watch was hard, but it was also tough after spotting Kurei-san leaving.</p>



     

<p>I quickly packed up the problem book and notebook, paid the café master, and left the shop. Following Kurei-san only to end up at a convenience store or supermarket would suddenly bring on a wave of exhaustion.</p>
<p>&#8230;And then, when Kurei-san returned home, I went back to the café again. Naturally, the master gave me a suspicious look.</p>
<p>&#8220;I took a break,&#8221; I said, and he just gave a wry smile. I stayed in the shop for a long time, but since I ordered light meals and coffee refills several times, I wasn&#8217;t kicked out.</p>
<p>The café closed at 9 PM. Kurei-san&#8217;s room lights went out at the usual time.</p>
<p>Sunday followed a similar pattern (except for Saturday night when I was so tired that I spontaneously stayed at a nearby business hotel&#8230;).</p>
<p>Since there was school the next day, it was unlikely for Kurei-san to make a move. I left at 9 PM.</p>
<p>&#8230;Or rather, it was more accurate to say I fled back home because both my body and spirit had reached their limits.</p>
<p>There was no way I&#8217;d be rested by Monday morning.</p>
<p>&#8220;What kind of intense play were you into, huh? Trying too hard just because summer vacation&#8217;s ending.&#8221;</p>
<p>A boy, who often joked around, said, causing laughter in the classroom.</p>



     

<p>Among them, only Kirihara wasn&#8217;t laughing.</p>
<p>She seemed expressionless, but I wondered if she was worried. Or maybe she was just disbelieving.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll get used to it bit by bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though I wasn&#8217;t rested, work is work. I managed to finish homeroom to some extent and dismissed the students. Since today was only the opening ceremony and homeroom, I planned to finish early and rest&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hm?&#8221;</p>
<p>On my way back to the staff room from the classroom, I felt my phone vibrate and checked the screen. There was a message from Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your face looked really bad, are you sure you&#8217;re okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>I stopped in the hallway, looked around, and replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was tough, but I&#8217;ll go to bed early today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. You said it was tough, but it must have been really bad.&#8221;</p>




     

<p>Kirihara and I had exchanged messages quite a bit during the weekend stakeout. Without that conversation, time would have felt even longer, and I would have been more mentally drained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going to continue tailing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Okay. Just don&#8217;t break your body.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had shown concern over the weekend, but there were times when she was oddly indifferent, and her replies suddenly became slower in the middle of the conversation&#8212;a strange change considering how clingy she used to be.</p>
<p>But I appreciated her concern.</p>
<p>Feeling a bit brighter, I headed back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei? What are you doing here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was just about to head back.&#8221;</p>
<p>By coincidence, I ran into Kurei-san and returned to the staff room together.</p>
<p>&#8230;While lightly probing for her weekend plans, I headed back.</p>
<p>Sadly, I couldn&#8217;t gather any new information from Kurei-san, and the first week of the second term passed by.</p>
<p>And then, Friday night. I found myself keeping watch from Kurei-san&#8217;s homecoming time again. But, as usual, the lights went out around 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>I should have gone home at that time, but I was still not rested, so I decided to stop by a nearby hotel. The room was available, so I checked in.</p>
<p>After finishing my shower and getting into bed, my consciousness was cut off instantly.</p>
<p>As a result, I completely overslept the next morning.</p>
<p>I woke up around 8 AM, hurriedly left the hotel, and headed for Kurei-san&#8217;s home.</p>
<p>Luckily, Kurei-san hadn&#8217;t gone out anywhere. I rushed to the location and saw her hanging laundry on the balcony.</p>
<p>If she had gone out early in the morning, this whole week&#8217;s effort would have been for nothing.</p>

<p>After that, I waited for the café to open before moving to my stakeout position.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s when another problem arose.</p>
<p>I was just too sleepy. Excessively sleepy.</p>
<p>With classes now in full swing, my exhaustion was at its peak. Since last night—Friday—I had been completely worn out.</p>
<p>Today was even worse. A mud-like drowsiness clung to my head and wouldn&#8217;t peel off. It seemed there was no other remedy but to sleep.</p>
<p>The kind café owner even came over to express his concern.</p>
<p>Trying to distract myself, I sent messages to Kirihara and my ex, but neither replied. Especially since my ex, after being told I couldn’t talk at the moment, has unusually cut off all contact. Could our long, odd relationship of just exchanging messages finally be at its end? And why did it have to end now of all times?</p>
<p>Despite the dire situation, falling asleep was not an option.</p>




     

<p>If I fell asleep here and now, what was the point of all this—.</p>
<p>&#8230;As I struggled desperately to fight the drowsiness, my phone vibrated softly.</p>
<p>It was a message from Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you staking out again today?&#8221;</p>
<p>Relieved, I typed back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, I know you might be busy, but can you keep sending me chats to keep me from falling asleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you that sleepy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today’s bad. I could fall asleep in five seconds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s really bad. Where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At the café with a view of Kurei-san&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don’t you stop for today? It’s not worth breaking your body over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I’m fine. It’s just sleepiness.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>Even as we exchanged messages, I didn’t neglect to check outside the window. It was busy in its own way, but far better than merely fighting off drowsiness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei, you’re too stubborn.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though she seemed to be exasperated, Kirihara kept up with the chat.</p>
<p>Without touching the dummy workbook spread out on the table, and sipping wakefulness-inducing coffee, I continued to message Kirihara. There was no movement from Kurei-san’s place.</p>
<p>&#8230;I managed to get through about two hours like that, but after gobbling down a lunch sandwich, the drowsiness returned with a vengeance.</p>
<p>It was the ultimate level of sleepiness. If this drowsiness were a final boss in a shonen manga, the protagonist would despair before even fighting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, are you awake?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the few seconds waiting for a message from Kirihara felt perilous.</p>
<p>Just when I thought I had reached my limit, I felt a tap on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Startled, I turned to see a familiar figure.</p>
<p>It was Kirihara, done up in heavy makeup and wearing a chestnut-brown wig, a gal version of Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh,&#8221; I let out involuntarily, and Kirihara put her finger to her lips in a &#8220;shh&#8221; gesture.</p>
<p>After sitting down, she typed a message on her phone.</p>
<p>&#8220;You shouldn’t be loud in the café. There aren’t many customers, but still.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara ordered tea from the owner, glancing outside while sending me another message.</p>
<p>&#8220;The apartment in front is Kurei-sensei’s place, right? The furthest back on the second floor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked during our chat earlier. Did you forget?&#8221;</p>
<p>I vaguely remembered answering.</p>
<p>&#8220;The staircase leading down from the second floor is also attached only to the exterior of the building, huh. I see, this place is indeed easy to stake out from.&#8221;</p>




     

<p>Kirihara didn’t wait for my reply, continuing to send messages rapidly.</p>



     

<p>&#8220;Take a break. I&#8217;ll watch for you. If Kurei-sensei comes out from the back door, I’ll wake you, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara waited for my reply while looking out the window.</p>
<p>I felt a bit pathetic but her proposal was incredibly appealing.</p>
<p>If Kirihara hadn’t been here, I would’ve refused, but she was already here. It would be rude to refuse now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I’ll sleep for a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I leaned back and closed my eyes for a bit. It felt like I had only blinked, but when I woke up, two hours had passed. I had completely fallen asleep.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning,&#8221;</p>
<p>I was rubbing my eyes when a message from Kirihara came.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, I overslept.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn’t oversleep. You’re just really earnest, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>I immediately called the owner over to order more drinks, apologizing for taking up the seat for so long. He said he didn’t mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Study too hard isn’t good either. Take care,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Considering the owner&#8217;s personality, this café deserves more popularity&#8230; Maybe I should leave a high rating online.</p>
<p>&#8220;You slept well. No snoring, so I didn’t have to wake you. Feel a bit better?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much better. How about Kurei-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No sign of her moving at all.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>The owner brought our coffee and tea.</p>
<p>The two orders were because I had ordered for Kirihara as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn’t have to do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You’re really serious, huh? Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>We sat side by side, quietly sipping our tea. After a moment, Kirihara sent another message.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are we even doing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We agreed not to talk about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unless there’s a result, it all ends in vain.</p>
<p>But if we’re going to stake out, we have to keep at it, even if it’s tough. If we can’t directly get Kurei-san&#8217;s schedule, creating a gap would make the stakeout meaningless.</p>
<p>&#8220;If only we knew the timing. Or had incredible luck. Like, just by chance, Kurei-san leaves the moment Gin arrives.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agreed, then the messages stopped for a while&#8230;</p>
<p>Afterward, Kirihara picked up her phone, typed something, hesitated, and then put it down again.</p>
<p>She repeated this several times before finally sending it.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Hey, should we stop this?&#8221;</p>
<p>I looked up at Kirihara after reading the message. She looked incredibly downcast.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying this for just over two hours showed me how tough it is. Just waiting around like this&#8230; it’s a waste of so many things. If we keep this up, we won’t last.&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused briefly before continuing.</p>
<p>&#8220;New teachers don’t earn much, right? Staying at a hotel every week will be tough, won’t it? Even just for a month&#8230; You could spend that money on so many other things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara’s words were reasonable.</p>

<p>But I have no intention of changing my mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for worrying you. But I’m not stopping. I&#8217;ll continue for the next two weeks until the deadline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Looking at the screen, Kirihara&#8217;s eyes seemed to moisten a bit&#8230; I think.</p>
<p>She slowly pressed the screen of her smartphone with her fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would you go so far?&#8221;</p>
<p>I pondered over a response.</p>
<p>&#8230;The next moment, everything I had been thinking about was blown away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep an eye on the window for me.&#8221;</p>




     

<p>I sent the message to Kirihara in one breath, quickly packed up my belongings on the table, and asked the master for the check, paying for Kirihara&#8217;s share as well.</p>
<p>I hurried out of the shop, and Kirihara quickly followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;What? What happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Kurei-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just now, a woman in a red dress should have passed by the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? That was Kurei-sensei? &#8230;Seriously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which way did she go!?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Towards the station but—Ah!&#8221;</p>
<p>I started to jog, leaving Kirihara behind.</p>
<p>&#8212;There!</p>
<p>As I chased after her, I saw Kurei-san&#8217;s back in the distance.</p>



     

<p>A red dress shirt with frills on the shoulders, a black long skirt, and high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that really Kurei-sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it. She came out from the furthest back on the second floor.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the most dressed-up she had been recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara, I&#8217;ll do the tailing. You should—&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m coming too. &#8230;Being a couple might make us less suspicious in some places, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had a point.</p>
<p>I nodded and focused on tailing Kurei-san with Kirihara.</p>
<p>Kurei-san entered a beauty salon near the station.</p>
<p>We positioned ourselves in the food space of a convenience store across the street and observed Kurei-san.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;She seems to be enjoying her conversation with the hairdresser.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think? Just here to get a haircut?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Would she dress up that much just for a haircut? &#8230;Isn&#8217;t it more likely that she&#8217;s getting her hair done before a date?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hope inevitably rises.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, just meeting someone wouldn&#8217;t be considered a weakness, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s words seemed to caution against getting our hopes up too high.</p>
<p>&#8230;Kurei-san spent a good two hours in the salon before coming out.</p>
<p>She then flowed towards the station.</p>
<p>We couldn&#8217;t see her face as we were tailing her, but it was clear she checked the time several times.</p>
<p>She must be meeting someone.</p>




     

<p>The crucial question is, who?</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Maybe they&#8217;re meeting under the clock?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a small clock tower object in front of the station.</p>
<p>Apart from Kurei-san, there are a few others waiting for someone.</p>
<p>We watch from afar as the person arrives.</p>



     

<p>Kurei-san spots the person and waves happily, bowing politely as they come near. The person is wearing a tasteful gentleman&#8217;s hat. From where we stand, we can&#8217;t see his face, but&#8212;his hair is peppered with white.</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems quite older, doesn&#8217;t he? Not exactly boyfriend material but—&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But Kurei-san seems happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t seem like her father. They are close, with Kurei-san willingly linking arms with him.</p>
<p>The two then walk off somewhere.</p>
<p>Naturally, we follow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could it be, just maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;d be good if it were.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maintaining a distance that was neither too close nor too far, we continued to tail them.</p>
<p>Several hours later, we were back at Kirihara&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>Though we were tired from the tailing and stakeout, the sense of upliftment dominated.</p>
<p>We were checking the footage in the living room. The digital camera was connected to the monitor we usually use for games, allowing us to verify on a big screen. Kurei-san was seen dining in a restaurant with a man, smiling.</p>
<p>The footage wasn’t from a smartphone but from a digital camera Kirihara had brought. (&#8230;I was scolded for not preparing one myself)</p>
<p>Kurei-san&#8217;s and the man&#8217;s voices weren&#8217;t captured. Since there were no seats close by, it had to be filmed from a bit of a distance.</p>
<p>However, the scene of the two enjoying their meal was clearly captured.</p>



     

<p>&#8220;This man, he’s wearing a ring on his ring finger. He’s married.&#8221;</p>
<p>The footage didn’t just show them eating.</p>
<p>A scene where Kurei-san is handed an envelope that appears to contain cash is also clearly visible.</p>
<p>Kurei-san is surprised, clearly refusing to accept it at first.</p>
<p>However, when the man persuades her, she bows several times and quietly places it in her bag.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adultery or sugar dating—either way, it seems like a scene that would cause a panic&#8230; But, are you really okay with this?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara asked with a tense face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kurei-sensei has been good to you, hasn’t she? If you reveal this, things will never be the same. She’ll hate you. &#8230;Are you really okay with that?&#8221;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Two days after achieving the goal of our tailing, on a laid-back Sunday, I welcomed Monday. I told Kurei-san that Kirihara sought her advice and asked her to come to the student council room after school.</p>
<p>Kurei-san, unsuspecting, sat on the sofa.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you relied on me. So, what&#8217;s the consultation about?&#8221;</p>
<p>I sat opposite Kurei-san. After exchanging a glance with Kirihara next to me, I took out a clear file that was carefully stored in a tea envelope.</p>
<p>Inside, there were photos.</p>
<p>The video in the digital camera was converted to still images and printed at a convenience store printer.</p>
<p>The photos were of decent resolution.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I recalled what Kirihara said yesterday.</p>
<p>Showing her these would ruin my relationship with Kurei-san.</p>
<p>To repay the respect I had for my senior with betrayal.</p>




     

<p>There might be a better way. But this was the only sure way to protect Kirihara.</p>
<p>Living a life without being disliked by anyone was my ideal.</p>
<p>But lately, that’s changed.</p>
<p>Choosing something means giving up something else. It was the same when I quit the company I joined as a fresh graduate.</p>
<p>&#8212;At first, I thought you were just a typical greenhorn afraid of being disliked.</p>
<p>&#8212;But you&#8217;re much more attractive acting like you are now.</p>
<p>These words of encouragement coming from Miyoko Kirihara were extremely displeasing, but her words carried a strange persuasive power.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hajima-sensei?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kurei-san was perplexed by my stern demeanor as I spread the photos across the desk towards her.</p>
<p>The change in her was dramatic. Kurei-san&#8217;s eyes widened, and she seemed to freeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;This?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;These are photos from the other day, Saturday. We have a video too. After dining at the restaurant with that man, we filmed you all the way until you returned home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were tailing me!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her expression of disbelief pained my heart.</p>
<p>Licking her dry lips nervously, she continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also captured you receiving what seems to be money from the man.&#8221;</p>




     

<p>In an instant, Kurei-san&#8217;s expression shifted.</p>
<p>What surfaced was clear resentment. A look of hostility I had never seen before.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the nature of your relationship with this man. But if you&#8217;re meeting in disguise, it&#8217;s something that can&#8217;t be openly acknowledged by society—&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that at all!&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san leaned forward, slamming her hands on the desk in protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t joke around! You know nothing! That person is&#8230; that person is!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had anticipated various scenarios, but this vehement response was unexpected.</p>
<p>Silently, I waited for Kurei-san to calm down from her rough breathing.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;But, Kurei-sensei. Everyone seeing this would misunderstand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s words, sharp as they were, drew Kurei-san&#8217;s ire towards her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adultery, or sugar dating. That&#8217;s what everyone will think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Kirihara.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>I intended to reprimand her clear-cut assertion, but Kirihara stopped me with a &#8220;No way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood from your reaction, Gin. For Kurei-sensei, this man is very important. It&#8217;s not the kind of relationship we were imagining. But Kurei-sensei will respond. It&#8217;s the same as the relationship between us two. Kurei-sensei definitely wants to avoid causing trouble for this person. Even if it&#8217;s something that would be quickly understood as a misunderstanding, she wouldn&#8217;t want him involved in such a foolish commotion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Why do you think that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman&#8217;s intuition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Being given a reason with no scientific basis whatsoever left me internally deflated.</p>
<p>However, Kurei-san seemed to have her anger dulled.</p>
<p>With a troubled look, she sighed deeply.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s ridiculous, but you&#8217;re right. It&#8217;s all, all of it, your misunderstanding. Even if the photos were spread, it wouldn&#8217;t cause any definitive loss to me or to him&#8230; if I can explain properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Against this, Kirihara argued.</p>
<p>&#8220;But explaining to everyone is impossible. You know about the risks of being flamed online, right? Once it ignites, for the vast majority, the subsequent explanations don&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s impossible to completely extinguish it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that. That&#8217;s why I said it&#8217;s ridiculous but true.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san shook her head in dismay, as if to say she was fed up.</p>



     

<p>Then, she murmured with a very sad look.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a foolish story, but it&#8217;s not like there&#8217;s no damage to him or me&#8230; I absolutely refuse to involve him in such a matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The strong expression Kurei-san occasionally showed me returned.</p>
<p>She directed a rational gaze at Kirihara and me.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, what do you two want? To seek revenge by destroying me along with yourselves?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s not it,&#8221; I immediately responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might sound strange after all this tailing but—I don&#8217;t want to mess up Kurei-sensei&#8217;s life. I&#8217;m not interested in your relationship with that man. We just want you to keep quiet about us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All this preparation for that?&#8221;</p>




     

<p>&#8220;It was necessary for us&#8230; It&#8217;s a deterrent.&#8221;</p>
<p>A smaller nation arms itself with nuclear weapons to avoid being dominated by a superpower.</p>
<p>Direct confrontation would surely result in the superpower&#8217;s victory, but the fear of nuclear retaliation prevents war.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you leak our secret, we will leak this secret too. We want Kurei-sensei to become our accomplice.&#8221;</p>
<p>In today’s society, a relationship where &#8220;this person alone will never betray me&#8221; likely exists like this.</p>
<p>Partners who know each other&#8217;s dark sides and protect each other.</p>
<p>My strategy was to involve Kurei-sensei in the relationship between me and Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Becoming acquaintances through the sharing of secrets, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine by me. Honestly, if that&#8217;s what you two want, I have no intention of interfering.&#8221;</p>
<p>Negotiations concluded surprisingly smoothly, almost leaving us breathless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just don&#8217;t involve me in it. If it gets leaked through another route and everything collapses, don&#8217;t take it out on me. Also, if things get bad, I won&#8217;t cover for you anymore.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. Even if that happens to Kurei-sensei, we won&#8217;t get involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s settled. Let&#8217;s each protect our own&#8230; Is the discussion over?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I returned the photos to the clear file and tea envelope.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll head back to the staff room first&#8230; I think you know this, but don&#8217;t get too cozy around the school. Maintain at least a minimum level of decency.&#8221;</p>
<p>With those final words, Kurei-sensei left the student council room.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Good work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



     

<p>Though Kirihara and I remained in the student council room, we had no energy left. There was no afterglow.</p>
<p>We both sat back on the sofa, silently drained.</p>
