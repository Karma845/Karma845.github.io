<h2 style="text-align: center">Prologue: Favorite Things: Mischief and Bad Romance</h2>

<p>In today&#8217;s culture, who do you honestly believe will never betray you?</p>

<p>For some, it may be family. Others might say friends. It may be the lover. If married, one may respond with their spouse or children.</p>
<p>I cannot say I have a wife because I am still unmarried. Furthermore, having been dumped by a girlfriend during my undergraduate days, I am hesitant to use the term &#8220;lover&#8221;.</p>

<p>I have the customary devotion for my family, but when it comes to someone who would &#8220;never betray me,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t fully resonate.</p>

<p>I had friends, but none of whom I&#8217;ve maintained in close contact with after graduation. At work, I&#8217;m not charismatic enough to earn the trust of my superiors or coworkers.</p>

<p>However, there is someone who I believe &#8220;might never betray me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sensei, may I have a moment?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was after school hours. I was heading down the hall after homeroom, which featured the closing ceremony, when I heard a voice behind me.</p>

<p>I turned around and found Touka Kirihara in her uniform standing there. Her long hair, highlighted by the light streaming through the window, sparkled brightly in spots as she looked directly at me through her simple, thick-framed glasses.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could you accompany me to the staff room to get the key for the audio-visual room?&#8221;</p>



<p>The key could only be handed out under the supervision of a teacher.</p>



<p>&#8220;I left a CD in the classroom that we used during a lesson. I thought I&#8217;d return it.&#8221;</p>


<p>Kirihara-san, a second-year high school student and student council president, is a dedicated and good student who is highly valued by the school. She&#8217;s very different from me, who only started this spring.</p>

<p>Kirihara smiled softly when I nodded at her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>She bent her head in a little bow—her long, lovely hair flowing effortlessly.</p>

<p>I waited for Kirihara-san to join me before we went to the staff room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not returning it to Sensei and doing it yourself is so typical of Kirihara-san. You&#8217;re considerate and serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I became the student council president just by being able to read the room, so I have to be like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even when praised, she maintained her modesty and composure.</p>

<p>Despite her age, she exudes confidence, which I admire.</p>

<p>We entered the staff room and went to the key storage area.</p>



<p>“Oh, Kirihara-san. What brought you here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Along the way, a senior male teacher hailed Kirihara-san. She reiterated the same explanation, which impressed him.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as thoughtful as ever.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not really.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was praised just like earlier, but this time, she blushed gracefully. She doesn&#8217;t openly show her confidence when it comes to anyone other than me. Kirihara-san thanked him nicely for the key to the audio-visual room and stated, &#8220;I&#8217;ll return it after I finish with the student council work,&#8221; before leaving for the corridor.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s admirable. It would be so much easier if everyone were like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>I smiled cynically at the teacher&#8217;s remark, a look tinged with both agreement and disapproval.</p>

<p>My smartphone vibrated in my pocket moments later. The message notice came from &#8220;ARIA.&#8221;</p>



<p>『I&#8217;m waiting, come over.』</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; I&#8217;ll take a walk before writing the class journal.&#8221;</p>



<p>I said to the Sensei sitting next to me and step out into the hallway.</p>

<p>Then, taking a diversion, I went from the staff room to the audiovisual room.</p>

<p>Walking is my hobby. I addressed it during my self-introduction at the morning assembly, so all kids and Senseis were aware. Some students make fun of me, but no one finds it weird.</p>

<p>After entering the audio-visual area, I carefully opened the door. It was unlocked.</p>

<p>Once inside, I said, 『I&#8217;m here.』</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome.&#8221;</p>


<p>Having removed her glasses, Kirihara-san emerged from beneath the desk. She must have been hiding cautiously. She approached the door and locked it from the inside with a click.</p>

<p>Nobody else could enter now.</p>

<p>This is our private zone.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s always thrilling no matter how many times we do this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kirihara-san giggled, her stern, honor student demeanor barely intact.</p>

<p>However, her mischievous side was far stronger. And without her glasses, Kirihara-san&#8217;s features were astonishingly attractive, providing a dramatic contrast.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get caught if we do this too much&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s okay. I actually forgot a disk that Sensei used in class.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kirihara-san approached me and stood right in front of me. After a pause, she pressed her head into my chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm&#8230; This is Sensei&#8217;s smell. It makes me calm.&#8221;</p>



<p>After taking a few deep breaths, she took a step back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Secret meetings with your students at school&#8230; does it excite you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sadly, yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm-hmm, that&#8217;s very honest of you. You&#8217;re starting to get it, Sensei!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more like I&#8217;ve started to give up.&#8221;</p>



<p>I kept my voice quiet, but I was still concerned that someone would hear us. The fear of being socially obliterated far outweighed any s*xual excitement.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re such a downer. You should just accept it and enjoy it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kirihara twisted her lips into a smile. It was an unusually seductive smile for someone so young.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know, I&#8217;m wearing a little bit of perfume today. During lunch break, Kana-chan was like, &#8216;President, you should dress up too~&#8217; and she insisted&#8230; You know her, right? Kana-chan, the junior from the student council.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she spoke, Kirihara&#8217;s slender fingers reached for the scarf around her neck.</p>

<p>Kirihara continues to unravel her scarf.</p>

<p>I should have told her to &#8216;stop&#8217;, but that single word wouldn&#8217;t come out of my mouth. There was a reason why I couldn’t.</p>



<p>While I remained silent, Kirihara opened her chest wide.</p>

<p>I could see her lovely skin and a glimpse of her undergarments. She was the type who looked slimmer in clothes, so once undressed, Kirihara&#8217;s body didn&#8217;t look inferior at all compared to an adult&#8217;s.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know what scent this is&#8230; the one I sprinkled a little into my chest?&#8221;</p>


<p>Her arms reached out as if to entangle my head. The hand placed on the back of my head drew me closer.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;citrus?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Correct. Smells nice, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kirihara pulled me toward her as she sat on the desk. I remained in a half-crouch, drawn into her embrace while my head gently stroked.</p>

<p>I was completely at her mercy, buried in her soft touch and warmth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Does my body feel good?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu, I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kirihara hugged me tightly. It seemed like Kirihara was also thoroughly savoring the feel of me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder why human warmth feels so good and comforting. It&#8217;s strange, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, Kirihara&#8217;s hold on me was released.</p>

<p>But that was only for a moment. Fingers caressed my neck, came to rest on my chin, and with a gentle force, tilted my head up.</p>

<p>After that, Kirihara approached her face close to mine and kissed me.</p>


<p>It wasn&#8217;t just a light touch, her tongue boldly pierced my mouth.</p>

<p>I had no choice but to react as she crushed the tip of my tongue.</p>

<p>If I didn&#8217;t, what comes after is scary. Kirihara is very particular about kisses.</p>



<p>As our tongues entwined and rubbed against each other, occasionally, a seductive breath would escape.</p>

<p>The sound of her catching her breath and the soft &#8220;hnngh&#8221; from her was mesmerizing.</p>

<p>While listening to all this, I distracted myself by thinking about work. As an older person and a teacher, I should act as a role model. I should not let Kirihara do as she pleases.</p>

<p>It was a man&#8217;s pride and pretense.</p>

<p>With a, &#8220;Mhmm,&#8221; Kirihara pulled away from me and stared at me intently.</p>


<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; Well, I guess that&#8217;s fine?&#8221;</p>



<p>Without waiting for my reaction, she devours my lips once more.</p>

<p>Her tongue clashes against mine with greater intensity than before. It&#8217;s not about me responding, it&#8217;s a movement that stirs up my heart and thoughts.</p>



<p>(This is not good.)</p>



<p>Even though I try to focus on work to get through this, I can&#8217;t concentrate. Having taken my composure, Kirihara started to trail her fingers along my side. It was so unexpected that I involuntarily jerked.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve let my guard down.</p>


<p>Then, she continued to stroke between my ribs with a feather-like touch over my shirt, assaulting me with her caresses.</p>

<p>A ticklish sensation and another feeling I don&#8217;t want to acknowledge alternated. I wanted to show some defiance, but I no longer have the luxury to think about work.</p>

<p>Even my breathing is becoming a little erratic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nfufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kirihara purred happily, softening her kiss&#8217;s intensity and gently stroking my head.</p>

<p>Then, as if trying to melt my brain, she quickly nibbled every corner of my mouth. Just when I thought she was done, she would press my tongue again, caress the underside of my tongue, and do various other things.</p>

<p>&#8230;unfortunately, my body was already completely ready by the time she freed me from the long kiss.</p>


<p>&#8220;Sensei, you&#8217;re so cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gazing at me contentedly from up close, Kirihara was slightly flushed.</p>

<p>As if she was in a trance, the corners of her eyes were slightly droopy.</p>

<p>Kirihara looked really seductive without her glasses.</p>

<p>It was a face she would never show during class or homeroom.</p>



<p>As far as I knew, it was the secret side of Kirihara that only I knew—a side she showed only to me.</p>

<p>Calling her the most talented girl in school wouldn&#8217;t be an exaggeration. She is the President of the Student Council, but she kisses, she acts spoiled, and she even lets me touch her body.</p>

<p>She is a moving, breathing, and tempting bomb that could potentially destroy my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, shall we do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;We&#8217;re not doing it.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s the one thing I absolutely cannot agree to. It&#8217;s something we mustn&#8217;t do.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so stubborn.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though I verbally refuse, she definitely sees through my desire.</p>

<p>Kirihara continues with confidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am fine with it, okay? Because I like you, Sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>While caressing my cheek, she whispers a few words that could ruin me.</p>



<p>&#8220;It would make things easier for you—in various ways.&#8221;</p>



<p>As an older person, as a teacher, as an adult, it&#8217;s incredibly frustrating, but it&#8217;s also a tempting invitation.</p>

<p>However, this invitation comes with &#8216;ruin&#8217; as part of the package.</p>


<p>It seems contradictory, but that&#8217;s precisely why Kirihara is so appealing.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, she is fully aware of everything.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not just Kirihara, but girls of this age are acutely conscious of their own value.</p>



<p>Kirihara, who imposes this without any hesitation, is a troublesome &#8216;child&#8217; and a troublesome &#8216;woman&#8217;.</p>

<p>However, maybe not as much as me, but she won&#8217;t get off scot-free either if we were to be discovered.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s precisely why I can trust her.</p>

<p>Perhaps&#8230; she is the only one who won&#8217;t betray me.</p>

<p>&#8216;The only one&#8217;, I can think of in that way.</p>



<p>We are bound by a distorted form of strong trust.</p>

<p>Partners in crime who share a secret—surely, that&#8217;s what it is.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Sensei. Don&#8217;t worry about doing it, just let me kiss you once more.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had no right to reject.</p>

<p>For a while, I reluctantly obeyed Kirihara.</p>


<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/embed0006_HD.jpg" />


<p>A few years later.</p>

<p>Kirihara and I occasionally get asked how we first met.</p>

<p>We had to prepare two answers: one for show and one that&#8217;s true. A lie and the truth.</p>

<p>When speaking to those we truly trust, I always start the story like this:</p>



<p>&#8220;I’m in a secret, bad romance with a love dependent student. Everything started from there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sitting next to me, Kirihara smiles gently and says, &#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; continuing to listen comfortably to the story of how we first met.</p>
