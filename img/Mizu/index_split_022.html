	<p class="block_12">Far West of the City of Rune.</p>
	<p class="block_12">More than 4,000 kilometers away if connected in a straight line.</p>
	<p class="block_10">There, a party of seven was fully armed, waiting for something to happen.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“It’s here!”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Everyone held up their weapons at the Magician’s words.</p>
	<p class="block_12">A rectangular space of about 50 meters in front of the seven people was dyed black.</p>
	<p class="block_12">It was 5 meters tall and 4 meters wide.</p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">If members of the investigation team from the Knightley Kingdom’s Kingdom Central University were present, they might have pointed out that the object appeared exactly like what President Clive named the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Gate</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">A beautiful woman walked out of the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Gate</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">She was 175 cm tall and had outstanding style… but when scrutinized closely, she seemed to have something like a miniature horn.</p>
	<p class="block_12">And a thin black tail.</p>
	<p class="block_10">It was the Akuma Leonor.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">“Hmm… I dropped by thinking there was something strange but… so it was a man-made </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Altar</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">?”</span></p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">Leonor said before she began to walk towards the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Altar</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_10">It was as though the people there didn’t exist in her eyes.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Wait, Devil King. You will perish here.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">The Swordsman in the seven-person party shouted.</p>
	<p class="block_12">He was probably the youngest in the party… about nineteen years old.</p>
	<p class="block_10">However, the Swordsman was also the leader in a sense.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Hmm? Devil King?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">She intended to ignore them, but Leonor heard a word that she couldn’t overlook.</p>
	<p class="block_10">“Did you call me the Devil King?”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">Then, for the first time, Leonor turned to the seven-person party.</p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">“This </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Altar</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> was created at the cost of many sacrifices. It is well known that the Devil King will descend if a fire is lit!”</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">A man at the prime of his life who appeared to be a Priest shouted.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“And so… who are you insects who intended to cause the advent of the Devil King or whatnot?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">The young Swordsman answered that question.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I am the Hero Roman. The one who will subdue the Devil King!”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yusha? A brave? Oh, the Hero!”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Leonor laughed.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Lurid was the word to describe her laugh.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“You should be strong if you are the Hero, right? Entertain me. Come on, come on, come on. Let’s fight!”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Thus, in a location far West, the battle between the Akuma Leonor and the Hero Party began, with some misunderstandings and coincidental products.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“&lt;Holy Armor&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“&lt;Enchanted Weapon&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“&lt;Protection of the Wind&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“&lt;Evil Resist Up&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“&lt;Body Strengthening&gt;”</p>
	<p class="block_12">……</p>
	<p class="block_10">Spells were cast one after another, strengthening the Hero Roman.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">Leonor looked on with a faint smile.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“I’ve heard that humans are boring with how they are all about long-distance magical battles but… are you betting everything on that Hero?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Only the Hero can defeat the Devil King. Roman will defeat you!”</p>
	<p class="block_12">The Scout, who could not engage in the magical strengthening, answered Leonor’s question.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“I see. That’s right, only when you cross blades that it would be fun.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">In Leonor’s mind, her battle with the Magician in the Corridor was relived.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">(Ryo, wasn’t it… that was fun. I didn’t think that I would get shredded. Well then, I wonder how would the Hero fare?)</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">As Leonor finished that thought, it seemed that the Hero was ready.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Seeing that, Leonor drew her sword out of nowhere.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Well, Hero or whatnot, are you ready yet? I’m ready. You can come strike me at any time.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Then, with her sword held in her right hand, she bent the finger on her vacant left hand to provoke him.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_10">“Don’t underestimate me, Devil King!”</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">With youthful momentum, the Hero Roman closed the gap in an instant and followed up with a thrust.</p>
	<p class="block_12">However, Leonor easily dodged that full-body thrust.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Even after that, she dodged all of Roman’s sword strikes that were swung in all directions.</p>
	<p class="block_12">Dodging everything without parrying with her sword.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Kuh.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It was Roman’s first experience swinging his sword so much but not hitting anything.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Hmm……”</p>
	<p class="block_12">The Akuma Leonor muttered a little, and for the first time received Roman’s horizontal slash from the right with her sword and parried it.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Ugu.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Roman’s posture was broken but he managed to dodge Leonor’s follow-up horizontal slash by twisting his upper body before taking a large step back to widen the distance.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Offense and defense change.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Having announced that, Leonor quickly closed the distance and directly pierced Roman’s stomach with her sword.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Eh?”</p>
	<p class="block_12">It was Leonor who made the bewildered voice.</p>
	<p class="block_10">The Hero’s first move was a stab after a dive, so she just traced it and tried it herself… it was supposed to only be a stabbing motion to keep him in check… but the stab actually hit the target.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“This… is too boring.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">She commented before pulling her sword out from Roman’s stomach and swinging it once to fling away the blood.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yo-you…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Oh, you are free to attack me, but then I’ll fight back too? Now, isn’t your priority to help the Hero?”</p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">After saying that, Leonor no longer held even a millimeter of interest in the Hero party and headed for the man-made </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Altar</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">The </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Altar</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">was decorated with something like a large crystal the size of a human head.</span></p>
	<p class="block_12">“Yeah, this is a good jewel. The fight was boring, but it wasn’t a waste since I could get my hands on this.”</p>
	<p class="block_10">The jewel disappeared the moment she placed her hand on it.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Wait, Devil King…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">Perhaps it was the effect of the recovery magic by the Priest, the Hero Roman had recovered enough to stand up.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Right. Let me correct you, I’m not the Devil King or whatnot.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Nonsense. With that strength… what would you be other than the Devil King!”</p>
	<p class="block_10">It was the Magician woman who shouted.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Even if you say that… Well. I can only say that I am not the Devil King. Perhaps if you combine your strength, you can defeat the current Devil King? Besides, there’s a human with similar strength as I have? Yeah, that fight was fun. I would love to have such a fight once more.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">Leonor smiled, recalling the battle with Ryo.</p>
	<p class="block_12">“Not… the Devil King…”</p>
	<p class="block_10">The Hero Roman groaned.</p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_12">“Correct. My name is Leonor. Hero or what you call yourself, get stronger. At the very least, you have to be the strongest among humans. You are the Hero after all.”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“A person stronger than me…”</p>
	<p class="block_12">“They are about 10,000 times stronger than you. You have a long road ahead to devote yourself to.”</p>
	<p class="block_15"><span class="text_">Then, Leonor entered the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Gate</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">.</span></p>
	<p class="block_13"> </p>
	<p class="block_14"><span class="text_">At the same time, the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Gate</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_">disappeared, leaving only the Hero party and the </span><span class="text_1">[</span><span class="text_">Altar</span><span class="text_1">]</span><span class="text_"> missing the jewel.</span></p>
