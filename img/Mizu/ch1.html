<h2 style="text-align: center">Chapter 1: Favorite Perfume: Citrus</h2>


<p>Gin Hashima. Male. 24 years old, a teacher. His special power is, nothing at all.</p>
<p>Just why did someone as ordinary as me, a newbie teacher, end up in this kind of relationship with Kirihara?</p>
<p>To explain that in an understandable way, going back to the very beginning and explaining everything in order seems to be the most effective.</p>
<p>It all started back when I was still a university student.</p>
<p>It was the peak of my life thus far.</p>
<p>My parents were well-off enough to send money to me, a single living son, and I attended a famous university classified among the winners.</p>
<p>By my third year, I had almost completed all my credits. The spare time I had was dedicated to working a part-time job three to four days a week, managing a relationship that began through a mixer, and living my life freely and whimsically.</p>
<p>Job hunting, which I started right as I became a senior, went smoothly, and I quickly secured a job offer from a leading company.</p>
<p>Truly, the future was bright and promising. A leisurely, suitable university life. I had quickly found a direction for my thesis and spent my days playing around.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found someone else&#8221; she told me and broke up with me, but it was getting monotonous, and I had started to miss the time I spent alone more than the time we spent together, so the timing was actually just right.</p>
<p>At that time, I had started to get into gaming.</p>
<p>It was an online game.</p>
<p>I started it with the thought, &#8220;I won&#8217;t be able to fully enjoy it once I become a working adult,&#8221; but inevitably, I got hooked.</p>
<p>On days without part-time work, from morning to night, I was logged in, playing all day long. Without a doubt, I would have been a shut-in if not for my job.</p>
<p>Fighting powerful enemies with a small group, conquering dungeons. It was a game that fell into the genre commonly referred to as &#8220;hunting games,&#8221; and I continued to play it day in and day out with a few like-minded members without getting tired of it.</p>
<p>Among them was a friend who used a female character named &#8220;ARIA.&#8221;</p>
<p>She played from the evening into the night, which matched the time I could play because I was out for work during the day.</p>
<p>As you play together for a long time, you start to learn more about the other person.</p>
<p>&#8220;ARIA&#8221; was a sophomore in college. Even though there are many instances where male players use female characters, she said she was a woman.</p>
<p>Even though I only half-believed her at first, as we continued to chat, I started to think, &#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s true.&#8221; If it was a lie, then she had quite the acting skills because &#8220;ARIA&#8221; was very much like a girl even within the game.</p>
<p>Whenever cute equipment was released in an update, she&#8217;d always beg, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go get it,&#8221; and when she got it with my help, she&#8217;d thank me with a heart mark.</p>
<p>Maybe I wouldn&#8217;t have believed it just from that, but maybe because we got along well, she started to confide in me about her personal troubles from time to time.</p>
<p>There were serious concerns, like issues at school or fights with her parents, and trivial ones like, &#8220;Oh no, I gained a little weight. Know any good exercises?&#8221;</p>
<p>As time went on, I began to think, &#8220;Maybe she really is a younger girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;GIN, you&#8217;re really good at listening. I end up talking about a lot of things,&#8221; she&#8217;d say, making me feel good.</p>
<p>Saying it&#8217;s easier to invite someone when you know their contact information outside the game, we exchanged messaging app accounts. From then on, we also started to communicate outside the game.</p>
<p>Then, a decisive event occurred that proved &#8220;ARIA&#8221; was a girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I call you for a bit?&#8221;</p>
<p>I replied, &#8220;Sure.&#8221; We didn&#8217;t exchange phone numbers but used the calling feature of the messaging app to hear each other&#8217;s voices for the first time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice to meet you,&#8221; &#8220;ARIA&#8221; said, her voice clearly that of a girl, albeit a bit nervously.</p>
<p>The nervousness was only at the beginning, and as we talked, we became as relaxed as when chatting in the game.</p>
<p>I had the next day off from my part-time job, so we talked until she was satisfied. We talked from 10 at night until about 2 in the morning before finally hanging up. But even after that, we continued to exchange messages through the app.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry for talking so long. Thank you for putting up with my selfishness so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s fine. I had fun too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really? That&#8217;s good! I&#8217;m being a bit selfish, but can I ask one more favor?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to see GIN&#8217;s face.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have definitely refused if she had asked out of the blue, but after having a fun conversation, I didn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>I think the late-night mood also played a part.</p>
<p>I took a casual selfie and sent it, and her reply came quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks. I saw the photo. What should I do? I think you might be my type.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m happy even if it&#8217;s just flattery. Thanks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not flattery!&#8221;</p>
<p>To prove it, &#8220;ARIA&#8221; sent a photo of herself.</p>
<p>Her face wasn&#8217;t in it, but it was quite a provocative photo. No bra, just a skin-baring outfit emphasizing her cleavage, a challenging, provocative photo. She also sent a photo of her immaculate legs.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a photo I found on the net,&#8221; she said, even including her game screen in one of the photos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your service is thorough&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right? I&#8217;m a capable woman,&#8221; she boasted.</p>
<p>But that was it for us, exchanging phone calls and photos was just that one time.</p>
<p>Even when I was advising her, I&#8217;d ask, &#8220;Should we talk over the phone?&#8221; but she&#8217;d refuse from her side.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I rely on you too much, I might seriously fall for you. That might be tough,&#8221; she said, and I stopped pursuing further. &#8220;ARIA&#8221; and I returned to just being gaming buddies.</p>
<p>Two years later, in the spring when I was 24, I became a high school teacher.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t right after graduating from university because I dropped out of the leading company I joined as a new graduate after half a year.</p>
<p>&#8220;…Sensei? Hashima Sensei?&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing a voice from the next seat, I snapped back and turned around.</p>
<p>A female colleague sitting in the chair was looking at me worriedly, cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you okay? You seemed to be spacing out…&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…Sorry, Kurei-sensei. During work hours.&#8221;</p>
    
<p>She laughed gracefully, with a mature, gentle smile, dismissing my awkward apology.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, really! Classes are over, and it&#8217;s after school now, and there&#8217;s no staff meeting today… You&#8217;ve finished grading the small tests, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>After parting with Kirihara in the audio-visual room, I returned to the staff room and quickly finished grading.</p>
<p>After school, when there&#8217;s no meeting, it&#8217;s time to do office work at your own pace.</p>
<p>Teachers in charge of club activities are busy, but fortunately, I&#8217;m not in charge of anything.</p>
<p>Kurei-san continued to talk to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t something worth calling out for, but Hashima-sensei looked so distant, I got worried.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san is my mentor. She&#8217;s in her sixth year of teaching and teaches modern Japanese, the same subject as me.</p>
<p>Typically, a newbie teacher&#8217;s troubles are looked after by a teacher of the same subject, and &#8220;Mori Kawara Gakuen,&#8221; where I was assigned, was no exception. Kurei-san&#8217;s desk is next to mine, and in the staff room full of seniors, she&#8217;s the closest to me.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s popular with the students, her classes are meticulous… and she&#8217;s incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>Though she dresses modestly and tones down her makeup due to her profession, if she were to dress up, she&#8217;d definitely stand out.</p>
<p>From my first day, she&#8217;s been very kind and considerate towards me. She&#8217;s what you&#8217;d call an ideal teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, reminiscing about something from the past?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, well… just a bit, about my previous company.&#8221;</p>
<p>Most of it was looking back on my gaming days with &#8220;ARIA,&#8221; but it wasn&#8217;t entirely a lie.</p>



<p>Kurei-san&#8217;s composed face suddenly turned cloudy.</p>

<p>&#8220;…Was it tough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, there wasn&#8217;t anything good about my memories of the previous company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without exaggeration, nothing good happened since I joined the company.</p>
<p>After the entrance ceremony, I was supposed to undergo training with my colleagues, staying overnight, but on the first day of training, I fell ill with a high fever and ended up bedridden in the hotel. That was the beginning of my bad luck.</p>

<p>The fever didn&#8217;t subside for a week, and my training ended with me just sleeping through it.</p>

<p>Naturally, a gap formed between me and my colleagues<br/>
.</p>

<p>There were three of us from the same period in the department, but I was the only one who continuously received disdainful looks and scoldings from our boss.</p>

<p>&#8212;What on earth did you join this company for?</p>
<p>&#8212;You can&#8217;t keep acting like a student forever.</p>

<p>I was the first to understand when I did something wrong, and I was the one who most wanted to make things right. It was my life and my mistake, so I had to be the one to fix it.</p>

<p>But every time I made a mistake, and every time I was scolded for asking something my colleagues already knew, I gradually started making quiet mistakes continuously.</p>
<p>Even the colleagues who initially sympathized with me either got tired of it or didn&#8217;t want the focus shifted to them, and they started avoiding me.</p>

<p>From there, not much remains in my memory.</p>

<p>My evaluation never changed from &#8220;He was top in the entrance exam but can only study and is useless at everything else.&#8221; In the end, I left the company after half a year and spent the next half recuperating at home.</p>

<p>Only my mentor, Kurei-san, and the principal were informed about these circumstances.</p>

<p>Being spared from becoming a club advisor was a consideration from the school.</p>

<p>As for being a homeroom teacher, the main homeroom teacher is on maternity leave, so I&#8217;m the assistant homeroom teacher. The work content is no different from a homeroom teacher&#8217;s, but &#8220;it makes a big difference not having the title,&#8221; they said considerately.</p>

<p>Despite being treated more than kindly, Kurei-san still worried about me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t dwell on it too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. …I&#8217;m sorry for everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need. Not at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kurei-san shook her head lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, the day after tomorrow is when you&#8217;ll observe my class, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ll be learning a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I dont like that… Hashima-sensei, you&#8217;re so good at teaching, there&#8217;s probably nothing for you to learn from me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kurei-san starts off using polite language when she first speaks to me, but as the conversation goes on, she shifts to a more casual tone as if she&#8217;s speaking to a junior.</p>

<p>I prefer it this way. It feels easier than speaking with a senior colleague at work; it&#8217;s like talking to the sister next door, with no need to be tense.</p>

<p>&#8220;The principal and vice-principal also saw the printouts you made, Hashima-sensei. They were well-received. Normally, they would say, &#8216;Printouts are convenient and easy but don&#8217;t overuse them,&#8217; but they didn&#8217;t say anything. You must be really good at organizing information because you&#8217;re smart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;…Thank you. It&#8217;s encouraging.&#8221;</p>

<p>She probably chose this topic to praise me.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s truly too good of a senior teacher for someone like me.</p>


<p>&#8220;How are things with your students? Are you getting along well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not really. I haven&#8217;t been directly complained to, but sometimes I feel like they don&#8217;t take me seriously.&#8221;</p>


<p>The students genuinely looked at me only during the first three days.</p>
<p>After the class shuffle, students will listen to any teacher or homeroom teacher during this period, no matter what. It&#8217;s the &#8220;golden three days,&#8221; as written in educational theory books. It was exactly as described.</p>


<p>&#8220;After the first three days, the students stopped seeing me. They listen to what the school says through me, what adults say, but they seem to have judged that I myself and my words are worthless.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kurei-san nodded with an almost divine expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the tough part about being new. Kids around that age are incredibly sharp and merciless.&#8221;</p>

<p>The kind Kurei-san didn&#8217;t deny that I was being taken lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a path everyone goes through. But the fact that you&#8217;re aware of the current situation is admirable.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ends up praising me after all. As expected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Kurei-sensei also experience this bitterness?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you overcome it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I just gave up on things that were impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…That answer is unexpected.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because no matter how much you struggle, some things just won&#8217;t change. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s a job where there&#8217;s a class shuffle every year. Not dwelling on it is a valuable skill. It&#8217;s not good to not worry at all, but once you&#8217;ve done your best, the rest is out of my hands. It&#8217;s important to accept that some things are just impossible.&#8221;</p>


<p>But Kurei-san continued, saying it wasn&#8217;t entirely wrong.</p>

<p>&#8220;After all, we&#8217;re dealing with children, but they&#8217;re still human beings. It&#8217;s impossible to have everything go your way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;…I see. That&#8217;s very insightful. Thank you for the great advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without being modest, Kurei-san simply replied, &#8220;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221; Everything she does, truly everything, is so adult.</p>


<p>&#8220;Teaching is a strange profession, isn&#8217;t it? Even someone like me becomes a teacher the moment I&#8217;m in the position. Even if I&#8217;m inexperienced and lack confidence, I have to act like an adult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told that to a university friend who got a job at a railway company, and he replied, &#8216;Me too.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;True. Whether the person driving the train I&#8217;m on is a newbie or not, I see them as a professional.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how it is. Pretense is sometimes necessary. Since students are human too, why not start by finding kids in the class you vibe with and build a trustworthy relationship? There must be some who sincerely listen to you, right? Kirihara-san was one of them, wasn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>
<p>A sharp pain pricked my heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it still going well?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she likes you, you&#8217;ll be fine. Having her on your side will eventually help you manage the students without any major incidents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose.&#8221;</p>


<p>The school and Kurei-san have been very good to me, very considerate.</p>
<p>If they knew what I was doing with Kirihara in the audio-visual room earlier—they&#8217;d be disappointed.</p>


<p>&#8220;But remember,in the end she&#8217;s still a student. I&#8217;m sure you know, but don&#8217;t get too close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>…Truly, filled with an apology and fear, my heart was heavy.</p>

<p>While harboring feelings of guilt, there was a reason I couldn&#8217;t completely reject Kirihara.</p>

<p>Even though I had lost my place in society soon after becoming a working adult, I hadn&#8217;t entirely lost my purpose for life.</p>

<p>While my workplace environment was the worst, the company, being a leading firm, had strict attendance management, and there was no unreasonable overtime work like the kind that&#8217;s been criticized lately.</p>
<p>I was able to go home, at least.</p>
<p>The one-room apartment a few stations away from the company was dark and cold when I returned, but there was someone waiting for my return.</p>


<p>&#8220;Are you back yet? Can you play?&#8221;</p>

<p>ARIA always sent me messages timing my return.</p>

<p>Generally, I would accept her invitation and play with her.</p>


<p>At first, I declined because I wanted to study to catch up on the delays at work, but as the pressure from my boss increased and my bottled-up emotions grew, I spent more time with ARIA.</p>
<p>The more I didn&#8217;t want to go to work, the more I ended up playing into the night.</p>
<p>Looking back, that was the cause of the increase in my work mistakes, creating a vicious cycle. But without those times, I might have died.</p>

<p>There was a sense of inferiority for not fully transitioning &#8220;from a student to a working adult—from a child to an adult.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was a conviction that &#8220;that was my limit at the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eventually, after leaving the company and returning home, my interactions with ARIA continued.</p>


<p>I never told her about my struggles at work or that I had quit my job.</p>

<p>I wanted to pretend to be an adult in front of her.</p>

<p>It was a trivial pride, but the last one I had left.</p>


<p>After months of quitting my job and being in a daze, I couldn&#8217;t rely on my parents support forever. The final choice I made in searching for my next job was to utilize the teaching license I had acquired in university. &#8220;If I could only study, maybe I could be somewhat appreciated for that&#8221;—that was my thought in choosing this path.</p>

<p>The result, as you know.</p>
<p>Being good at studying is a given for a teacher, so I was disregarded by the students in three days.</p>

<p>But I wasn&#8217;t as depressed as when I messed up at my previous company.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t become a teacher out of passion, after all.</p>

<p>It didn&#8217;t matter if I didn&#8217;t try hard. As long as I could work without dying and create a foundation for living, that was enough. That was i belief.</p>

<p>The sensitive students must have sensed my true nature to some extent.</p>

<p>Yet, Kirihara—the student council president, Kirihara, was somehow different.</p>

<p>A glasses-wearing girl who was good at studying but didn&#8217;t dress fashionably, belonging to the plain category. She seemed quiet and timid, perhaps because of her character, she often got burdened with troublesome tasks.</p>

<p>Kirihara, who seemed like she would dislike a teacher like me, who harbored insincere feelings, somehow smiled at me and grew attached.</p>


<p>During breaks or when we passed each other at school—casually, she showered me with genuine smiles and charm, not just affectionate laughter.</p>
<p>I found out the reason for this when I was wandering around the school during a break from my office work.</p>

<p>When I passed by the student council room, I unexpectedly met Kirihara, who was about to leave after finishing her work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Still busy with student council work at this time? That&#8217;s tough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; You too, Sensei. Aren&#8217;t you going home yet?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I still have a bit more preparation for tomorrow&#8217;s class. I&#8217;m taking a break now.&#8221;</p>


<p>After a moment of thought, Kirihara spoke up as if she had made up her mind.</p>


<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something I&#8217;d like to discuss about the class. Can we talk in the student council room?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her tone was serious, so I felt a jolt of anxiety inside.</p>

<p>&#8212;Could there be bullying in the class?</p>

<p>I wanted to avoid touching on such heavy topics as much as possible, but I couldn&#8217;t refuse.</p>
<p>The fact that it was Kirihara asking also played a big part. I didn&#8217;t want to be disliked by her.</p>
<p>Entering the student council room, Kirihara locked the door from the inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want anyone to hear this.&#8221;</p>

<p>What could she possibly want to discuss&#8212;?</p>

<p>As I braced myself, Kirihara didn&#8217;t face me and quickly fiddled with her smartphone, finishing her operation swiftly.</p>
<p>Then, my cell phone vibrated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did your cell phone ring?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? Yeah&#8230; But right now, I think Kirihara&#8217;s story is more&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Please check your phone.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a gentle smile, Kirihara made me feel a slight sense of discomfort as I checked my smartphone.</p>
<p>It was from &#8220;ARIA.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In front of Kirihara Touka now, it&#8217;s GIN, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>I froze and awkwardly looked at Kirihara.</p>
<p>With a grin, Kirihara, without looking back at me, tapped her phone&#8217;s screen.</p>
<p>My phone in my hand vibrated.</p>
<p>Through the messaging app, &#8220;ARIA&#8221; was calling.</p>
<p>Kirihara showed me her phone&#8217;s screen.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re connected now, aren&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>


<p>For the first time, I truly understood that when humans are genuinely shocked, they can freeze completely.</p>


<p>&#8220;This can&#8217;t be real?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a lie. It&#8217;s ARIA. Sorry, I knew from the beginning.&#8221;</p>


<p>It wasn&#8217;t a strange story. I had sent her a photo once.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you said you were a university student&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, that was a lie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mentioned living alone&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a high school student?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My parents are <em>laissez-faire</em>, and it&#8217;s a bit of a complicated family situation. It&#8217;s not rare these days, right?&#8221; (tln : a policy or attitude of letting things take their own course, without <span class="AraNOb">interfering</span>.)</p>

<p>Is that so?</p>
<p>My mind wasn&#8217;t working well, and I couldn&#8217;t find the words to say.</p>
<p>Moreover, Kirihara&#8217;s demeanor was different from usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was happy. Because I could meet GIN.&#8221;</p>

<p>The &#8220;ARIA&#8221; I played games with and talked on the phone was nothing like the Kirihara in class.</p>

<p>&#8220;ARIA&#8221; was clingy, unrestrained, and transparent. She was the complete opposite of Kirihara in class.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you happy to see me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is&#8230; yeah.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was the girl who had become my reason for living when I was mentally down.</p>
<p>Though I was confused, I couldn&#8217;t think that it would have been better not to meet her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad. But I never thought GIN would become a teacher. And my homeroom teacher at that! Isn&#8217;t that amazing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s surprising.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without exaggeration, it was a miraculous probability.</p>
<p>What should one do in such a situation?</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it bother you that I am ARIA?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kirihara cut straight to the heart of the matter without beating around the bush.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Given my position, it inevitably does.&#8221;</p>

<p>We were close in age and shared the same interests. Had the situation been different, I might have even wanted to date her, but as a student, it was a different story. I hesitated even to interact with her as a friend.</p>


<p>&#8220;As a teacher, do I have to treat you the same as the other students?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>


<p>I felt relieved inside. Kirihara was indeed Kirihara.</p>
<p>She understood well.&#8212;However, that wasn&#8217;t the case.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see. But that would be boring for me. Can&#8217;t we have a little fun when we&#8217;re alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry. Please forgive me for that.&#8221;</p>


<p>I may lack passion, but I thought I had at least the minimum common sense.</p>


<p>&#8220;Come on. We&#8217;ve exchanged photos through the app. Do you still have my sexy photo on that phone?&#8221;</p>

<p>I was hit where it hurt and fell silent.</p>


<p>&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;re keeping it safe? That makes me happy. Hehe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reluctantly, I decided to delete it later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kirihara, let&#8217;s calm down and talk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, sorry, Sensei. It&#8217;s too late.&#8221;</p>


<p>Kirihara took something out of her sailor uniform&#8217;s chest pocket.</p>
<p>It was a thin device with a square shape, slightly smaller than the palm of her hand, with a blinking red light.</p>


<p>&#8220;This is a voice recorder. I&#8217;ve been recording. Sorry.&#8221;</p>


<p>Kirihara lightly stuck out her tongue and cutely put her hands together in apology.</p>
<p>What she was doing was far from cute.</p>
<p>I moved to take it away, but Kirihara pulled back and quickly loosened her scarf, hiding the voice recorder in her chest.</p>
<p>Inside her bra.</p>
<p>A groan escaped from the depths of my throat. I couldn&#8217;t make a move now.</p>

<p>&#8220;GIN is really kind. That&#8217;s why I like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>No matter the circumstances, if it became known that I had images of a student half-naked, I wouldn&#8217;t get off easily.</p>

<p>As long as that data exists, I can&#8217;t defy Kirihara.</p>

<p>On the surface, I&#8217;m the secret playmate of a well-behaved student.</p>

<p>As I reflected on my encounter with Kirihara, I managed to finish my work without incident.</p>

<p>I wrote the class journal, graded the quizzes, and completed the printouts for next week&#8217;s lessons. Since I had a meeting with Kurei-san about the final exam questions, it got a bit late.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good work. Make sure to rest well over the weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. I look forward to working with you again next week.&#8221;</p>

<p>After waving goodbye to Kurei-san in the staff room, I left the school.</p>
<p>The time was just past seven in the evening.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s late June, and although the rainy season hasn&#8217;t quite ended, today was clear. I walked through the school gates, heading to the nearest bus stop. After boarding the bus, I loosened the buttons of my short-sleeved shirt and gazed aimlessly out the window. Feeling my smartphone vibrate, I saw a message had arrived. It was from my ex-girlfriend. Even years after breaking up, she still contacts me from time to time.</p>


<p>&#8220;Tired? Are you done for today? I&#8217;m on my way home on the train. Going to have dinner with my boyfriend. We&#8217;re just going to laze around this weekend.&#8221;</p>
<p>even though i didn&#8217;t ask for it, she had sent me an update on her life. &#8220;As usual,&#8221; I thought, replying casually before returning my gaze outside.</p>

<p>Ideally, like my ex, my weekend should be starting from here. But, given my secret relationship with Kirihara, I still had things to do.</p>






<p>After about twenty minutes on the bus, I got off. It&#8217;s just about a five-minute walk from the bus stop to the apartment where I live.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a small one-room apartment, but it comes with a closet. After hanging up my tie and trousers, I quickly changed into the clothes I had prepared.</p>

<p>A sukajan jacket and ripped jeans.</p>
<p>I also donned a flashy blond wig. With colored contact lenses and fashionable glasses, I was practically a different person. Those who know me wouldn&#8217;t be able to recognize me at all.</p>

<p>I packed a backpack with a change of clothes, a towel, and a toothbrush for an overnight stay and headed for the entrance. When I have work to take home, I transfer items from my business bag, but today I had nothing to bring back. It was nice having less to carry.</p>
<p>Leaving the house, I headed not for the bus stop but toward the closest train station.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the station, I deliberately bought a ticket for a few stations away instead of using my IC card, to leave as little evidence as possible.</p>

<p>My destination was the apartment where Kirihara lives alone.</p>

<p>After getting off the train, I made a small detour before heading to Kirihara&#8217;s place.</p>
<p>Standing in front of the entrance, I sent a message saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ve arrived,&#8221; and sensed someone moving on the other side of the door.</p>

<p>The key turned, and the door opened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Welcome,&#8221; she greeted me with the same words as when we had our secret meeting after school.</p>

<p>The difference from the after-school time was Kirihara&#8217;s attire. She greeted me in a camisole and shorts, making it hard to know where to look. She wasn&#8217;t wearing her usual plain glasses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put on some proper clothes&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hot. And I don&#8217;t like turning the air conditioning too high.&#8221;</p>

<p>I felt the same, so I couldn&#8217;t argue much.</p>
<p>For now, I entered the house.</p>
<p>Even just at the entrance, the room was filled with Kirihara&#8217;s scent. I wouldn&#8217;t admit it to her, but it was a nice smell. A fragrance that could melt one&#8217;s rationality.</p>


<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at a good point in the game, so I&#8217;ll go ahead and make some progress.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saying so, Kirihara walked toward the living room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you eaten dinner?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. I was thinking of eating with you, Sensei.&#8221;</p>

<p>Expecting this, I had bought ingredients. After getting off the train, my first stop was the supermarket.</p>


<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it usually bento for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no work today, so I thought I&#8217;d make something proper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay! I love the meals you make, Sensei.&#8221;</p>


<p>Cooking is one of my few skills. During my university days, I worked part-time at a privately-owned restaurant. The owner was quite passionate about his cooking, and I learned a lot there.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take some time, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. If you need help with anything, just let me know.&#8221;</p>


<p>While talking to me, Kirihara skillfully navigated the game controller.</p>

<p>Deeply seated on the sofa with a bead cushion in her lap, she played the online game we usually play together, alone.</p>
<p>The apartment&#8217;s layout is 2LDK, and the space is quite large. Even with a sofa and a large TV, there&#8217;s plenty of room for me to sit next to her without feeling cramped.</p>

<p>The kitchen is well-equipped, too. I&#8217;ve supplemented it with various cooking tools and seasonings, so it&#8217;s fully stocked.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t have work, we can play a lot today. I&#8217;ve finished my homework, too. We&#8217;re not sleeping tonight, okay?&#8221;</p>

<p>When Kirihara says it, it sounds suggestive&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that. But I wouldn&#8217;t mind if it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>I walked into a trap. Shrugging exaggeratedly, I started to unpack my belongings.</p>


<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so considerate, Sensei. Bringing a change of clothes, towels, and all. Isn&#8217;t it a hassle? You come every week; you might as well leave them here.&#8221;</p>


<p>Since Kirihara had leverage over me, I&#8217;ve been visiting her place every weekend. It&#8217;s only on weekends and holidays, but it&#8217;s almost like we&#8217;re living together. Kirihara has always said I could leave my things in the extra room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I stop by home to change anyway, so it&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s what you prefer,&#8221; she said, sounding slightly disappointed but didn&#8217;t press the matter.</p>

<p>Not just on this topic, but Kirihara rarely uses her leverage over me to bind me with authority. She has only asked me for three things.</p>


<p>&#8212;I want you to spend weekends at my place.</p>
<p>&#8212;In various ways, I want you to be my playmate.</p>
<p>&#8212;When I want to be spoiled, let me be as much as possible.</p>


<p>These are the three requests.</p>
<p>If she wanted, she could make more malicious demands.</p>

<p>For example, asking for money.</p>


<p>However, it seems what Kirihara wants isn&#8217;t material.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s either lonely, deeply troubled, or both.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m guessing.</p>

<p>At least, the loneliness part must be correct.</p>

<p>When Kirihara heard I&#8217;d be cooking after getting by on convenience store bento and supermarket side dishes, she was amazed, saying, &#8220;I never knew home cooking could taste so good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8230;How exactly was she raised?</p>

<p>It&#8217;s clear from living alone in such a spacious house as a high school student, with not even a hint of her parents or any family, that her family background isn&#8217;t ordinary&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to it, Sensei&#8217;s cooking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her humming made it hard to feel bad.</p>
<p>Dismissing unanswerable questions from my mind, I focused on cooking.</p>

<p>Despite declaring I&#8217;d &#8220;properly cook,&#8221; the menu was quite ordinary.</p>
<p>Pork miso soup with vegetables, tamagoyaki, and grilled fish using a double-sided grill. The kitchen stove, which had barely any signs of use when I first came, is now a reliable ally.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a simple menu, but Kirihara loves these straightforward dishes.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s much happier when I make simple dishes rather than something overly fancy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Alright, I defeated the boss. It’s a good stopping point, so maybe I&#8217;ll take a shower now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going in first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. Then we can play all we want after we finish eating, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an efficient move.</p>
<p>These small accumulations are probably what make her an honor student.</p>


<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll take a bit more time to prepare, so go ahead and take your time in the shower.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay!&#8221;</p>


<p>She heads to the bathroom in a good mood.</p>
<p>&#8230;Soon after, I could hear the sound of the shower and Kirihara&#8217;s humming.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time Kirihara has taken a bath while I&#8217;m here, but it&#8217;s still unsettling.</p>


<p>&#8220;&#8230;What am I even doing?&#8221;</p>


<p>It&#8217;s not that I deeply dislike Kirihara.</p>
<p>I like games, and honestly, it&#8217;s fun playing with Kirihara.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean our relationship is acceptable. I&#8217;m stuck in a halfway situation.</p>
<p>If only Kirihara weren&#8217;t a minor and my student, there wouldn&#8217;t be any issues.</p>

<p>She&#8217;s probably the ideal partner.</p>
<p>Life doesn&#8217;t always go as planned.</p>


<p>&#8220;Whoops.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lost in thought, the miso soup boiled over.</p>
<p>I turned off the heat and cleaned the stove. Since it&#8217;s not mine, I can&#8217;t leave it dirty.</p>
<p>To distract myself from thinking about Kirihara in the bathroom, I focused on cooking for a while.</p>
<p>By the time I finished plating everything, the doorbell rang.</p>


<p>&#8230;This is a new situation.</p>
<p>Should I answer it?</p>

<p>But what if it&#8217;s Kirihara&#8217;s friend or parent?</p>
<p>I could feel my blood run cold.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, sorry! It&#8217;s probably a package, I think. Sensei, can you get it?&#8221;</p>


<p>Hearing her voice from the bathroom, I felt relieved.</p>
<p>Cautiously, I picked up the intercom to hear, &#8220;Delivery service!&#8221; A long sigh of relief escaped me.</p>
<p>I pressed &#8220;Kirihara&#8217;s&#8221; seal on the delivery slip and received the package.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprisingly light. The sender seemed to be a store. Online shopping?</p>


<p>&#8220;Thanks. Just leave it there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright&#8230; hey!&#8221;</p>

<p>When I turned around, Kirihara wasn&#8217;t wearing any clothes. She had on shorts different from before, but nothing on top. A bath towel loosely hung around her neck barely covered her chest, but the outlines were visible.</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, put on some clothes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh, it&#8217;s fine. We&#8217;re at home. You&#8217;ve seen it many times, right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about that. The air conditioning is on, and you&#8217;ll catch a cold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei is so serious&#8230; that&#8217;s cute though.&#8221;</p>


<p>Kirihara lifted the towel she used to cover her chest and started drying her wet hair.</p>

<p>I averted my eyes quickly, hoping I didn&#8217;t see anything.</p>
<p>Unfazed by my efforts, Kirihara walked toward the dining area.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, dinner&#8217;s ready! It looks delicious!&#8221;</p>

<p>Seeing Kirihara half-naked isn&#8217;t new to me.</p>

<p>But sharing a bath and still, it&#8217;s unsettling. I want to avoid getting used to it. If it goes that far, I fear I might never be able to escape.</p>

<p>&#8230;Probably, losing this feeling would lead to a steep downfall.</p>
<p>Her youthful, smooth silky skin has that much destructive power.</p>


<p>&#8220;Sensei, let&#8217;s eat. I’m hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get dressed?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. Just a cami though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn’t you dry your hair?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do it after eating. I don&#8217;t want the delicious food to get cold.&#8221;</p>


<p>Interacting with her normally feels like dealing with a mischievous younger sister.</p>
<p>As we said &#8220;itadakimasu&#8221; together, I harbored such thoughts.</p>

<p>After the meal, it was time for the eagerly awaited game time.</p>
<p>About three hours in, Kirihara stretched widely while still seated.</p>


<p>&#8220;That was fun. Let’s take a little break.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kirihara headed toward the entrance and quickly returned with the package I had received earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you buy clothes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. I thought I’d follow Sensei’s lead.&#8221;</p>


<p>Puzzled, I tilted my head.</p>
<p>I don’t recall buying any new clothes recently, nor have I dressed up to meet Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ta-da! Look at this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Opening the box and breaking the seal, Kirihara showed off her spoils with glee.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was clothing, but of the punk genre.</p>
<p>Having only seen Kirihara&#8217;s homewear, this was quite surprising.</p>


<p>&#8220;Is that what you usually wear?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don’t. I usually wear something more modest.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then it clicked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You said you wanted to follow my lead, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For disguise?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nodding, Kirihara pulled out a blond wig from the box. There was also a brown one. She tried on the blond one and asked, &#8220;How does it look?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Like a different person.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see.&#8221;</p>

<p>She walked to the stand mirror in the corner of the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, really! This is fun!&#8221;</p>

<p>Switching between the blond and brown wigs, she started to get excited. This side of her was quite childlike.</p>


<p>&#8220;When I first saw Sensei in disguise, I thought you were a different person. If we go out together like this, we should be fine, right? People who know us are less likely to notice.&#8221;</p>


<p>It&#8217;s been almost a month and a half since we started sharing this secret, but I haven’t gone out with Kirihara yet.</p>

<p>Even in disguise, I was afraid of being discovered.</p>
<p>I even refused to go to the nearby supermarket together.</p>


<p>&#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s go on a date.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll think about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Tomorrow is good. Tomorrow.&#8221;</p>


<p>Tomorrow is Saturday, and the weather is supposed to be nice. I checked before hanging the laundry outside earlier.</p>


<p>&#8220;How about going to a shopping mall a bit farther away? I want to stroll around a shopping mall with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn’t that where students from our school go on weekends?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, but if we disguise ourselves, we should be fine, right? The more people know us, the less likely they are to notice.&#8221;</p>



<p>Having reached the same conclusion while in disguise, I found it hard to argue.</p>
<p>But I still wanted to refuse. I needed a good excuse.</p>


<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2649533555761525" data-ad-slot="4361878888" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>





<p>&#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kirihara persisted, and I continued to search for an excuse.</p>


<p>&#8220;If you won&#8217;t go on a date with me, I might attack you tonight.&#8221;</p>


<p>Despite the outrageous statement, I chose not to react.</p>

<p>&#8220;Seriously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Putting that aside, should I make some tea? The warm kind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara likes tea. Even the cheap tea bags make her happy when brewed.</p>
<p>While the water is boiling, the topic of the date becomes vague and unclear. Kirihara also puts away the punk clothes and wig into a cardboard box, so I should have managed to smoothly sidestep the issue&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m filled with a desire to praise myself. Was I a strategist of Zhuge Liang&#8217;s caliber in a past life?</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;ve made tea, I want to play a bit more, okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>We continue to play until the date changes, about one more hour.</p>
<p>Then, without anyone starting it, yawns begin to escape us. Even Kirihara, as young as she is, seems to get tired after nearly five hours of almost continuous play.</p>
<p>&#8220;Should we go to sleep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>After getting ready for bed, Kirihara and I head to the bedroom.</p>
<p>Kirihara gets into the bed, while I lay out the sleeping bag I brought on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sensei, come here.&#8221;</p>
<p>She lifts the corner of the large towel blanket she&#8217;s using in place of a comforter, calling me over.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in the mood to be spoiled. Won&#8217;t you let me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her tone carries a slight edge. Implicitly, she&#8217;s bringing up the promise we exchanged.</p>
<p>&#8212;Let me be spoiled when I want to be.</p>





<p>&#8220;&#8230;If you don&#8217;t do anything weird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mhm.&#8221;</p>
<p>I reluctantly agree to a non-aggression pact and make my way to the bed.</p>
<p>I lie down, turning my back to Kirihara. I can smell her scent on the pillow.</p>
<p>With the lights off, Kirihara snuggles up against my back. Her arm stretches forward, making me into a human pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, about the date plan earlier&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s fingertips touch my lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m serious.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two fingers are pushed into my mouth. They split between my teeth, sandwiching my tongue from above and below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bite.&#8221;</p>
<p>She speaks in a commanding tone. With her other hand, she starts tickling my nape and collarbone. Not in a way that makes me laugh, but to arouse a certain mood.</p>
<p>Moreover, to ensure I can&#8217;t escape, she wraps one leg around my waist. When her tongue crawls along my nape and neck, an involuntary sound escapes me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even this makes you react? But there&#8217;s still more to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her breath is hot in my ear, whispering, while her tongue continues to toy with the fingers sandwiching it.</p>
<p>While her free hand checks various spots for reactions, she sweetly bites my shoulder and neck. I wish I didn&#8217;t react. I know it&#8217;s a cheap pride, but I have a man&#8217;s dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead. Try your best.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her fingertips, which were stroking the hollow of my collarbone, slide towards my chest. Midway, a toe tickles my skin, almost making me let out my voice again. I manage to endure it until she bites down on my shoulder hard. I couldn&#8217;t help but react to that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haha. its really fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gnaws, but not enough to cause pain. After intensifying her actions, she always soothes with her tongue or lips.</p>

<p>I find myself comforted, despite myself. Then she bites again, introducing a different sensation that makes me shiver.</p>
<p>She repeats licking and biting, a mix of sweet and stern. After several rounds, even the pain starts feeling pleasant.</p>
<p>I realize I&#8217;m sweating not from anxiety or tension, but from pleasure. It seems humans start to anticipate when they know there&#8217;s sweetness promised after the bite.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit scary.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll touch here too. Have you ever been touched like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>As I start breathing heavily, Kirihara attacks my ear. My attempt to escape only strengthens her grip with her leg.</p>
<p>She plunges her tongue tip into my ear, sucking it into her mouth and vacuuming up fiercely.</p>
<p>It feels like my brain is being directly sucked, and I couldn&#8217;t help but vocalize. I wriggle trying to escape, but Kirihara captures me, leaving me with goosebumps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was this your first time? Feels good, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>After whispering, she licks my earlobe. She sandwiches it between her lips, even giving it a kiss.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Sensei. I think I&#8217;m pretty lecherous woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought I understood, but apparently, I hadn&#8217;t. It was a bit beyond my imagination.</p>
<p>Not just my ear but she licks and sucks as if devouring the crevices and protrusions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kirihara, enough&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pleading with discarded pride, her leg&#8217;s grip doesn&#8217;t loosen. As if saying, &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk,&#8221; my tongue is tightly sandwiched by her fingers again. It was complete discipline.</p>
<p>How long was I subjected to this?</p>
<p>When I&#8217;m nearly out of breath, the fingers squeezing my tongue finally pull out, and the leg and hand that were wrapped around me slide off, rolling me onto my back.</p>
<p>Kirihara, straddling my lower abdomen, looks down on me with a dominance not fitting her younger age. Both Kirihara and I are drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we go any further, I won&#8217;t be able to hold back either. Which do you prefer, this or the date?&#8221;</p>

<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block; text-align:center;" data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-2649533555761525" data-ad-slot="1527292983"></ins>



<p>She finds my right hand sunk into the bed, brings my fingers to her mouth, and starts sucking them. Just rolling my fingers with her tongue feels good.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alright, I give up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment I say it, she smiles at me contently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay! Tomorrow is our first date.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara gets off me and moves next to me, snuggling up.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I thought I could win you over today, so it&#8217;s a bit disappointing.&#8221;</p>
<p>I pretend not to hear, letting it pass.</p>
<p>&#8230;That was close.</p>
<p>Really close.</p>
<p>If we had gone through with it, I would have regretted it.</p><p>The next day. We were walking through the shopping mall, dressed in outfits we normally wouldn&#8217;t wear.</p>
<p>The commercial facilities were crowded with families and couples on their holiday. A customer walking alone wouldn&#8217;t stand out much.</p>
<p>Kirihara was walking close to me, not wanting anything in particular.</p>
<p>Holding hands, intertwining arms, leaning closer, she&#8217;d occasionally look up at me and if our eyes met, she&#8217;d give a slight smile.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what it was like. To anyone who didn&#8217;t know the circumstances, we&#8217;d look like a typical young couple who&#8217;d met at a live house or somewhere similar.</p>
<p>No one would think of us as a student and a teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah, can we take a look over there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara pointed to a shop selling fancy little things.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind, but you haven&#8217;t bought anything yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t necessarily want anything. But looking is fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Besides trinkets, the shop also dealt in cheap rings.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about we secretly try on matching rings?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a break.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed joyfully. Even though she looked flashy, her gestures were elegant. I wondered if I was too paranoid about being viewed suspiciously by acquaintances.</p>
<p>After browsing the shop for a while, Kirihara suggested we sit on a bench in the corridor. While idly watching the people passing by, Kirihara played with my hand she was holding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you wanted to buy something specific by coming shopping.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not really. Staying home all the time gets boring, doesn&#8217;t it? Or did you want to play a game?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8230; Since I&#8217;m rarely invited out, this place feels quite fresh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m glad. I enjoy just walking side by side with you.&#8221;</p>





<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. My dream was to spend time like this with someone who knows I&#8217;m not just a good girl, but also a bad girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What? Surprised?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s just&#8230;typical.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so like me, right? The picture-perfect good girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>Though she laughed, there was a tinge of fleeting sadness. Since we were spending time together anyway, I wanted to take such moments away, even just a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there anything else you&#8217;ve been longing for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230; Maybe there&#8217;s one thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara took my hand and rose from the bench. We headed to an ice cream shop in one corner of the food court.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you have the app, buying two gets you an upgrade from single to double. They add one more flavor for free.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kirihara chose chocolate mint and lemon. I went for soda and strawberry, matching Kirihara&#8217;s preferences too.</p>
<p>After purchasing, we moved to a dining table in the food court, sitting side by side. Unfortunately, the seats along the wall were taken, so we ended up sitting near the middle of the plaza.</p>
<p>We began eating our ice cream.</p>
<p>Due to its volume, reaching the cone proved to be a challenge.</p>
<p>As I struggled, Kirihara tugged at my sleeve lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I have a bite?&#8221;</p>
<p>She grasped my hand holding the ice cream from above and took a bite where I had been eating.</p>
<p>Despite eating something cold, Kirihara&#8217;s cheeks were slightly red. It was noticeable because of her fair skin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious. Here, you can have some of mine too.&#8221;</p>



<p>I took a bite from where Kirihara had been eating.</p>
<p>She giggled, blushing.</p>
<p>&#8220;An indirect kiss. I&#8217;ve always longed for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She&#8217;s a strange one. We&#8217;ve had more intimate moments than this.</p>
<p>But for some reason, I felt my heart racing too.</p>
<p>Turning my face away to hide it, Kirihara continued with a laugh, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we came.&#8221;</p>
<p>Embarrassed, Kirihara and I focused on eating our ice cream in silence.</p>
<p>It was snack time, and the shop gradually became busier. The tables in front and behind us filled up, making the already tight aisle even narrower.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me~&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a voice came from nearby—a group of two young girls trying to move down the aisle to an open seat in the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to get through with the chairs in the way, is it okay if we pass?&#8221;</p>
<p>The girls managed to get past the diners before reaching us.</p>
<p>Eventually, they sat down right behind us, back-to-back with us. I was incredibly surprised.</p>
<p>Leaning towards Kirihara, I whispered.</p>
<p>(Are those two girls behind us&#8230;)</p>
<p>She nodded solemnly. They were familiar faces. Though in casual clothes, the two girls sitting behind us were members of the student council, just like Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really fun to hang out in a big shopping mall, isn&#8217;t it? There&#8217;s so much to see!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! We could spend all day here and not get bored!&#8221;</p>
<p>The two were lively, but we were the exact opposite—silent. Cold sweat was running down my back.</p>
<p>(Let&#8217;s eat up and get out of here quickly.)</p>

<p>Kirihara, who had agreed with a nod, hurriedly finished off the last few bites of her ice cream cone. I sped up too, but their conversation continued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Next time, we should invite the student council seniors to hang out too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah! Oh, that reminds me. I wanted to ask the president something over the phone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I panicked internally.</p>
<p>Kirihara tends to set specific ringtones for each member in her contacts and doesn&#8217;t put her phone on silent mode during holidays.</p>
<p>If it rang right behind us&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it about work?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, different, different. I was wondering if she liked the perfume I gave her the other day. If you want it, I can go buy it for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You really like the president, huh&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, I love her! She helps me with my studies and is so kind. She may not stand out normally, but she&#8217;s really dependable when it matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>As they said that, one of them, Kana-chan, took out her smartphone.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this, I found out for the first time the other day&#8230; The president without glasses is super beautiful! It&#8217;s like, you have to throw those glasses off forcefully!&#8221;</p>
<p>We had started to stand up and move, but it was crowded and we couldn&#8217;t escape quickly.</p>
<p>Then, Kirihara&#8217;s smartphone started to ring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The moment Kana-chan, who called, seemed to turn around.</p>
<p>At the same time, Kirihara&#8217;s hand swiftly pulled mine, which was leading. Turning halfway back towards her, Kirihara&#8217;s hands enveloped my face.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>
<p>Both Kana-chan and I gasped at the same time.</p>
<p>Stretching herself up, Kirihara kissed me right in the middle of the food court, without caring about the people around.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, aw!&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe they weren&#8217;t used to such a scene. The two members of the student council immediately turned their faces away and looked down.</p>
<p>Noticing that from the corner of her eye, Kirihara gently pushed my back.</p>
<p>While feeling the gaze of other customers on us, we quickly left the food court and went far away without saying anything.</p>
<p>My heart was still racing. Though my heart rate was fast, I felt a chill.</p>
<p>After moving from the food area to the apparel corner, I asked Kirihara.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Did you save me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her reply was as if it was the most natural thing, and it slightly surprised me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it that weird? I mean, I definitely don&#8217;t want to end your life or anything.&#8221;</p>





<p>The hand that was normally holding mine let go and changed to a lovers&#8217; hold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just want to be with someone fun, so my life doesn&#8217;t get lonely. For as long as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;How should I interpret this?</p>
<p>Should I be happy?</p>
<p>Or should I be afraid that I can&#8217;t return to a proper life anymore?</p>
<p>These thoughts, like Kirihara&#8217;s presence, were both the face and the flip side of the same coin.</p>
<p>Charm and destruction are always back to back, inseparable.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go home now. It doesn&#8217;t feel like a date anymore, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yeah. But, can we stop by one place before that?&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know the answer, but I wanted to thank her for saving me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The store that sells perfume.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kirihara stopped. She looked at me, puzzled. It was a rare moment as if time had stopped.</p>
<p>&#8220;You liked it, didn&#8217;t you? The citrus-scented perfume.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Kirihara&#8217;s face broke into a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or so you say, but wasn&#8217;t it you who liked it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t want it, we can go home without stopping by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait, wait. I do want it. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/Mizu/embed0007_HD.jpg" />

<p>She was in high spirits. As proof, she intertwined her arm with mine, pulling our bodies closer. It was the closest contact we had all day.</p>
<p>Afterward, Kirihara found the perfume that Kana-chan had let her try and bought it with her own money.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to pay as a thank you for saving me,&#8221; I said, but Kirihara refused.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to owe anyone,&#8221; she claimed, and when I said the same, she retorted, &#8220;I feel the same way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to muddle things with money&#8230; I just want to have fun, for as long as possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>Faced with her divine-like expression, I had no choice but to back down.</p>
<p>&#8230;Perhaps she had some trouble with guys other than me in the past.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kirihara doesn&#8217;t use the perfume she bought at school.</p>
<p>But when I go to her room on weekends, a slight, refreshing citrus scent has started to drift through the room.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how we slowly accumulate our mistakes together.</p>
<p>The longer we spend time together, and the more secrets we have, the number and density of our mistakes grow.</p>
<p>Becoming intimate with Kirihara means just that.</p>
<p>My sins are slowly accumulating──.</p>
