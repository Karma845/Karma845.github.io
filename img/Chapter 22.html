<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; Companion in Question</h3>

<div class="calibre3">"Waa~, I knew it, you have one! What's that person like?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">The tone of her voice is rising. Kurumizaka-san leans in close to Kiyokawa, curious.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka, who sits next to me, is also listening with interest</div><div class="calibre3">After all, girls love to talk about love.　</div><div class="calibre3">I'm also curious as to what kind of person Kiyokawa likes.</div><div class="calibre3">"Umm, about that...... he was actually a friend of mine from an online game, but......" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa confided in us with difficulty.</div><div class="calibre3">She is worried that she might ruin the expectations of the seniors.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ayane-chan! Don't be shy! I think online romance is wonderful, okay." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"She's right. In fact, Kazuto-kun and I also met through an online game." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes....... But, that...... is an unattainable love." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Why so?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"That friend of mine was married in the game and had a girlfriend in real life as well." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">""Ahh..."" (Rinka, Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san and Rinka utter a regretful voice as they pull back.</div><div class="calibre3">I have the same reaction.</div><div class="calibre3">"They were also very close, and...... They've played together all the time. Eee, so much so that there is no space for me to enter at all." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">By just listening to her words, it sounds regretful, but the way Kiyokawa speaks is dismally yet smiling.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not that she's jealous.</div><div class="calibre3">She is just watching from a standpoint of withdrawal.</div><div class="calibre3">"How did you meet that person?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"The first time we met was when we belonged to the same guild. However, he always went mining and rarely showed up at guild gatherings......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">It's just like Kazuto-kun'd do, Rinka mutters. I think so too. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: Maaan, it's you.)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa puts her hand on her chest as she continues.</div><div class="calibre3">"I was a female player, so I was well-liked in the guild. But at the time, I mistakenly thought that they were treating me with pure feelings......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Did something troublesome happen?" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. We were talking about holding an offline meeting. But when I refused to do so to hide the fact that I was an idol, I was...... inundated with criticism. I was called a stupid girl who couldn't read the atmosphere and other horrific abuses." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa's shoulders shake slightly as she seems to recall the incident vividly.</div><div class="calibre3">"I also have a similar experience. That's why I try not to make friends with anyone other than Kazuto-kun and Nana." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. That was what I did too. And when I was being reproached by other members of my guild, that person covered for me. He was very desperate and very angry for me....... As a result, we ended up leaving the guild." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa exhales a breath of relief when she finished telling.</div><div class="calibre3">And I, on the other hand, feel a tingling sensation somewhere in my head.</div><div class="calibre3">"Say, Kiyokawa-san. Is the name of that friend of yours――――." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"What a wonderful story, Ayane-chan! That friend is, a really nice person!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san, apparently moved, reaches and clasps Kiyokawa's hands vigorously.</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-yes....... In fact, I sometimes ask that gentleman for advice about real-life....... And, he listened to all my stories cordially." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What a nice friend, he is." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes. I also found myself falling in love with him....... I'd like to maintain our relationship and continued to get along and play together, that was why I hide my love......." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see......." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Isn't this a very touching story?</div><div class="calibre3">The person she fell in love with is married in the game and has a girlfriend in real-life.......</div><div class="calibre3">But she still wants to be with him, so she hides the fact that she likes him and continues to play with him as a friend.</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa probably thinks that if the person in question knows that she likes him, it will ruin their relationship.</div><div class="calibre3">"Aight! Next time, let's all four of us online together!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Maybe she doesn't like the gloomy atmosphere, or maybe she is trying to liven things up.</div><div class="calibre3">Kurumizaka-san raises her hand, says so cheerfully.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's good. After thinking about it, we haven't talked about the game at all." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"True. After school, we only talk about idol-related things." (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka and Kurumizaka-san nod to each other saying, "Yup, yup".</div><div class="calibre3">Being busy as popular idols, the girls didn't seem to have a chance to talk about online game stuff.</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's aside about arranging the plan later! Now it's time for lunch, lunch~" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">A hungry Kurumizaka-san holds a lunch box in her hand and shovels white rice into her mouth with enthusiasm.</div><div class="calibre3">Just watching her having her meal is enough to bring a smile to one's face.</div><div class="calibre3">"......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"What's wrong, Kazuto-kun?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"No...... it's nothing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'd like to ask Kiyokawa for the username she used, but it appears that she's not in that mood already.</div><div class="calibre3">She has completely switched the atmosphere and is in having meal mode.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Nana. I've prepared some tea over here." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Thank you, Ayane-chan!" (Nana)</div><div class="calibre3">As I thought, it's not mood to tell anymore.</div><div class="calibre3">......Well, whatever.</div><div class="calibre3">There is no way that Kiyokawa can be that person.</div><div class="calibre3">No matter what, there's no way that such a coincidence could happen.</div><div class="calibre3">It's just that we happen to have been through similar situations. If you are playing online games, relationship problems are commonplace.</div><div class="calibre3">My wife in the game is a cool idol, and my good friend is a neat and tidy idol.......</div><div class="calibre3">There is no way that such a miracle could have happened to me.</div><div class="calibre3">However, if...... Masked☆Aaya-san is Kiyokawa.......</div><div class="calibre3">――――Eh.</div><div class="calibre3">Masked......☆...... Aaya.............</div><div class="calibre3">With a snap, and the pieces fit together in my head――――.</div><div class="calibre3">"Senior Ayanokouji!" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"Eh, ah, yes!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa called me with a loud voice that sounded like anger. Or rather, her face looks angry.</div><div class="calibre3">"Why were you ignoring Senior Rinka?" (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">"What do you...... Ah." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I glance at my side.</div><div class="calibre3">There's Rinka, her cheeks puffed out as if she was sulking.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun is......ignoring my 'Ahmmm'......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, it's not like that, I was just thinking about something......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It seems that I was lost in thought, oblivious to Rinka's 'Ahmmm'.</div><div class="calibre3">"What were you thinking about. Is it more important than me?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, not at all. Rinka is the most important to me!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Geez...... Kazuto-kun......" (Rinka) <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: Save Nana-chan...... and Ayane.)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">Rinka's cheeks turned red as she turns shy. And it's d*mn so cute.</div><div class="calibre3">When I look at Rinka, I don't care about anything else. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5">(PTW/N: SIMP,,,,,,, and I envy.)</i></b></div><div class="calibre3">"......As I thought, they'd already been an idiot couple, had they." (Ayane)</div><div class="calibre3">In a sense, isn't it sound better than proclaiming yourselves husband-wife?</div><div class="calibre3">Kiyokawa murmurs, to which I reply in my mind.</div>
