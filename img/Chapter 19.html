<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; The True Identity of Kiyokawa Ayane ⑤</h3>

<div class="calibre3">It seems that Rinka won't be logging into the Black Plains today.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not surprising, right? Since it's a weekday.</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's go mining!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Controlling Kazu, I go mining by myself. <b class="calibre4"><i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17">(PTW/N: He always went mining... He must be having a powerful GPU.)</span></i></b></div><div class="calibre3">In my room, it's a simple task of clicking the mouse.</div><div class="calibre3">Then, a "Masked☆Aaya logged in" notification appears in the chatbox.</div><div class="calibre3">She immediately sends me a message.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazu! What should I do?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What's wrong?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I told that guy...... my secret!] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What secret?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Sorry, I can't tell you that! But it's a secret that will change my life forever.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">......sounds like a really terrible situation.</div><div class="calibre3">In order to find out more about the situation, I typed in a chat.</div><div class="calibre3">According to what Aaya-san told me, that man had been following her all day, and he had found out the secret she had been hiding from everyone.</div><div class="calibre3">The secret was something that would change Aaya-san's life drastically, and she must not let anyone find out about it.</div><div class="calibre3">And so, she went to the man's house, prepared for her end, and explained the secret to him.</div><div class="calibre3">......Something stuck in my head.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[And what's going on now? How about this handsome guy?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Nothing much. He was kinder than I thought, or rather, he accepted me as normal.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I don't know what exactly Aaya-san's secret is, so I can't say anything about it.</div><div class="calibre3">However, I can tell her one thing.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Be careful. A good-looking man will show his sweet face at the beginning to catch a woman off guard and then eat her.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......I guess that's true.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I'll tell you my story, there was once a girl who promised to marry me. But the next day, she was holding hands with a handsome guy and making out with him.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I see........ That's tough.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Yes, it was very painful. I even caught a fever and had to be bedridden the next day.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I can still remember that day. From that day on, I recognized handsome guys as my enemy.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[By the way, how old was Kazu at that time?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Five.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......What?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Around nursery school age.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[...... Aah.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Ee, what? Are you trying to tell me something?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No....... Age has nothing to do with love, doesn't it?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Somehow, Aaya-san's reaction is subtle. It's not relieving.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Anyway, you should be careful with that handsome guy.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I wonder if I should. But no matter what I said, the guy never made any attempt to harm me......] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I told you, it's a trap!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Mmmm. If he was going to do anything, I would have had it by today.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Then, the aim must be to raise Aaya-san's likeability!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't feel like that by the way....... The guy was just a natural.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Maybe it's his own way of hitting on women!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Mmmm. If I think about it calmly, it's more likely that he's a good guy because he's the kind of guy my senior fell in love with.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Calm down! You're being deceived too, Aaya-san!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I wonder about that. Ah, the guy doesn't seem to be a lolicon. I heard from my senior that he has always had a tendency to be fond of children.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[You handsome j*rk! You're not just hitting on women, but you're hitting on kids too!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I've heard that men have always had a tendency to be fond of children, and I wonder if that's true.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Not good. This is not good. Aaya-san is starting to open her heart to the handsome guy!</div><div class="calibre3">After all, handsome guys are to be feared!</div><div class="calibre3">After that, I keep trying to persuade her, "Don't let yourself be distracted by that handsome guy!" I try to persuade her, but to no avail.......</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[He listened to my words and improved his relationship with my senior, and I don't have anything to complain about anymore. He's always been straightforward with me.]</i></div><div class="calibre3">I came to this conclusion, she says.</div><div class="calibre3">It seems that Aaya-san had finally accepted the handsome man.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[By the way, how about Kazu'side? You know, that awful girl. She's a junior, right?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">She seemed to be referring to Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">Looks like she's trying to change the subject, but I guess that's fine.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Actually, there's been a development on my side as well. I had a talk with my junior girl today.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Hmm hmm. And?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......She was a girl with a huge gap. I'm just using this as an analogy, I thought she was a stubborn gal at first, but she turned out to be a dead-serious neat and tidy girl.] (Kazu) <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre17">(PTW/N: ゴリゴリのギャル [gorigori no gyaru]; I'm not so sure.)</span></i></b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Holy cow! Isn't she a real mess.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No, I asked her about it and she said she had no choice.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Heeh. Ah, but she was stalking you, wasn't she?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[That's more likely due to my fault too.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What's wrong, Kazu? Have you been deceived by that junior girl? She's starting to get on my nerves.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">She may be right.</div><div class="calibre3">I've learned a lot of things about Kiyokawa in one day.</div><div class="calibre3">To be honest, I'm filled with a desire to support her. I might even become a fan.</div><div class="calibre3">She's too sincere.</div><div class="calibre3">Originally, she was extremely shy and wanted to be a novelist, but she turned to an idol...... and established her popularity as a neat and tidy idol.</div><div class="calibre3">In addition, as the leader behind the scenes, she also manages the other members. It's really a lot of hard work.</div><div class="calibre3">Furthermore, to protect the image of the neat and tidy idol at school, she was having lunch in the lavatory.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Yup. She's not a bad girl after all. She's just a hard worker who's desperately pursuing her dream.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No, no, no! Calm down! She's been treating you like a womanizer and stalking you at school, isn't she!?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Ah, the misunderstanding about the womanizer thing has been cleared up. So it's okay now.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It's not okay at all! Then what about she was stalking you?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It could be considered as protection, if you think about it. I mean, the famous people have bodyguards and stuff, right.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[You're too positive!] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">After that, Aaya-san adds, "Kazu is mistaken! I don't know the details of the situation, but that woman is definitely dangerous!" She keeps saying things like that, but it didn't reach my heart......</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[I guess we can get along somehow from now on.]</i></div><div class="calibre3">I've come to this conclusion.</div><div class="calibre3">So, now I want to be friends with Kiyokawa in a natural way.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazu is a pretty simple guy.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Huh? If you say so, then Aaya-san is a simple woman as well.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Huh?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Huh?] [Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">A touch-and-go situation. We're on the brink of arguing.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazu hates handsome men too much, to begin with. Not all of them are bad. The handsome guy my senior is dating is a good person.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I think it's true that there are some handsome men out there! But that guy is dangerous! Because he's going out with a girl who looks like Rinka!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Isn't that, just jealousy.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I'm not jeealous!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......you made a typo there, you know? You're upset, then.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Haha, I am jealous?</div><div class="calibre3">I'm dating a real Rinka, you know?</div><div class="calibre3">How in the world can I be jealous?</div><div class="calibre3">That's why, this is a――――murderous intent.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Aaya-san treats my junior girl like she's a bad person, too. That's also a terrible assumption.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No, she definitely is, isn't she? He treated his senior as a womanizer and stalked him at school.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[There's a deeper reason for that too!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Then, what's that reason?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I can't tell you that because it's a special circumstance!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't get it!] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Strangely enough――I'm mysteriously defending the person I was complaining about from the person I was asking for a confide.</div><div class="calibre3">I was defending my junior (Kiyokawa), and Aaya-san was defending that handsome guy.</div><div class="calibre3">What the hell are these uncanny exchanges?</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Well...... Umm, we've been through a lot....... I think it's time to do Daily Missions now?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Let's go!] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">The conclusion of the conversation is made.</div><div class="calibre3">In other words, we prioritized the game.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, I guess this is the right thing to do as a gamer.</div><div class="calibre3">Aaya-san and I exchanged complaints about real life while keeping our personal information to ourselves, and afterward, we play the game together.......</div><div class="calibre3">Isn't this one of the ideal human relationships?</div><div class="calibre3">Anyway, today's incident has definitely shortened the distance between me and Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">There will come a day when we can talk happily.</div><div class="calibre3">I have no proof about it, but I'm convinced.</div>
