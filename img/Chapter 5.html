<h2>Chapter 5</h2>


<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Round 5 – You Want to Make Me Eat a Lot, Right? 1</strong></p>

<p>“Yo yo yo, Mamori Suzufumi-san yo”</p>

<p>In class 2-A, second row from the windowside, second seat from the front.</p>
<p>The moment I sat down in my seat, the thug in the seat in front of me glared at me.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Hozumi.”</p>
<p>“I’m so angry, man. I thought you were my friend.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks for that.”</p>

<p>Yesterday, during the opening ceremony, he wouldn’t stop bragging about his girlfriend to me, but today he’s openly expressing the complete opposite emotion.</p>
<p>He’s a busy guy, flipping between being sweet and angry.</p>

<p>“You confessed to Arisu Yuzuki, didn’t you?”</p>

<p>The pencil case I was about to put away slipped from my hands.</p>

<p>“…Why do you know that?”</p>
<p>“I heard it from a friend in the student council. They said you called Arisu Yuzuki to the Resource Room after school yesterday.”</p>

<p>As expected, it’s impossible to keep things secret.</p>
<p>From a senior to a junior, then to their friends——I thought I felt an unusual number of gazes on me from the moment I stepped onto the school grounds today, and it seems it wasn’t just my imagination.</p>

<p>“After all that preaching to others, you’re overtaking corners yourself, huh? You’re pretending to be a sensible person.”</p>
<p>“Common sense doesn’t apply to love.”</p>
<p>“Well, I understand the feeling of awakening to a forbidden love.”</p>

<p>As expected, a man who has a teacher as a lover catches on quickly.</p>
<p>By the way, the teacher Hozumi is dating was a Japanese history teacher.</p>
<p>She’s usually a calm and collected woman, but she seems to be surprisingly proactive in love.</p>

<p>“Jokes aside, be careful not to attract strange rivalry from those you don’t know. You’re the one who will be in trouble if you get entangled with those pesky fans.”</p>

<p>Thanks for the warning, my friend.</p>
<p>He’s right, I want to spend my high school life peacefully. If there are hardcore fans of Yuzuki in the school, it wouldn’t be strange to receive a night raid.</p>
<p>For a while, I should refrain from going out after dark.</p>

<p>The bell rang, and the scattered classmates each took their seats.</p>
<p>Within a minute, our homeroom teacher entered the room.</p>
<p>Her appearance, with a wrinkle-free gray jacket, a crisp pure white blouse, and a skirt slightly longer than knee-length, gave off an impression of being quite stern at first glance.</p>

<p>“Good morning, everyone. I’ll take attendance now.”</p>

<p>Her short bob of black hair swayed smoothly. Her soft-spoken greeting was like the singing of a spirit standing by the lake’s edge.</p>
<p>Mikami Momose. Our second-year class A homeroom teacher who was in charge of modern literature.</p>
<p>She’s estimated to be in her mid-twenties and is probably the youngest teacher at Orikita High School.</p>
<p>She’s an object of admiration among the male students.</p>

<p>Round eyes, a button nose, and glossy lips.</p>
<p>Her face, combining innocence and dignity, would not seem out of place even in an idol group.</p>

<p>Kind to everyone, yet strict at times. Serious and honest, yet she would occasionally talk about her hobbies during class or have fun with the students at the sports festival.</p>
<p>Her mischievousness appropriate for her age is also her popular point.</p>

<p>“We’re lucky to have Momo-chan as our homeroom teacher.”</p>
<p>“I definitely prefer her over Arisu Yuzuki.”</p>

<p>The classmates whisper their praises.</p>
<p>The homeroom teacher, seemingly unconcerned, calmly continues to read the students’ names in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>“Mamori Suzufumi-san”</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>

<p>Our eyes meet. I thought I had gotten used to the faces of beautiful women recently, but I still feel nervous.</p>

<p>“…Yes, everyone is present. The first period is modern literature, so I’d like to get started, but first, there’s an announcement from the staff room.”</p>

<p>Announcement.</p>
<p>That’s not a word you often hear during the morning HR (homeroom).</p>

<p>“There is a student among this year’s new freshmen who is engaged in talent activities. I’ll refrain from mentioning her name, but probably all of you already know who she is.”</p>

<p>She had attracted so much attention at the entrance ceremony.</p>
<p>Even those who are not familiar with idols would have heard about her through the grapevine.</p>

<p>“Our school does not prohibit students from having part-time jobs. Therefore, we intend to support her as much as possible in balancing her academic and entertainment activities.”</p>

<p>Orikita High School’s school philosophy is ‘respect for autonomy.’</p>
<p>It seems they have a policy of allowing idol activities as well.</p>

<p>“The same goes for friendships. I hope you make many friends at Orikita and nurture bonds that will continue into adulthood… However——”</p>

<p>I physically felt the atmosphere in the classroom change completely.</p>

<p>“——As for romantic relationships, please act with utmost caution. Of course, the school does not prohibit relationships between specific students. But in her case, if images or videos of her alone with a member of the opposite sex circulate online, it could spread strange rumors and negatively affect her work. Do not approach her class out of mere curiosity.”</p>

<p>My eyes meet with Mikami-sensei’s again.</p>
<p>On the surface, she appears calm, but I could feel a sense of intimidation.</p>
<p>The gaze of the entire class was piercingly focused on me.</p>

<p>“Moreover, it is absolutely unacceptable to harbor one-sided affections and then take someone to a secluded place. Remember, your primary duty as a student is to study. That is all.”</p>

<p>I feel like I’m being treated like a criminal.</p>
<p>It’s true that it was a lie that I started, but it’s still depressing.</p>
<p>The fact that these words came from Mikami-sensei, who is usually gentle and approachable, weighed even more heavily on me.</p>

<p>That day, perhaps because I looked so down, friends who had been scattered by the class shuffle treated me to juice every time we passed each other in the hallway.</p>
<p>——My stomach hurts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>It’s after school.</p>
<p>Although we had morning classes all week, I ended up coming home late because I took on various chores from different teachers.</p>

<p>It’s too late for lunch and too early for dinner.</p>
<p>Maybe I should buy a snack at the convenience store on my way home.</p>
<p>The single chestnut bun I received as a little reward wouldn’t be enough to satisfy my hunger.</p>

<p>Having left the staff room on the first floor, I decided to first go back to class 2-A to pick up my bag.</p>
<p>I start by walking straight to the end of the corridor on the first-year floor. That’s because the shortest route to class 2-A above is to use the stairs at the very end of the class 1-A.</p>
<p>I walked past classes D, C, and stopped in front of class 1-B—Yuzuki’s class.</p>

<p>Wait, this could be bad.</p>
<p>If someone spots me here, I’ll definitely be suspected of being a stalker.</p>
<p>I need to move away quickly and follow the morning’s announcement.</p>
<p>Just as I passed the classroom door at the front, that moment——</p>

<p>“…Hm?”</p>

<p>I heard someone’s voice from the inside.</p>
<p>Both doors were closed, so I couldn’t see who it was.</p>
<p>Club activities hadn’t even started their recruitment period yet, so it wasn’t closed off for changing clothes.</p>
<p>Freshmen classes are starting either tomorrow or the day after, making it unlikely for someone to be doing preparatory studying.</p>

<p>Could it be a thief?</p>
<p>But it seemed unlikely that wallets or valuables would be left in a classroom after students had gone.</p>
<p>I slid my left hand into my pocket to feel for my smartphone, then cautiously placed my right hand on the sliding door’s recess.</p>
<p>Trying not to alarm whoever was inside, I gently slid the door open——</p>

<p>“Ah, Yuzuki-chan… like… I really like…”</p>

<p>In my line of sight was someone in Sasaki Yuzuki’s seat.</p>
<p>That woman was rubbing her cheek against the chair with an enraptured expression.</p>
<p>Her grey jacket was squashed against the corner of the chair, wrinkling it.</p>

<p>“Ahh… I want to tear off this seat where Yuzuki-chan’s butt has been and use it as a face pack after my bath…”</p>

<p>She was nuzzling the chair like a dog seeking affection from its owner.</p>

<p>“If a student saw me like this, my life would be over… For my jail care package, I’d want Yuzuki-chan’s photo book… and for a bookmark, I’d need her hair… hehe…”</p>

<p>I was speechless.</p>
<p>More than being unable to speak, but I didn’t know how to react, and I couldn’t move.</p>

<p>“It’s about time for the staff meeting to start, so I have to go… Ah”</p>

<p>The woman looks up.</p>
<p>——Then our eyes met as I peered into the room through the gap in the door.</p>

<img10

<p>“…M-Mikami-sensei…”</p>
<p>“Mamori-kun…”</p>

<p>The world freezes.</p>
<p>The homeroom teacher of Class 2-A, Mikami Momose, pressed her cheek against the chair again and asked,</p>

<p>“Did you come to enjoy Yuzuki-chan’s seat too?”</p>
<p>“Like hell I did!”</p>

<p>I hadn’t raised my voice this much at school since the cheering competition at the sports festival.</p>

<p>“That, Sensei, seriously, w-what are you doing?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t stop sweating.</p>
<p>It seems that when humans instinctively feel fear, their way of speaking becomes clumsy.</p>

<p>“Just so you know, I haven’t licked it or anything.”</p>
<p>“If it had been the case, I would have forcibly removed you from the chair without question.”</p>

<p>Finally getting up, Mikami-sensei stood imposingly right in front of me.</p>

<p>“I believe I mentioned this during the morning homeroom? You’re not supposed to go anywhere near Yuzuki-chan’s classroom.”</p>

<p>Incredible…</p>
<p>She’s putting herself on a pedestal and starting a lecture in this situation.</p>

<p>“It’s not like I was specifically aiming for Class B. I just heard voices coming from inside the classroom and I peeked in, I never imagined it would be such a situation…”</p>
<p>“I’ve always been like this, getting so absorbed in things that I start talking to myself. I need to fix that.”</p>

<p>That’s not the main issue you should be reflecting on.</p>

<p>“Um, just to confirm, are you a fan of Arisu Yuzuki, sensei?”</p>
<p>“A fan, huh…”</p>

<p>She scoffs with a ‘Hmph’, and places her hand on her chest.</p>

<p>“Make no mistake, I am member number 000005 of the 【Spotlights】 fan club.”</p>

<p>What she pulls out from her card case with two fingers is a shimmering membership card.</p>

<p>“Monthly food expenses are within 5,000 yen. Drinks for home are wholesale. Clothes are from thrift stores or online auctions. Not giving New Year’s money to relatives’ kids and skimping on wedding gifts——and devoted all the money I could spend to Yuzuki-chan! It’s been several years of living like this. The reason I continue to be a civil servant is simply because the salary is stable.”</p>

<p>At the morning HR meeting, I understood why the looks directed at me were particularly stern.</p>
<p>This person wasn’t hoping for Yuzuki’s healthy school life.</p>
<p>She was simply jealous of me.</p>

<p>“I’ve participated in various events up until now. Local live concerts, new song release streams, fan meetings, live radio broadcasts… But you know, I’ve never once participated in a handshake event. Do you know why?”</p>
<p>“…w-why?”</p>
<p>“It’s obviously because Yuzuki-chan is just too cute!”</p>

<p>—Scary.</p>
<p>The always kind and gentle Mikami-sensei was furiously passionate.</p>
<p>I want to show this scene to the boys in class who were always infatuated with her.</p>

<p>“Yes, let’s admit it. It’s true that I am the idol of Orikita High School. Good looks, great style, and a pleasant personality. Every year, I get confessions from numerous students, and it’s only a matter of time before the local paper runs a feature on ‘The Too-Cute Teacher.’ “</p>

<p>Her narcissism is the real problem here.</p>

<p>“But you know what? I’m just an ordinary citizen. Part of the masses. In front of the real deal, I’m just a generic idol. If someone like me, a fake, were to touch those white, slender, smooth hands, Yuzuki-chan would be tainted. You see, I’m the type who wants to keep a certain distance from my idol. During a handshake, you exchange a word or two, right? The moment I hear Yuzuki-chan’s voice up close, I’m sure I would cut off my own ears with a cutter and preserve them in formalin——”</p>

<p>I remembered the origin of the word ‘fan’ that I once heard from Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“——And to think that she would enroll in our school… It’s a stroke of luck—no, an ordeal for me. As the chosen one, it’s my duty to guide Yuzuki-chan into becoming a respectable adult. But if I suddenly interacted with her in private, wouldn’t I just melt? That’s why I start by touching this chair. I’m gradually getting my body accustomed to it.”</p>

<p>Humans who lose their common sense are no different from monsters.</p>
<p>It seems that the true evil often takes human form, as most final bosses are humanoid in anime where one fights grotesque monsters.</p>

<p>“Anyway, do you understand?”</p>

<p>Nothing was really resolved, but she continued.</p>

<p>“This is merely an extension of my work. A way to interact with students on an equal footing. You didn’t see anything, and you didn’t hear anything. Is that clear?”</p>

<p>I wondered how she could be so condescending.</p>
<p>Well, once club activities and committee meetings start in earnest, someone will likely come and go from the classroom after school, so she probably won’t repeat this behavior too often.</p>

<p>“…If you promise never to do it again.”</p>
<p>“I can’t guarantee that.”</p>

<p>That was the most serious expression I’d seen from her all day.</p>
<p>This is where you should obediently comply, you know.</p>

<p>“You know that in this country, we believe in Tsukumogami, right? Gods and spirits dwell in tools that have been used and cherished for a long time. Maybe Yuzuki-chan’s spirit might reside in this chair, which she has been sitting on continuously. Ah, such a spirit would surely be adorable… And by the way, I’m the one who wants to complain here. Can you please not disturb an adult who’s seriously engaged in her work?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>She crossed her arms and struck a pose. This person is unhinged.</p>
<p>No one would believe it if I revealed that the usually gentle and cute Mikami-sensei is actually a creepy idol otaku.</p>
<p>It’s easy to say anything with words. Right, unless there’s evidence.</p>
<p>I took out my smartphone from my pocket and pressed the play button.</p>

<p>『Ahh… I want to tear off this seat where Yuzuki-chan’s butt has been and use it as a face pack after my bath…』</p>
<p>『…The moment I hear Yuzuki-chan’s voice up close, I’m sure I would cut off my own ears with a cutter and preserve them in formalin——』</p>

<p>Hearing it again sends shivers down my spine.</p>

<p>“…Wha, when did you!?”</p>

<p>It was here that Mikami-sensei finally distorted her face.</p>

<p>“I’ve been recording since before I opened the door because I thought a suspicious person might have sneaked in.”</p>

<p>The true identity was, shockingly, our homeroom teacher.</p>
<p>But having witnessed it by chance, I couldn’t ignore the potential stalker.</p>

<p>“I have no intention of spreading this around. But if you claim to be the chosen one, how about you stop the indirect s*xual harassment that’s similar to a grade-schooler licking the recorder of the girl he likes?”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying it’s all good if I get permission?”</p>
<p>“Shut up!” (Sharaappu!)</p>

<p>With my shout, Mikami-sensei let out a sigh and slumped her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Fine. I’ll concede to your demands for today. But don’t let your guard down. There are many other fans of Yuzuki-chan in this school besides me. If you dare to mess with her, an army of ten millions will beat you with their mint-condition unopened tapestries.”</p>

<p>I don’t think there were more than 800 students at Orikita——where did the tens of millions come from?</p>
<p>Anyway, the bare minimum of safety at Yuzuki’s school has been secured.</p>
<p>Let’s keep it a secret from her.</p>

<p>“…Ah, I have to go. The staff meeting is about to start,”</p>
<p>“What are you even doing before the staff meeting, seriously…”</p>
<p>“Be very careful on your way home at night. And make sure to lock your house properly.”</p>

<p>With these unsettling words that one would not expect to hear from a teacher, Mikami-sensei left the classroom.</p>

<p>“…I should head home too.”</p>

<p>I’m tired. Maybe I’ll make my favorite food for dinner to change my mood.</p>
<p>At that moment, I had no idea that I would be even more exhausted tonight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>It’s 9:30 PM.</p>
<p>The sun has completely set, and the entire apartment building is enveloped in silence.</p>

<p>I’ve been preparing dinner for my neighbor for the past few days.</p>
<p>At first, it was just about making the meal, but gradually, we started sharing the mealtime itself.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve been eagerly waiting for hours for my neighbor to come home so we can have dinner together.</p>
<p>It seems my life has completely started to revolve around her.</p>

<p>——I couldn’t wait to see Yuzuki.</p>
<p>Just as I thought something like that, the doorbell rang.</p>
<p>For her to come directly to my place—she’s become quite straightforward.</p>

<p>Of course, that couldn’t be the case.</p>
<p>But at that moment, my spirits were lifted by the anticipation of the person I was waiting for, and combined with my hunger, my actions became impulsive.</p>

<p>Without checking the monitor, I unlocked the front door and opened it.</p>
<p>Through the gap in the door, I could see something silver glinting.</p>
<p>At that moment, Mikami-sensei’s words flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>──Be very careful on your way home at night. And make sure to lock your house properly.</p>

<p>Ah, this is bad.</p>
<p>I was leaning forward, and now it’s too late to pull back the door handle.</p>
<p>Even if I wanted to call for help, the idol in room 810 isn’t home, and the couple in room 808 said this morning in the elevator that they were leaving for a two-night, three-day trip to a hot spring in Izu today.</p>
<p>I’m stuck.</p>

<p>At the very least, I must burn the perpetrator’s characteristics into my memory.</p>
<p>If I survive and can testify, that would be the best outcome, but even if I end up decaying here alone, I’ll leave a dying message in blood.</p>

<p>The hair is a bright brown, semi-long. In both ears, she had emerald-colored earrings.</p>
<p>She’s wearing a high school uniform. A blouse on top, with a bright red tie on her chest, and a simple black skirt on the bottom.</p>
<p>The skirt is shortened to the limit, and her thighs are exposed between it and the black knee-high socks.</p>
<p>On her shoulder is a Boston-type school bag. Dangling from the zipper is a silver accessory shaped like an ‘R’.</p>
<p>Was this the object that was flickering through the gap in the door?</p>
<p>By the way, isn’t this accessory the same one I gave to a friend when I was in elementary school?</p>

<p>“Yo, Suzu. I came to visit you!”</p>

<p>The person who appeared with a cheerful smile that seemed to clear the darkness of the night was someone I knew very well.</p>


<p>“…Rika, don’t scare me like that.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t you a bit low on energy? Your dear childhood friend came all the way to celebrate your move~”</p>

<p>Kishibe Rika. A senior at Orikita High School and my former neighbor.</p>
<p>The Mamori family lived in a different apartment building before moving into the ‘Orikita Residence.’</p>
<p>Next to that building was a single-family home where the Kishibe family, also a family of three, lived.</p>
<p>Being close in age, Rika and I have had family ties since we were young.</p>
<p>Eyes that looked strong-willed, a beauty mark under her right eye, false eyelashes that curled back like ski jumps, a beautifully shaped nose, and pink lips.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I hadn’t seen her face since the move, I even felt a sense of nostalgia for her features, which oozed with a strong personality.</p>

<p>“Are you impressed? Your favorite Rika Onee-san came by for a surprise visit.”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised. I mean, how did you get past the entrance?”</p>
<p>“Huh? I just asked your mom for the code. After my shift, I was like, ‘I wanna go to Suzu’s place!’ and shouted it in the back room, so she told me.”</p>

<p>That’s my mother’s low sense of security for you.</p>
<p>Rika works as a hall staff part-timer at our family’s izakaya, ‘Aien Kien (合園奇宴)’.</p>
<p>It seems she’s been on the schedule almost daily recently due to the busy season of new beginnings.</p>
<p>Rika proudly held up a paper bag from the department store basement.</p>

<p>“This is the pudding Suzu has been wanting to try for a while. It’s late, but consider it a housewarming gift.”</p>
<p>“Wow, seriously? Thank you.”</p>

<p>Rika has always remembered even the smallest things I’ve said or done.</p>
<p>She’s really good at being considerate.</p>

<p>“And this here is the limited-edition seasoning that Suzu wanted. These are cookies I received as a gift, and over here is a shirt, socks, and underwear that I thought would suit Suzu…”</p>
<p>“No-no, that’s way too much!”</p>

<p>Her thoughtfulness is excessive, to the point where it feels less like she’s an old friend and more like a mother who’s come from the countryside to check on her son.</p>

<p>“…Well, anyway, come on in.”</p>
<p>“Yay! I’m coming in!”</p>

<p>Taking off her loafers, Rika walked down the hallway with a light step, and I followed her with mixed feelings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>“From now on, Rika Onee-san here is going to spoil Suzu!”</p>

<img11

<p>Just as I expected—In the center of the living room, Rika declared this with her chest puffed out.</p>

<p>“You must be tired from the move and the new school term, right Suzu? Today, you can be as spoiled as you want.”</p>

<p>Rika rolled up the sleeves of her blouse and snorted.</p>

<p>“No, I appreciate it, but I’ll just take the sentiment.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be shy. Come on, tell your Rika Onee-san what you want her to do?”</p>

<p>I wonder if she’d get mad if I honestly said I wanted her to do nothing.</p>
<p>Rika began taking out items one after another from the plastic bag that was about to burst, which she brought separately from the housewarming gift.</p>
<p>An apron, rubber gloves, a mask… it was the so-called initial equipment for a housekeeper.</p>
<p>It seemed she had bought them at a discount shop after her part-time job.</p>

<p>Rika always wants to take care of me in one way or another. While that in itself is nice, there is one problem.</p>
<p>Frankly, Rika is not good at household chores.</p>
<p>When she cooks, flames erupt; when she sews, her fingers get covered in blood; when she tries to organize, somehow the room ends up more cluttered than before.</p>
<p>Her motivation and skills are not in sync.</p>

<p>However, when it comes to serving customers at the ‘Aien Kien’, her reputation seems to be very good.</p>
<p>Rika herself seems to work more with a sense of communicating with the customers rather than just working.</p>
<p>“First, I’ll help with unpacking.”</p>
<p>“I’ve already finished that.”</p>
<p>“What about grocery shopping?”</p>
<p>“I did that on my way back from school.”</p>
<p>“…Then laundry?”</p>
<p>“I’ve even done the ironing.”</p>
<p>“Geez! You’re leaving me with nothing to do! Are you too competent or what?”</p>

<p>Rika was skilled at praising while being angry—that was one thing she was deft at.</p>

<p>“Rika, you’re a guest, so it’s totally fine if you just relax on the sofa. The gifts you brought are more than enough.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>This was genuinely how I felt. The Mamori family is not so black-hearted as to make my childhood friend work for us after she finishes her part-time job.</p>

<p>“Right. So for now, go wash your hands and gargle.”</p>
<p>“Okay~”</p>

<p>Rika dashed off toward the washroom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I proceeded with the preparations for Yuzuki’s dinner.</p>

<p>However, five minutes passed, then ten, and Rika still hadn’t returned.</p>
<p>She didn’t seem to be in a hurry, and I didn’t think she was the type to secretly snoop around my room…</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bizarre scream from Rika came from down the hallway.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>

<p>I stopped cooking and moved towards the washroom to find out.</p>

<p>“Uh…”</p>

<p>Rika was sitting in the flooded bathroom with a bucket overturned.</p>
<p>Foam was splattered everywhere— including the bathroom door and ceiling.</p>
<p>That detergent dripped steadily into the drain, the one from the plastic bag earlier.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even meant for the bathroom, right?</p>

<p>“Rika-san, please explain yourself.”</p>

<p>As I looked down at her with a cold gaze, Rika awkwardly shifted her eyes around.</p>

<p>“No——I was just washing my hands, and then I saw the dirt on the bucket in the bathroom, and… Once I started, I got more and more into it…”</p>
<p>“And then you slipped on the wet floor and foam after getting carried away.”</p>
<p>“…Yes”</p>
<p>“I’ll get you some clothes to change into.”</p>
<p>“…Yes”</p>

<p>It was the moment when the list of household chores Rika should not be allowed to do was updated.</p>

<p>Several minutes later, Rika, who had taken a shower, returned to the living room.</p>
<p>She was wearing a T-shirt and slacks I had pulled out from my closet.</p>
<p>I thought the shirt might be too big, but I guess Rika has grown, so it turned out to be just the right size.</p>

<p>“I chilled the pudding I got for you in the fridge, so go ahead and eat it.”</p>
<p>“Okay~”</p>

<p>Rika leaned back on the sofa with a ‘plop’ and opened the lid of the pudding.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to eat, Suzu?”</p>
<p>“I’ll have mine after dinner.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you haven’t had dinner yet?”</p>
<p>“My meal times have been irregular lately.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t eaten yet either~ Then, as a thank you for lending me clothes and a shower, today I’ll…”</p>
<p>“Please let me do the cooking!”</p>

<p>It would be bad to cause a small fire incident right after moving in.</p>
<p>Besides, Yuzuki will be coming home soon.</p>
<p>t would be troublesome in various ways if Rika found out that my neighbor was the new student everyone was talking about.</p>
<p>I should just whip up something quick and politely ask her to head home for today.</p>

<p>“Then, how about some chicken soboro ochazuke that can be eaten right away…”</p>
<p>(TN: A dish of rice topped with minced chicken (chicken soboro), with tea or broth poured over it (ochazuke).)</p>

<p>While eating pudding, Rika glances over while squinting her eyes.</p>

<p>“…somehow, something seems fishy.”</p>
<p>“…yes?”</p>
<p>“Normally, you’d make a complicated dish even if it’s late at night. Do you really want me to leave that badly?”</p>
<p>“N-not really?”</p>

<p>Rika is sharp at the weirdest times sometimes.</p>
<p>It’s fine, I shouldn’t have given anything away.</p>

<p>“Suzu, you’re hiding something from me, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“N-no…”</p>
<p>“Your right cheek twitches when you do. How long do you think we’ve been childhood friends?”</p>

<p>I didn’t know that. I was shocked, and at the same time, I remembered that a surprise birthday present for Rika had never been successful before.</p>

<p>“Ahh, I feel so lonely. Ever since my childhood friend moved away, it feels like even our emotional connection has drifted apart~”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that, there are special circumstances…”</p>
<p>“I don’t think this was the case, but… is your girlfriend coming over now?”</p>

<p>The tone suddenly dropped.</p>
<p>Why did the conversation suddenly turn to matters of love?</p>


<p>“I heard a strange rumor at school. ‘It seems that Mamori Suzufumi from the second year confessed to Arisu Yuzuki'”</p>

<p>My heart skipped a beat. Had the information reached Rika as well?</p>

<p>“Of course, I wasn’t going to believe such a rumor. Suzu isn’t interested in idols, nor is he a fanboy. Suzu values his own beliefs.”</p>

<p>Rika’s eyes as she looked at me were serious.</p>

<p>“…So, what’s the deal?”</p>

<p>The real reason for her visit wasn’t to take care of me or to celebrate my move, but this, huh.</p>
<p>Now, how honest should I be?</p>

<p>“It’s true that I confessed to Yu… Arisu Yuzuki. But there were circumstances behind it.”</p>
<p>“What’s the situation?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t just reveal that Yuzuki is my neighbor.</p>
<p>Consequently, I can’t reveal that ‘I was caught by a third party while having a secret talk to hide our neighbor relationship.’ And even if I made up some convenient reason like love at first sight, there’s no guarantee she would believe me.</p>
<p>Above all, I didn’t want to lie to my childhood friend like that.</p>

<p>“I just encountered Arisu Yuzuki in the Resource Room ‘somehow’, and right after that, a third-year senpai came in. That person misunderstood, thinking Yuzuki and I were up to something suspicious. So, I pretended to confess to her on the spur of the moment. It seemed better than having weird rumors spread about us. After all, she’s an idol.”</p>

<p>I skirted around the truth without completely lying.</p>
<p>Even though it was to protect Yuzuki, I felt a little pain in my chest for deceiving my childhood friend.</p>

<p>“Hmm. If Suzu says so, I’ll believe it.”</p>

<p>Rika seemed not fully convinced, but she seemed to have put away her spear of anger for the time being.</p>

<p>“I’ll ask one more time, are Suzu really not dating Arisu Yuzuki?”</p>
<p>“We’re not dating. That’s the truth. I’m sorry if I make you worried, Rika.”</p>

<p>I put my hands together in front of my face and sincerely apologized to Rika.</p>

<p>“…Alright, I understand. If you have something else to do today, I’ll leave in a little while.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I’ll make it up to you next time.”</p>
<p>“By the way, whose young-looking boots are those at the entrance?”</p>
<p>“Uh, Yuzuki shouldn’t have been up in my place… ah.”</p>

<p>Enveloped in an aura of absolute zero, Rika swiftly gulped down her pudding in one go.</p>

<p>“I’m going home!”</p>

<p>Rika slung her school bag over her shoulder, slammed the empty pudding container onto the kitchen counter, and strode towards the entrance. Seriously, is she planning to go home dressed like that?</p>

<p>“Stupid Suzu! I hope the pudding gets stuck in your throat and makes you choke!”</p>

<p>Just as I was about to chase after her, I dropped the empty container on the floor, and a brown stain spread across the kitchen mat.</p>
<p>This is bad, I need to wipe it up properly and quickly, or the caramel sauce will seep in.</p>

<p>“…Ah, damn it!”</p>

<p>Right now, Rika is more important than the kitchen mat.</p>
<p>As I stepped out into the hallway, Rika was already reaching for the front door handle.</p>

<p>“Wait, Rika!”</p>

<p>Ignoring my plea to stop, Rika leaves the room.</p>
<p>I stepped out into the hallway in my socks and placed my hand on her shoulder.</p>

<p>“Let go! Suzu, You should just be happy getting along with a popular idol like Suzu. After all, you probably think of me as nothing more than a convenient-all-capable maid who’s good at housework!”</p>
<p>“That’s a misunderstanding!”</p>

<p>I never once thought of Rika as someone who’s good at housework!</p>

<p>“I said it before, but I’m not dating Yuzuki.”</p>
<p>“But you seem awfully close to her! If you’re such good friends, why don’t you just live in the same apartment building──”</p>
<p>“…What are you doing?”</p>

<p>It was a clear, dignified voice that cut through the noise.</p>
<p>Rika and I simultaneously turned to look toward room 810.</p>
<p>There was Yuzuki—in the midst of inserting her key into the door.</p>

<p>“…Hey Suzufumi. What’s this about a convenient maid? And who is that woman?”</p>

<p>I thought vaguely that if I looked up the phrase “a frog being stared down by a snake” in a dictionary, it would probably use this situation as an example.</p>

<p>“…Can you explain what you mean?”</p>

<p>I couldn’t tell whether the question just now had come from Yuzuki or Rika.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>“Hey, are you sure all I need to do is stir it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. This is an important task that only the patient Rika can handle.”</p>
<p>“Then I guess I’ll give it my best~”</p>

<p>At the low table on the left, Rika is concentrating on the bowl in front of her. It seems I’ve managed to cheer her up.</p>
<p>Taking the opportunity, I bowed my head to Yuzuki, who was sitting on the right.</p>
<p>Even if it was a series of coincidences, the fact that Yuzuki and I are neighbors became known to a student at the same school.</p>

<p>“…I’ve mostly understood the situation. It’s originally my fault for calling Suzufumi to the Resource Room, so there’s no need for you to apologize, Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>Earlier, I had explained the bare minimum to Rika.</p>
<p>About my new place, which is coincidentally next to Yuzuki’s, how, after moving in, Yuzuki nearly fainted from hunger, and how I occasionally prepared meals for her.</p>
<p>I had already explained that I made a fake confession to dispel the rumors of an inappropriate relationship at school, but I emphasized again that it was indeed a lie.</p>

<p>“Sorry about this. Even bringing Rika to your house…”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. It would have been awkward to just leave things as they were. Besides…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki is casting a dubious glance at Rika, who is eagerly mixing the contents of the bowl.</p>
<p>Even though I had already introduced her—to Yuzuki, Rika was just a gal she was meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>Perhaps Yuzuki is trying to determine with her own eyes whether Rika is a trustworthy person who won’t leak any secrets.</p>

<p>“…Hey, Suzu, are you listening?”</p>

<p>Rika pulls on my arm, trying to turn me towards her.</p>

<p>“Sorry, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“This batter is almost unseasoned, right? So I’m thinking of adding soy sauce, mirin, sauce, and as a secret ingredient, some maple syrup. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“…Thanks for asking, but it’s okay as it is.”</p>

<p>You see, today’s menu is okonomiyaki!</p>
<p>Rika grins mischievously, perhaps sensing the anxiety seeping out of me.</p>

<p>“If you’re that worried, just watch me. I’m actually a little bad at cooking.”</p>

<p>Just a little, huh?</p>
<p>Well, awareness is the first step to improvement.</p>
<p>I savored the certain growth of my childhood friend as I wiped the batter that had splattered across the table with a tissue.</p>

<p>“Got it. I’ll give you thorough guidance so that even Rika can make it on her own—”</p>

<p>Suddenly, I felt a tug at the hem of my shirt from behind.</p>
<p>Turning around, I saw Yuzuki with her hand on the hem of my shirt.</p>

<p>“…I’m not very good at cooking either…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki had an expression I had never seen before. Perhaps she was unsure how much of her true self to reveal in front of Rika.</p>

<p>“Arisu Yuzuki-saaan. I’m in the middle of talking with Suzu right now~”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. After all, this is my house.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to say that, Suzu is mine!”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not true.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but reflexively interject.</p>
<p>This won’t do; if I take them seriously, we’ll never get anywhere.</p>
<p>I have to play the role of mediator, or else we’ll never finish making the okonomiyaki.</p>

<p>I spread the okonomiyaki batter Rika had stirred onto the greased griddle, shaping it into a circle with a spatula and making a slight indentation in the center.</p>
<p>This helps it cook evenly, as the center is usually the last to cook through.</p>

<p>“But still, to think that the ‘rumored idol’ is actually Suzu’s neighbor…”</p>

<p>After wetting her throat with oolong tea, Rika stares directly at Yuzuki sitting across from her.</p>

<p>“I owe a lot to Suzufumi. In ‘various ways’.”</p>

<p>Perhaps inspired by Rika, Yuzuki replied with an ‘implied’ tone.</p>
<p>Across the table, the two girls were intensely locking eyes. Yuzuki on the right, Rika on the left.</p>
<p>I was caught in between, diligently cooking like a background character.</p>

<p>Just when I thought the staring standoff would continue, Rika casually moved behind me.</p>
<p>It seems she has quickly yielded to Yuzuki’s intense gaze.</p>
<p>Like a tiger cub born in a zoo intimidating a large imported animal, she peeked over my shoulder and hissed at Yuzuki as if to threaten her.</p>
<p>Yuzuki, on the other hand, appears to wear a gentle smile at first glance. But it feels more like a forced smile—a tactic to exert pressure rather than her natural idol persona.</p>

<p>“…Just to be clear, it’s not like I asked Suzufumi to ‘Make me dinner’. It’s a little uncomfortable when you’re so openly hostile.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki doesn’t show any signs of being intimidated.</p>
<p>On the contrary, there’s even a sense of composure.</p>
<p>It seems that I’ve become quite adept at sensing Yuzuki’s true feelings through our daily meals together.</p>

<p>“…If you don’t like Suzu’s cooking, you could just refuse it.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been trying to refuse… But I ended up eating it anyway, so it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>“So you like Suzu’s cooking? Or could it be… you actually like Suzu?”</p>
<p>“Wha…!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki pouted, leaning her upper body back slightly.</p>

<p>“A-aren’t you the one who’s been too close to Suzufumi the whole time!?”</p>
<p>“I’m Suzu’s Onee-san, so it’s fine!”</p>

<p>Rika leaned on my back, putting her weight on me like a child being piggybacked.</p>

<p>“If anything, you’re definitely more like a little sister…”</p>

<p>Whether it’s because Rika’s personality is easy to read or because Yuzuki has exceptional interpersonal skills, she managed to see through her true nature within just a few minutes of meeting her.</p>


<p>Whether it’s because Rika’s personality is easy to read or because Yuzuki has exceptional interpersonal skills, she managed to see through her true nature within just a few minutes of meeting her.</p>
<p>Perhaps due to Rika’s struggle with social interactions in her younger years, she still has a unique way of communicating with her peers.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about her too much, Yuzuki.”</p>

<p>Seemingly worn out by Rika’s unpredictable pace, Yuzuki mutters something under her breath with downcast eyes.</p>

<p>“…What’s with that, acting all clingy as if it’s the most natural thing in the world…”</p>
<p>“Yuzuki? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Huh, ah! Nothing, I’m fine!”</p>

<p>Now, in an attempt to hide her agitation, she fanned her face with her hand.</p>
<p>Something about Yuzuki is a little off today.</p>

<p>Oops, it looks like the batter is about ready to be flipped.</p>
<p>With spatulas in both hands, I flip the batter swiftly.</p>
<p>Then a perfect golden brown okonomiyaki appears.</p>
<p>The unique aroma of the flour-based dish fills the room, finally relaxing the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Now’s a good time to check the finishing ingredients.</p>
<p>Bonito flakes, seaweed, and sauces are already on the table.</p>
<p>Oh, that’s right, there should still be some pickled red ginger left over from when we made yakisoba.</p>

<p>“I’m going to grab some pickled red ginger.”</p>
<p>“What, didn’t you leave the pickled red ginger in my fridge?”</p>

<p>Rika’s shoulder twitched.</p>
<p>As she said, there was a small container of pickled red ginger neatly placed in the corner when I opened the Sasaki family’s refrigerator,</p>

<p>“Found it, you remembered well.”</p>
<p>“Well, I do get meals made for me every day.”</p>

<p>Twitch- twitch- Rika’s shoulders shook again.</p>

<p>“…Suzu, I’ll prepare the usual special mustard-mayo in the meantime.”</p>
<p>“Ah, thank you… Just to check, you sure you can handle it?”</p>
<p>“Even I can prepare something like this. We’ve eaten it dozens of times at my place.”</p>

<p>Now Yuzuki’s shoulders twitched.</p>
<p>Both of them seemed as if they were being zapped with a faint electric current. And for some reason, the atmosphere that had begun to relax was once again becoming tense.</p>

<p>“A-alright! It’s almost ready!”</p>

<p>My instincts were sending danger signals, warning me not to delve any deeper.</p>
<p>I hurried to finish up.</p>

<p>I pushed the okonomiyaki to the edge of the hot plate and slathered it with special sauce.</p>
<p>For the mustard mayonnaise, I use a piping bag to create wavy patterns.</p>
<p>After giving it some ‘skincare’, I add a touch of seaweed and bonito flakes for a ‘cheeky effect’. I cut it into six equal parts with a spatula and placed them on small plates for Rika and Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Here, both of you, enjoy your meal.”</p>
<p>“Itadakimasu!”</p>

<p>Having returned to the table, Rika immediately starts breaking apart the okonomiyaki with her chopsticks.</p>

<p>“Wow, the batter is so fluffy!”</p>
<p>“That’s because I added yam.”</p>

<p>Next, she chops up the okonomiyaki with her chopsticks and shovels a big bite into her mouth.</p>

<p>“The inside is so creamy! The seafood is crunchy! The mayo sauce is delicious!”</p>

<p>While Rika eagerly devours her food, Yuzuki hasn’t started eating yet.</p>
<p>Normally, this would be the time for a playful back-and-forth argument, but with Rika here, I wasn’t sure how to approach the situation.</p>

<p>“Suzufumi’s meal is…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>There Yuzuki is, gripping the chopsticks with her own will.</p>

<p>“…Suzufumi’s meal is not just for Kishibe-san!”</p>

<p>With eyes full of determination as if she were about to bungee jump, she brought a piece of okonomiyaki to her mouth.</p>
<p>The moment she took a bite, Yuzuki’s expression cleared up like a blue sky that had blown away the clouds.</p>

<p>“Wow, it’s really fluffy…”</p>

<p>This time, she took a proper bite.</p>

<p>“The earthy scent of cabbage and yam, the oceanic aroma of shrimp and octopus—they all blend together, leaving a rich aftertaste. The special sauce and spicy mayo also have a perfect balance of spiciness and sweetness…”</p>
<p>“That’s right! This is the blend Suzu spent years perfecting, and it’s even adopted at Papa and Mama’s restaurant!”</p>

<p>The two who had been at odds until just a moment ago were now smiling and enjoying the same dish.</p>
<p>This is the charm of okonomiyaki.</p>
<p>Just like the seafood and mountain vegetables, seemingly opposite ingredients come together in one batter—everyone is equal in front of okonomiyaki.</p>
<p>The universal language of food transcends people’s positions and relationships with ease!</p>
<p>Simply put, delicious food brings smiles to people’s faces. That’s why there is no more fighting or petty bickering here.</p>
<p>This is truly world peace.</p>
<p>Okonomiyaki is the symbol of peace that our country is proud of!</p>

<p>As I began cooking the second batch, I felt a strong gaze from my left.</p>
<p>Rika was staring at me intently while holding chopsticks in hand.</p>

<p>“Don’t just keep cooking, Suzu. Let’s eat together.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me. I’ll make my own after you two have had your fill.”</p>

<p>However, Rika put down her own chopsticks and grabbed mine instead.</p>
<p>Then she lifted a piece of okonomiyaki from the hotplate.</p>
<p>This is…</p>

<p>“Ahhn♪”</p>

<p>It might have been a pleasant situation under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>But what was presented before me was the entire slice, and moreover, it was piping hot after having just been cooked.</p>

<p>“No, Rika, that’s too big—”</p>
<p>“Ahhn♪”</p>

<p>Rika seemed to be acting out of pure kindness, so I steeled myself and opened my mouth.</p>

<p>“A-ahhn… it’s hot!”</p>

<p>The temperature inside my mouth skyrocketed as if coal had been thrown into a furnace.</p>
<p>I desperately rolled the okonomiyaki around with my tongue to cool it down, and without missing a beat, I also chased it with some oolong tea to cool off my mouth.</p>

<p>“Suzufumi, over here, over here.”</p>

<p>Looking to the opposite side of Rika, I saw Yuzuki with her mouth open.</p>
<p>She wasn’t holding chopsticks in her hand.</p>

<p>“Ahhn.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“I mean, Suzufumi, you want to make me eat a lot, right?”</p>
<p>“That is, well…”</p>

<img12

<p>Yuzuki’s defenseless mouth was right in front of me.</p>
<p>Even though she was in the midst of eating okonomiyaki, her mouth showed no signs of okonomiyaki, seaweed, or bonito flakes.</p>

<p>“Suzufumi got to be fed by Kishibe-san, so now Suzufumi has to feed me too. Come on-come on, it’s your chance to win me over with food, you know?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki was unusually proactive about food today.</p>
<p>It’s certainly the perfect opportunity to take the offensive.</p>
<p>Yet, seeing Yuzuki closing her eyes and obediently opening her mouth in front of me made me feel like I was doing something wrong.</p>

<p>“Come on, ‘ahhhn’ “</p>
<p>“A-ahh…”</p>

<p>With trembling hands, I tried to bring the okonomiyaki to Yuzuki’s mouth——</p>

<p>“Here you go!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, Rika’s hand popped out from the side.</p>

<p>“Mmffpphh!”</p>
<p>“Instead of Suzufumi, I’ll feed you as much as you want~. Bring it on~”</p>
<p>“Grrmph, mmph!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s mouth resembles a hamster hoarding food as okonomiyaki was stuffed into her mouth one after another.</p>

<p>“Mmph… puhah! Hey, what are you doing!?”</p>
<p>“You wanted to be fed, right? Lucky you~”</p>

<p>Today, for who knows how many times, their gazes clashed again.</p>
<p>Sparks wildly bloom right in front of me. Neither of them shows any sign of backing down.</p>

<p>Yuzuki and Rika acted at the same moment.</p>
<p>Yuzuki’s hand reached out from the right, Rika’s from the left.</p>

<p>” “Here, ‘ahhhn’ !! ” “</p>

<p>Two okonomiyaki, nearly falling off the chopsticks, was in front of my eyes.</p>

<p>” “Hey, which one will you choose!?” “</p>

<p>I placed the spatula on the hot plate and sighed with a gloomy heart.</p>
<p>These two—I thought they were complete opposites, but aren’t they in perfect sync?</p>
