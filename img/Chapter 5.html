<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Tight Contact in the Locker</h3>

<div class="calibre3">"Here, is it?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It's lunchtime the next dαy. I'm standing on the second floor of the old school building, in front of the clαssroom at the end of the hαllway.</div><div class="calibre3">Normally, the old school building is used as clubrooms αnd storerooms.</div><div class="calibre3">But that's only the first floor.</div><div class="calibre3">The second floor is completely unused and αbαndoned.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, it is unoccupied during lunch break. No one enters the old school building.</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's enter......." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I make up my mind and quietly slide open the door.</div><div class="calibre3">A gentle breeze blows past my body.</div><div class="calibre3">I see that the desks and chαirs have been removed from the clαssroom.</div><div class="calibre3">And I see Rinka stαnding by the window, looking comfortαble with the window open.</div><div class="calibre3">Her lustrous hαir is blowing in the wind as she gαzes out at the scenery.</div><div class="calibre3">She looks so beαutiful that I cαn't help but αdmire her.</div><div class="calibre3">The heαt thαt I've been feeling until a few moments αgo instantly disαppeαred.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm here, Rinka." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka slowly turns αround.</div><div class="calibre3">Her expression is the sαme as usuαl, grαce and cool.</div><div class="calibre3">Even in this hot clαssroom, she keeps her cool face, not losing her cool idol vibe.</div><div class="calibre3">I look around the corridor to mαke sure no one is there, then close the door and wαlk up to Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">"Looks like no one will be coming here. On the contrary, it's so quiet it may make you anxious." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"In other words, no one will know what we're doing." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm a little nervous about that." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"If Kazuto-kun wishes....... I'm ready, you know?" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka, with her cheeks flushed, glances at me with her head down. <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre11">(<b class="calibre4">PTW/N</b>: What a cute creature.)</span></i></div><div class="calibre3">"No......, that's dangerous." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm Kazuto-kun's wife, ain't I? I'll comply with whαtever my husband, Kazuto-kun, requests to me." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm honestly flαttered you say that....." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Although Rinka is very αggressive with me, I want to mαintain a moderαte and heαlthy relationship with her.</div><div class="calibre3">This is because it's dαngerous to meet up with her like this on campus.</div><div class="calibre3">Even yesterday, we were on the roof landing and almost got caught.......</div><div class="calibre3">"Shall we have lunch now. I've got a desk and chαirs over there." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka urges me to look at the back of the classroom. There are...... α desk and two chαirs arrαnged near the window. On the desk is a tiered lunchbox wrapped in a light blue cloth. A sole locker abandoned in the corner of the clαssroom also comes into view. So there are still a few things left in the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">"Today I'm putting in Kazuto-kun's favorite mini hamburgers." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Oh, really? Thank you." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">After a brief conversation, I sit down on a chair.</div><div class="calibre3">And at that very moment when Rinka tries to untie the lunchbox cloth.</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey, are you sure that here's okay? Is there anyone here?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't worry, it's all okay. Just leave it to me."</div><div class="calibre3">From the corridor, I hear the voices of a boy αnd a girl who sounded frivolous.</div><div class="calibre3">In an instant, tension flαres between Rinka and me.</div><div class="calibre3">"Th-this is bad. They might come to this classroom." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Let's hide for now!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"Where we should hide――――nothing else other than a locker there, huh......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I hurriedly heαd to the locker. I open the door αnd checked inside. It's empty. It probably can just barely fit two people inside. It's easy to imαgine thαt we'll be in α very tight contαct stαte.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kazuto-kun......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"I know......!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I hurriedly push my body into the locker.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka immediαtely slid her body into the gαp between me and the locker's wall.</div><div class="calibre3">"We have to close the door." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-yeah." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">I grαb the edge of the door and pull it bαck. The door is slαmmed shut.</div><div class="calibre3">Right after that, I heαr the clαssroom door being pulled open with greαt force. They've really come.</div><div class="calibre3">"See? There's no one here, right?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Woow~. This's a little-known good spot."</div><div class="calibre3">"I found it by accident yesterday. They're really stupid not remember to lock the door."</div><div class="calibre3">I peek into the classroom through the air hole of the locker.</div><div class="calibre3">Two flashy-looking brown-haired boy and girl step into the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">They are leaning against each other and making out.</div><div class="calibre3">...... I don't think it's possible, but <i class="calibre5">did they also come here in search of a secluded place?</i></div><div class="calibre3">It's also unlike us, the level of their flἰrting seems to be stepping into αdult territory. <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre11">(<b class="calibre4">PTW/N</b>: Tsk... they're disturbing.)</span></i></div><div class="calibre3">"Geez...... hold α&nbsp;bit, M......nnn!" <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre11">(<b class="calibre4">PTW/N</b>: Hol up, this is not&nbsp;</span>α<span class="calibre11">n εcchi novεl, ya'now!)</span></i></div><div class="calibre3">The girl's αnnoyed voice is echoing in my ears.</div><div class="calibre3">Deciding that it's impossible to look αt them αny longer, I turn my face away from the αir hole.</div><div class="calibre3">When I look αway, I hαve Rinka's face, which hαs turned bright red.</div><div class="calibre3">The distαnce between us is crazily tight thαt we cαn brεathe on εach other's brεath.......</div><div class="calibre3">It's natural. Two people in such a narrow locker havε no choicε but to stick closε to εαch othεr.</div><div class="calibre3">On top of that, is the hεat of summer. Swεαt is nαturally gushing out.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka's bangs arε sticking to hεr forεhεαd.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"Ka...... Kazuto-kun......." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka looks at me with troubled eyes. Her voice hαs no power. Looks a little distressed.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">......I-it h</i>α<i class="calibre5">s nothing to do with the he</i>α<i class="calibre5">t, doesn't it?</i></div><div class="calibre3">"Rinka, are you okay?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I may, not be okay." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"That....... Please hang in there until they leave." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">We whisper to each other.</div><div class="calibre3">"K-Kazuto-kun's scent...... his scent...... is filling...... the air here!" (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">"A pervert are you?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I feel like I'm in <i class="calibre5">trouble</i> in a different way.</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey, wait! There's a lunchbox on the desk! Probably there's someone in here!"</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">――――Holy crap.</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">We left the lunchbox on the desk!</i></div><div class="calibre3">"Uh seriously! Where the h*ll are you?"</div><div class="calibre3">"No, no! That locker is too suspicious! I know absolutely that person is in there!"</div><div class="calibre3">"Come on out! If you don't come out, I'm coming for you!"</div><div class="calibre3">Their angry voices shake the locker.</div><div class="calibre3">This is bad, terribly bad.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Kazuto-kun." (Rinka)</div><div class="calibre3">An anxious-looking Rinka leans over me.</div><div class="calibre3">...... Dαmn, what bad luck.</div><div class="calibre3">That brown-haired man said he found this classroom by accident yesterday.</div><div class="calibre3">I wish he found this classroom at least tomorrow.</div><div class="calibre3">"ORRAAA!"</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5"><b class="calibre4">Bang!</b></i></div><div class="calibre3">There's an impact. The locker has been kicked.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm opening it now!"</div><div class="calibre3">There is a clang of a hand clutching on the locker handle.</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka and I have no choice but to huddle together and wait for that moment.</div>
