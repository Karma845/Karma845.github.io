<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; The Three's Daily Life</h3>

<div class="calibre3">The morning classes are over, and with the chime comes the lunch break.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm more hungry than usual due to the swimming class I have taken in the morning.</div><div class="calibre3">It isn't just me, but everyone else as well.</div><div class="calibre3">My classmates who belong to the cafeteria group are rushing out of the classroom.</div><div class="calibre3">In the midst of all this, I can confirm the presence of Rinka, who is walking with a lovely light blue handbag in her hand.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">......Alright, I'll go too.</i></div><div class="calibre3">The rendezvous is the landing of the rooftop. Rinka is waiting for me there.</div><div class="calibre3">"Sup, Ayanokouji. Let's have lunch, let's have. I'm starving already." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yo! Ayanokouji-kun. I, Saito, am here. Let's have lunch together." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">Naturally, Tachibana and Saito gather around my seat.</div><div class="calibre3">Well, this is always the case......</div><div class="calibre3">But unfortunately, I have a prior appointment today.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm sorry to them, but I will have to decline.</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm sorry. I have another appointment today." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Huh? What are you talking about, Ayanokouji? You don't have anyone else to have lunch with but us, do you!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's a fact though, but it pis*es me off....... How should I put it, haven't we had this conversation before?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">When I'm looking down at Tachibana with half-lidded eyes, Saito whispers in a tone of voice that is considerate to the surroundings.</div><div class="calibre3">"No, Tachibana-kun. You can't do it, because Ayanokouji-kun now has a very special girlfriend." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Hmm... Ah, you're right. I'm so jealous of you that I had to delete that fact from my brain." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">At Saito's words, Tachibana claps his hands.</div><div class="calibre3">They're my friends, and they're one of the few people who know about the relationship between me and Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">Although Tachibana and Saito usually do and say lousy things, when it comes down to this matter, they are trustworthy and will do their best to help us (I hope).</div><div class="calibre3">...... No, I'm pretty sure they're trustworthy here.</div><div class="calibre3">They won't tell anyone about my relationship with Rinka</div><div class="calibre3">"Godddamiiiitt!! I'm so jealous! I bet you fοndle her bοοbs all the time, don't you!? And also have her call your name in that beautiful voice of hers." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Aren't you too devoted to your lust? You're so full of sh*t, really you are." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Don't be stupid! Even if I'm castrated, seeing that erοtic body would increase my sεxual desire!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Tachibana becomes intensely excited. I silently give him a chop on his forehead.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ouch! What the h*ll are you doing?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's the chop for getting excited over my pretty girlfriend." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It's the first time in several years that I have committed a small act of violence.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm a pacifist and a non-violent person, but I'm annoyed when people have weird fantasies about my girlfriend.</div><div class="calibre3">"Screw you! Go ahead and give chops to all the men in the country, then!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">That's impossible.</div><div class="calibre3">But there is a part of what Tachibana has said that makes sense.</div><div class="calibre3">If you look at it objectively, there is no doubt that Rinka's appearance level is among the top class in Japan.</div><div class="calibre3">It'll be harsher to tell people not to fantasize when they see Rinka.......</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey, Ayanokouji. You have to share your happiness with me." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"What exactly do you want me to do?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Introduce me to a girl! A kind girl who will only love me!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I can introduce you to such ones." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Whoa! Seriously?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yeah. How about Akita or Poodle? I hear they're very loyal." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Are you making fun of me? You're telling this me to give up on human women?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Tachibana, who has lost his temper, grabs me by the chest and closes the distance between us.</div><div class="calibre3">Oh no, I must have played him a little too much.</div><div class="calibre3">"Phew~......, don't do that, Tachibana-kun. Let's have more composure in our hearts." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"......What's with you, Saito? Is it will be appealing to have more composure, huh? ......Ah, could you be, have gotten a girlfriend too?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Fufu, that your <i class="calibre5">'could you be'</i> is a bingo." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wh-WHAAATTTT!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Tachibana and I both let out a big gasp of surprise when Saito snapped his glasses on with plenty of composure.</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Does Saito finally have a girlfriend?</i></div><div class="calibre3">"I'll show you my girlfriend exclusively." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">Saito takes out his smartphone from his pants pocket and shows us the screen.</div><div class="calibre3">On it is a picture of a special beautiful girl that makes our mouths dropped. Her blond hair shining brightly. Large brεasts. Big and clear eyes. And a simple nose drawn with vertical lines.......</div><div class="calibre3">"Oi, oi, oi! It's 2D!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yes, you're right she's 2D! a 2D wife!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">Saito exclaims to the screaming Tachibana.</div><div class="calibre3">"Saito! That girl won't come out of the screen!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"What's the matter with that! In the face of infinite love, it doesn't matter whether it's 3D or 2D!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Wha――――!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Listen, Tachibana-kun, Ayanokouji-kun. 3D girls grow old as they age. But with 2D girls, they can stay young forever!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Y-you're right! 2D girls are the best, aren't they!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Hearing Saito's passionate speech, Tachibana shivers as if he's moved.</div><div class="calibre3">For me, I'm just stunned, unable to follow the flow of conversation.</div><div class="calibre3">To be serious, if you have love in your heart, it doesn't matter if she looks old or not.</div><div class="calibre3">Even if we become old, I want to stay with her...... <i class="calibre5">Isn't that what you call love?</i></div><div class="calibre3">I don't know either, though.</div><div class="calibre3">"Then I'll, be off." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Have a good day, Ayanokouji-kun." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"Go ahead, Ayanokouji! While you're brεastfed by a 3D woman, we'll be moving on to the next stage!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">As long as they seem happy, I'm not going to say anything.</div><div class="calibre3">Let's go to Rinka as soon as possible.</div>
