<h3>Round 3: Which Part? Hey, Which Part?</h3>

<p>One day, the head of our family collapsed at the entrance of the house without any apparent sign before and was taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>The cause was overwork and malnutrition.</p>

<p>At first, I was very confused.</p>
<p>Each day as I returned from school, I found Dad always staring blankly at the TV.</p>
<p>Mom worked full-time, so there was no worry about income, but the problem was meals.</p>
<p>Since we started having dinner together, we have been sharing the pre-made foods that we bought at the store.</p>
<p>There was not a trace of conversation between us.</p>
<p>In such a state, I couldn’t imagine he’d recover from that state of poor health.</p>

<p>That’s why I scoured online videos and started cooking by imitating what I saw.</p>
<p>The first thing I tried was a fried egg. I sacrificed four eggs before I could cook one properly.</p>
<p>I also tried making curry. Although I followed the instructions on the box, the roux was somehow watery and the vegetables were undercooked for some reason.</p>
<p>Dad said nothing and continued to eat my failed dishes.</p>
<p>Day after day—day after day—every day.</p>

<p>Before long, the final day of his leave of absence arrived.</p>
<p>At the very least, I wanted to improve his eating environment and create a little joy in Dad’s life.</p>

<p>I served him my wholehearted specialty dish.</p>
<p>This was a menu I had practiced many times, using ingredients I bought with my own pocket money, which was separate from our daily meals.</p>
<p>That day, just like always, Dad silently took a bite of my cooking.</p>
<p>Then, to my surprise——he adjusted his chopsticks, leaned forward, and began to eat it quickly.</p>
<p>Eventually, Dad let out a few words after swallowing the last bite of the food.</p>

<p>“…That was delicious.”</p>

<p>——It had been several years since I last heard Dad’s voice with warmth in it.</p>
<p>There was a bowl of pork rice on the table with not a single grain of rice left.</p>

<p>Right after returning to work, Dad quit his job.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he started to be frequently absent from home.</p>
<p>Some time had passed——one evening, just when I thought it seemed unusual for the three of us to be gathered at the dinner table, Dad made a surprising announcement.</p>

<p>“I’m going to take over a friend’s izakaya.”</p>

<p>It seemed that he had been training at the shop and acquiring qualifications related to the food and beverage industry while he was away from home.</p>
<p>Later, I asked Dad why a man who didn’t know the first thing about cooking was interested in the food and beverage business.</p>

<p>“I thought to myself while eating your homemade cooking, Suzufumi. I want to make someone happy with my own cooking too.”</p>

<p>Dad said so and smiled while ruffling my hair.</p>

<p>I know food is a sure path to making people happy.</p>
<p>That’s why I can’t just leave her alone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the last day of spring break, the sound of the doorbell woke me from my sleep.</p>

<p>“I’m coming.”</p>

<p>Rubbing my eyes while still in my pajamas, I head toward the entrance.</p>
<p>It must be a delivery person.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Dad sends a huge amount of food along with a note saying, ‘Try this out, I recommend it!’.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s branded meat, sometimes organic vegetables, sometimes limited edition sweets.</p>
<p>I’m grateful for the sentiment. The problem is the amount that arrives is far too much for one person to finish it by himself.</p>
<p>It’s a struggle to finish everything when it’s packed in a volume that seems enough for at least ten people.</p>
<p>I slip on my sandals and open the door.</p>

<p>“——Good morning, Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>Standing before me was the resident of room 810, Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“It’s already eight o’clock. Were you still sleeping?”</p>

<p>My neighbor looks at me with the eyes of a teacher cautioning a student who has dozed off during class.</p>

<p>“…Good morning, Yuzuki.”</p>

<p>I see, so it’s not enough to have a wake-up voice, you’ve come to wake me up in person.</p>
<p>Dressed in a shirt and shorts, her long legs are dazzling.</p>

<p>“I have been awake for a while now.”</p>
<p>“Your reply sounds like an automatic translation.” (返事が自動翻訳みたいになってる)</p>

<p>Well, it’s true that I would have long since gotten up and finished breakfast by now if it were a weekday, but spring break isn’t over yet, so this is what happens.</p>

<p>“Already off to work? You’re quite popular, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m running late today. Here, take this.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki held out a book to me.</p>
<p>On the cover was a beautiful girl lying face down on a bed and looking straight at the camera.</p>

<p>“It’s my first photo book, which was released today. I’m giving it to you, Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>The Yuzuki on the cover had a feminine expression and was gazing at me.</p>
<p>It made me feel as if I was actually sharing the bed with her, so my heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>Any trace of sleepiness had long since vanished.</p>

<p>“It’s already going for a reprint at the pre-order stage, so I’m sure you won’t be able to find it in bookstores right now.”</p>

<p>The obi on the cover reads, ‘Shopping, dinner, beach…The unwavering 【Spotlights】 center. A close-up on Arisu Yuzuki’s vacation!’</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s about time for me to go. Bye!”</p>

<p>After pressing the photo book against my chest, Yuzuki brings her lips close to my ear.</p>

<p>“…Have lots of fun, okay?”</p>

<p>Feeling a tickle in my ears, I instinctively stepped back.</p>
<p>Yuzuki flashes me a mischievous smile, then waves her hand flutteringly and heads towards the elevator.</p>

<p>I stood by the entrance while still holding my ear as I saw Yuzuki off.</p>
<p>Lots of fun… you’re talking about spring break, right?</p>

<p>The pounding in my chest didn’t seem like it would subside unless I kept telling myself something like that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>In the morning, I finished the laundry, cleaning, and shopping, and picked up my uniform from the dry cleaners.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I finished unpacking the remaining items and, while at it, repacked the preserved food in the emergency kits bag.</p>
<p>Then, I watched the programs I had recorded and tended to the vegetable garden on the balcony.</p>
<p>As evening approached, I finally started to run out of things to do.</p>
<p>There was nothing left to do…</p>

<p>” …. “</p>

<p>I returned to my room and sat in seiza on my bed.</p>
<p>In my hands was a photo book I had just received this morning.</p>

<p>A photo book is essentially a collection of ‘cuteness.’ In other words, it’s like stepping into her ‘home ground’. For Yuzuki, who’s trying to win me over as a fan, it must be one of her trump cards.</p>

<p>The best move for me would be to seal the photo book without opening it.</p>
<p>But you see… that would be rude to Yuzuki, and to be honest, I really want to see it.</p>
<p>After all, it’s bound to be incredibly cute.</p>

<p>After taking several deep breaths, I resolve myself and flip the cover.</p>
<p>The first thing that catches my eye is Yuzuki strolling around in what looks like a park.</p>
<p>She’s dressed in a white T-shirt and sweatpants, giving off a sporty and casual vibe.</p>
<p>With each page turn, she reveals different looks: overalls, maid cosplay, extravagant dresses, and so on——</p>

<p>When I reached the middle of the photo book, the scene shifted to the beach.</p>
<p>Yuzuki has tied the hem of her T-shirt at the waist, revealing her navel.</p>
<p>The shirt clings tightly, emphasizing the contrast between her chest and waist.</p>

<p>──Have lots of fun, okay?</p>
<p>The words Yuzuki whispered into my kept echoing in my mind, making my head spin.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t read too much into those words.</p>
<p>After all, a photo book is like a painting displayed in a museum.</p>
<p>The only purpose is to appreciate it respectfully and deepen people’s appreciation.</p>
<p>Don’t get flustered—stay calm.</p>

<p>I steadied my rough breathing and turned the page again.</p>

<p>“…!”</p>

<p>There was Yuzuki in a swimsuit.</p>
<p>Under the clear sky and against the backdrop of an emerald green sea, she wore a blue bikini that rivaled the beauty of her surroundings.</p>
<p>The bikini top, adorned with frills and two triangular pieces of fabric, prominently displayed her cleavage.</p>
<p>Not too small, not too big, just the right size.</p>
<p>The bottom part of the swimsuit was a pareo, which not only looked cute but also gave an everlasting summer vibe.</p>

<p>The bikini figure of the one I’m yearning for——</p>
<p>This was getting dangerous, in more ways than one.</p>

<p>I closed the photo album and stored it in the lower drawer of my desk.</p>
<p>In a hurry, I moved to the kitchen and gulped a cold bottle of green tea.</p>
<p>I felt a freezing sensation lodged in my head and managed to shake off my worldly desires.</p>
<p>Yuzuki probably anticipated my reaction like this when she handed me the photo album.</p>
<p>The more I agonize over it, the more I play into her hands.</p>
<p>It is dangerous to turn the pages any further.</p>

<p>“I’m home~”</p>

<p>A voice announcing a return home and the sound of a door opening and closing could be heard from the next-door house.</p>

<p>——I’m saved</p>
<p>Now is the time to switch to offense and start preparing dinner.</p>

<p>Tonight’s menu is yakisoba.</p>
<p>First, let’s prepare the vegetables. I toughly chop the cabbage and cut the carrot into thin strips.</p>
<p>It’s also possible to add bean sprouts, onions, and various mushrooms, but having too many ingredients can make the flavors incoherent, so I limit the non-meat ingredients to two types when making yakisoba.</p>
<p>Once the vegetables were cut, I added lard to the heated frying pan. While regular oil is fine, using lard significantly enhances the dish and makes it more filling.</p>
<p>I stir-fried the pork slices and vegetables appropriately, then add the loosened Chinese steamed noodles.</p>
<p>After mixing the ingredients and noodles, I drizzled the special sauce over them, ensuring it coated everything evenly.</p>
<p>I also added oyster sauce as a secret ingredient to enhance the flavor.</p>
<p>Then, I increased the heat to give the surface of the noodles a slightly crispy texture.</p>
<p>The finishing touches were sprinkling aonori (green seaweed), katsuobushi (bonito flakes), and tempura scraps just before serving. Of course, a large portion of pickled red ginger was also included.</p>

<p>The cooking time was less than thirty minutes, but it was a good change of pace.</p>
<p>By now, the memory of Yuzuki in a bikini was far away.</p>
<p>Her breasts, navel, and waistline were not imprinted on my mind at all!</p>

<p>Hearing the sound of the balcony door opening, I turn on the ventilation fan as a form of greeting.</p>
<p>Let the smell of the slightly burnt sauce tantalize you now.</p>
<p>Earlier, I had been completely caught in her trap, but now it was my turn.</p>
<p>I’ll satisfy you tonight with my big and tasty serving of Yakisoba.</p>

<p>I was thinking such carefree thoughts at that time.</p>
<p>Little did I know that I would cross a line as a man a few minutes later——</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>As usual, I carry my Okamochi and ring the bell of the next door.</p>

<p>Today’s strategy is as follows.</p>
<p>First, I’ll offer up some piping hot yakisoba in a classic move.</p>
<p>Like the Milan-style Doria from the day before, I won’t forget the performance of sprinkling green seaweed and tempura scraps right in front of her.</p>
<p>At this stage, she probably won’t give in yet, so I’ll swiftly launch my second shot.</p>

<p>Apart from the yakisoba, I’ve prepared white rice.</p>
<p>It’s not that I’m saying to eat the white rice with the yakisoba as a side dish.</p>
<p>Though that’s delicious in its own right, what I’m attempting to make is ‘Sobameshi.’</p>
<p>It’s a B-grade gourmet dish originating from Kobe, consisting of finely chopped yakisoba and rice stir-fried together.</p>
<p>To differentiate the taste from the yakisoba, I plan to sprinkle fish powder as a finishing touch.</p>
<p>It’s a perfect plan.</p>

<p>For a palate cleanser, I’ve also prepared some boiled spinach in the lower compartment of the Okamochi.</p>
<p>The front door opens. Today’s Yuzuki doesn’t have any protein with her.</p>
<p>In other words, defenseless.</p>

<p>“I’ve made dinner. Today’s menu is yakisoba. Let’s eat together.”</p>

<p>With a smile, I brought dinner, to which Yuzuki responded with a sigh.</p>
<p>——Come on, resist as you always do. I’m prepared for every possible scenario.</p>

<p>However, the words that came from her mouth were unexpected.</p>

<p>“…Please come in.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Did she just say, ‘please come in’? Did ‘that’ Yuzuki just welcome me?</p>

<p>What’s going on?</p>
<p>Yesterday and the day before, the moment I offered my cooking, Yuzuki contorted her face and resisted desperately.</p>
<p>But she’s unusually submissive and accepting without any fuss today.</p>

<p>While tilting my head in confusion, I was led to the living room.</p>
<p>Even when I took out a silver plate filled with yakisoba from the Okamochi, Yuzuki swallowed hard, yet her expression was somehow different from before.</p>

<p>Well, it’s fine. I just have to fulfill my mission.</p>
<p>After scattering various toppings over the yakisoba on the low table, I gestured with my hand.</p>

<p>“This time, I chose thick noodles to enjoy a chewy texture. I also cut the vegetables large to retain a crunchy bite.”</p>
<p>“…I’ve been thinking about why I lost the past two days.”</p>

<p>With a resolute attitude, Yuzuki pushed the plate back toward me.</p>

<p>“Pork bowls and Milan-style Doria are not impossible to make at home, but basically, you can’t really get the proper thing unless you order them at a restaurant. It was that rarity that made me give in.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>
<p>“But today’s yakisoba is different. Compared to the previous two dishes, it’s something you can easily make at home, and there are plenty of opportunities to eat it at outdoor festivals or catering events. In other words, it’s not a menu that can only be enjoyed right now!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, pointing her index finger at me sharply, looked like a great detective in a mystery novel, pinpointing the culprit.</p>
<p>I see—so she figured that if the yakisoba wasn’t rare, she could resist the temptation even if it was presented right in front of her.</p>
<p>That’s why she let me into her house so easily.</p>
<p>I really think to myself. This idol is too naive.</p>

<p>“This Chinese-style noodle is the same product used at my dad’s store. It’s an expensive one that we get wholesale from the noodle factory, and I don’t think it’s something you can easily find around town?”</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s composure vanished from her face.</p>

<p>“They say they blend four types of flour, each carefully selected for the grinding method and place of origin. It even comes with a catchy slogan like ‘Divine noodles that perfectly balance suppleness with chewiness.’ “</p>
<p>“D-Divine noodles…”</p>

<p>Her voice’s intensity dropped sharply.</p>
<p>But Yuzuki still shook her head vigorously from side to side as if to dispel her worldly desires.</p>

<p>“What’s divine about it! It’s not like there won’t be other chances in the future!”</p>
<p>“Too bad. This noodle factory is planning to close down in the summer due to a lack of successors.”</p>

<p>That’s why Dad has been placing large orders for the past few months as a way of saying thanks.</p>
<p>The yakisoba is also very popular in the shop as the final dish to finish off a meal.</p>

<p>“S-shut up! Just so you know, today is the day that I won’t lose!”</p>

<p>Realizing that logical resistance is impossible, Yuzuki plays her last card of fighting spirit and determination.</p>

<p>“Yakisoba is nothing but a lump of carbs! I don’t want to eat this anti-diet menu, not even a little bit! The brown-stained noodles, the smell of the burnt sauce, the plentiful meat, the fresh vegetables, the toppings on the table, none of them are enough to make me succumb to your meal!”</p>
<p>“…Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Sure, the thick noodles have a strong texture and I think you can taste the wheat flavor. They also do go well with the sauce, making them suitable for yakisoba! By the way, does that noodle factory handle low-carb noodles as well?”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so…”</p>
<p>“Oh is that so? ——And not just the noodles, but cutting the ingredients into larger pieces to give them more presence is also to my liking! Not that it matters what I like!”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>

<p>Yuzuki, could it be that you’re already starting to give in after just these few seconds?</p>
<p>Hold on-hold on.</p>
<p>Where did that strong will you had when you invited me to your house go?</p>

<p>No, I can guess the reason for the change of heart in such a short time.</p>
<p>It’s not just the noodle factory’s original noodles. Yuzuki has been forcibly inhaling the smell of the cooked sauce since earlier.</p>
<p>Few people can maintain their composure under the rich fragrance of yakisoba.</p>



<p>As a test, I push the plate of yakisoba back.</p>
<p>Yuzuki returns it.</p>
<p>Once again, I push it from me towards Yuzuki.</p>
<p>Then the plate does not come back to me anymore.</p>
<p>That’s it?</p>

<p>Judging it was time to make a move, I raised my voice.</p>

<p>“Come on, let’s eat while it’s hot! Let us put our hands together~!”</p>
<p>“U-uhh…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, a bit delayed, gripped her chopsticks and put her hands together.</p>

<p>“Itadakimasu!”</p>
<p>“Itadakimasu…”</p>

<p>Yes, victory again today. That was honestly too easy.</p>
<p>Yuzuki, with some hesitation, takes a half bite of the yakisoba.</p>
<p>As she chews slowly, her expression gradually brightens.</p>

<p>“…So chewy…♥”</p>

<p>She continues with another bite.</p>
<p>This time, she boldly grabs a mouthful of yakisoba with her chopsticks and slurps it up.</p>

<p>“The surface is crispy, while the inside is chewy, the noodles are perfectly entangled with the rich sauce, just amazing♥ As expected from the divine noodles…♥ The pork is tender, the vegetables are crisp, and the balance in my mouth is just right.”</p>
<p>“Right? I’m confident in my yakisoba.”</p>
<p>“The ingredients are so juicy. Are you using lard when you stir-fry it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s the correct answer.”</p>
<p>“That’s why it tastes like it’s from an authentic teppanyaki restaurant♥”</p>

<p>I took a bite too. Yeah, it’s pretty good.</p>
<p>The ingredients and noodles are perfectly grilled. The flavor is also spot on.</p>
<p>I managed to get Yuzuki to eat some, too, and I’m feeling good.</p>
<p>My record is three wins in three matches up to today.</p>
<p>At this rate, the day of her complete defeat seems close.</p>

<p>“By the way, I didn’t expect Suzufumi to be this happy.”</p>

<p>With a slurp, Yuzuki twirled the noodles near her mouth and muttered.</p>

<p>“…What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>After curling the corners of her lips, Yuzuki crossed her arms and grabbed the hem of her shirt.</p>

<p>“…Hey, Yuzuki?”</p>

<p>It was a gesture normally done in a changing room.</p>
<p>Then her skin is exposed. I can see her waist, navel, and a frilled light blue fabric supporting her chest.</p>
<p>——Yuzuki was wearing a swimsuit under her shirt.</p>

<p>” ! “</p>

<p>The scene I had just admired in the photo book was right before my eyes.</p>
<p>The sea. Swimsuits. The sandy beach. Food stalls. Swimming in the sea. Travel. Yakisoba. Beach houses. Meals.</p>
<p>Various words flitted through my mind, eventually leading to a certain hypothesis.</p>

<p>“No way…!”</p>

<p>I borrowed one of the photo books that looked like a gift from the shelf in the Sasaki family’s living room and flipped to the continuation of the page I had stopped at before.</p>

<p>“…!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki was eating yakisoba at a beach house.</p>

<p>“That’s ridiculous!”</p>

<p>Had I unintentionally recreated the scene from the photo book?</p>
<p>The odds of randomly choosing yakisoba from all the possible dishes by chance surely can hardly be expressed in numbers.</p>
<p>No, perhaps the sight of the beach and swimsuits in the height of summer had subconsciously influenced my choice.</p>
<p>But if Yuzuki didn’t know I was going to make yakisoba, she wouldn’t have thought to prepare a swimsuit in advance.</p>

<p>“When I went out to the balcony earlier, I smelled a nice sauce aroma. Ah, I’m convinced that you wanted to eat yakisoba after looking at the photo book.”</p>

<p>Right, it was me who turned on the ventilation fan before the visit as a preparation.</p>
<p>At that point, I hadn’t reached the particular page yet. However, it was natural for Yuzuki to come to that conclusion.</p>
<p>The intention was to launch a preemptive strike with the scent, but it backfired, inviting a counter instead.</p>
<p>Yuzuki plans to knock me out with her swimsuit appearance while riding on the yakisoba wave.</p>

<p>“So, what do you think? How does it compare to the photo book?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki moves the yakisoba aside and throws me a sly glance.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s…”</p>

<p>Because she has her hands placed on her knees, it naturally becomes a pose that pushes her chest together and emphasizes her cleavage.</p>

<p>“Even though I already gave you one, you were intently looking at the photo book again in my room. You’re such a closet perv, Suzufumi.”</p>
<p>She flashed me a challenging smile that seemed almost audible with a sneering sound effect.</p>
<p>Stop making that face, seriously, it’s making me blush.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s kind of dangerous in various ways.</p>

<p>“Hey, what do you think?”</p>

<p>Activating all sorts of mental brakes at once, I somehow choose my words carefully and manage to squeeze them out.</p>

<p>“…I think it’s healthy, and very good.”</p>
<p>“Which part? Hey, which part?”</p>
<p>(TN: ‘Healthy’ in this context means something like ‘You’re in a good shape’)</p>

<p>Leaning over the table, Yuzuki kept pressing for an answer.</p>
<p>Because of that, two bulges came dangerously close to me.</p>
<p>That’s the part I’m talking about, you idiot!</p>

<p>I couldn’t see any way to engage with her seriously and come out on top.</p>
<p>So I needed to finish my meal quickly and make my escape.</p>
<p>When I decided to ignore her, Yuzuki’s face took on a sulky expression, and she grabbed my hand to stand up.</p>

<p>“Come over here for a second.”</p>

<p>She was unusually forceful. I was taken out into the hallway without a chance to argue.</p>
<p>I was led straight into a room off the corridor. It seemed to be a bedroom.</p>
<p>The room was unified in white, from the bed to the curtains, exuding a mystical atmosphere.</p>
<p>Yuzuki turned her back to me and took off her shorts.</p>
<p>Unlike in the photo book, she wasn’t wearing a pareo, so the shape of her back was clearly visible.</p>

<p>At the back of the room, Yuzuki lay down on the bed on her side and propped her head up with her right hand.</p>
<p>It was the so-called ‘Nirvana statue’pose.</p>
<p>However, when Yuzuki did it, she exuded the elegance of a pure-hearted campaign girl.</p>

<p>“Did you know there are bed scenes like this in the photo book, or were you too shy to finish the book?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, lying down, sent a bewitching glance my way.</p>
<p>The mismatch between the bedding and the swimsuit intensely shook my instincts.</p>


<p>“…What do you think? Does it make your heart race?”</p>

<p>Somehow, Yuzuki’s voice seemed tinged with moisture.</p>
<p>Slender limbs, fine white skin, toned body.</p>
<p>The food I made is inside that stomach. Imagining it makes my body tingle.</p>

<p>Sensing my gaze, Yuzuki made a suggestion while stroking her belly.</p>

<p>“Do you want to touch it?”</p>

<p>From the tips of my toes to the crown of my head—it felt like a thin snake was wriggling all over.</p>

<p>I think I should say no.</p>
<p>After all, such behaviour might cross a line for an idol.</p>

<p>“…Is it really okay?”</p>

<p>But against my better judgment, my mouth was asking for her confirmation.</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki sat up and took a ladylike sitting posture at the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>I knelt in front of the bed.</p>
<p>My field of view was filled with Yuzuki’s abdomen and thighs.</p>
<p>With a trembling right hand, I slowly touched Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Mmm——”</p>

<p>A small voice leaked out above my head.</p>

<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>What is this?</p>
<p>My fingers are being drawn into the white, translucent skin.</p>
<p>The heat transferred from my fingertips surges through my brain like an electric shock.</p>
<p>The fingers that have invaded her abdomen give the illusion that they might just melt away in no time.</p>

<p>“Hehe, I’ve been working hard on my abs because my outfit often shows my stomach. Want to check more?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki takes my wrist and presses it against her abdomen.</p>
<p>I reflexively tried to pull my hand back, but she firmly held it in place.</p>

<p>“W-wait!”</p>
<p>“Nope, come on.”</p>

<p>Through the palm of my hand, my thoughts are slowly being invaded.</p>
<p>In a corner of my mind, instinct bares its fangs, threatening to devour my reason.</p>
<p>If this continues, blood will rush downward.</p>

<p>“Let’s recreate the camera angles from the photo book. Lie down on the bed.”</p>

<p>Led by the hand, I climbed onto the bed, and we both rolled over.</p>
<p>Yuzuki was on the right side, and I was on the left.</p>
<p>This distance, like sleeping with a lover——Made my heart raced like a rapid bell.</p>

<p>“Okay, one more time.”</p>

<p>Once again, I touched Yuzuki’s stomach with my right hand.</p>
<p>If I wasn’t careful, I felt like I could lose consciousness at any moment.</p>

<p>“You’re already getting embarrassed. How cute~”</p>

<p>We’re at a distance where our lips could touch if I’m not careful. Her breath tickled me.</p>
<p>As much as Yuzuki was trying to win me over as a fan, this was definitely going too far.</p>
<p>Still, I don’t seem to be able to resist this magic.</p>

<p>Every time I ran my finger over her, Yuzuki would squirm and let out a small sound.</p>
<p>I want to hear more of that voice, so I trace my fingers down her stomach.</p>
<p>——The sound of sheets rustling, her eyes growing moist, her breathing gradually becoming rougher.</p>

<p>But as I touched her, I could feel not just softness but also firmness.</p>
<p>How many years must it have taken to build such a figure?</p>
<p>Maybe I should take a leaf out of her book and start working out too.</p>
<p>Where can you buy an ab roller?</p>

<p>“…Hey.”</p>

<p>Her abs were indeed impressive, like a work of art.</p>

<p>“…Hey, Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>Amateur training methods wouldn’t be effective, so I guess watching professional tutorial videos is essential.</p>

<p>“It’s about time…”</p>

<p>Maybe I’ll also look up some protein supplements too.</p>

<p>“Suzufumi, that spot is——hhnggh!”</p>

<p>When I get home, I must thoroughly go through the photo book again.</p>

<p>“Hey, listen to me——!”</p>

<p>When I looked up, Yuzuki’s face was bright red.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I look down at my own hand.</p>
<p>My right hand had reached just below Yuzuki’s navel.</p>

<p>“That’s enough…”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s voice, stricken with shame, was so faint that it was barely audible.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>An awkward silence flowed between us.</p>

<p>“Err, I should go home.”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah, see you tomorrow!”</p>

<p>——Forgetting even to collect the dishes, I dashed out of the Sasaki house.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">★★★</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just after Suzufumi left the room.</p>
<p>I was writhing in agony alone on the bed while rolling around.</p>
<p>I went too far aaaaaaaaaah!</p>

<p>That was just perverted!</p>
<p>No matter how much I wanted to charm Suzufumi and win him over as a fan, to dress up in a swimsuit and let him touch my stomach——</p>
<p>What was I thinking, doing that with a boy!</p>

<p>The scene earlier was less a recreation of a photo book and more like a runaway.</p>
<p>I even let out a weird voice at one point. I must have definitely come off as creepy…!</p>

<p>“Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”</p>

<p>I bury my face in the pillow and flail my legs.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it made my face feel like it was on fire.</p>

<p>“But-but! I was tired of losing to Suzufumi! I wanted to beat him for once and revel in a sense of superiority!</p>

<p>Lying on my back at the left edge of the bed, I can feel the warmth Suzufumi left behind.</p>

<p>“…Sigh…”</p>

<p>I wonder if I’ll be able to face him properly from tomorrow.</p>
<p>This swimsuit was one I bought after a photo shoot.</p>
<p>I was thinking of going to the pool at least once this summer. But if I wear this, I might just end up writhing in the memories of today.</p>
<p>Then again, if I wear a different swimsuit, Suzufumi might think I’m being self-conscious——</p>

<p>“Wait, why am I assuming I’m going to go with Suzufumi!”</p>

<p>After giving myself a mental retort, I reach behind to untie the straps.</p>
<p>I decided to just take a shower and end the day——</p>
