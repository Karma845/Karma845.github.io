<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; The Identity</h3>

<div class="calibre3">Peaceful weekdays have passed and weekends have arrived. And now, the time is 20:47.</div><div class="calibre3">Today is the day that the four of us (me, Rinka, Kurumizaka-san, and Kiyokawa) are going to play online games together.</div><div class="calibre3">The day before yesterday, Rinka contacted me and we decided to online from 21:00 today.</div><div class="calibre3">But just now, Rinko called me again and said that both Kurumizaka-san and her had something to do and would be 5-10 minutes late.</div><div class="calibre3">Incidentally, Kiyokawa seemed to have no problems and was already logged in.</div><div class="calibre3">But I haven't been informed of Kiyokawa's username in the Black Plains.</div><div class="calibre3">Regretting that I should have asked Rinka about it, I turn on my computer and launch Black Plains. In the menu scene, I select Kazu, that wearing his stern armor, and log in.</div><div class="calibre3">Putting on my headphones, I enter the voice chatroom. Of course, I'm the only one in the room. I look at the list of participants on the server. Kazu, Rin, and Sturmangriff are all listed. It seems that Kiyokawa has not joined, or maybe she has not yet been given the URL of the server by Kurumozaka-san and Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Ah, Aaya-san's logged in." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">After logging into the Black Plains, I casually look at my friend lists and noticed.</div><div class="calibre3">It might be a little unusual for her to be logged in at this time.</div><div class="calibre3">She usually logged in around 22:00 and logs out at 23:00.</div><div class="calibre3">If she doesn't have any plans, I'd have invited her to do the dailies now, but this time I can't do that.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Ah, it's Kazu!] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Aaya-san sends me a chat. I apologize, but I have to decline today.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I'm sorry, Aaya-san. I have an appointment to play with my real friends today.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Real friends....... Real friends are friends in the real world.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I see. I'm actually planning to online with my real friends as well.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Seriously? We're the same then.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[We are. But it seems that my real friends are going to be a little late, so I thought I'd ask Kazu to keep me company until they get here, Would you?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Sure. I'm in the same situation. My real friends are going to be late too.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[We're perfectly in the same boat. Is it a miracle?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[It's not a pleasant miracle, tho.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">Luckily(?), we both have found someone to pass the time with.</div><div class="calibre3">I'll spend some time chatting with Aaya-san until Rinka and the others get here.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Among the friends who are coming over is the guy I mentioned before. What do you think?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I think we should report him to the administrators.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[You hate handsome men too much, you know. He's a good guy, okay.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Is he really? I guess I'll go and confirm it.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazu, you're going to play with your friends, right? Then you can't.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I'll take a little break and go confirming it. I'll at least see what kind of avatar he's wearing and then I'll report him.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[In the end, you're going to report him. You the worst.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I'm called the worst (crying).</div><div class="calibre3">It's not that I hate a handsome guy.</div><div class="calibre3">It was because he stole the girl I had promised to marry at my preschool time.</div><div class="calibre3">I still couldn't forget those happy smiles on their faces.</div><div class="calibre3">......No, if I'd been with that girl, I wouldn't have been dating Rinka, right.</div><div class="calibre3">In a way, I can regard that handsome guy as a cupid for my love story.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Aaya-san. I was mistaken.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Huh?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Handsome guys are the best, aren't they!] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Eh, Why so sudden? Are you of that kind of guy? One of my friends is a senior who likes BL.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I am not, and I also don't care anything of that senior of yours.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">That reminds me, I have a friend who likes BL too.</div><div class="calibre3">In addition, this girl is the leader of a popular idol group. I'm so surprised.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What is the username of this handsome guy?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Ah, I didn't know. I did to the usernames of my seniors, but the guy wasn't there, so I didn't know.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Well, I guess it's no use, ....... I'm sure I'll find it out later.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I'll ask Rinka and the others on the way a little break and go see this handsome guy.</div><div class="calibre3">It seems that there is still time, so this time I will be the one who brings the topic.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Listen, Aaya-san. One of my friends who are coming over is, that junior girl.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Seriously? That terrible girl? Should I report her?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Please not do. And, please don't say the same thing as I did to her. After all, she's a cute junior of mine.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Whoa~ what should I do? I want to go see what that b*tch looks like. What's her name?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't know her name yet. I forgot to ask. But I'll find out soon enough.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I wonder what kind of name Kiyokawa is giving to her character in the Black Plains.</div><div class="calibre3">Is it possible to be a play on her real name......?</div><div class="calibre3">It is also possible that the name is unexpectedly full of delusional sickness.</div><div class="calibre3">After letting my imagination run wild in my brain, I proceed with the chat with Aaya-san.</div><div class="calibre3">We mainly have chats about the handsome guy and the junior girl.</div><div class="calibre3">We talk to each other, hiding our real-life information until the last minute.</div><div class="calibre3">And in this exchange...... there comes a turning point in our relationship.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Who does this terrible girl look like?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I think she looks like Kiyokawa Ayane from Star☆Mines.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">She doesn't just look like, she's literally the person.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I see. I'm going to change the topic a little bit, but Kazu likes Mizuki Rinka, don't you?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I do. But lately, I've been rooting for Kiyokawa as well.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Eh.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Well, as a fan. I'm a fan of Kiyokawa Ayane.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">The more I learned about Ayane, the more I found myself rooting for her.</div><div class="calibre3">Besides, she and I are friends. It's only natural that I'll be in a position to support her.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[......would you like to meet her in person?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I'd like to if I could.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">We've actually met many times. And now we are going online together.</div><div class="calibre3">Though, I can't say that.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[What if Kiyokawa is just pretending to be a neat and tidy young lady? What if she's actually just a mere normal girl?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I don't care. Either way, it doesn't change the fact that Kiyokawa-san's trying really hard, right? Isn't that what makes her so cute and charming?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I already know the true identity of Kiyokawa, though.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Aaya-san?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">What's going on? The chat suddenly stopped.</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder if she has left the room.</div><div class="calibre3">As I wait quietly, I receive a shocking message from Aaya-san.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I am, Kiyokawa Ayane.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">.............</div><div class="calibre3">Aah, are you kidding me.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm seriously surprised.</div><div class="calibre3">Aaya-san didn't usually make funny jokes, so I'm surprised.</div><div class="calibre3">For now, I'll just pretend to be surprised and go with the flow.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Wh-what you say! Aaya-san is Kiyokawa Ayane?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Yes. I'm Kiyokawa Ayane.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Wow! By the way, how long are you going to keep this up?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Listen here. I'm dead serious.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No, you're lying. I can say with certainty that it's a lie.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">I can say it because I'm friends with Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">......Is it not enough evidence to say it's a lie.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Kazu, I want you to believe me. The real friends I was talking about are Senior Nana and Senior Rinka.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[They just look alike, don't they?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[No. They are real. Kazu is trustworthy, so I told you the truth.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I won't be fooled, okay.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Why don't you believe me? I confided in you because you're Kazu.......] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Because I'm with the three of them right now.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Huh?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Huh?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">A long silence prevails in the chatbox.</div><div class="calibre3">I'm sure that Aaya-san on the other side of the screen is also troubled.</div><div class="calibre3">But I'm troubled too here.</div><div class="calibre3">Aaya-san is not the type to make this kind of joke. Then she must be Kiyokawa Ayane.</div><div class="calibre3">N-no, no, no. That's not possible.</div><div class="calibre3">If Aaya-san's true identity is Kiyokawa, then...... the person she likes is――――</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Does your given name start with "Aya", by any chance?] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">――――</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">*Ba-dump*</b>, I feel as if my heart has been grabbed.</div><div class="calibre3">I think it's not possible, but I begin to type in the chat with my fingers, which already trembling.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Yes.] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[And could it be possible that the name of yours contains the word "Kazu"?] (Masked☆Aaya)</b></div><div class="calibre3">......Aah, there's no doubt about it.</div><div class="calibre3">The fact that she can narrow down my real name so precisely means that she's genuine.</div><div class="calibre3">And the way her words have suddenly become more polite.</div><div class="calibre3">But, how.......</div><div class="calibre3">How is this even possible?</div><div class="calibre3">I'm getting dizzy now.</div><div class="calibre3">But I have to send the reply.</div><div class="calibre3">I have to reveal Kazu's true identity now.</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[I am, Ayanokouji Kazuto.] (Kazu)</b></div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">.............</div><div class="calibre3">Long silence prevails again.</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder what kind of face Kiyokawa is making behind the screen now. What is she thinking about now?</div><div class="calibre3">She probably doesn't even know what to do now.</div><div class="calibre3">I stare at the chatbox and wait for a reply while enduring my heart beating fast and hard.</div><div class="calibre3">Then, as the conclusion of this long silence, Aaya-san's.......</div><div class="calibre3">No, Kiyokawa's action is――――</div><div class="calibre3"><b class="calibre4">[Masked☆Aaya-san has logged out.]</b></div><div class="calibre3">"You're leaving!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">The action that Kiyokawa has chosen is to flee.</div>
