<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Swimming Class ~The Cool Idol in Swimsuit~</h3>

</div><div class="calibre3">Summer vacation is just around the corner.</div><div class="calibre3">As the sweltering heat continues, swimming classes have already started at the school I attend.</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey Ayanokouji! We're having a joint class with the girls today!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"I know. It's not a joint class. We're going to be divided into different courses." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">As soon as I change into my swimsuit and come out of the changing room, Tachibana, a chubby boy with a happy smile on his face, calls out to me.</div><div class="calibre3">Next to him is Saito, a boy with glasses. No, he's not wearing glasses right now.</div><div class="calibre3">I've known these two since I was a freshman in high school, and they're my benefactor who allowed me to graduate from being a loner.</div><div class="calibre3">By the way, today's swimming class is divided into three courses: 1-3 for boys and 4-6 for girls.</div><div class="calibre3">It doesn't mean we'll be taking classes together.</div><div class="calibre3">"Kehkehkeh, the girls' eyes are all over my body!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's more of a flab than a body. That flabby belly." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Some girls prefer fat guys, you know!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">Well, that's also rightー</i>, I reply to him and turning my attention to the pool.</div><div class="calibre3">The water is glistening reflecting the sun's rays.</div><div class="calibre3">I want to jump into it right now.......</div><div class="calibre3">"According to my calculations, there's an 89% chance that Ayanokouji-kun is being pretentious!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm not being pretentious, but....... to be honest, I'd rather deal with the heat than the girls right now." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"What are you talking about, Ayanokouji? A man should always be thinking about a woman's body!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... That's the worst statement I've ever heard, really." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I give a half-hearted criticism to Tachibana, who is dripping sweat down his body.</div><div class="calibre3">If a girl heard that, she'd probably despise him for the rest of her life.</div><div class="calibre3">The three of us follow the other boys and take a shower before moving to the poolside.</div><div class="calibre3">"I can't wait for the girls to get here." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Dαmn it......! Why I'm a boy who has to wear glasses? I can't see clearly without it!" (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">Both stare at the girls' locker room with glaring eyes.</div><div class="calibre3">I know what you're thinking, but you should at least hold back a little.</div><div class="calibre3">That said, but I'm curious as well.</div><div class="calibre3">I've never seen Rinka in a school swimsuit before.</div><div class="calibre3">I don't think I'll ever have the chance for boys and girls to enter the pool together in the future, so I want to make sure I get a perfect view of her.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ooh, the girls are here!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">The other boys respond to Tachibana's voice.</div><div class="calibre3">I couldn't help but involuntarily turn my face in the direction of the girls' locker room.</div><div class="calibre3">One after another, girls from the same class who have changed into school swimsuits come to the pool.</div><div class="calibre3">They looked completely different from their usual uniforms.</div><div class="calibre3">"Holy sh*t, this is f*cking magnificent! I could eat a hundred green bell-peppers while looking at this superb view!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"P-please, Oh both my eyes! just this once, please improve your eyesight......!" (Saito) <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre11">(<b class="calibre4">PTW/N: </b>Poor Saito-kun,)</span></i></div><div class="calibre3">You're too desperate.</div><div class="calibre3">Saito's eyes narrowed as he stares at the girls.</div><div class="calibre3">"Yikes, what's with them...... staring at us like that?"</div><div class="calibre3">"Aren't those three guys dangerous? That Saito is staring at us." <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre11">(<b class="calibre4">PTW/N:</b> Poor Kazuto, he is counted in.)</span></i></div>
<div class="calibre3">When the girls confirmed our presence, they cower, shouting accusations.</div><div class="calibre3">......Wait a minute, do they mean by "those three" is also count me in?</div><div class="calibre3">Please don't count me in.</div><div class="calibre3">They're certainly important friends, but I have to draw the line, especially when it comes to these things――――</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey Ayanokouji! Mizuki's coming out too!" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Really?!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It seems I belong to the same boat after all.</div><div class="calibre3">I immediately look for Rinka with my eyes.</div><div class="calibre3">There she is.</div><div class="calibre3">She comes out of the locker room after the other girls.</div><div class="calibre3">The school swimsuit highlights Rinka's perfect and beautiful body.</div><div class="calibre3">Her figure is straight and graceful, and her arms are slender and feminine.</div><div class="calibre3">She has well-fleshed thighs and calves that are very attractive, showing off her beautiful legs in a way that will make a man with a leg fεtish shed tears.</div><div class="calibre3">"Uhhyooooo~ Mizuki is different from other girls, after all. Moreover, she has rather large bοοbs. I guess she's the type who looked slender in clothing." (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey, Tachibana." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Mnn?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">"I'm going to gouge out both your eyes." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Scary~! What's wrong with you so suddenly?" (Tachibana)</div><div class="calibre3">Tachibana, who seems to have realized how serious I'm, moves away from me at a speed that's hard to believe he's a chubby guy.</div><div class="calibre3">"There there, Ayanokouji-kun, Mizuki-san is an idol, so it's inevitable that many people will look at her." (Saito)</div><div class="calibre3">"......That is right, though." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I understand it in my head, but I can't subtly convince myself.</div><div class="calibre3">......Am I surprisingly possessive? <i class="calibre5"><span class="calibre11">(<b class="calibre4">PTW/N:</b> possessive boyfriend and yandere girlfriend.... hmmmm, interesting.)</span></i></div><div class="calibre3">As I'm pondering for a bit, my eyes meet with Rinka's, who has finished her shower and is walking to the poolside.</div>
<div class="calibre3">"......"</div><div class="calibre3">"......"</div><div class="calibre3">She doesn't care about the water dripping down her body, and when she notices my presence, she smiles for a moment.</div><div class="calibre3">I think she really wants to run up to me, but she keeps her reaction to a minimum because she's worried about her classmates.</div><div class="calibre3">Then the boys in the vicinity start to buzz.</div><div class="calibre3">"Just now, Mizuki Rinka looked at me and smiled! Could she be into me!?"</div><div class="calibre3">"No, no, no! She smiled at me!"</div><div class="calibre3">"How should I put it, that cool idol also can smile, huh. It's the first time I've seen her smiling in the school."</div><div class="calibre3">Rinka just smiles a little and makes this commotion.</div><div class="calibre3">It's been a while since I've experienced firsthand the awesomeness of a popular idol.</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder what will happen if they find out about my relationship with Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">I have a feeling there will be a riot, at least to the point where I can't come to school (am I exaggerating?).</div><div class="calibre3">"Gather around, you guys. Let's get ready for gymnastics."</div><div class="calibre3">The muscular male teacher in charge of physical education gathers the students.</div><div class="calibre3">Most of the boys, however, are slowing down as they glance at the girls.</div><div class="calibre3">Many of them are probably looking at Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">It's not often that you get to see a cool idol in a school swimsuit, after all.</div><div class="calibre3">And moreover, if she has an outstanding figure and large brεasts, she'll have attracted a lot of attention even if she isn't an idol.</div><div class="calibre3">A girl like that is married to me on the game, and also is acting as my wife in real life.</div><div class="calibre3">You really never know what will happen in life.</div>
