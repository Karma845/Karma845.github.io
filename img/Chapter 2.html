<h3>Round 2: Suzufumi, Let’s Quickly Forget About It</h3>

<p>Years have passed since then.</p>
<p>I’ve become a university student, enjoying a smooth sailing campus life.</p>

<p>Today is my twentieth birthday.</p>
<p>I’m receiving one invitation after another from my college friends to go out drinking, but I decline them all, saying, ‘I already have a prior plan.’</p>
<p>The table is already crowded with dishes.</p>
<p>The bottle of white sparkling wine on the side was procured from an import food specialty store that Yuzuki frequents.</p>

<p>“They said, ‘It’s light on the palate and easy to drink, your boyfriend will surely like it.’ “</p>

<p>Yuzuki pours the wine into the glass with a shy look.</p>
<p>Yes, Yuzuki and I became lovers.</p>
<p>During spring break a few years ago, I made this declaration to Yuzuki, whom I had just met.</p>
<p>──I’ll make Yuzuki fall for my cooking so much that she won’t be able to live without my meals!</p>

<p>The mission was successfully accomplished.</p>
<p>I tilt my glass and try my first wine in life.</p>
<p>Yeah, it does seem easy to drink… I think. There’s a slight bitterness, but it’s kind of like juice.</p>

<p>“I really wanted to take you to a fancy restaurant or something. But we have to consider the public eye.”</p>

<p>Glancing to the side, Yuzuki was staring at me with wet eyes.</p>

<p>“Hey, Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t just her eyes.</p>
<p>Her lips were also moist, and I felt almost drawn to them.</p>

<p>“…wanna kiss?”</p>
<p>” ! What are you saying all of a sudden…”</p>
<p>“You dislike it?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I dislike it, but…”</p>

<p>Ever since we started dating, we’ve maintained a platonic relationship.</p>
<p>But perhaps because I’ve turned twenty, Yuzuki is unusually assertive today.</p>

<p>“So come on, I want a kiss… from Suzufumi?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki closes her eyes and tilts her chin up.</p>
<p>Then, she taps the center of her lips with her index finger.</p>

<p>Her skin is white and smooth, her nose bridge straight, her lips a pale cherry blossom color.</p>
<p>Yuzuki, who has continued to eat the meals I make, has grown healthy and her face has become even more attractive as a woman.</p>

<p>I gently touch Yuzuki’s cheek.</p>
<p>It feels somewhat cold, yet warm——but deep within her cheek, I can feel a definite warmth.</p>

<p>I slowly bring my mouth closer to those pale cherry blossom-colored lips.</p>
<p>Just ten centimeters. Five centimeters. Four centimeters.</p>

<p>——Suzufumi, it’s morning, wake up~.</p>
<p>Three centimeters, two centimeters.</p>

<p>Someone is calling me.</p>
<p>One centimeter——</p>

<p>Then I woke up.</p>
<p>I, in my pajamas, in my apartment, in my bed.</p>
<p>I gradually awakened my mind, which hadn’t fully emerged from a state of sleep, and recalled the beautiful girl who played the leading role in my dream.</p>

<p>She’s a girl from a five-member idol group, 【Spotlights】.</p>
<p>Their absolute ace, Arisu Yuzuki, fifteen years old.</p>
<p>Born in Niigata City, Niigata Prefecture. Height 154 centimeters. Blood type A.</p>
<p>Her ‘image’ color is yellow. Her favorite foods are galettes and crepes.</p>
<p>She debuted as the youngest member of 【Spotlights】 at the age of twelve.</p>
<p>With her excellent musical sense, innate high idol consciousness, and earnest attitude, she gradually made a name for herself and now exerts a strong presence as the group’s ace.</p>
<p>Last year, a song with easy-to-imitate choreography was released and became a topic of conversation mainly on social media, attracting attention.</p>
<p>Since then, she has made a lot of appearances not only on music shows but also on variety shows and dramas——</p>

<p>When I look at the wiki, I find her profile and career history listed in detail.</p>
<p>She uses the fancy surname ‘Arisu’, but that’s just her stage name.</p>
<p>Her real name is Sasaki. A common, unremarkable surname that you could find anywhere.</p>
<p>And that ordinary surnamed girl is my next-door neighbor.</p>
<p>Even so, to have such a wishful dream the day after yesterday….</p>
<p>That alone shows how impactful my encounter with Yuzuki to me was.</p>

<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Placing a hand on my chest, my heart was beating rapidly</p>

<p>『Suzufumi~, it’s morning~, wake up~!』</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, I’m already up… hm?”</p>

<p>A cute voice could be heard from somewhere.</p>

<p>『Come on, we’re going on a date today, right? Get up quickly!』</p>

<p>Did I have such plans?</p>
<p>Yeah, now that someone mentioned it, I think I’m starting to feel like I might have.</p>

<p>『Or would you prefer a date at home? Should we go back to bed and sleep together like this?』</p>

<p>It was a suggestion leaning me towards saying ‘yes’.</p>
<p>I wanted to feel a warmth different from that of a futon, but I needed to start the washing machine soon.</p>

<p>『…If you don’t wake up soon, I’m going to kiss you, okay?』</p>

<p>Alright, I’m going back to sleep.</p>
<p>…My mind was clear enough to come up with such a retort, so I picked up my smartphone from beside my pillow and stared at the lit-up screen.</p>

<p>『Come on~ Wake up~! It’s boring watching TV alone~!』</p>

<p>The girl’s voice came from my smartphone.</p>
<p>The alarm sound has been changed…. Probably the culprit is the owner of this voice.</p>
<p>──I’ll make Suzufumi my fan!</p>

<p>Yesterday, Yuzuki gently took my hand and declared so.</p>

<p>Fans keep their distance.</p>
<p>Fans do not intrude on their idol’s private life.</p>
<p>Fans don’t make homemade meals or anything like that for their idol.</p>
<p>One of the idol goods is the wake-up voice.</p>
<p>So this is also part of the strategy to captivate me as a ‘fan’.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, there was this exchange right after the declaration of war last night.</p>

<p>『Hey Suzufumi, let’s exchange contact information.』</p>
<p>『Sure…but I still don’t really understand how to use the app.』</p>
<p>『Then I’ll do it for you.』</p>
<p>『Really? That helps. I’ll do the dishes, so here you go, my smartphone.』</p>
<p>『Okay~』</p>

<p>Just before she got up from her seat, I couldn’t help but feel that Yuzuki had a twisted smile on her face.</p>
<p>She must have secretly recorded the wake-up voice while registering her contact information.</p>
<p>I see, it seems she’s serious over there. In that case, I’ll go all out to make her fall for my cooking.</p>

<p>Right now, I’ve already listened to the wake-up voice five times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p>Idols don’t have a spring break. Therefore, Yuzuki’s time at home is inconsistent.</p>
<p>Some days she leaves early in the morning, and on others, she returns home late at night.</p>
<p>Her schedule is filled to the minute with not just work but also singing and dance lessons, meetings, and so on.</p>

<p>That’s precisely why she should take nutrition seriously. The body is an asset, and health starts with the body.</p>
<p>It was just past seven in the evening when the sound of the key turning in the lock of room 810 was heard today.</p>
<p>It was the return of the idol. I timed it appropriately and rang the doorbell of the neighboring room with the meal ready.</p>
<p>After a slight pause, a voice could be heard from the depths of the monitor, ‘…You really came.’</p>
<p>Still, the door is opened.</p>

<p>“Yo, I’ve come to deliver your dinner, Yuzuki.”</p>

<p>I make an effort to sound cheerful.</p>

<p>“…I told you I don’t need it.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s tone is low.</p>
<p>Perhaps she has just come out of the bath; her long black hair is damp, and her cheeks are faintly flushed.</p>
<p>She is dressed casually in a white T-shirt and dolphin shorts.</p>
<p>I’m almost captivated by her legs, but I hastily redirect my gaze.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so stiff. Look, I even went to the trouble of putting it in the Okamochi for you.”</p>

<p>An ‘okamochi’, is a silver square box that often appears in scenes where traditional Chinese restaurants make deliveries.</p>
<p>I borrowed it from the storeroom of our izakaya, which is a turnkey property.</p>

<p>“Hmph, I won’t fall for the same trick twice. I’ve just finished my workout, you know.”</p>

<p>She must have been working out right after getting back from work.</p>
<p>Despite the hard schedule of the day, she probably wants to rest as soon as possible.</p>

<p>“Fifty squats, thirty reps with the ab roller, and three sets of my original shape-up training. I do this every morning and evening——And for the finishing touch, this.”</p>

<p>With a smug chuckle, she pulled out a shaker that was slightly larger than the palm of her hand.</p>

<p>“Protein drink for efficient protein intake. Perfect, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>I sense her strong will. It seems she is aware of my visit and has decided to confront me head-on.</p>

<p>“…you’re not going to tell me that’s what you’re having for dinner, are you?”</p>

<p>As I stared at her while squinting my eyes, Yuzuki concealed her stomach with her hand as if to hide it.</p>

<p>“…With this, yesterday’s pork bowl incident is now ‘even’. I won’t make the same mistake twice.”</p>

<p>With a faint blush on her cheeks, Yuzuki glared back at me fiercely.</p>
<p>Perhaps she intends to offset last night’s calories by being frugal with tonight’s dinner.</p>

<p>Yuzuki opened the lid of the shaker and quickly gulped down the protein.</p>
<p>She stood with her hands on her hips, much like an old man savoring a beer after a bath.</p>

<p>“Phew! That was delicious! Now, Suzufumi, you should quickly go back home.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki makes a shooing motion with her hands.</p>
<p>I can’t just obediently go home after being confronted with such an unbalanced diet.</p>
<p>I slide open the front lid of the Okamochi to reveal its contents.</p>
<p>I’ve removed the board that usually separates the upper and lower sections so that everything can be clearly seen.</p>

<p>“Now, can you still say the same after seeing this…?”</p>

<p>Framing the oval dish is a pure white béchamel sauce.</p>
<p>Within it, a meat sauce asserts its presence just like a mythical continent floating in a lake.</p>
<p>Beneath the red and white sauce lies a golden glow treasure of saffron rice</p>

<p>“Today’s menu is Milanese-style Doria.”</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki steps back, pressing her hand against her stomach.</p>
<p>Even a popular idol who has tasted many expensive dishes should be aware of the allure of Milanese Doria.</p>
<p>It’s the signature menu item of the national Italian restaurant chain and an immovable favorite number one product.</p>
<p>The price range that even middle and high school students can casually afford is also a factor supporting its popularity.</p>

<p>“Look-, it’s handmade from scratch, you know? Wouldn’t you like to try the splendid combination of a rich and smooth béchamel sauce with a meat sauce that’s packed with plenty of beef thigh meat?”</p>
<p>“I’ll Eat——No…!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki puts up a barrier with both palms, determined not to let the image of the Milanese doria reflect on her retina. Her large eyes are tightly shut.</p>

<p>Huh, you think you can resist if you don’t see it?</p>
<p>How naive——</p>

<p>I take out the premium item I had hidden in my left hand.</p>
<p>The item’s true identity is a dairy product in a small packet. I sprinkle the contents and flitter it over the surface.</p>

<p>“This smell… could it be, cheese?”</p>

<p>I flashed a grin.</p>

<p>“I’m going to borrow the kitchen.”</p>
<p>“N-no, you can’t!”</p>

<p>As I march into the kitchen, Yuzuki tries to stop me by spreading her arms wide.</p>
<p>However, I pass through as if breaking through the finish line tape and head towards the back of the kitchen.</p>
<p>Following yesterday’s pattern, I found myself in a woman’s house uninvited again.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not without a sense of guilt, but this is an unquestionably serious battle.</p>
<p>In order to achieve the noble goal of making Yuzuki fall for my cooking, I can’t just stand around politely making conversation.</p>

<p>Now that it’s come to this, I’ll go as far as I can.</p>
<p>In the kitchen, I found a toaster oven on top of the refrigerator. Insert the dish and turn the lever.</p>
<p>The upper part lights up red, sizzling and browning the cheese.</p>

<p>“Ah… Aahhh…”</p>

<p>Attracted by the smell, Yuzuki staggers towards the kitchen. I take her hand and seat her on the cushion in front of the low table.</p>


<p>With the ‘Ding’ sound signaling completion, I opened the oven toaster, and the aroma was instantly released.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but gulp.</p>

<p>I set a trivet on the table and placed the piping hot dish on it.</p>
<p>As if in a final act of resistance, Yuzuki closed her eyes once more.</p>

<p>“Now, take a look with your own eyes?”</p>

<p>I whispered in her ear, and Yuzuki trembled.</p>
<p>Then, she opened her eyes with trepidation——</p>

<p>“Eeeek…”</p>

<p>The red and white sauce bubbled.</p>
<p>The cheeses adorned with just the right amount of char danced on the place.</p>
<p>No one could resist the golden-brown-colored smiles they offered.</p>
<p>The Milanese Doria is a dish that is completed by baking.</p>
<p>Cooking is something to be enjoyed not just with the taste buds but with all five senses.</p>

<p>I gently inserted a spoon into the Doria. A light, crisp sound softly touched my eardrums.</p>
<p>I scooped up the contents and then placed the silver spoon into Yuzuki’s hand.</p>

<p>“Come on, open your mouth.”</p>
<p>“N-no, I don’t want to…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki stretched her arm to the limit, desperately trying to keep the tip of the spoon away, but the fact that she didn’t let go of the spoon meant that she had already given in instinctively.</p>

<p>“The longer you wait, the harder the cheese gets, and it loses its flavor, you know? The Doria is at its most appealing when it’s freshly made.”</p>
<p>“I don’t… want it…”</p>
<p>“Then let me ask you, why are you pursing your lips? It’s as if you’re about to blow on something hot.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…!”</p>

<p>Yuzuki’s ears turned as red as a meat sauce with embarrassment.</p>

<p>“I know. It’s like your body is reacting on its own in front of a piping hot dish. In other words, Yuzuki’s mouth is craving for the Doria.”</p>
<p>“…That’s”</p>
<p>“Let’s take care of your body. You see, this isn’t just a meal. Right, it’s a kind of body care. Just like a face pack after a bath or stretching.”</p>
<p>“R-really… But…”</p>

<p>Her voice is losing its strength, wavering unsteadily.</p>
<p>Now that it’s come this far, just one more push is needed.</p>
<p>I utter the finishing blow.</p>

<p>“I’ve specially increased the amount of cheese than usual for you.”</p>
<p>“~~♥”</p>

<p>The hand gripping the spoon suddenly tightens.</p>
<p>Yuzuki finally cools the surface of the Doria with a gentle blow, then carries the spoon to the fountain of taste.</p>
<p>The moment it entered her mouth, her until-now vacant eyes suddenly lit up.</p>

<p>“——A milky yet sharp white béchamel sauce, tangy tomatoes, beef rich with umami, all gently supported by the saffron rice… Above all, the cheese, whose presence has expanded manifold by being baked…♥”</p>

<p>Her eyes widen even further, and the spoon eagerly seeks the next bite.</p>

<p>“In my mouth, flavors, sounds, and scents unfold one after another, it’s like experiencing a musical…♥”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, the active idol, explains the allure of the Doria from an entertainment perspective.</p>
<p>When I place two types of premium items at the corner of the table, they are instantly snatched away from the side.</p>

<p>One is powdered cheese.</p>
<p>Yuzuki scatters a flurry of powdery snow over the now gooey sauce-covered natural cheese.</p>
<p>The other is chili pepper sauce.</p>
<p>With each shake of the small bottle by Yuzuki, the bright red sauce decorates the canvas.</p>

<p>“The strong meat sauce is mellowed out by the powdered cheese♥ Sprinkling it a second time after a delay, the melted and fluffy textures combine, making it a joy to experience different textures♥ The chili pepper sauce adds a spicy edge to the mellowed Doria, keeping it interesting and enjoyable to eat forever~♥”</p>

<p>I thought the same yesterday, but Yuzuki becomes talkative during meals.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a backlash from usually suppressing her appetite.</p>
<p>Maybe she’s more suited to be a food critic than an idol?</p>

<p>“Saffron rice feels kind of special, doesn’t it? Maybe it’s what they call a ‘feast sensation’? I also love the parts that get crispy because of the toaster♥”</p>

<p>With her hand on her cheek, Yuzuki narrows her eyes in bliss.</p>
<p>Oops, I was so mesmerized watching her that I completely forgot to serve the side dish.</p>

<p>“I got some popcorn shrimp too, wanna eat it?”</p>
<p>“Eat!”</p>

<p>An immediate response. She opens her mouth wide and enjoys them as if they were snacks.</p>

<p>“It’s so light on the mouth, and it disappears in your mouth so quickly that I can’t stop moving my fork♥ The combination with the sweet Aurora sauce is addictive…♥ Hmm, what about this orange sauce over here?”</p>
<p>“It’s an original carrot sauce made with carrots I received as a gift. It’s seasoned with sugar, salt, and olive oil. It’s one of those sauces you can actually eat but with a slight texture that’s still there.”</p>
<p>“Mmm, the crisp texture is interesting. I might get hooked on this sauce too♥”</p>

<p>The mountain of popcorn shrimp dwindled rapidly.</p>
<p>It kind of felt like feeding a pet.</p>



<p>“…But you know, it’s kind of uncomfortable to be stared at so intently from the side…”</p>
<p>“The invincible idol shouldn’t be bothered by a man’s gaze. Or is it that you can’t be an idol in front of me?”</p>
<p>“That’s not truel! Just watch.”</p>

<p>She switched from a fork to a spoon with a determined look on her face.</p>

<p>“Alright, what we have prepared here today is a Milanese-style Doria. Without further ado, let’s dig in right away.”</p>

<p>A mock food critic has begun.</p>
<p>Pretending my gaze is a camera, she exaggeratedly lifts her spoon.</p>
<p>Even while propping up the food, she maintains a cute smile, and up to this point, everything is going smoothly.</p>

<p>However, Yuzuki’s expression instantly collapses as soon as the flavor of the sauce and the saffron rice spreads in her mouth.</p>
<p>Her eyes and mouth were melting away, just like the moment someone surrenders to a secret hot spring.</p>

<p>“I just can’t~. The rice just completely takes all my attention~♥”</p>

<p>To be honest, I don’t know much about the idol Arisu Yuzuki.</p>
<p>Of course, I’ve seen her a few times on TV and the internet, but I’ve never been particularly hooked and lived my life up to this day without any connection to idols.</p>
<p>But now, I can assert that I am utterly captivated by Sasaki Yuzuki.</p>

<p>“Thank you for the meal!”</p>

<p>Because every time I see an empty dish, my heart is filled with happiness.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">☆☆☆</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Ahhh… I did it again…”</p>

<p>Yuzuki grinds her head against the table.</p>
<p>This scene has happened two days in a row now.</p>

<p>“I won’t even open the door for you tomorrow!”</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Who was it again that said ‘You’re always welcome’?”</p>

<p>Yuzuki choked on her words when I said it with a deliberately nasty tone.</p>

<p>“Arisu Yuzuki has to be perfect at all times…”</p>

<p>I asked her as Yuzuki hung her head in dejection.</p>

<p>“Is it really that important to keep being perfect? Yuzuki, I seriously don’t mean to deny your efforts, but taking breaks is important too. This isn’t the stage, and there are no cameras rolling.”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly why. Being perfect on stage is a given, but a true idol is an idol from the moment they wake up in the morning. Every moment you let your guard down, the gap with your rivals widens.”</p>
<p>“That’s——”</p>

<p>‘——absurd’, I couldn’t say that.</p>
<p>In fact, Yuzuki was fully committed to her role as an idol, even when greeting me as I moved in.</p>
<p>Even at home, she was thoroughly an ‘idol’.</p>

<p>“Everyone is working hard every day, aiming for the top in their jobs or dedicating themselves to club activities and studies. But no matter how much it’s for their own sake, people can’t always just look forward. When that happens, idols are the ones who can support everyone. You see, idols are like everyone’s cheerleading squad.”</p>
<p>“Cheerleading squad…”</p>

<p>If there is ‘something’ to which one can purely direct their feelings of ‘liking’——’something’ that lets them forget about work, studies, relationships, and even time, they would surely find great comfort in it.</p>

<p>“…But I’m worried about you, Yuzuki. Don’t you think there’s a limit to everything?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m pushing myself too hard. I just want to continue being perfect in order to fulfill my role… That’s why I can’t afford to keep losing to Suzufumi.”</p>

<p>Before I knew it, Yuzuki had enveloped my right hand in hers.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the atmosphere of the room completely changed.</p>

<p>“──Thank you for today, for doing this for me.”</p>

<p>Her voice was as light as a cotton cloud.</p>
<p>Her smile shone brilliantly like the sun peeking through the gaps in the clouds.</p>
<p>A certain warmth was transmitted through her hands.</p>
<p>Before me, ‘Arisu Yuzuki’ had appeared.</p>
<p>At the sudden physical contact, my heart began to beat rapidly.</p>

<p>“Fufu, you’re getting shy. Cute.”</p>

<p>I’ve said it many times, but I’m not a fan of Arisu Yuzuki.</p>
<p>——But this kind of surprise attack is terrible.</p>

<p>I can feel the sweat slowly forming on the inside of my hands due to the tension.</p>
<p>In a panic, I try to shake her off, but my hands are firmly held by Yuzuki’s.</p>

<p>“I’ll let you go if Suzufumi becomes my fan.”</p>

<p>Her ten delicate white fingers envelop my right hand.</p>
<p>Handshake events are a staple in the idol industry, but the act of shaking hands with a girl in itself is a deviation from everyday life for an ordinary person like me.</p>

<p>“…Suzufumi, let’s quickly forget about it. Being the meal attendant for the girl next door is just a troublesome role.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki puts strength into her hand.</p>
<p>The sweet temptation whispered from her lovely lips slowly erodes my heart.</p>
<p>I want to grasp this hand back right now——</p>
<p>…But I felt like I could never call my relationship with Yuzuki ‘neighbors’ again if I did that.</p>

<p>“…Then, I’ll be Yuzuki’s cheerleader!”</p>

<p>I grab a glass from the table with my left hand and press it against the back of Yuzuki’s hand.</p>

<p>“Cold!”</p>

<p>For a moment, the grip weakens.</p>
<p>I gently released my right hand during that moment and promptly made Yuzuki grasp the glass with the now-free hand.</p>
<p>By the way, the content is homemade lemonade.</p>

<p>Yuzuki pouts with pursed lips, and I, feigning calm, inform her.</p>

<p>“I even have a carrot tart for dessert.”</p>
<p>“…Suzufumi is so stubborn.”</p>

<p>Yuzuki, still with a look of dissatisfaction, sipped the lemonade with a ‘slurp’ through the straw.</p>
