<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; A Cornered Nerd Gamer</h3>

<div class="calibre3"><div class="calibre3">".......It was what happened." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I see." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">After hearing my story, Kasumi-san crosses her arms, closes her eyes, and made an "Mmm" groan.</div>
<div class="calibre3">A few days have already passed since the day when Kiyokawa had declared that she would be monitoring us.</div><div class="calibre3">Today is my day off from school, so I'm coming to visit Rinka's house.</div>

<div class="calibre3">But now that it's already evening, Rinka still hasn't returned from her idol business yet.</div><div class="calibre3">It seems that she has sudden trouble during her morning lesson and will be home late.</div><div class="calibre3">The only people in the house are me, Kasumi-san, and Nonoa-chan. Just the three of us.</div><div class="calibre3">We are sitting on the sofa in the living room, Nonoa-chan humming to herself as she draws on the drawing paper on the table.</div><div class="calibre3">"So you've finally had caught Ayane-chan's attention, huh. She's so serious, you know."</div><div class="calibre3">Kasumi-san says so, somewhat happily.</div><div class="calibre3">I was telling her about the events of the past few days.</div><div class="calibre3">It was started when Kasumi-san said to me, "Kazuto-kun. You look like you're having some kind of trouble. Why don't you just confide to me about it? I'll help you as your big sister". She said so with a gentle tone, so I told her about my interactions with Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">The reason why I confided to her was that I was fed up with being monitored by Kiyokawa.</div><div class="calibre3">I want someone to listen to me.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, I made her promised that she would keep it a secret from Rinka.</div><div class="calibre3">"I, what should I do?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Kasumi-san might be able to give me accurate advice. That's what I'm hoping for.</div><div class="calibre3">However, my expectations are completely betrayed.</div><div class="calibre3">With a very serious expression on her face, Kasumi-san recrosses her hands and then opens her mouth.</div><div class="calibre3">"...... How about adding Ayane-chan as a member of your harem, Kazuto-kun?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"Ooh, that's a good idea, you think I'll say it? I'm not a womanizer, you know." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"I wonder about it. I think Kazuto-kun will be a natural-womanizer who specializes in idols." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"What the h*ck are you talking about, haaa......" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I sigh unreservedly in front of the still incomprehensible Kasumi-san.</div><div class="calibre3">Was this person really listening to me?</div><div class="calibre3">I'm dumbfounded, and I think back to the exchange I had with Kiyokawa that I told her about.</div><div class="calibre3">Day 1</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[Senior Ayanokouji. During today's break, you were talking to Senior Rinka in the hallway of the main school building, weren't you?] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[What's with this sudden chat? I mean, where were you watching us? I didn't see anyone else around.] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[There's no need to talk about it. All I want to talk with you is, your conversation time.] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[Conversation time?] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[Yes. Your conversation lasted 1 minute and 32 seconds. That's long. And too risky. Please limit conversation time in the hallway to 30 seconds or less.] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[That's too strict! You were even measuring the time!] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3">Day 2</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[Senior Ayanokouji. Today, you haven't said that you love Senior Rinka even once, haven't you?] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[......Why do you know it? This's really unpleasant, you know.] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[In today's dance lesson, I noticed that Senior Rinka's movements weren't sharp. When I asked her what happened, she seemed to be worried that Senior Ayanokouji hadn't told her he loved her.] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[I-is that so?] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[You are Senior Rinka's boyfriend, aren't you? Tell her that you love her every single day.] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[......Sorry. I'll be more careful.] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3">Day 3</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[This morning, you were patting Senior Rinka's head, weren't you? Please refrain from excessive contact, and keep your relationship healthy and student-like. Of course, kissing is prohibited until marriage. Holding hands is also limited to 10 seconds.] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[......] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3">Day 4</div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[I've been aware of this for a while, but you're ordering Senior Rinka to act as your wife, aren't you? Please don't attempt any weird play.] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[I didn't order her to do anything! Rinka is acting like a wife on her own initiative!] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[It can't be, can it? If that was really her initiative, she'd already gone off the rails.] (Ayane)</i></div><div class="calibre3"><i class="calibre5">[Just now, you've just made a rude remark of your own senior, you know.] (Kazuto)</i></div><div class="calibre3">In other words, I was being monitored the entire time I was in school.</div><div class="calibre3">Wherever I went in the school, whenever I tried to talk to Rika, I could feel Kiyokawa's eyes on me.</div><div class="calibre3">Recently, even when I'm in the boy's lavatory room, I can feel Kiyokawa's presence.</div><div class="calibre3">I feel like I'm going crazy.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's beyond the realm of a stalker. It's a torture. It's really a torture." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Isn't she just like Rinka?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"Rinka is acting out of goodwill. And she would never do anything that I really dislike." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">But Kiyokawa is different. She might be trying to destroy me.</div><div class="calibre3">Because from Kiyokawa's point of view, I'm nothing more than an obstacle.</div><div class="calibre3">I have deprived the senior whom she respected, and have put Star☆Mines' activity at serious risk......</div><div class="calibre3">The most important problem is that the relation of Rinka and I were almost exposed to other students several times.</div><div class="calibre3">I can understand why Kiyokawa is worried enough to consider monitoring us.</div><div class="calibre3">"......I can understand how Kiyokawa feels." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I wish she will loosen up on the monitoring toward us just a bit more.</div><div class="calibre3">The stress is building up at a Mach pace.</div><div class="calibre3">Of course, we understand that our rash actions have resulted in this. But still, I can't come to convince myself.</div><div class="calibre3">"Okay, okay." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... Kasumi-san?" (Kazuto</div><div class="calibre3">For some reason, she gently pats my head. The soft-touch is comforting.</div><div class="calibre3">When I turn my gaze to Kasumi-san, who is sitting next to me, she has a warm, maternal smile on her face.</div><div class="calibre3">"That's great, Kazuto-kun. Even though you're suffering, but you're also thinking about the other person's situation." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"If you put yourself in Kiyokawa's shoes, you'll understand it. I think my presence is endangering Star☆Mines." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"That's the great point about you, Kazuto-kun. Ordinary boys will only think about themselves." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">She strokes my head while saying that. It's surprisingly pleasant and troubling at the same time.</div><div class="calibre3">"......Are you encouraging me by any chance?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yup. 'Coz my cute little brother is having a hard time....... Ah, do you want me to give you a hug?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, thank you." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"You don't have to be shy. It's a lil bro's duty to be pampered by big sis, you know?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"It's only if we're related by blood, right?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Blood has nothing to do with family ties! Take this~!" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"Hey――――" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">She strokes my head vigorously in a circular motion. I can feel my hair getting messy and rough.</div><div class="calibre3">But I don't feel like resisting and just surrendering myself.</div><div class="calibre3">Eventually, Kasumi-san stops her stroking and speaks to me in a calm voice.</div><div class="calibre3">"Well, you don't have to worry so much about it. It's not like she's trying to break you two up. And I'm sure Ayane-chan will get tired of it soon." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"I, hope so." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Yup. If you take your relationship with Rinka carefully, then Ayane-chan will be convinced, you'll just have to be patient for now." (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"...... I understand." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">I'm convinced by the gentle voice of Kasumi-san.</div><div class="calibre3">Strangely, I feel calm. Is this the receptive power of an older person?</div><div class="calibre3">"Do you want me to talk to her?" (Kasumi)</div><div class="calibre3">"No, thank you. That'll be embarrassing." (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">It'll be a little shameful for a man to rely on his girlfriend's sister to solve the problem.</div><div class="calibre3">When I firmly refuse, Kasumi-san mutters, "I wish my lil bro could be more dependent on me".</div><div class="calibre3">I wonder if she wants a younger brother as well, since she only has younger sisters.</div><div class="calibre3">As I'm thinking about this, I hear the sound of the door opening from the entrance.</div><div class="calibre3">"Ah, Rinka-sis is baack!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">Nonoa-chan immediately stops drawing and runs to the entrance with cute steps.</div><div class="calibre3">I casually glance at the picture left on the table. It's a child's drawing, so it looks messy but cute at the same time.</div><div class="calibre3">The setting is a church wedding, probably. There's a man who looks like me and a girl who looks like Nonoa-chan are wearing wedding clothes and facing each other in front of a priest.</div><div class="calibre3">.......</div><div class="calibre3">I'm not going to say anything. Well, it's a kid's drawing. It's wrong for me to say anything.</div><div class="calibre3">"Help me, Kazuto-bro!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">"Whoaaa!" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">Nonoa-chan, who's supposed to be heading for the entrance, comes back at a great speed and jumps into my chest.</div><div class="calibre3">"Wh-what's wrong?" (Kazuto)</div><div class="calibre3">"Nana-sis and...... A-Ayane-sis is here!" (Nonoa)</div><div class="calibre3">Nonoa-chan pleads to me while being so frightened.</div><div class="calibre3">No matter how I look at, she's frightened of Ayane-sis......no, of Kiyokawa.</div>
