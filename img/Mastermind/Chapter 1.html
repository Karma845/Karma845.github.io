<h2>Chapter 1: Meeting My Younger Sister’s Online Wife In Person</h2>

<p>It was Friday, on the middle of May.</p>



<p>That morning, right after homeroom, the classroom buzzed with more excitement than usual. Today marked the first seat rearrangement of our second year.</p>



<p>Yesterday, our homeroom teacher announced that there would be a raffle for the seat rearrangement, so I prayed at the shrine on the way home from school. It didn&#8217;t matter if it was by the window, in the middle, near the hallway, or at the front or back. I just wanted to be next to the girl I liked—Takase Narumi.</p>



<p>And here came the fateful moment. I nervously drew the lottery—</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice to meet you, Fujisaki-kun&#8221;</p>



<p>And there it was, I successfully secured the seat next to Takase. Thank you, God!</p>



<p>Just for the record, my seat was in the last row of the second column by the window. Takase was on my left. Sunlight streamed in through the window, making her chestnut hair appeared translucent. <em>Is this what they mean by a girl with an ethereal beauty?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Nice to meet you. By the way, how do you know my name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I remember. We were in the same class last year even though we didn&#8217;t interact much. Do you remember my name, Fujisaki-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Takase Narumi, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa, you remembered my full name!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Takase is so cute!</em></p>



<p>For a tall and rugged guy like me, girls who genuinely smile at me were extremely rare. They treated me normally once we got to know each other, but at first encounter, they invariably look scared.</p>



<p>However, right after school started, Takase looked up at me with a smile and said, <em>&#8220;Wow, you&#8217;re tall. So cool!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>In that moment, I fell for her.</p>



<p>A cute girl, even if it was just flattery, calling me &#8216;cool&#8217; with a smile. What guy wouldn&#8217;t fall for that? None, I could confidently say there was none.</p>



<p>It had been a year and one month since I harbored a crush on her. I wasn&#8217;t lucky to get a seat next to her last year, but finally, I had secured the ideal seat. <em>I&#8217;ll make the most of this chance!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Takase, do you know my full name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, um&#8230; just a moment, I&#8217;ll try to guess!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you need a hint?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re offering, sure!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, here&#8217;s a hint. It&#8217;s a name that like the sun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The sun, the sun&#8230;&#8221; Takase murmured while touching her temple with her fingertip, striking a pose like she was Ikkyu-san.<sup data-fn="aa34dd44-a685-458c-bc63-0611f24672db" class="fn"><a href="#aa34dd44-a685-458c-bc63-0611f24672db" id="aa34dd44-a685-458c-bc63-0611f24672db-link">1</a></sup> The sight of her was so cute that I&#8217;d want it as my wallpaper.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Naru-chan, wanna go buy some juice?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I admired the cute figure before me, a girl who was sitting in front of Takase interrupted.</p>



<p>She had a blonde hair with azure eyes. Her name was Momoi. Her question made Takase dropped her cute Ikkyu pose.</p>



<p><em>What&#8217;s with this, Momoi? Do you have any idea how long I&#8217;ve been yearning for more interaction with Takase? It&#8217;s been a year and a month for crying out loud! Can&#8217;t you just go get your own juice? Heck, I&#8217;ll even treat you later if you just let me have this!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;What are you looking at?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then stop staring so intensely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/embed0004_hd.jpg">



<p>It wasn&#8217;t like I was intimidated. It&#8217;s just that&#8230; Momoi was Takase&#8217;s best friend. Even without that, I couldn&#8217;t just boldly retort to a girl in front of my crush.</p>



<p>And seriously, no need for the glare. She really disliked guys, huh?</p>



<p>&#8220;We are playing a guessing game with Fujisaki-kun&#8217;s name now. Do you wanna join, Maho-chi?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Taro, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Haruto.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the most useless information of this year.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi said with a genuine disinterest before leaving the classroom with Takase.</p>



<p>&#8220;Man, Fujisaki, you&#8217;re lucky to talk to Momoi,&#8221; said Yamada as he watched Momoi&#8217;s back with a dreamy expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;We barely had a conversation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just having Momoi talk to you is amazing. How much karma did your accumulate in your past life for this?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If this is the result of karma, I don&#8217;t want to remember my past life.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You really aren&#8217;t interested in Momoi, huh? What&#8217;s happening to your strike zone?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about strike zone. I&#8217;m just not interested.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, I could understand why guys like Yamada were head over heels for Momoi.</p>



<p>After all, she was a half-Japanese blonde with well-endowed figure. She lived in a luxury condo and had excellent athletic skills. However, she wasn&#8217;t a flawless superwoman—she was a bit weak in studies which only added to her cuteness. Furthermore, she was caring and actively reached out to girls who seemed troubled.</p>



<p>However, her kindness was exclusively reserved for girls. If she were friendly with both genders, she&#8217;d attract a swarm of guys but she was notorious for detesting them.</p>



<p>Those who knew Momoi were well aware of her aversion to guys, which was probably why there were no rumors about anyone confessing to her. Or at least, unheard to my ears—there might be someone crying in secret somewhere.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey Fujisaki, let&#8217;s switch seats.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t even ask where my seat is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t matter; my answer is still no.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll treat you to lunch.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I like this seat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, you&#8217;re not interested in Momoi, right? You switched with me last year, what happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing. It&#8217;s just that, you know&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I turned my gaze to the right to disguise my feelings for Takase. </p>



<p>Next to me, a petite girl was resting her head on her desk. She had long black hair tied into twin braids. She was my twin sister, Fujisaki Kotomi.</p>



<p>Yamada grinned as if understanding the situation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, you want to be close to your sister.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that. I&#8217;m not a siscon or anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, sure. But, you know, you can talk to your sister at home anytime. &#8230;Though I can&#8217;t imagine your sister actually talking.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was understandable why Yamada would say that. Kotomi didn&#8217;t speak at school.</p>



<p>She was introverted, shy, a loner, and spent every breaks pretending to be asleep. Perhaps that&#8217;s why even the friendly Momoi ignored her.</p>



<p>She could converse normally with family, and if she behaved with the same energy as at home, she could easily make friends. However, for the past few days, she had been unusually down at home and school which worried me.</p>



<p>I doubted she&#8217;d suddenly being shy around the family, so there must be something on her mind. Maybe she was anxious about her plans to go buy anime goods on Saturday. A few days ago, she worriedly mentioned, <em>&#8220;What if there&#8217;s a typhoon on Saturday?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Even though the forecast for Saturday showed a 0% chance of precipitation, her anxiety probably wouldn&#8217;t disappear since she was bit of a worrywart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Still, it&#8217;s unusual for siblings to be in the same class. Back in junior high, there were also twins but they were in different classes for three years.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Each school probably has different rules for class assignments.&#8221;</p>



<p>I said that to protect Kotomi&#8217;s reputation, but the likely reason was that the teachers were concerned.</p>



<p>Kotomi was extremely shy, and as far as I knew, she never had any friends since elementary school. During the first year, she was so isolated that the homeroom teacher, who was worried about her, assigned her to the same class as me.</p>



<p>I felt bad for the considerate teacher, and seeing my sister&#8217;s lonely figure pained me. But at school, I tried my best not to interfere with her school life.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t being mean. Kotomi asked me to keep my distance. Even though we were siblings, it would attract attention if we were seen together. That&#8217;s why she wanted me to leave her alone.</p>



<p>Despite being twins born on the same day, I was still her older brother.</p>



<p>Moreover, I knew Kotomi desired friends. Therefore, I wanted to be there for my sister, specifically by helping her make friends. If she had them, she could enjoy a happy school life.</p>



<p>Ideally, I&#8217;d like her to become friends with Takase. If I could date Takase and manage to connect her with Kotomi, we could all have a happy school life together.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just&#8230; Takase was an outdoorsy sports girl while Kotomi was an indoor otaku, so whether they&#8217;d hit it off was questionable.</p>



<p>Also—</p>



<p>&#8220;Move, Tanaka. You&#8217;re in the way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh, I&#8217;m Yamada.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what your name is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Being scolded by Momoi upon her returning, Yamada happily retreated. The guys envied him as he walked away.</p>



<p>Even if the friendship plan went well, the issue was Momoi.</p>



<p>Takase and Momoi were close. If the friend plan succeeded, Kotomi would likely interact with Momoi too. Having more friends was a good thing. Although I didn&#8217;t like her, if Momoi could get along with my sister, she was more than welcome.</p>



<p>However, Kotomi could only talk about anime, manga, and games. Even though Momoi was friendly with girls, I doubted she&#8217;d enjoy chatting with Kotomi. If the conversation would quickly shift to fashion or celebrity topics, Kotomi would become a statue and the awkward situation would make her leave the group.</p>



<p>If only Momoi were an otaku, those worries would disappear. But that&#8217;s not the case.</p>



<p>At least, that&#8217;s what I thought at that moment.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Later that night.</p>



<p>I had finished my homework early and delved into my studies.</p>



<p>I wasn&#8217;t particularly fond of studying, and back in junior high, I was more of the type to skip it whenever possible. After school, I&#8217;d gather with friends to chat, casually watch variety shows, or even work out for no reason despite having no one to show off to.</p>



<p>The reason I became interested was solely to go out with Takase.</p>



<p>I happened to overhear that she wasn&#8217;t great with studies. If my intelligence impressed her, she might rely on me when struggling with schoolwork. If we studied together after school, the distance between us would become much closer.</p>



<p>So, here I was, studying. My grades were currently above average. I actively participated in classes by raising my hand to answer questions. But since Takase often dozed off, there was no guarantee she noticed it.</p>



<p>But today, I managed to get the seat next to her. We might end up exchanging answers during the upcoming midterm exams at the end of this month. If I could flaunt a perfect score, it should leave the impression of being smart!</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do this!&#8221;</p>



<p>I slapped my cheeks to inject determination before eagerly started to solve practice problems.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii, are you awake?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was almost 10pm when I heard a soft knock from the door.</p>



<p>After I responded with a &#8220;yeah, I&#8217;m up&#8221;, Kotomi entered my room hesitantly. She seemed to have just taken a bath, her long black hair gleaming. She wore an anime-themed T-shirt and sweatpants.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up at this hour?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, well&#8230;&#8221; Kotomi mumbled while looking down.</p>



<p>She wasn&#8217;t being shy around me; at home, we were just normal siblings despite not having interacted much at school. She stumbled on her words simply because it was hard to bring up the topic. For example—</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you need help with your homework?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no. It&#8217;s not that&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want me to go to the convenience store with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not that either&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there a bug in your room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230; Haru-nii, do you know LoF?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;L, o—what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s short for <em>Life of Farmer</em>.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, is that the online game you play?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s the one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about it, but I don&#8217;t really know much.&#8221;</p>



<p>I vaguely remembered Kotomi mentioning it back in our middle school days. It was a slow-life game where you made a living as a farm owner and you started out with a small farm. You earned money by harvesting crops and selling livestock products, which allowed you to buy new clothes, furnish your house, or even move to a larger farm.</p>



<p>And because it was an online game, you could interact with other farm owners, the players. You could make friends, chat with them, and there was even a marriage feature in it.</p>



<p>Kotomi, despite being shy, didn&#8217;t dislike socializing. The reason she started playing online games in the first place was to make friends. The somewhat hefty monthly fee of 800 yen, which was a significant expense for a middle schooler back then, was covered by our parents mainly because she wanted to have friends.</p>



<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2023/11/embed0005_hd.jpg">



<p>That&#8217;s pretty much all I knew about [Life of Farmer].</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what about that game?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You see, I actually have a wife in LoF.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not a husband?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s a wife. I use a cool male character.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though Kotomi was shy in real life, she managed to get married in an online game. And to another female character, no less. It was surprising, but then again, it wasn&#8217;t like they met face-to-face. If it didn&#8217;t involve direct interaction, she could display enough social skills even to the extent of getting married.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you come here just to announce your in-game marriage?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ve been married for two years now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you&#8217;re not asking for congratulations?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Getting married in a game doesn&#8217;t warrant congratulations. Games are games, and real life is real life. But&#8230;&#8221; she let out a gloomy sigh, &#8220;She didn&#8217;t quite see it that way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She invites me for an offline meeting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230; I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>I understood the situation.</p>



<p>She was afraid of meeting her online game wife in real life. While chatting could be enjoyable, face-to-face meeting posed a different challenge. Despite being in the second year of their in-game marriage, in reality, it was like meeting for the first time, and her shyness would likely come to the forefront.</p>



<p>However, they got along well in the online game. If Kotomi could overcome the barrier of meeting in person, she might make friends in the real world.</p>



<p>But here&#8217;s the thing—Every now and then, I saw news reports about people getting into trouble with someone they met online, and as her brother, I was worried about letting Kotomi go alone. Just like she was pretending to be a man, her partner might be doing the same.</p>



<p>If they found out Kotomi was a high school girl, their attitude could change unexpectedly.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, are you asking me to accompany you to the offline event because you&#8217;re worried about going alone?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I assumed, but it seemed I was wrong. Kotomi shook her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii, I want you to be my stand-in.&#8221;</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stand-in? You mean, I attend the offline meeting in your place?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why me, though?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>She&#8217;s your wife. Go meet her yourself.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because&#8230; I don&#8217;t want Mahorin to hate me. We&#8217;ve already become good friends&#8230; If she hates me&#8230; I absolutely can&#8217;t bear it&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hold on. Before you start whining, tell me the whole story. First off, is this Mahorin your online game wife?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi nodded.</p>



<p>&#8220;And why would I attend the meetup in your place?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because if she finds out I&#8217;m a <em>nenabe</em><sup data-fn="1626d35f-b66a-45fd-9fde-eebfe0946fd6" class="fn"><a href="#1626d35f-b66a-45fd-9fde-eebfe0946fd6" id="1626d35f-b66a-45fd-9fde-eebfe0946fd6-link">1</a></sup>, we might get divorced. Besides, even though I act like an extrovert in the game, I&#8217;m an introvert in real life.”</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to behave the same way in the game and in real life.&#8221;</p>



<p>Humans had multiple faces. Take Momoi as an example. Her behavior towards guys and girls was completely different. Similarly, having different personalities in real life and in a game wasn&#8217;t necessarily odd.</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230; pretending to be an extrovert in the game after showing my true self is impossible. It&#8217;s embarrassing, and it&#8217;ll definitely get awkward.&#8221;</p>



<p>Whether or not the other person cared, if Kotomi proceeded with the meetup, the fun interactions they had so far might not be possible anymore. That was undoubtedly a big issue for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why not just decline the meetup, then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t. If I break the promise, she&#8217;d dislike me. She&#8217;s really looking forward to this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even if it was an unpleasant meetup, Kotomi saying she would participate might be her desperate attempt not to be disliked by Mahorin. Though asking me to be her substitute was questionable, her desire to maintain her connections with a friend was apparent.</p>



<p>For Kotomi, who was usually alone in real life, Mahorin was like a treasure. As her older brother, I wanted to protect that. However&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think this substitute plan will work.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii is outgoing and can talk to strangers just fine, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can talk to them, but the topics you talk with Mahorin-san are mostly anime, manga, and games, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Mahorin is an otaku.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s impossible for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not an otaku. I had no interest in anime, manga, or games. Naturally, I had no knowledge about them. I might know a bit about popular anime like Doraemon, manga like Demon Slayer, or games like Pokémon, but that was the extent of it. I couldn&#8217;t engage in deep otaku discussions like Kotomi.</p>



<p>Despite this, Kotomi looked confident.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be fine. You see, the cafe for the meetup is a collaboration with Driste. So, the only topic will be Driste! Even if your knowledge is superficial, you can manage!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Driste?&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi widened her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dream Stage! It&#8217;s an idol anime! It&#8217;s been aired for two seasons since the summer two years ago, has one OVA, plus three spin-off manga volumes! Oh, but the spin-off is a prequel focused on the producer, so it won&#8217;t be discussed much. Well, if Mahorin does bring it up, just say <em>&#8216;The producer is such a good girl!&#8217;</em> and it should work. So, just watch the anime! Oh, but if you can, listen to all the character songs. They&#8217;re all masterpieces! Also, you should check out all the popular works from the voice actors, especially for the ongoing anime this season! Oh, and about the character designer—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hold on. You lost me around &#8216;<em>has one OVA</em>&#8216;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh, sorry for speaking too fast…”</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure, but what&#8217;s an OVA? Don&#8217;t look at me like &#8216;<em>Wow, you don&#8217;t even know that?</em>&#8216;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry if I came across as superior.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not mad, so don&#8217;t pull a crying face. Anyway, I get it. There&#8217;s a lot to catch up on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Will you be my stand-in?&#8221; Kotomi looked at me with pleading eyes.</p>



<p>To be honest, it was a hassle, but Mahorin-san was an irreplaceable presence for Kotomi. If my sister lost that, she would truly be all alone.</p>



<p>For Kotomi, online games were a sanctuary for her heart. If watching an anime or two helped protect my sister&#8217;s precious haven, then so be it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, fine. I&#8217;ll be your stand-in.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi&#8217;s face lit up as if she had been saved.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you&#8230; I&#8217;m glad I asked Haru-nii!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention it. So, is Driste available for streaming?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is, but I have the Blu-ray so I can lend it to you. It&#8217;s 24 episodes and one OVA, so roughly 11 hours. If you start now, you&#8217;ll just make it in time for the meetup!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Hold on a second!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, did you just say &#8216;<em>just make it in time</em>&#8216;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had a terrible feeling about this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, weren&#8217;t you worried about a typhoon hitting on Saturday?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;And tomorrow is Saturday, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;You&#8217;re not going to say the meetup is tomorrow, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tomorrow!? What time!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;10 AM!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;10 AM!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, but the cafe is in a building near Kinjo Station! Just one train ride, about 10 minutes each way!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Accessibility is not the issue here!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi flinched, &#8220;W-Why are you getting mad?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because you asked at the last minute! Why didn&#8217;t you tell me sooner!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I finally understood how Mom felt when she scolded me for not showing her the printout from school sooner.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, I thought&#8230; there&#8217;d be a typhoon&#8230; and if that happened, the meetup would be canceled&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Throw away that hope now…”</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Haru-nii&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, we&#8217;re wasting time arguing. Just bring the anime already.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Are you really going to be my stand-in?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. I&#8217;ll just make it in time if I start now, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes! Thanks, Haru-nii! I promise Driste is worth it! Eleven hours will fly by! <em>Let&#8217;s Dream Live</em>!&#8221;</p>



<p>With a cheerful bounce in her voice, Kotomi went to get the anime.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">&#8212;</p>



<p>Eleven hours later.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s over&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It was nine in the morning. Somehow, I managed to finish both the Driste main story and the OVA without falling asleep. A sense of accomplishment bubbled up within me, but it wasn&#8217;t enough to ward off sleepiness.</p>



<p>I&#8217;d love to dive into bed right now, but the main event hasn&#8217;t come yet. I was about to engage in some hardcore otaku talk with an unknown net game wife.</p>



<p>&#8220;So tired&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Regardless, I needed some caffeine. When I left the room to chug coffee, Kotomi came out from the next room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Haru-nii,&#8221; she walked over while letting out a yawn. </p>



<p>Kotomi went to sleep right after. Although she acted like she was going to stay up to watch the anime together, I decided to let her sleep. </p>



<p>I saw the anime, but what I gained was just surface-level knowledge. I didn&#8217;t have confidence in keeping up with deep otaku talk. There might be times during the meetup where I needed to leave and ask for advice, and I&#8217;d need Kotomi awake for that.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning. I finished watching.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t skip the ending, did you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The voice actor who sings changes every time, right? As you instructed, I watched it properly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Which episode did you find interesting?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The one that stands out&#8230; let&#8217;s see, maybe episode twelve?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The musical episode! I get it! I love that one too! Though the episode seems like a slice of life, everyone suddenly starts singing out of the blue. It&#8217;s important because they&#8217;re not singing for a live performance, but they sing to express their emotions which brings out their unique personalities! It&#8217;s an essential episode where you understand that the cool Carol actually loves girly songs! The next episode preview is also in a musical style and it&#8217;s hilar—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Don&#8217;t overwhelm me!</em> If Mahorin-san responded with the same intensity, I&#8217;d start to feel anxious.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, who&#8217;s your favorite character, Haru-nii?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I had to choose, probably MioMio.&#8221;</p>



<p>MioMio was what you&#8217;d call a &#8216;young lady.&#8217; Being a sheltered girl, she lacked common sense and her communication skill was a bit unconventional. She was the type to enthusiastically engage with everyone without considering social norms.</p>



<p>Thanks to MioMio, the cool and distant Carol managed to blend in with the group. The scene where she told off a nasty president from a client company with <em>&#8216;So, you were from our subsidiary&#8217;</em> was truly satisfying.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good. It won&#8217;t be a lie, then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A lie?&#8221;</p>



<p>“I’m supposed to be a MioMio&#8217;s fan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. By the way, who&#8217;s Mahorin-san&#8217;s favorite?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She said she loves them all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So I have to keep up with topics about everyone&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>If she started recounting events like &#8216;<em>This character did that at that time,</em> and &#8216;<em>This character did this back then,&#8217;</em> I might end up tongue-tied.</p>



<p>Well, leaving that aside&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;I forgot to ask yesterday, what&#8217;s the name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Haruto.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean your name in the game.&#8221;</p>



<p>If she used her real name, there&#8217;s no way I looked like Kotomi. I could only hope she hadn&#8217;t.</p>



<p>Kotomi blushed slightly and said, &#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s written as Jet Black Yasha (漆黒夜叉), but you pronounce it as [Darkness Dark]?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, people call you [Darkness Dark]?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mahorin calls me &#8216;Jet Black-kun.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p>It was still embarrassing, but the name was slightly better than [Darkness Dark].</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I should get ready soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a sec.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi brought a T-shirt from her room. It was the same oversized T-shirt she was currently wearing with a huge MioMio print.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you bringing pajamas?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not pajamas. I buy these thinking I&#8217;ll wear them outside, but I never muster the courage. So they usually end up as loungewear.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And what do you want me to do with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wear this for today.&#8221;</p>



<p>If she were my little brother, I&#8217;d have smacked her by now.</p>



<p>&#8220;You want me to wear an outfit that even you, the anime enthusiast, hesitates to wear outside?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, Mahorin insisted. She said, &#8216;<em>since it&#8217;s a collaboration cafe, let&#8217;s enjoy it with a Driste-themed outfit as a marker</em>.&#8217; She also said, &#8216;<em>I&#8217;m looking forward to a strong MioMio love in your outfit.&#8217;</em>&#8220;</p>



<p>Indeed, wearing something that even an anime lover would hesitate to wear outside could convey the strength of your devotion.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;What size is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an L.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Guess it&#8217;ll fit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll wear it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve already come this far.&#8221;</p>



<p>Besides, I could avoid stand out if I buttoned up my shirt on the train. And when someone resembling Mahorin showed up, I&#8217;d unbutton it discreetly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks, Haru-nii! Make sure to compliment Mahorin in her Driste outfit too, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. I&#8217;ll change first. Can you prepare coffee, Kotomi?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure thing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Believing in my ability to make the meetup successful, Kotomi confidently descended the stairs without a trace of doubt.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Five minutes before the appointed meeting time, I arrived at Kinjo Station.</p>



<p>The area around the station was dominated by buildings. While there were commercial facilities, Kinjou Town primarily served as a business district. It was far from being a place for students, so I had never wandered around this place.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the meeting spot was right in front of the station. Having double-checked the location on the train, I didn&#8217;t need to worry about getting lost. I should hurry and head there.</p>



<p>I navigated through the crowded street and read the signboard in front of the multipurpose building.</p>



<p>This seven-story building held a variety of establishments, and my destination, the maid cafe, was on the sixth floor. According to Kotomi, this place was an otaku paradise with the other floors having many different stores like anime, manga, card shops, internet cafes, karaoke, and more.</p>



<p>As the elevator ascended to the sixth floor, the maid cafe came into view across the illuminated hallway. There was a lively signboard in front of the store, and posters of Driste characters in maid outfits were plastered on the walls.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, so cute! Too cute! Seriously, they&#8217;re angels! Ai-chan, chu chu! Chihiro-chan, chu~!&#8221;</p>



<p>The enthusiastic voice belonged to someone familiar.</p>



<p>A girl with a model-like figure, confidently displaying and concealing what was necessary, and natural flowing blond hair stood captivated. She wore a knitted dress with long sleeves and an open-shoulder design, revealing her fair skin.</p>



<p>The girl that held a brand bag in her left hand while capturing the posters with her smartphone in her right was Momoi, my classmate.</p>


<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/1000010202.png">


<p><em>Why is Momoi here of all places? This is an otaku&#8217;s paradise! It isn&#8217;t the kind of spot for a popular gal like her!&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Despite my confusion, her unmistakable enthusiasm gave away the answer. Momoi was popular, a gal, and she was also an otaku.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah~ <em>mou</em>! Everyone is too cute! It&#8217;s such a waste that these aren&#8217;t for sale! I&#8217;ll buy them at any price and take them ho—wha!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi froze the moment she laid eyes on me. Her expression turned incredibly awkward. Either she was reconsidering her actions or reflecting on them, her face gradually reddening.</p>



<p>I ignored Momoi and stood in an empty space, waiting for Mahorin to arrive.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>An unpleasant silence hung in the air.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Honestly, I just wanted to go home already.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t care if Momoi thought I was an otaku, but the real issue was her connection to Takase.</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t know what kind of person Mahorin was, but unless she lied about her gender, she was a girl. If Momoi saw me entering a maid cafe with another girl and Takase heard about it, Takase might misunderstand and thought I had a girlfriend.</p>



<p>That would mess up my study plan. If that happened, Takase would refrain from being alone with me and all the effort I had put in would be in vain.</p>



<p>But still, I made a promise with Kotomi. And at this point, I couldn&#8217;t just bail out now, could I?</p>



<p>&#8220;I have a proposal&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A quiet voice reached my ears. Glancing to the side, I saw Momoi looking at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;A proposal?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you&#8230; have business in this cafe?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah&#8230; but you&#8217;re not suggesting I change locations, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked offended, &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t interfere with your business like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then what&#8217;s your proposal?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Promise me this: you won&#8217;t talk about what you see here.&#8221;</p>



<p>That one sentence made it clear what she was suggesting. It was because I shared the same concerns as her.</p>



<p>Momoi was what you&#8217;d call a closet otaku. She might have confided in her close friends, but she had no intention of openly sharing her hobbies, perhaps because she was afraid of ruining her image.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s convenient.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then keep the fact that you saw me a secret too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have anyone to talk about you with, but I&#8217;ll agree to that proposal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Deal.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alright, with this, I could avoid Takase finding out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, I just need to get through the offline meeting. It should be about time for her to arrive&#8230; When I checked my phone, it was already five minutes past our agreed meeting time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, she wasn&#8217;t here.</p>



<p>Ten minutes passed, then fifteen, and Mahorin still hadn&#8217;t shown up.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>And right next to me, Momoi glanced at her wristwatch nervously. She was probably experiencing the same waiting game as me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s precisely why I had a bad feeling about this.</p>



<p>Momoi seemed to share the same premonition and stole a quick glance at my profile. I hoped that wasn&#8217;t the case, but well, that&#8217;s how it was.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh, Momoi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you&#8230; Mahorin?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked shocked.</p>



<p>&#8220;S-So, it&#8217;s true&#8230; You&#8217;re Darkness Dark?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m Jet Black Yasha, a.k.a Darkness Dark.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S-So, it&#8217;s really you&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi seemed conflicted.</p>



<p>Her in-game husband she had been close with turned out to be her classmate. While Momoi was known for disliking guys, considering that she was planning to meet her in-game husband, she probably didn&#8217;t hate all guys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, at least she disliked me. Not just me, but all the guys at school. From this, I could speculate that she disliked boys of our age because they acted childish? I didn&#8217;t want to be labeled as a child by someone who was so ecstatic about posters.</p>



<p>At any rate, I didn&#8217;t want her to hate me. I didn&#8217;t care about being liked by her, but Kotomi would cry if their connection in the game was severed. To avoid that, I needed Momoi to feel like spending time with me was fun. In other words, I just needed to boost her mood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Man, it&#8217;s pretty hot in here.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I said this, I casually unbuttoned my shirt. The moment Momoi saw the oversized T-shirt with MioMio printed on it, her blue eyes sparkled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa~! No way! It&#8217;s MioMio-chan! And the ultra-rare blushing version!? You managed to get it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Her enthusiasm exceeded my expectations. She instantly boosted the atmosphere and I felt relieved.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is my signature look. Pretty cool, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Definitely! So this is what it looks like when you wear it! I have a different version, but it takes courage to wear it outside.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I love MioMio. No need to feel embarrassed as long as there&#8217;s love.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;True, as expected of a big MioMio fan! But my love for her is just as strong.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, she&#8217;s wearing something related to Driste too? Kotomi wanted me to compliment her, that&#8217;s why I had been searching since earlier but&#8230; which one is it?</p>



<p>The knit dress? The branded bag? Or the shoes? None of them seemed very anime-like at first glance.</p>



<p>Or was she recreating a character&#8217;s casual outfit? As far as I knew, none of the characters dressed like her.</p>



<p>Wait, didn&#8217;t Kotomi say Momoi supported all the characters? In that case, maybe—</p>



<p>&#8220;Your nails are amazing.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I complimented her colorful nails, Momoi beamed with pride.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you notice? I painted them to match each member&#8217;s image color! Isn&#8217;t it awesome?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>You could&#8217;ve made it a bit more noticeable.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s seriously impressive. Well done!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you would notice for sure, Jet Black-kun!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a piece of cake. I love Driste, after all. By the way, shouldn&#8217;t we start the offline meeting soon?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked to be having fun, and any awkwardness should be gone now. It would be great if she could keep this mood &#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>



<p>Great. It seemed the doubts had been cleared up. If I could get through this meeting without revealing I was a replacement, Kotomi could continue enjoying her interactions with Mahorin.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope the bonus for visiting the café is MioMio&#8217;s sticker.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You really love MioMio-chan ~ If I win, I&#8217;ll trade her for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks, I appreciate it!”</p>



<p>While navigating through the conversation, we made our way into the cafe. The maid guided us to a table by the wall, handing over the menu along with stickers.</p>



<p>&#8220;All right, I got MioMio! What about you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Chihiro-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, Chihiro-chan is good too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;s tiny and cute. I felt like a parent&nbsp;at nursery school when I saw her live performance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And speaking of Chihiro-chan, isn&#8217;t Ai-chan also small and cute?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look over there, they&#8217;ve got life-size panels next to Noah-chan! It really highlights their height difference! Plus, next to them is Kanade-chan! The staff really know their stuff for placing the kid duo in the center of the parent combo!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Agreed!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, check that out! They&#8217;re anime cutout panels! They even picked the scene where MioMio-chan&#8217;s joke makes Kanade-chan spit out coffee. The staff really get it, huh? Isn&#8217;t that from the Blu-ray version? You know, the one where the color of the coffee was different from the broadcast version. Although it&#8217;s such a subtle change, it makes sense if you looked back. Kanade-chan prefers black coffee, but the broadcast version had coffee with a milk-like color. Oh, speaking of coffee, remember the canned coffee collaboration they did? I usually don&#8217;t like it when unpopular characters get left over, but they treat all Driste&#8217;s characters evenly, so I felt relieved!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was on the verge of a panic. I couldn&#8217;t handle this improvisation.</p>



<p>Anyway, let&#8217;s change the topic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we order soon?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s decide on that first.&#8221;</p>



<p>We both checked the menu. A drink for 800 yen? I wasn&#8217;t sure about the usual prices, but it seemed a bit steep.</p>



<p>&#8220;Have you decided, Mahorin?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just a bit more. How about you, Jet Black-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m good. It&#8217;s easy to decide since I&#8217;m a MioMio fan. But to choose when you&#8217;re a fan of all characters is tough, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Totally. I&#8217;d instantly buy a complete set of goods, but when it comes to foods, well&#8230; I can&#8217;t eat everything. But I do want to spend 4000 yen.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had looked up the benefits on the train. If you ordered for 4000 yen, you got an acrylic stand.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m spending about 2300 yen alone, so with two people, we can easily reach 4000 yen.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, that means we&#8217;ll only get one benefit, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine with that. Of course, I really want it, but seeing Mahorin happy is more important to me.”</p>



<p>I&#8217;d like to wrap this up quickly and head out, so avoiding lingering too long would be ideal. While I played the role of an otaku, I was also supposed to be her husband. Wanting to see my wife&#8217;s happy face shouldn&#8217;t be a negative factor.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, are you a God?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hmm, that might be pushing it a bit too positively. Oh well, it wasn&#8217;t a bad thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks, Jet Black-kun. I&#8217;ll treat you today in return.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need. I&#8217;ll cover my own meal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Strictly speaking, it was Kotomi who would foot the bill.</p>



<p>Momoi thanked me again and after she decided on her order, I called the maid over.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, I&#8217;ll have the &#8216;Chihiro&#8217;s Love Banana Juice&#8217; and the &#8216;Kanade&#8217;s Training Camp Curry,&#8217; please.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go with the &#8216;Mio Mio&#8217;s Special Get Well Soon♪ Nutrient-Packed Special Drink&#8217; and the &#8216;Mio Mio&#8217;s Gorgeous Delicious Omelet Rice.&#8217;&#8221;</p>



<p>The maid said, &#8220;Right away,&#8221; and left. Shortly after, our drinks arrived.</p>



<p>My throat was parched because of nervousness. I took a sip of the special drink—</p>



<p>&#8220;Sour!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hehe, a reenactment from episode eight of the anime.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah, this was the drink from episode eight.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is seriously sour.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s apple vinegar. I&#8217;m not a fan, but Naru-chan loves it and drinks it every day.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Really?</em> If Takase liked it, then I liked it too! I&#8217;d drink apple vinegar in class and use it a conversation starter.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like it, you don&#8217;t have to force yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ll drink it. For MioMio who worked so hard to make it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well done. That line is like something the producer would say!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In the anime, the producer did her best to drink it. She said if she left even a drop, MioMio would be disappointed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s truly—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Too good!&#8221;</p>



<p>I was told that you could get through producer-related conversations by saying, &#8216;<em>She&#8217;s too good</em>.&#8217; So, I tossed that in here.</p>



<p>Upon hearing that, Momoi beamed cheerfully, &#8220;Exactly!&#8221; and continued;</p>



<p>&#8220;And you see, the producer used to aim to be an idol in the past, right? Sasaki-kan, the voice actor, is known for her singing skill, and there was a scene in the manga where she sang, wasn&#8217;t there? If they add vocals to that, it&#8217;d definitely be masterpiece!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And she&#8217;s just too good!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Also, in the second volume, there&#8217;s a bit about her having a past rivalry with the manager from another agency. I wonder what that was about? Jet Black-kun, you must know, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Darn it. &#8220;Too good&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t cut it. In that case—</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. I need to use the restroom real quick.&#8221;</p>



<p>I quickly announced and made my way to the bathroom. After entering a stall, I called Kotomi.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Help, Kotomi. I&#8217;m in trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, did something happen with Mahorin?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not exactly. But the conversation took a turn I can&#8217;t follow. It&#8217;s about the producer, and—&#8221;</p>



<p>I threw Kotomi the same question I received from Momoi earlier. Kotomi responded immediately.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, that. It was covered in the official site&#8217;s four-panel comics. They built a bit of a rivalry in high school because they liked the same person, but it almost turned into a little controversy because of the guy&#8217;s presence. The comic got deleted in about ten minutes. If it weren&#8217;t me, anyone would have missed it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome! Oh, by the way, Haru-nii, what was on the sticker?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s MioMio.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay! Thanks, Haru-nii! Make sure it doesn&#8217;t bend on your way back, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. Also, I&#8217;ll give the acrylic stand to Mahorin.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh!? I want one too—&#8221;</p>



<p>I ended the call and returned to my seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome back. Our food has arrived.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice, they look delicious. Oh, and about that question from earlier, I remembered the details.&#8221;</p>



<p>I relayed the story I heard from Kotomi to Momoi.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s what it was. They&#8217;re quite similar, so their interests in guys might overlap. Thanks, Jet Black-kun. That clears things up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy to help. Well, let&#8217;s dig in while it&#8217;s still warm.&#8221;</p>



<p>I immediately put a forkful of omelet rice into my mouth. It didn&#8217;t exude a luxurious vibe, but it lived up to its &#8220;delicious&#8221; name. At 1500 yen, it didn&#8217;t seem overpriced.</p>



<p>Momoi, who likely enjoyed tasty food regularly, also wore a pleased expression while savoring the dish.</p>



<p>&#8220;This! This is the training camp curry I&#8217;ve been longing for! You see, Kanade-chan is like everyone&#8217;s mom. With Ai-chan and Chihiro-chan around, the curry is naturally on the sweeter side. Feels like we really went on a training camp, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I bet it would taste even better if we had it at the campsite.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d love to go on a journey to those sacred grounds. Oh, and speaking about camps, a test of courage is a must, right? The combination of the little Chihiro-chan and Ai-chan is the absolute best for healing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s tricky when you&#8217;re the one trying to surprise others.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Totally. Though Chihiro-chan doesn&#8217;t like scary things, she acts all mature because her birthday is a month earlier than Ai-chan&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And Ai-chan is completely fine with scary stuff. That contrast was hilarious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Trick or Treat&#8217; scream in the Halloween episode was so funny. Chihiro-chan really pulled off that scream.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That was seriously intense! And even cool Carol flinched, she was so cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know, right? Then the scene where they gave throat lozenges instead of candy cracked me up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the conversation veered into territory I could barely keep up with, I nervously continued with my meal. We almost finished eating simultaneously.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The restaurant was now livelier than when we first arrived. Lunchtime was approaching, and staying longer would likely inconvenience the staff.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, as much as I hate to say it, it&#8217;s about time to head out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. I hope I get that MioMio-chan&#8217;s acrylic stand, though&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you loved all the characters?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah, but after talking with you, I kinda want MioMio-chan too. Can you use the power of love to make it happen?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, I&#8217;ll give it my best shot, but don&#8217;t get your hopes up too much. My luck with draws has been exhausted already.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;True, you did manage to get MioMio-chan&#8217;s sticker, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was actually referring to the fact that I managed to secure the seat next to Takase, but that was a secret that would remain locked within my heart.</p>



<p>We both stood up, settled the bill, and then the maid brought out a lottery box. With a tense expression, Momoi drew a ticket.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s MioMio!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa, this is amazing! I actually won! Thank you so much!&#8221;</p>



<p>After accepting the MioMio acrylic stand from the maid, Momoi beamed with joy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Congratulations.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it really okay for me to have this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s totally fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yay! Thank you so much! I&#8217;ll treasure it!&#8221;</p>



<p>She carefully placed MioMio into what seemed to be a branded bag and we left the maid café. After taking the elevator, we exited the building.</p>



<p>With this, the mission was complete.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Momoi seemed satisfied too, and I had successfully played my part as the substitute. Once the relief set in, drowsiness hit me hard. I wanted to get home quickly and rest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s offline meeting was fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I didn&#8217;t expect it to be Momoi, but I enjoyed our conversation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had fun too! But&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Her cheerful face suddenly darkened.</p>



<p>With an apologetic look, she continued;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re, you know, just an in-game married couple. We behave normally at school, and it&#8217;s impossible for us to have that kind of relationship in real life. Please don&#8217;t misunderstand.&#8221;</p>



<p>In other words, &#8220;Don&#8217;t fall for me.&#8221; I could understand why Momoi would want to make that clear. She was beautiful and our conversation flowed easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I were an ordinary high school boy, I might have developed feelings and misinterpreted the situation.</p>



<p>However, I wasn&#8217;t interested. The one I wanted to date was not Momoi but Takase.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry; I can confidently say I won&#8217;t fall for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely. Sorry, but I genuinely have zero interest.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite saying something that might have offended her, Momoi instead seemed delighted by my words.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good then. Well, see you in the online game!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yup. And I&#8217;d prefer to keep the gaming vibe intact, so let&#8217;s avoid school topics.&#8221;</p>



<p>If Kotomi found out that her online game wife was actually her classmate, and moreover, the glittery type she hated the most, Kotomi might get nervous and their fun otaku talk could turn awkward.</p>



<p>It&#8217;d be better to keep Momoi&#8217;s real identity as Mahorin hidden.</p>



<p>&#8220;I get it. Let&#8217;s continue discussing anime, manga, and games just like before!&#8221;</p>



<p>With a cheerful tone, Momoi who was in high spirits hailed a passing taxi and left.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Having successfully finished the offline meeting, I headed straight home without making any detours.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It had truly been a long day. I really just wanted to dive into bed right now, but first, I needed to report the results to Kotomi.</p>



<p>I went upstairs and knocked on Kotomi&#8217;s door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kotomi! I&#8217;m back!&#8221;</p>



<p>The door creaked open.</p>



<p>Kotomi was still in her pajamas, probably because she had stayed home all day. Her hair was left untied, and even her bedhead remained untouched.</p>



<p>The contrast was stark compared to the stylish girl I saw a while ago. It was amazing how different two otakus could be.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kotomi used to get scared when approached by guys at the anime shop in ninth grade, but her style would be decent if she fixed her posture.</p>



<p>Besides, Momoi was friendly to girls. Even a sloppy girl indifferent to fashion like Kotomi could become friends with Momoi if she knew they shared common interests. I wanted to avoid immediately revealing Mahorin&#8217;s true identity, but I might casually probe whether Kotomi had any intention of becoming friends with her&#8230; online game wife in real life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Haru-nii! How was the offline meetup?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a great success. We had a good time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected from Haru-nii! I knew relying on you was the right choice! Thanks!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No problem. By the way, the total bill was 2,300 yen. Did you leave enough pocket money?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Just a moment&#8230; Here you go, 2,300 yen.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, here&#8217;s this.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I handed over the MioMio sticker, Kotomi&#8217;s eyes sparkled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa! It&#8217;s so cute!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you like it. Take good care of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah! Also, about the acrylic stand—&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I gave it to Mahorin.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You really gave it away. What did you win?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;MioMio.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What!? You won MioMio!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah. While talking to me, Mahorin apparently started wanting MioMio and she was really grateful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; I wanted it too, but well, if Mahorin is happy then it&#8217;s fine,&#8221; With a curious look, she stared at me, &#8220;So, Mahorin is a girl, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, she is.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi sighed in relief, &#8220;Thank goodness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why? Did you really care about her gender?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. If she were a guy, I&#8217;d be nervous. I used a handsome character because I wanted to get along with girls.&#8221;</p>



<p>“Oh, is that why you used a male character?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. I thought if I used an attractive character, girls would come over. Mahorin was the first one to approach me. We chatted and found out we&#8217;re both otakus. Moreover, she liked all the anime I liked then our conversation just clicked.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And did you get married after that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, you can chat without marrying, but when you get married, the chat logs stay as a record of your married life until you get divorced. Chatting with Mahorin was so fun that I wanted to look back on it, so we got married.”</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Anyway, you really have fun while chatting with Mahorin, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah! It&#8217;s so much fun!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi was beaming. This expression was definitely something she wouldn&#8217;t show at school. If chatting alone could bring her so much joy, I could only imagine how much more fun it could be if they became closer in real life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, how about meeting Mahorin in person?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? No, no, no! Absolutely not! It&#8217;s impossible! That&#8217;s why I asked Haru-nii.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know. You&#8217;re embarrassed to talk to her face-to-face, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah&#8230; I can&#8217;t talk without getting nervous unless it&#8217;s through chat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you see, if you actually try talking to her, it might not be as bad as you think. Just like asking for a second serving—you explain the situation and she&#8217;d understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it&#8230;&#8221; Kotomi said weakly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As much as I&#8217;d like her to become friends with Momoi and overcome her shyness, forcing the issue would be unfair.</p>



<p>Moreover, for Kotomi, the online game was her sanctuary—a place for interaction with the first true friend she ever made. Even without meeting in person, she could enjoy happy moments through chats.</p>



<p>While it was for Kotomi&#8217;s sake, pushing her to meet with Mahorin when she wasn&#8217;t ready might be more of a trouble than a favor.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s what you say, then that&#8217;s fine. I&#8217;m going to bed now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Thanks a lot for today, Haru-nii.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome,&#8221; I replied, entering my room and diving onto my bed.</p>
