<h1>Chapter 3: My Younger Sister’s Online Wife Came Over</h1>



<p>It was a late May Saturday night.</p>



<p>The looming midterms were just two days away, I was pushing myself hard by having diligently reviewed the lessons throughout the month. Thanks to my consistent efforts, tackling practice exams felt like a breeze. Every question within the exam scope seemed familiar.</p>



<p>Certainly, I couldn&#8217;t afford to be complacent, but at this rate, achieving an average score of ninety points was practically guaranteed. I&#8217;d definitely enter the top ten for the first time. My goal was to be number one in the class.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be perfect if I can drag Takase into a study session&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t interact much with Takase at school. Although we exchanged greetings since we sat next to each other, Momoi would quickly whisk her away for various reasons – be it to buy juice or go to the restroom.</p>



<p>Naturally, Momoi never approached me. Takase also didn&#8217;t force interactions between us and respected our wish to keep our relationship a secret, allowing us to continue our routine.</p>



<p>Her consideration was appreciated. I was really thankful, but there was no need for her to go out of her way to create opportunities for us to spend time alone on weekends since me and Momoi couldn&#8217;t interact at school. Rather, I&#8217;d prefer another weekend with Takase like the one we did recently.</p>



<p>Takase was a member of the basketball club, and even on weekends, they had club activities. However, our school valued both academics and sports. To ensure studies weren&#8217;t neglected, club practices were scheduled either in the morning or afternoon.</p>



<p>So, on weekends, under the pretext of &#8220;<em>wanting to balance time with friends and a lover,</em>&#8221; I wanted to be included in their group of friends. Unfortunately, Momoi rejected that idea. According to her, she created a scenario that she had already spent so much time with me when her friends were at club activities. This effectively meant she&#8217;d hang out with her friends without me.</p>



<p>In essence, everything remained the same on the surface.</p>



<p>In other words, dating Takase required the same effort as before.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to give it my all!&#8221;</p>



<p>With renewed determination, I continued to tackle the practice exams.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haru-nii, are you awake?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was almost 10pm when I heard a knock along with Kotomi&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m up,&#8221; I replied through the door, and Kotomi entered with a face that seemed on the verge of tears.</p>



<p>It was the third time I&#8217;d seen her like this in a month. I could naturally figure out what it was about.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it related to Mahorin?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes, it&#8217;s about Mahorin&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Another offline meetup?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, it&#8217;s different.&#8221;</p>



<p>A new development, huh? She looked at me with teary eyes, seemingly wanting my help. I initially thought it was another invitation to an offline meeting.</p>



<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think Mahorin hates me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Hated in what way?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just as it sounds&#8230; Recently, Mahorin hasn&#8217;t been logging in at all. I&#8217;m afraid we might have broken up without me knowing&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi was contemplating the possibility of divorce.</p>



<p>In reality, you couldn&#8217;t end a relationship without filing for divorce, but in an online game, all you needed to do was not log in. If you created a new account, you could remarry without your ex finding out.</p>



<p>However&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible.&#8221;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I stated it firmly.</p>



<p>Momoi cherished her time with Kotomi as much as she did with her other friends. Although I hadn&#8217;t seen their chat logs, they seemed to have so much fun discussing otaku topics judging from our conversation at the collab cafe and karaoke. It was unlikely for Momoi to willingly let go of the time spent with her only otaku friend.</p>



<p>Of course, I hadn&#8217;t done anything to make her dislike me. I managed to act as her boyfriend smoothly at the cafe, and I didn&#8217;t act overly familiar at school. Everything was going according to Momoi&#8217;s wishes.</p>



<p>If there was a reason to avoid logging in, it would be the &#8216;awkwardness&#8217; after the kiss on the cheek. Her reaction undoubtedly showed that it was her first. Maybe she felt embarrassed about interacting with me, even in chats, after that.</p>



<p>However, even after the kiss check, we could still talk normally at the cafe. In conclusion, I could confidently say that there was no divorce.</p>



<p>It could be…</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe she&#8217;s just busy, like studying or something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is Mahorin a student?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. She looks young, but I never asked about her age.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had kept details about Mahorin vague. I only told Kotomi that Mahorin was a girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;Regardless, whether you&#8217;re a college student or working, studying is something you do. College students have exams, and even working adults have qualifications exams. Has she ever not logged in for several days?&#8221;</p>



<p>While the schedule might have been different back in middle school, since we attended the same high school, our exam schedule should be aligned. There must be times during exam periods when she didn&#8217;t log in for a few days.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since we got married, even if we didn&#8217;t talk for a while, we chat at least every three days. But she hasn&#8217;t logged in since Sunday night.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sunday night&#8230; that was the day Momoi introduced me to her friends. We managed to deceive them by pretending to be a couple. Even though she enjoyed our otaku talk, she could easily chat with me without logging in. Perhaps she lost her reason to indulge herself in the online game. Still, the most likely reason was that she was busy studying for exams.</p>



<p>The midterm exams lasted for three days, so she should be able to log in by Wednesday.</p>



<p>&#8220;For now, how about focusing on your studies? By the time exams are over, she might just pop back in.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t concentrate&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Seems like Kotomi was too worried to focus on studying.</p>



<p>This was troublesome. Kotomi&#8217;s grades were already poor, and if she dropped any further, she&#8217;d fail.</p>



<p>While there were remedial exams she could take, failing those would mean repeating a year.</p>



<p>The thought of Kotomi, who was shy around people, being tossed in a class with younger students&#8230; just thinking about it made my heart ache.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright. I&#8217;ll give Mahorin a call. So, Kotomi, just relax and focus on your studies. If you end up with remedial exams, you&#8217;ll be too busy to play games, and then Mahorin will be lonely this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah! I&#8217;ll do that! Thanks, Haru-nii!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi left my room with a relieved look on her face, believing that I could handle it. I better contacted Momoi right away to make sure I didn&#8217;t betray my sister&#8217;s trust.</p>



<p>When I called Momoi, she picked up right away.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you log in lately. I got worried and decided to call.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Oh, that. I&#8217;ve been busy studying for exams.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Ah, just as I thought. Kotomi said that they used to chat even during exam periods, but this was her first exams as a second-year. It was around this time that some started thinking about the upcoming entrance exam and decided to focus on studying.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, will your next login be after the exams?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;ll log in on Wednesday night. I want to catch up on the anime I&#8217;ve recorded, so I won&#8217;t stay long. Have you watched it, Haruto-kun?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about anime on the chat. Otherwise, it&#8217;d turn into a long conversation.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;True. I&#8217;m looking forward to our chat then.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Maho-chi, it&#8217;s your turn to use the bath.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>A cute voice interrupted.</p>



<p>This cute voice could only belong to Takase! Was she studying for exams too? <em>Let me join!</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Hm? Maho-chi, are you on the phone? Oh, could it be from Fujisaki-kun!?&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Y-yeah, it&#8217;s him. Haruto-kun says he can&#8217;t sleep without hearing my voice.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Oh, really? That&#8217;s cute. Should I step out to the hallway? I don&#8217;t want to disturb you.&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. He seems satisfied just hearing my voice. Right?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Not yet. Let&#8217;s switch to speaker mode and make a video call.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;To show off that we&#8217;re couple.&#8221;</p>



<p>Doing that would add more realism to our relationship, plus I got to witness Takase in her pajamas. Truly killing two birds with one stone.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Really? You want to see my face that badly? You must really like me.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Momoi seemed to agree with my proposal. The screen quickly switched.</p>



<p>Even though she was about to take a bath, her hair was already silky smooth, as if she just got out of the bath. And beyond her sparkling blond hair, I could see the angelic figure in pajamas.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Hey there, Fujisaki-kun.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Takase. I heard you&#8217;ve been hitting the books with Honey.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Yeah, she&#8217;s been crashing at my place since Monday to help me study.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Since Monday? That&#8217;s impressive.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi was way too kind. She was the type who took good care of her friends, huh? I wonder if she could get along well with my sister.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Maho-chi is super sweet. When I complained about being fed up with makeup tests, she offered to help.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>I overheard that Takase failed two subjects in the final exams of the third term, and one of them got carried over to makeup tests.</p>



<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s the studying going?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I feel like I&#8217;m getting smarter. Especially my English is improving like crazy!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Momoi, being a half-foreigner, must found&nbsp; English a piece of cake.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;I drilled her thoroughly in English, so no worries there. But the trouble is Japanese. I struggle with it too. I scored below fifty in the last exam&#8230;&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay! I got 32 points last time!&#8221;</em></p>



<p>That was a solid failing grade. It was definitely not okay. While I had a dream to be called &#8220;Fujisaki-senpai&#8221; by the girl I liked, I really wanted us to graduate together.</p>



<p><em>&#8220;How did you do in Classical Japanese, Fujisaki-kun?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I scored 94 points in the last final.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Wow, isn&#8217;t that amazing!? Then, then, could you teach Maho-chi and me?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Me!?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Uh, are you busy?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Seeing her disappointed expression, I shook my head so vigorously it felt like my head might come off.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all! If you&#8217;re okay with me, I&#8217;ll teach you!&#8221;</p>



<p>Did they have any idea how much I had dreamed of studying with Takase? If she managed to avoid failing this time, she might rely on me every time there was an exam. I wouldn&#8217;t let this opportunity slip away!</p>



<p><em>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to push yourself.&#8221;</em></p>



<p>Momoi looked kinda unhappy. I understood her feelings. If I went, I&#8217;d have to act like her boyfriend even though it was embarrassing to flirt in front of my crush.</p>



<p>Still, I could go to Takase&#8217;s house. I could enter Takase&#8217;s room. Even if there was a typhoon or a tornado, I&#8217;d definitely visit!</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely going. I want to spend time with Honey.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Aww, you guys are so in love. I&#8217;m totally okay with it. Maho-chi, you&#8217;re cool with it too, right? After all, your boyfriend wants to see you!&#8221;</em></p>



<p><em>&#8220;W-well&#8230; sure. Do you know where Naru-chan&#8217;s house is, Haruto-kun?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;No idea. You can pick me up at the nearest station.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8220;Okay. How about we meet at Aida Station at 10:00?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Got it,&#8221; I replied before ending the call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After reassuring Kotomi about Momoi&#8217;s plan to log in on Wednesday, I decided to get to bed early to avoid oversleeping.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>The next day, Sunday.</p>



<p>Five minutes before our meeting time, Momoi arrived at the front of Aida Station. Whether it was because I stood out or the lack of a crowd at the station, Momoi quickly spotted me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re early today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bad to make people wait. Are we going to walk there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s not far enough to take a taxi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. If you&#8217;re thirsty, I&#8217;ll treat you to a juice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How about buying some ice cream at the convenience store?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need. By the way, why are you being unusually kind? Do you have something to hide or feel guilty about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more like reflecting on my actions. I made us play lovers again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yesterday, I prioritized my feelings because I didn&#8217;t want to miss the opportunity. But after that night, guilt started creeping in. </p>



<p>Momoi had already achieved her goal – introducing me as her boyfriend and deceiving her friends. Yet, here we were, playing fake lovers again. I thought I would be scolded, and honestly, I should be the one who said, <em>&#8220;Why are you being unusually kind?&#8221;</em></p>



<p>&#8220;True, I thought yesterday, &#8216;<em>What&#8217;s he thinking?</em>&#8216; But the root cause is that I lied about having a boyfriend. So, I&#8217;m not blaming you. If anything, I want to thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank me? Did you want to flirt with me again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, not that. Like I said yesterday, I&#8217;m really bad at classical Japanese.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that can&#8217;t be helped. You lived abroad until entering middle school, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In England. My dad&#8217;s Japanese, so it&#8217;s not like I wasn&#8217;t familiar with Japanese. But we mostly spoke English over there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s actually amazing. You must have put in real effort to become fluent in Japanese.”</p>



<p>Momoi gave an awkward, shy smile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought I wouldn&#8217;t be able make friends if we couldn&#8217;t communicate. But it&#8217;s not like I put in much effort. I picked up words naturally from watching anime. There are still words I don&#8217;t know, and I&#8217;m not only bad at Classical Japanese but modern literature too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re not failing, right? It&#8217;s impressive considering that you only started learning in middle school.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I honestly praised her, Momoi stared at me with a slightly damp expression</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been praising me strangely for a while now. Are you worried I might scold you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m genuinely impressed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. You&#8217;re unexpectedly nice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That &#8216;unexpectedly&#8217; isn&#8217;t necessary.&#8221;</p>



<p>I get why she&#8217;d feel that way.</p>



<p>Even at the clothing store, I was pointed out for having a personality that&#8217;s &#8220;completely different in real life and online.&#8221; Until recently, I had interacted with Momoi naturally while thinking she was a cold and unpleasant person, except for when we were engrossed in otaku talk. Even though I avoided saying or doing things that could make her dislike me for the sake of my sister, I hadn&#8217;t consciously tried to be kind.</p>



<p>However, Momoi wasn&#8217;t a bad person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite still being cold toward guys at school, she wasn&#8217;t hurling insults. She was genuinely cared for her friends. It made sense why she was admired by Takase and the others. I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to act coldly toward a girl who showed such kindness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I struggle with it, but it&#8217;s not to the point of failing. If it&#8217;s just me, I can manage, but&#8230; it&#8217;s not at a level where I can teach others. So, I appreciate your help. Thanks to you, Naru-chan can avoid failing.&#8221;</p>



<p>She prioritized Takase&#8217;s grades over the embarrassment of playing lovers. She really cared about her friends.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If only Momoi could become friends with Kotomi, I&#8217;d be relieved as her brother. But Kotomi didn&#8217;t get along well with gyaru types. She even felt nervous around the ordinary girl like Aoki, and ultimately declined to join the photography enthusiast group.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best to meet your expectations. So, is Takase&#8217;s house nearby?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About a five-minute walk from here.&#8221;</p>



<p>I followed Momoi as she started walking, and we entered a quiet residential area.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, is Takase&#8217;s family at home?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They went for a drive since it&#8217;s sunny today. They should be back in the evening. Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just thinking it might surprise them if a guy suddenly shows up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean, you&#8217;re afraid to be mistaken as their daughter&#8217;s boyfriend? If you explain the situation, there won&#8217;t be any misunderstandings. In fact, they will even be grateful that someone helping their daughter study.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good then.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even so, I&#8217;d rather not meet Takase&#8217;s parents if I could help it. If they saw me getting along with Momoi, they might assume we were dating.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I eventually wanted to be Takase&#8217;s boyfriend, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;d rather not be seen as someone who changed their lovers frequently. If they were coming home in the evening, I should leave before that.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi stopped, and though it was just an ordinary house, it looked like a castle where a princess resided in my eyes.</p>



<p>Following Momoi inside, I nervously headed upstairs. Finally, we arrived at Takase&#8217;s room.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m back!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to bother&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a simple room dominated by white. A corkboard displayed photos from childhood to the present. A message board, probably from her underclassmen, adorned the study desk. A mini basketball hoop hung near the ceiling, and study materials were scattered on the table.</p>



<p>And in the center of the room was an angel.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome, Fujisaki-kun! Please, have a seat!&#8221;</p>



<p>Prompted by Takase&#8217;s smile, I settled on a cushion.</p>



<p><em>Whoa, I&#8217;m in the room of the girl I like right now&#8230;</em></p>



<p>Takase sat across from me, and Momoi took a seat next to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Why are you sitting there, Maho-chi?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? Oh, it&#8217;s just a habit. Haruto-kun, is it okay if I sit next to you?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I nodded, Takase spoke with a warm smile, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be polite, Maho-chi. You&#8217;ve mentioned how you like sitting on your boyfriend&#8217;s lap, right?”</p>



<p>Momoi fidgeted nervously.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, um, did I mention that? But, wouldn&#8217;t you feel uncomfortable if we did that, Naru-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not at all! I&#8217;d actually prefer you not to hold back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-Right. So, um, is it okay if I sit on your lap, Haruto-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yeah. You can sit like you always do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-then, just for a moment&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi, with a mix of apprehension, settled onto my thigh.</p>



<p>Damn, her butt was way too soft. Moreover, her blonde hair was so close that I could smell her shampoo. Through our clothes, I was able to feel the softness of her skin and warmth. It made my heart race naturally.</p>



<p>&#8220;A-am I, uh, not too heavy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not heavy, but&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps catching the unspoken message of &#8220;<em>Let&#8217;s stop because it&#8217;s embarrassing</em>,&#8221; Momoi tried to lift her hips, however—</p>



<p>&#8220;Fujisaki-kun, don&#8217;t you always hug her when you&#8217;re in that position?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>W-What&#8230;?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, honey. Did you really have to spill everything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;S-Sorry, Haruto-kun. I just couldn&#8217;t resist bragging a little.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a big deal, but showing a hug is a bit too much, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yeah, I guess. But since we&#8217;ve come this far, can we do it just for a moment?&#8221;</p>



<p>Was this really okay? It was like inviting more trouble.</p>



<p>Well, if we showcased a bit of couple-like behavior upfront, we could keep the rest low-key without raising suspicion.</p>



<p>Momoi had made up her mind. Even if hugging her was more embarrassing than the kiss in check, I had to play along since we were supposed to be dating.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, just for a moment&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Trying not to convey any tension, I smoothly wrapped my arms around her back. Her delicate body fit perfectly into mine. Though I tried to avoid touching her chest, the sensation was soft and elastic. <em>My arms&#8230; are resting on her chest.</em></p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t see her expression, but her ears were turning red. Even Takase, who encouraged the hug, blushed faintly after witnessing her classmates&#8217; hug.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa, you&#8217;re so lovey-dovey&#8230; this is what couples do, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for other couples, but we do it quite often. Though, of course, not during study sessions.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. We just sit normally when it&#8217;s study time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly. Since our goal today is studying, let&#8217;s sit like we normally would.&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying that quickly, Momoi moved to sit next to me. Even though our bodies were now apart, her scent still lingered.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My heart was still pounding, but Momoi was right. Our purpose was to study. I needed to concentrate to prevent Takase from failing.</p>



<p>Regaining my composure, I pulled out some printouts from my bag and handed them to the two.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A self-made problem set. If you master these, you can avoid failing at least.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You made this for us?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just happen to wake up early.&#8221;</p>



<p>I woke up at five today, too excited about the day. The classical literature teacher was the same as in the first year, and knowing the pattern, I compiled potential exam questions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fujisaki-kun, you&#8217;re really kind.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks a lot, Haruto-kun. This will be a huge help.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No problem. Now, go ahead and solve them. I&#8217;ll set the timer for about 45 minutes.&#8221;</p>



<p>After setting the timer, both of them began solving the problems with serious expressions. Meanwhile, I attempted to review math, but&#8230;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t forget the sensation from before, making me not able to focus at all.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Later on, after finishing grading the self-made problem set, going through the explanations, and having them tackle similar problems with subsequent explanations, two hours had passed.</p>



<p>It was already lunchtime. Since I was at Takase&#8217;s house, I&#8217;d love to enjoy some homemade cooking if possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of which, what should we do for lunch?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We could get delivery, but honestly, Fujisaki-kun, you&#8217;d probably prefer Maho-chi&#8217;s homemade cooking, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh? My cooking?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Fujisaki-kun would want to eat that too, right?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>This is bad</em>. Looks like the flow was heading towards eating Momoi&#8217;s homemade cooking. I needed to steer it back to Takase&#8217;s cooking.</p>



<p>&#8220;While I&#8217;d love to try her cooking, she doesn&#8217;t know the kitchen here, right? Maybe Takase should handle it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s definitely better that way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But, you see, I&#8217;m not really good at cooking. By the way, Fujisaki-kun, how hungry are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m on the brink of starvation.&#8221;</p>



<p>I exaggerated a bit, hoping she&#8217;d make a lot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Maho-chi and I will cook then. We can make more that way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pay, so why don&#8217;t we just order the foods?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi didn&#8217;t seem keen on cooking. Maybe because it was a time constraint. However, the vote was two-to-one in favor of home cooking. I&#8217;d teach her more later if she wanted to keep studying, so she should gracefully back down now.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s cook for a change of pace.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I mean&#8230; you know, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, Momoi glanced at me, and Takase smiled at her reassuringly.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. Fujisaki-kun, feel free to do whatever you like! Come on, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi, despite her lack of enthusiasm, let Takase guided her out of the room.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..”</p>



<p>Left alone in the room, I was told I could do as I pleased, but I couldn&#8217;t move around recklessly. If I touched anything in the room, I&#8217;d be stamped as a pervert. <em>Let&#8217;s just study quietly.</em></p>



<p>I started working on a math problem set.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can come down now!&#8221;</p>



<p>Takase&#8217;s voice from downstairs came after about an hour. It took quite some time, probably because she mentioned she wasn&#8217;t good at cooking.</p>



<p>I descended to the first floor, following the aroma to the dining area.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the four-seater table, there were Napolitan and Fried Rice with our individual plates. Rather than cooperating to make two dishes, it looked like each person made their own.</p>



<p>It was clear at a first glance who made which dish. Though there was nothing special about Napolitan, the fried rice looked mushy. The vegetables were roughly chopped, and it was questionable if they were cooked properly.</p>



<p>This was indeed the kind of meal someone not skilled at cooking would make&#8230; Was this Takase&#8217;s homemade dish?</p>



<p>Though she must really bad with cooking, I was happy that she worked hard to make it.</p>



<p>&#8220;They look delicious! Can I start eating?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go ahead, eat as much as you like.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Great!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was loading my plate with fried rice, I noticed a clouded expression on Momoi&#8217;s face.</p>



<p><em>Come on, don&#8217;t make that face. It&#8217;s not like I avoided the Napolitan because it looks less tasty. I&#8217;ll enjoy it later.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Itadakimasu</em>!&#8221;</p>



<p>I clasped my hands and took a big bite of the Fried Rice</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmgh!?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>What&#8217;s this!? Is this really fried rice!?</em> I couldn&#8217;t taste the salt, pepper, or soy sauce at all! Not only that, the rice was way too mushy, the carrots were unnaturally hard, and thanks to the thick cuts, you could really taste the bitterness of the bell peppers!</p>



<p>I felt like I was going to get a stomachache. My instincts were warning me, &#8220;<em>Don&#8217;t eat more</em>.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this was Takase&#8217;s home-made dish, which I had been dreaming of. I couldn&#8217;t waste it. I didn&#8217;t want to see a disappointed expression on Takase&#8217;s face. If this was her cooking, I&#8217;d accept it with open arms!</p>



<p>&#8220;How is it? The fried rice is delicious, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad! Eat as much as you want!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;m gonna finish it all!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though this would surely wreck my stomach, it was all for Takase&#8217;s happiness. I gobbled down the mushy fried rice while sweating profusely.</p>



<p>&#8220;So good! Seriously, it&#8217;s so good!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-Is it really that good?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Best thing I&#8217;ve ever eaten! I&#8217;d eat it every day if I could! Ah, so tasty!&#8221;</p>



<p>While Takase and Momoi enjoyed the Napolitan, I single-handedly finished the mountain of fried rice. My stomach was definitely full, but I couldn&#8217;t neglect the Napolitan for Momoi&#8217;s sake.</p>



<p>Since there wasn&#8217;t a single portion of Napolitan left, I opted to eat it directly from the large plate. When I took a bite, I could taste the gentle flavor of ketchup.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks for the meal. Ah, that was delicious!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fujisaki-kun, you ate a lot. Which one did you like better, the fried rice or the Napolitan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The fried rice.&#8221;</p>



<p>I replied instantly. Even though Momoi and I were supposed to be dating, and it&#8217;d be more wise to compliment her cooking, the chef of each dish hadn&#8217;t been revealed yet. There was no harm in not praising the Napolitan for now.</p>



<p>Above all, this was a chance to boost my favorability. Takase wore a pleased smile and—</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected of a couple!&#8221;</p>



<p><em>&#8230;Huh, a couple?</em></p>



<p>To confirm my suspicions, I glanced at Momoi, who blushed shyly while fiddling with the ends of her hair.</p>



<p>&#8220;S-so, you really like my cooking&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;This is yours?”</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m really terrible at cooking. Even today, I couldn&#8217;t make the fried rice taste good&#8230; But I didn&#8217;t expect to see you enjoy it so much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you, didn&#8217;t I? Fujisaki-kun would definitely love your cooking. After all, he&#8217;s your boyfriend!&#8221;</p>



<p>Wait, what? Did Momoi make this fried rice? Then, did Takase cook this Napolitan!? What on earth&#8230; It&#8217;s not like I assumed Momoi was good at cooking, but I thought she was better than Takase who claimed to be bad at it&#8230; Could it be that she was just being modest?</p>



<p>&#8220;My bad, Takase. I couldn&#8217;t eat much Napolitan. It was just delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fine, really. I&#8217;m just glad you enjoyed the fried rice. Maho-chi has always been worried about her cooking skill. So seeing Fujisaki-kun happily ate it made me really happy!&#8221;</p>



<p>Not only Momoi but also Takase looked happy to hear that her friend&#8217;s cooking had been praised. I was able to make them both happy, so I guess it was all good.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, where&#8217;s the toilet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Over there.&#8221;</p>



<p>My stomach was at its limit. I rushed to the bathroom and, upon returning to the dining area, found that they had already cleaned up the table.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for not helping. All I did was eat.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No problem. It&#8217;s a thank you for helping us with the studies. Well, shall we call it a day?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, already?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks to you, it looks like I can avoid getting a failing grade. And sorry for monopolizing Maho-chi all this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;m just going to relax when I get home anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I feel bad. And Maho-chi, thanks for everything since Monday. I&#8217;m gonna get the best grade ever!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, good luck&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed we were really gonna leave. I wish I could stay a bit longer at Takase&#8217;s place, but staying too long could lead to an awkward encounter with her family.</p>



<p>&#8220;See you at school, then!”</p>



<p>After gathering our study materials and bidding farewell to Takase, Momoi and I stepped outside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we casually walked for Aida Station, Momoi timidly initiated a conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, was what you said earlier true?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Earlier?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The one about just going home and relaxing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the plan.&#8221;</p>



<p>My stomach still wasn&#8217;t feeling good. I intended to lounge on my bed for a while, do some light studying in the evening, and call it a night early.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, is it okay if I come over to your place now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To my place? For studying?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope. I want you to show me that &#8216;Maison de Night&#8217; OVA we talked about before.&#8221;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s that? Maison de Night? If it was an OVA, it must be an anime, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;R-Right, Maison de Night. Don&#8217;t you have one of your own?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have it. Actually, I&#8217;m surprised you have one. I&#8217;d buy it in a heartbeat if it were up for sale, but with the limited production and no one letting go of their copies, it&#8217;s tough to get them. It doesn&#8217;t have to be today, but since we&#8217;re together, I thought it&#8217;d be fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if you want to see it that much&#8230; I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>While there was some risk involved, if she just wanted to watch anime, she wouldn&#8217;t notice that I was just a stand-in. Even if we would discuss it later, as long as it was about an anime we had watched together, it should be fine.</p>



<p>Most importantly, having Momoi at my place was an opportunity. If I could smoothly drag Kotomi into this viewing party, maybe they could become friends.</p>



<p>But there was one thing that bothered me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you resistant to coming to my place?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why would I?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because, you&#8217;re not exactly fond of guys, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>If she was forcing herself to do this just for the anime, I could ask Kotomi to lend it to her. It might strain my relationship with Kotomi, but reducing the risk of getting exposed was more important.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t particularly dislike guys.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? If you don&#8217;t dislike guys, why act cold towards them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I&#8217;m cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>All of sudden, she praised herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you saying you treat guys coldly because you&#8217;re cute?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Exactly, though saying it like that could be misleading. You see, Haruto-kun is a bit of a special case, but in general, when cute girls are kind to guys, they tend to develop feelings, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I guess so.&#8221;</p>



<p>I, too, had fallen for a cute girl who smiled and talked to me. If the order were different—if it were Momoi being kind to me instead of Takase—I might have fallen for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I make an effort to keep my distance. If I&#8217;m too nice like I was in middle school, guys get the wrong idea and confess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you just reject them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it were just one or two, that would be fine. But it&#8217;s not as simple as rejecting someone hitting on you. Plus, other girls get jealous if a lot of guys confess. Especially when you reject a guy who has a fan club.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi said with a melancholic tone. I wouldn&#8217;t pry into the details since it didn&#8217;t sound like a pleasant story, but I could guess what happened.</p>



<p>Whether it was light or severe, Momoi had been bullied by girls who were jealous. That&#8217;s probably why, to ensure a happy high school life and prevent a repeat of the past, she maintained a cold attitude toward guys as a form of self-defense.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. I didn&#8217;t know the circumstances, and I thought you were just being unfriendly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;d rather have you think that way. And don&#8217;t worry about my attitude at school, okay? I don&#8217;t dislike you. In fact, there&#8217;s no guy I dislike.&#8221;</p>



<p>A guy hearing this would probably be overjoyed. Some of them might even confess if they found out. But since no other guy besides me heard these words, it didn&#8217;t matter.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, even though I don&#8217;t dislike them, I still hesitate to go to a guy&#8217;s house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why come to mine?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because a friend&#8217;s house is different.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Friend?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think of you as a friend. Or&#8230; is it different for you, Haruto-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi looked at me with an anxious expression.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t solely for that reason, but I shook my head</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not different. We&#8217;re friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though I used to think she was unpleasant, things had changed now. I came to like her enough to accept being called friends.</p>



<p>I just hoped Kotomi would feel the same way.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Around 3:00 PM, I arrived home with Momoi. I&#8217;d love to just let her in, but first, I needed to buy time to convince Kotomi. </p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tidy up the room, so wait a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind it being messy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to bring a girl into a messy room. It could be dangerous if you trip and get hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not that clumsy. Well, I appreciate your concern. I&#8217;ll wait then, just hurry up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. I&#8217;ll be quick. It&#8217;s hot in here, you could wait in the garage if you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, how thoughtful. Sure, I&#8217;ll do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Leaving Momoi in the garage, I entered the house which was eerily quiet. My parents had been out at my Grandma&#8217;s house since morning. We were told to order dinner, and they wouldn&#8217;t be back until around 8:00 PM. This meant I could have a girl over without getting caught.</p>



<p>Heading upstairs, I knocked on Kotomi&#8217;s door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Kotomi!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I talk to you? It&#8217;ll be quick.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-wait a sec.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Why does she sound so flustered? </em>Just as I was feeling suspicious, Kotomi came out. She must had been at home all this time, as she was still in her pajamas.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-what is it, Haru-nii?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got something to talk about&#8230; Were you playing a game?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Game!? The day before exams!? Me, who got scolded by Dad this morning with &#8216;<em>If your grades drop any further, I&#8217;ll cut your allowance</em>&#8216;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her voice was high-pitched, and her eyes were darting around. Given her reaction, she must had been playing games until just now.&nbsp;</p>



<p>She got the lowest ranking on the final exam in the third semester. Even though she promised Dad to refrain from games before exams, she easily broke that promise when not being watched.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t get mad now if you tell the truth.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh, fine, I was playing a game&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi admitted it immediately. In a way, she was an honest one.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, keep this a secret from Dad&#8230; he&#8217;ll be furious if he finds out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll keep this a secret but make sure to study. You&#8217;ll end up with a failing grade otherwise. You don&#8217;t want to take makeup tests, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t, but&#8230; Honestly, I did try study! I just couldn&#8217;t understand anything. That&#8217;s why I decided to take a break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How long have you been taking this &#8216;break&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since 10:00.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right when I left the house!&#8221;</p>



<p>That wasn&#8217;t a break; it was more like escaping reality.</p>



<p>&#8220;But, you see, I can&#8217;t figure it out on my own&#8230; Haru-nii, please teach me.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was an usual scene for Kotomi to come crying for help right before exams. I knew it would happen, so teaching her wasn&#8217;t a big deal. But I couldn&#8217;t do it right away.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll teach you later. In return, show me the Maison de Night OVA.&#8221;</p>



<p>The moment I mentioned the anime title, Kotomi&#8217;s eyes lit up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh!? Maison de Night!? Haru-nii, are you interested!? Want to watch it together!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course! Maison de Night was originally a game, but thanks to crowdfunding, it got an anime adaptation last year! If you supported it with 30,000 yen, you&#8217;d get the OVA as a reward! I haven&#8217;t played the game, but I love the manga adaptation. When I saw the crowdfunding announcement, I immediately contributed! I&#8217;m so satisfied with the result! It encapsulates Miko-chan&#8217;s charm in just 15 minutes! But, wait, I shouldn&#8217;t spoil it before you watch! Hold on, I&#8217;ll show you now!&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi was all hyped up about the unexpected anime discussion. She grabbed the OVA from her anime shelf excitedly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The package featured a blonde gal looking at us with a melancholic expression. Judging by Kotomi&#8217;s description, she must be Miko-chan. From the title and visuals, it seemed like a romance set in an apartment?</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you&#8217;re a fan of Maison de Night, Kotomi?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A huge fan!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How about watching it together?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go, let&#8217;s go!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With Momoi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;M-mo-mo-momoi-san!?&#8221;</p>



<p>She was way too flustered. There was really no need to step back. <em>Oh well, there she goes, tripping without even looking behind.</em></p>



<p>&#8220;When exams are over, clean up your room. It&#8217;s too messy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;M-More importantly, why Momoi-san!? Are you saying she&#8217;s going to come over?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s already in front of the house.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In front of the house!? T-that Momoi-san? But why&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>That was a valid question. Momoi was famous for disliking guys. To imagine her getting along with me would be quite a stretch for anyone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I explained that Mahorin was actually Momoi, she&#8217;d understand instantly, but she wasn&#8217;t fond of glamorous girls, especially gal types. In the worst-case scenario, she might get so overwhelmed that she couldn&#8217;t even chat.</p>



<p>If things went well, they could become friends in real life, but if it failed, my sister would lose her emotional support. I shouldn&#8217;t be impatient. I should observe the situation first by starting with Momoi being an otaku.</p>



<p>&#8220;Keep this between us, but Momoi and I are friends. She also likes anime. So, when I heard she wanted to watch the Maison de Night OVA, I thought you might have it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;E-even so, I don&#8217;t see why I need to watch it with her&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be more fun if fellow otakus watch together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t have fun&#8230; It&#8217;d make me nervous.&#8221;</p>



<p>Kotomi seemed to really hate the idea. I knew she had an aversion to popular girls like Momoi, but she didn&#8217;t need to reject her so strongly. Momoi was genuinely a good person.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a golden opportunity to make an otaku friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m fine. I have Mahorin.&#8221;</p>



<p>Mahorin was Momoi, but if I revealed that now, perhaps she&#8217;d start disliking Mahorin too. I couldn&#8217;t keep Momoi waiting forever, I might as well give up for today.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, I&#8217;ll watch the anime with Momoi alone. Also, keep Momoi being an otaku a secret, alright?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t tell anyone. There&#8217;s no one to tell anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>No one to tell, huh&#8230; That&#8217;s hard when it came to trust.</em></p>



<p>Putting the OVA borrowed from Kotomi in my room, I went outside to pick up Momoi. After guiding her to my room, I noticed her glancing around.</p>



<p>Uh-oh. Did she get suspicious because my room wasn&#8217;t tidy? It wasn&#8217;t as bad as Kotomi&#8217;s room, but it was still a bit cluttered after cleaning up…</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, do you have any merchandise?&#8221;</p>



<p>Oh, right! I forgot. I was supposed to be a hardcore otaku. It must have looked weird not having figures or posters in my room.</p>



<p>I did have a manga series on world-renowned figures, but that wouldn&#8217;t be enough to fool her, right?</p>



<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you have any merchandise?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-well, you see&#8230; there&#8217;s just too much, so I display it in a separate room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I see. It&#8217;s impressive that you have so much it won&#8217;t fit in your room. Can you show me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh, how about another time? More importantly, look at this, this right here.&#8221;</p>



<p>I tried to distract Momoi by showing her Maison de Night. Her eyes sparkled like a child&#8217;s.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whoa, amazing! You really have it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I got it through crowdfunding.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so cool! I&#8217;d have definitely supported it if I knew beforehand. I found out about Maison de Night after it got an anime adaptation. It was so interesting that I wanted to see the OVA, but it&#8217;s not on the market and I didn&#8217;t want to let it go. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m so excited today! I love Miko-chan, so I&#8217;m looking forward to it. Haruto-kun, your top pick is Miko-chan too, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yeah, of course. Miko-chan is seriously cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know! But it&#8217;s kind of rare for someone with a little sister to love a little sister character.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>Miko-chan is a little sister!?</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I mean, Miko-chan is exceptionally cute. It&#8217;s definitely not because I&#8217;m a siscon, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I get it. Anime is anime, and reality is reality. By the way, Haruto-kun, who&#8217;s your second favorite after Miko-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p><em>I only know Miko-chan!</em></p>



<p>&#8220;U-Um&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to choose. They&#8217;re all cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know! Everyone is cute in their own way! But Miko-chan is still the cutest! That&#8217;s why I was so excited to watch the OVA. I knew it was going to focus on Miko-chan, but I avoided looking up the details to avoid spoilers. Now, I finally know what it&#8217;s about. I can&#8217;t wait!”</p>



<p>&#8220;This OVA encapsulates Miko-chan&#8217;s charm in just 15 minutes, so you can look forward to it. Shall we start watching?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I repeated Kotomi&#8217;s words. If the anime talk went on any longer, I wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep up. I wanted to show the anime quickly to settle things down.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, let&#8217;s get started.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Momoi urged me with an excited expression, so I promptly got everything ready. Although she was lively just a moment ago, as soon as the anime began, she fell silent.</p>



<p>She looked more focused than when she was studying. After watching, we&#8217;d probably discuss our impressions, so I better paid attention too.</p>



<p>&#8230;Maison de Night seemed to be set in an apartment building. The story revolved around Haruki, a university student who became the caretaker, depicting his friendly interactions with the heroines who resided there.</p>



<p>Various unique girls appeared one after another at the beginning, but apparently it was a dream. Haruki was woken up by Miko-chan and had a meal together, then a visitor arrived.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Haruki was invited to study by a neighboring female college student and he left the room. Miko-chan, watching Haruki left with a wistful gaze, returned to her room and started playing with her smartphone on the bed&#8230;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps because the walls were thin, lewd sounds leaked through. Then Miko-chan, looking like she was in distress, started massaging her own chest—</p>



<p><em>Wait, hold on! Is this an adult anime? Is the game based on an adult game? No wonder Kotomi hadn&#8217;t played it!</em></p>



<p>I glanced at Momoi&#8217;s expression. She blushed slightly while squirming her thighs. As if noticing my gaze, she looked at me and her face reddened even more.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-Is there something on my face?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then focus on the anime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-right.”</p>


<img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.files.wordpress.com/2024/01/1000010274.png">


<p>Leaving the awkward atmosphere as it was, I shifted my gaze back to the TV, where Miko-chan was breathing heavily with a sad expression. Next to me, Momoi was fidgeting uncomfortably.</p>



<p>Looks like Momoi wasn&#8217;t aware of the explicit scenes in the OVA. Why did Kotomi suggest watching together when she knew the content? Did she watch so much anime that her sense of appropriateness got messed up?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Come to think of it, she used to boast about swimsuit figurines. Although it was great to express your interest openly, a bit more awareness to general perceptions wouldn&#8217;t hurt. Maybe making friends would help her pick up on that.</p>



<p>While contemplating this, Haruki returned home. He heard suspicious sounds coming from his sister&#8217;s room and entered worriedly, only to witnesses Miko-chan in an embarrassing state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Miko-chan was pushed down by Haruki, kissed, but then woke up from the dream. The ending credits started rolling just as she welcomed Haruki back with a sad expression.</p>



<p>It was beyond awkward, but since I was supposed to be a hardcore otaku who loved Maison de Night, I had to ask Momoi&#8217;s thoughts.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>When I glanced at her, Momoi still had a flushed face. It was a bit difficult to initiate a conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;So&#8230; what did you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it was&#8230; poignant, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>I see. She was opting not to mention the explicit scenes. Much appreciated.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really heart-wrenching that even though she loves Haruki, she can&#8217;t confess because they&#8217;re siblings.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Given that you have a sister, you must empathize more.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m not!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You became a Miko-chan fan because you could relate, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-no, it&#8217;s not that! It&#8217;s just, you know&#8230; Well, her appearance! I just like how Miko-chan looks!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;Do you like blonde girls?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-yeah! I like blonde girls—&#8221;</p>



<p>Wait, wasn&#8217;t Momoi also a blonde girl? This just made the awkwardness skyrocket!</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I mean, I&#8217;m talking about the anime, okay? It&#8217;s not like I like her just because she&#8217;s blonde. And, um, Momoi, why are you a Miko-chan fan when you don&#8217;t even have a sister?”</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the type who automatically falls for little sister characters, especially those who adore their big brothers. It&#8217;s nice to see Miko-chan episode. She was incredibly cute, and Haruki&#8217;s voice was just perfect.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;His voice, huh? Yeah, it was deep and cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, definitely!&#8221; Momoi beamed, looking so happy. &#8220;You know, that voice is uncannily similar to my dad&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just like a kid boasting,<em> &#8220;My dad&#8217;s a pilot!&#8221;</em> she said it with pride.</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? Your dad must have a pretty cool voice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, you&#8217;re right. That&#8217;s why I often rewatch anime that Haruki&#8217;s voice actor works on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. If you like it that much, why not just talk to your dad?&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi, who was smiling a moment ago, suddenly clouded over.</p>



<p>&#8220;My dad is really dedicated to his job. He travels all around the world and rarely comes home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you live with just your mom?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. My mom passed away when I was one or two due to an illness. That&#8217;s why I moved to Japan because being in England reminded me of Mom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230; Sorry for bringing it up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;ve accepted it. Well, to be honest, it gets lonely sometimes. That&#8217;s why I started playing online games.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How did that lead to online games?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was hoping that if I got married in the game, I could have something like a family. Well, in the end, we mostly just talk about anime, manga, and games.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; Momoi&#8217;s expression brightened before continuing, &#8220;Although I haven&#8217;t been able to do anything family-like, I&#8217;m having a really, really fun time. Thanks to you, I don&#8217;t feel lonely at all when I&#8217;m alone at home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good to hear.&#8221;</p>



<p>It seemed my sister had unintentionally brought happiness to someone. As her brother, it filled me with tremendous pride.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s chat again on Wednesday.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be waiting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Momoi smiled and rose from her seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I should head back now.&#8221;</p>



<p>I nodded and accompanied Momoi to the entrance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks a lot for today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nothing. I just showed you an anime.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I appreciate that, but you also helped me with my studies and enjoyed my fried rice. That made me so happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>I had almost forgotten about the shock from Maison de Night. When I remembered, my stomach began to ache&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;On the contrary, thanks for the delicious meal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. If there&#8217;s another chance, I&#8217;ll cook for you again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need to go out of your way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to hold back. Well, see you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. See you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unable to reveal the truth, I could only wave as she left.</p>
